Bert's recommendation LegUp, jweekend.com/dev/LegUp, have worked just fine for me. I used the wicket + Spring + JPA archetype. I will still look for the reason why maven's Hibernate+Spring+Spring MVC archetype didn't work for me. I'll edit this once I have the answer. For the time being, legup did the job! Thanks
