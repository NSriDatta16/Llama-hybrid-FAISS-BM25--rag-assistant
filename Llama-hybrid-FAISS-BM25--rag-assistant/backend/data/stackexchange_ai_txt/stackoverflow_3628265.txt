How Does localStorage in HTML5 work?

How Does localStorage in HTML5 work? I searched every where (even in SO ) to find the actual internal logic of localStorage, but I ended up with visiting some examples which uses localStorage. I haven't found any useful Answer to my question. Can Someone post me a link or explain about the working of localStorage
