Book on data modeling

I'm looking for reference to get a better understanding and overview of the methods for data modeling (mostly related to business questions like finding categories in data and setting of scoring functions for forecasting). After some internet research I couldn't single out a canonical reference. I have some very basic knowledge of statistics and I believe the topics that could be most useful for me would be SVM, Decision Trees, Clustering, Covariance Matrix, Correlations, Multivariate analysis ... just to name some keywords for the direction. Also I'd like to have some foundation to eventually dive into other statistical and data mining topics. While the reference should introduce the concepts, I'd like it to be fast-paced (not chatty, not too many examples) and mathematically thorough while concentrating on applications. Of course there are specialized books on each topic, but I'd rather learn the basics of all of these topic quickly. So ideally one or two books for all of them together. I cannot think of a different way to explain :) Can you suggest good books? Or maybe just help me get some orientation in the vast field of statistics so that I know what to look for.
