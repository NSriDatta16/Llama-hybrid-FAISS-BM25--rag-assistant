Maybe you could create and start a thread when the touch occurs that has a volatile boolean stop = false field and that checks for this value in every loop after sleeping for a while. When the touch ends, you can set the boolean variable to false. Edit: added an example private MyHandler h; public void handleDown() { System.out.println("touch began"); h = new MyHandler(); h.start(); } public void handleUp() { h.pleaseStop = true; System.out.println("touch ended"); } class MyHandler extends Thread { volatile boolean pleaseStop = false; public void run() { while (!pleaseStop) { System.out.println("touch is active..."); Thread.sleep(500); } } }
