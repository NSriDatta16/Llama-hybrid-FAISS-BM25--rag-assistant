Will your table always only have two rows? Such as: If so, a simple, but not overly elegant, solution would be to split your background image into two images, and apply a CSS class to the left and right column, applying half of the arrow to the right side of the left column, and to the left side of the right column: Your CSS could then be similar to: td.left { background: #ffffff url(../PathToLeftBackground.png) top right; } td.right { background: #fffff url(../PathToRightBackground.png) top left; } You could also use a sprite image where you use one image and position it differently for the two backgrounds. I realize it's probably not the most ideal solution, but it would at least fix your issue and get your project moving. I sometimes use simple solutions such as this in order to make forward progress, and then revisit the problem to make it more efficient later.
