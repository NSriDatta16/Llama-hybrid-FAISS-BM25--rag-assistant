Multiple regression for a questionnaire study

Let's say I have a study in which I send a 100 people a questionnaire in which the dependent variable is binary, such as "does x, y and z correlate with whether a person is obese or not obese". Would a logistic regression be a good way to answer this question? Furthermore, would a multiple logistic regression be a good model to say "does x affect whether a person is obese or not obese, controlling for y?"
