Is there a way to reduce high-dimensional feature space to an array of 2d tSNEs ordered along a chosen dimension?

Let's say we have 4096-d vectors (via a CNN fully-connected layer) and often we use tSNE to visualize the space, sometimes in combo with Jonker-Volgenant to assign it to a grid. When applied to image datasets such as museum collections we can get "views" like this : My question is whether there's a way to control for a 3rd dimension when reducing the feature space? To take the museum example, instead of reducing to a single grid, could I reduce it to a stack of tSNE grids, binned/controlled by e.g. year of artwork creation as the z-dimension while maintaining consistent x- and y-axes, such that in the result "view", one could "travel" through time and get a sense of how (for example) development of paint colors influenced the history of iconography? (I'm coming at this from a designer perspective, apologies in advance for ignorance of math. )
