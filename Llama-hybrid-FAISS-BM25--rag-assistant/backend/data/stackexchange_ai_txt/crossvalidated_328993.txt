Comparing ELBO of a VAE for different samples

I am lacking of an interpretation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO), when comparing two different samples $x_1, x_2 \sim X$. Writing the marginal log-likelihood as the sum of lower variational bound and the KL-Divergence between the approximated ($q$) and true ($p$) posterior as $L=L^V + D_{KL}(q(z|x)||p(z|x))$. A variational autoencoder (VAE) is able to estimate a value for $L^V$ for any $x$. Now let's say we calculate values for $x_1$ and $x_2$ with the outcome of $L^V(x_1) Can the two likelihoods $L(x_1)$ and $L(x_2)$ can be compared as well, like $L^V(x_1) ? The reason why I am worrying is the KL-Divergence and the approximator $q(z|x)$ of the posterior. The hyperparameters of $q$ are not constant in a VAE, they a rather calculated given $x$ and thus, $D_{KL}$ is not constant as well.
