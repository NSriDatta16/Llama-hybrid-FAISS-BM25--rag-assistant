I'm under the impression that when you display:none screen readers may discard that element. I don't follow completely why they do that, but I suppose it's why they're "screen" readers and not "HTML" readers. I tend to use position:absolute to remove an element which I still want to be visible to a screen reader. Something like... a#skip_to_content { position:absolute; top:-10000px; left:-10000px; } ... but I've read nothing to confirm that this is the suggested solution. If you're trying to develop accessible web sites and want to very quickly test your page, you should check out the Fangs FireFox plugin . It simulates how a popular screen reader, Jaws, would see and organize the information on your site.
