In a case where you have the entire population and the data is full, and meats parametric assumptions, than yes - you can perform a linear regression. The significance levels of the coefficients will naturally be pointless. A significance level is a measure of the likelihood that the coefficient $\beta_i$ was taken from a population which has a $\beta_i=0$. Since the model has no idea of what part of the population we are using, it does not know that we use the entire population as such, the coefficient in the regression will equal the coefficient in the population and the significance test loses all meaning. Usually, the coefficient is just an averaged relation between $y$ and $x$ in the sample data, and even when highly significant, does not equal the actual relationship in the population (which can be estimated with confidence intervals). When using the population, even a non significant coefficient is "significant", but more so, represent the actual relationship. One last thing, the fact that we can measure the entire population does not mean we can assume to talk about causation. At his needs to be carefully done checking for cofounders and using theory etc...
