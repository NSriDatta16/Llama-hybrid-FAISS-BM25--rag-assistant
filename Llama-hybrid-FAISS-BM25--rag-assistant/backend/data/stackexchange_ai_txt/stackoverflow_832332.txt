After investigating some more and implementing my own XML file-based settings persistence using IsolatedStorage , I discovered the IsolatedStorageSettings class and the IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings object that is a key/value collection specifically for storing user-specific, application settings. It all seems obvious now. Of course, in the long term, a mechanism for backing up and restoring settings using a server database would be a good enhancement to this client-side settings persistence.
