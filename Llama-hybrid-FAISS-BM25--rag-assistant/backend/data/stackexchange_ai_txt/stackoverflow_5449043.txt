REST is an approach that leverages the HTTP protocol, and is not an alternative to it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer Data is uniquely referenced by URL and can be acted upon using HTTP operations (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc). A wide variety of mime types are supported for the message/response but XML and JSON are the most common. For example to read data about a customer you could use an HTTP get operation with the URL http://www.example.com/customers/1 . If you want to delete that customer, simply use the HTTP delete operation with the same URL. The Java code below demonstrates how to make a REST call over the HTTP protocol: String uri = "http://www.example.com/customers/1"; URL url = new URL(uri); HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); connection.setRequestMethod("GET"); connection.setRequestProperty("Accept", "application/xml"); JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance(Customer.class); InputStream xml = connection.getInputStream(); Customer customer = (Customer) jc.createUnmarshaller().unmarshal(xml); connection.disconnect(); For a Java (JAX-RS) example see: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/08/creating-restful-web-service-part-45.html
