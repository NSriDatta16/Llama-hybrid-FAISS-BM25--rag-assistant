Based on the feedback from Heinzi and Robert Rossney I came up with the following solution that works with an ObservableCollection that I can access in XAML and code behind: In code I extended ObservableCollection so I can use it in XAML (this will no longer be necessary in XAML 2009): public class CatObservableCollection : ObservableCollection { } In XAML in the UserControl.Resources I instantiate the Cats: The collections: The Rooms are now defined as follows: Room.Cats is an ObservableCollection
