Yes, you're right; a char/byte only allows up to 8 distinct bits, so that is 2^8 distinct numbers, which is zero to 2^8 - 1, or zero to 255. Do something like this to get the bytes: int x = 0; char* p = (char*)&x; for (int i = 0; i (This isn't officially C because of the order of declaration but whatever... it's more readable. :) ) Do note that this code may not be portable, since it depends on the processor's internal storage of an int .
