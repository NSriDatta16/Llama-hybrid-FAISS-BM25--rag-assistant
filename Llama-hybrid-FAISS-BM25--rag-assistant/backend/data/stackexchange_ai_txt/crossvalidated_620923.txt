PCA Derivation with maximizing projection length

I was reading a post about deriving PCA, So it considered an arbitrary row datum, $x_i$ and tried to maximize projection length for each row of data matrix, $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$ : $$\sum_{i=1}^N(u_1.x_i)^2=\sum_{i=1}^N(u_1.x_i)(u_1.x_i)=u_1^\top \Biggr[ \sum_{i=1}^Nx_ix_i^\top \Biggr] u_1\stackrel{*}{=}u_1^\top X^\top X u_1$$ Up to step *, everything is great, but I don't realize why the step * holds?
