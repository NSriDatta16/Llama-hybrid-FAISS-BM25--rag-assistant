Struts2 sx:div with Timer ignoring preload="true"

I have the following refreshing timer: The problem I have is that it waits 8000 millis before loading the content even though I have preload="true". After this it functions as I would expect, reloading the content every 8000 millis. Removing updateFreq="8000" causes the div to preload correctly but then my timer does not start. Is this expected behaviour? If so is there a workaround? I used to get around this by embedding html inside the sx:div tag, but Firefox 3.5 now throws security errors with this approach due to the the html containing a form, and the ajax trying to write over the top of it.
