Sending data over a network with zero MTU (Maximum Tranmission Unit)

I want to send the data such that the fragmentation of the data is disabled. For example in ping, if we write ping localhost -M do -s 65507 -M do : disable fragmentation -s 65507 : maximum packet size It gives me an error like From localhost (127.0.0.1) icmp_seq=1 Frag needed and DF set (mtu = 16436) Is there some other way to do this or using some other software. Preferably Iperf.
