How to create a virtual file?

I'd like to simulate a file without writing it on disk. I have a file at the end of my executable and I would like to give its path to a dll. Of course since it doesn't have a real path, I have to fake it. I first tried using named pipes under Windows to do it. That would allow for a path like \\.\pipe\mymemoryfile but I can't make it works, and I'm not sure the dll would support a path like this. Second, I found CreateFileMapping and GetMappedFileName. Can they be used to simulate a file in a fragment of another ? I'm not sure this is what this API does. What I'm trying to do seems similar to boxedapp. Any ideas about how they do it ? I suppose it's something like API interception (Like Detour ), but that would be a lot of work. Is there another way to do it ? Why ? I'm interested in this specific solution because I'd like to hide the data and for the benefit of distributing only one file but also for geeky reasons of making it works that way ;) I agree that copying data to a temporary file would work and be a much easier solution.
