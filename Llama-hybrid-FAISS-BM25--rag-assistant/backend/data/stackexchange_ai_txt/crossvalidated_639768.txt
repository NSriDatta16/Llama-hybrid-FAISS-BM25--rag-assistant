Fisher r-to-z transformation: comparing correlation coefficient of multiple samples

I am comparing the linearity of a regression model for two independent devices (n=10 each device group). The data is force (newtons) over time (seconds). The regression models show R^2 values of 0.9 to 0.95 for all devices. I want to do a statistical test to see if the R^2 values are significantly different between the devices . I came across the Fisher r-to-z transformation but this only allows comparing only two independent R^2 values, whereas I have 10 individual R^2 values for each device. Is it possible to average the R^2 values (n=10) for each device group or is there another way to compare both device groups?
