Why do we need natural log of Odds in Logistic Regression?

I know what an odds is. It's a ratio of the probability of some event happening to the probability it not happening. So, in the context of classification, the probability that an input feature vector $X$ belongs to class 1 is $p(X)$ then the Odds is:- $O = \frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}$ This is what I don't understand. When we have probability, why do we need Odds here at all?
