First, if you need a convenient way to test this, the pooled or un-pooled t-test might be a good fit for your problem. If you assume that Configuration A and Configuration B have the same variance, use the pooled t-test; Otherwise, use the un-pooled t-test. Both the two tests do not have restrictive assumptions on the sample size for the two groups. Here is a resource that you can look up to for the equations: https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat200/node/60 The assumptions for the two tests are also i.i.d sampling and the underlying distribution of the two population are normally distributed. I am not sure why you think your data is not simple random sampling, but as the data size is large, CLT can always support this. Just try this pooled or the un-pooled test, and see the result if it makes any sense. Use two tailed, if your hypothesis is group A is different from group B; Use one tailed, if your hypothesis is one group is over another. Another test you might think of is KS test. Here is one resource: http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35g.htm Instead of comparing the mean of the two group, this can compare everything. For example, if the mean of two groups are very closed, but the max, min, quantile are very different for two groups, t-test might not be significant, but KS test can be significant. One last try is Bayesian. Assuming the two groups are normally distributed, and get priors for mean and variance. Plug this in rJags. Adjust the priors for mean and the variance, see what you can get.
