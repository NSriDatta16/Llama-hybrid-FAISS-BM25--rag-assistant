I think if you donâ€™t use .netrc , that will work. It will prompt you for your login name as well as the password, though. If you want to keep your .netrc for other purposes and just not use it in Vim, use :let g:netrw_ignorenetrc = 1 A better solution, of course, would be to switch to some SSH-based access method. Then you can make use of the SSH agent to evade the whole issue entirely.
