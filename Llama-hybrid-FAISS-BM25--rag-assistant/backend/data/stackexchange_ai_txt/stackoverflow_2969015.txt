Word/Tag cloud in R using "snippets" package www.wordle.net Using openNLP package you could pos-tag the tweets(pos=Part of speech) and then extract just the nouns, verbs or adjectives for visualization in a wordcloud. Maybe you can query twitter and use the current system-time as a time-stamp, write to a local database and query again in increments of x secs/mins, etc. There is historical data available at http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_data_dump_infochimp_puts_1b_connections_up.php and http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/04/loc-google-twitter/
