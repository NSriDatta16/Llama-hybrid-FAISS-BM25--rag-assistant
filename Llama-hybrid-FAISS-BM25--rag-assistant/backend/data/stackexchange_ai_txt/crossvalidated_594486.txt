How to check heteroskedasticity in ordered logistic regressionmodels?

When estimating an ordered logistic regression in R using library(MASS)::polr how can I check for heteroskedasticity and fit it if it's exist? I'm self-studying the ordered logistic regression model, so I didn't covered in any classes. only for linear regressionmodels, such as BP test, chow test. As far I can find these methods are not used for ordered logistic regression.
