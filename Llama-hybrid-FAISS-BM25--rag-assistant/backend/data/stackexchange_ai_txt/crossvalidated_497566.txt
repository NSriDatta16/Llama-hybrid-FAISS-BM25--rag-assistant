You can find some useful discussion of the "rule of three", including derivations and simulation analysis, in Javonovic and Levy (1997) . With modern computing technology there is really no reason to use a "rule of thumb" like this instead of a good confidence interval formula what respects the support of the parameter of interest. For inference for a binomial proportion the Wilson score interval gives an interval that respects the support of the proportion parameter and has good large-sample properties. This interval reduces down to something similar (but not the same as) the "rule of three" when you have no successes. This aspect of the Wilson score interval is discussed in the paper O'Neill (2021) (p. 5), which sets out mathematical properties of the Wilson score interval, including the finite population correction for inference to a finite population or the unsampled part of a finite population. Wilson score interval with no successes: Let $\chi_{1, \alpha}^2$ denote the critical point of the chi-squared distribution with one degree-of-freedom, using the upper-tail area $\alpha$ . With no successes, the Wilson score interval is: $$\text{CI}_p(1-\alpha) = \Bigg[ 0 , \frac{\chi_{1, \alpha}^2}{n + \chi_{1, \alpha}^2} \Bigg].$$ Taking $\alpha = 0.05$ for a 95% confidence interval gives: $$\text{CI}_p(0.95) = \Bigg[ 0 , \frac{3.841459}{n + 3.841459} \Bigg].$$ For large $n$ this is fairly similar to the "rule of three" but it should be more accurate than this rule of thumb. As to showing that the rule has the required coverage probability, this holds using the normal approximation to the binomial for large $n$ . One advantage of this interval over the "rule of three" is that it gives a valid value even for values $n=1,2$ where the "rule of three" goes outside the support of the parameter. (The Wilson score interval is not wonderful in these situations either, but at least it respects the support of the parameter!)
