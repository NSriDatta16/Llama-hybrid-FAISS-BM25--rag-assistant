Yep, the order will be created if you have test mode on. I am only familiar with Magento 1.3 (not newer versions), but I am pretty sure that having authorize.net in test mode works just like if it was not in test mode, except for the fact that authorize.net doesn't actually do any real credit card processing. In the Magento interface you won't notice a difference.
