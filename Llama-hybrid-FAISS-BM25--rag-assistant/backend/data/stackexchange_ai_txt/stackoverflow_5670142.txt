What are some Security holes a website is exposed through document upload?

I am new to the document storage space. I am not sure what i am doing yet, but before i begin i wanted to know about the possible security threats one has when one allows document uploads and what is the best way to sanitize the data? I am using PHP and will allow images, word docs, pdfs, excel docs, etc. And is this a good solution: http://blog.insicdesigns.com/2009/01/secure-file-upload-in-php-web-applications/
