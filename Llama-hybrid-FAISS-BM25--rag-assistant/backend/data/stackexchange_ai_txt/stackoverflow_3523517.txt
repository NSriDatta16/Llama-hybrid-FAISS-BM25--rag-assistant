It depends! If you create an indexed view you'll be trading increased costs in terms of greaer storage space requirements and slower inserts, updates & deletes for increased speed of accessing these computed values. If you only want to use these values once or occassionally, you might be better off computing them on demand in a SP but, like I said, it depends! There are other factors to consider to, including: over how many records do these computations need to execued? If it's just a few, the indexed view approach may not be appropriate because it may affect all rows unless you limit it with sutable WHERE/HAVING clauses - remember that an indexed view isn't parameterised.
