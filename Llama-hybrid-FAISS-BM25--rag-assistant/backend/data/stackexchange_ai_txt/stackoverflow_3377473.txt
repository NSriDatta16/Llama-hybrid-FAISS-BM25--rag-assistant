In this situation you could use a GUID created by the application itself. The database would then only have the PK set to be a Unique Identifier (GUID) and that it must not be null. In this situation you are not wasting any unique keys as each call to get a new GUID should be definition produce a (mathmatically) unique identifier. It is worth noting that if you use this method, it is best to make sure your PK is not set up to be clustered. The resulting index reorganisation upon insert could quickly result in an application that suffers performance hits.
