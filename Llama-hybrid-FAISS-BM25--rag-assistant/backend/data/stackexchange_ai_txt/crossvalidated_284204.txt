Q: R - CausalImpact | order of control time series

My colleagues and I have been using Google's R-package CausalImpact for a while but recently discovered something that we can't quite explain. Depending on the order of including the different control time series into the variable "data" CausalImpact generates different outputs. Example: Using a slightly different version of the example on CausalImpact's Github we first create 2 control time series and a response variable. library(CausalImpact) set.seed(1) x1 Define pre- and post-period. pre.period And finally # order 1 data These generate (in this case slightly) different outputs, even though (to our understanding) it shouldn't. Does CausalImpact weigh the "first" control time series different to the "second"? Any help would be much appreciated!
