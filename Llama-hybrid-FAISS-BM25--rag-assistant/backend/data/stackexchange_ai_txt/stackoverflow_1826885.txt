Visual Studio 2008 C++ debugger drops out of single-step mode under Vista

I have a fairly large C++ project, and am trying to use the debugger to step through some code. Unfortunately, it sometimes decides to drop out of that mode, and just execute the code without paying attention to the fact that I pressed F10, and not breaking at subsequent breakpoints. I don't know when it's going to drop out, but it seems to do so consistently when it does. To be specific, I'm trying to see how a certain element of a display is calculated. I put breakpoints where the calculation occurs. The debugger will stop at a few of them (not getting as far as I need), and then disregard all the rest, and the finished image appears on the window. Some other times, I've been single-stepping through code, and suddenly it simply starts executing. This is using Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2008 SP1, running on 64-bit Vista. The code is compiled in Debug mode, with no optimizations enabled. I have done a clean and complete rebuild without fixing this. Does anybody know what could be causing this? Is there anything I can do about it? Edit: There are no threads involved where I lost the breaks, and I just installed this recommended fix and still have the problem.
