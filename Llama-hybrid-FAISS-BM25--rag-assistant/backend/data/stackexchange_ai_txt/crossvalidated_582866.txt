I would be very careful about fitting an ARIMA model to a time series that has only 21 observations, especially if there is a predictor involved. Let's plot your series: We see an upward trend, then a sharp downturn in 2009 (presumably due to the worldwide financial crisis in that year), then the trend picks up again for two years, finally the series plateaus. The "standard" way of doing your analysis would be to introduce a predictor that is 0 for 2000-2009 and 1 for 2010-2020, then regress your time series on it and perhaps finally model the residuals using ARIMA . Unfortunately, auto.arima() complains that it "does not find a suitable ARIMA model", which per above, I fully understand. We can also run this regression and plot the time series of residuals (which is what auto.arima() unsuccessfully tried to model): predictor We again see the upward trend and the plateau. For all we could say, the new marketing campaign might have interrupted a period of linear growth and throttled the growth to zero, leaving you with the flat line ever since. There is simply too little data here to tell. If you could get your hands on monthly data, or on the components that make up total sales, you might be able to tease out something. In any case, if your question just is how to fix ARIMA orders, take a look at stats::arima() , especially its order parameter. However, I reiterate that I would counsel against a deep analysis of this kind. Paul Goodwin once said he would not trust a new forecasting method that was tested on fewer time series than the method had words in its name - here, I would not put much stock in an analysis that takes more words to describe than you have observations in your time series.
