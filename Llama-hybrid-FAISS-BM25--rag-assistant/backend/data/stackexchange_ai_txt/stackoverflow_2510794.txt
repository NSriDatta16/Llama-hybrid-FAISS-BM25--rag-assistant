visual studio load test unable to find assembly error when running remotely

I have written a custom LoadTestPlugin to vary the number of users randomly. When i run this test locally everything works great, but when i deploy it using the controllers and agents, its give me 'Unable to find assembly' error, like its not able to find the assembly in which that plugin is, even though the test and plugin are in the same assembly. any clues on how to accomplish this ? many thanks
