The key difference between Bayesian and frequentist approaches lies in the definition of a probability, so if it is necessary to treat probabilties strictly as a long run frequency then frequentist approaches are reasonable, if it isn't then you should use a Bayesian approach. If either interpretation is acceptable, then Bayesian and frequentist approaches are likely to be reasonable. Another way of putting it, is if you want to know what inferences you can draw from a particular experiment, you probably want to be Bayesian; if you want to draw conclusions about some population of experiments (e.g. quality control) then frequentist methods are well suited. Essentially, the important thing is to know what question you want answered, and choose the form of analysis that answers the question most directly.
