Can finite state machines be encoded as input/output for a neural network?

I want to encode finite state machines (specifically DFAs) as output (or input) of a neural network for a supervised learning task. Are there any ways in the literature for doing this? I've already found some algorithms being able to extract a DFA from a recurrent neural network, but nothing about DFAs either as input or output of ANN.
