This problem might be well-suited to hierarchical linear modelling, such that satisfaction is nested in channels. The way you describe your data, it might be organized in a "wide format:" Participant Satisfaction through Channel X ... Satisfaction through Channel j 1 1x ... 1j 2 2x ... 2j ... ... ... ... i ix ... ij The first step is to reformat your data into a "long format:" Customer Channel Satisfaction 1 x 1x . . . . . . . . . 1 j 1j 2 x 2x . . . . . . . . . 2 j 2j . . . . . . . . . i j ij In this format, missing data is less of a problem. With $overall$ as your outcome variable, $customer$ indexed as $i$, and $channel$ indexed as $j$, your mixed model for the hierarchical linear model would be: $overall=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{01}(channel_j)+\gamma_{10}(satisfaction_{ij})+\gamma_{11}(channel_j)(satisfaction_{ij})+e_{ij}+U_0+U_1$. To determine the influence of each channel, you could compare the statistical significance of $\gamma$ parameters. Better yet, would be to add channels to your data in a stepwise manner to determine which channel reduces the variance of the $U_0$ and $U_1$ terms. It might be tempting to just run the "long format" as a multiple linear regression, but you will have inflated type-I error rates because the nesting structure violates the assumption of independence. For more information on this type of model, see Raudenbush & Bryk (2002).
