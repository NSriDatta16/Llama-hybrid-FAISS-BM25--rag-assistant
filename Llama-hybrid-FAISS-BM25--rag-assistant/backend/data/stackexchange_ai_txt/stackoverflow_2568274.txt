Since you're not getting any answers I'll offer a limited suggestion. I use netbeans, but not to automatically upload like you're doing so I may be way off here. It sounds like you would either need to change your project to have a larger directory structure that would contain everything for this to work like you want it to. Gan you go up a level or two in the directory structure, and add containing folders in your local project to match? The other option might be to create a second project for the javascript directory, and set that to go were it needs to go. You can create "project groups" in the project view which you can use to link them together. I know this is probably not ideal, but is hopefully easier than doing your uploads manually.
