How to visualize gene networks and cluster groups of genes?

I'm working with biological data - namely groups of genes. For example: group 1: geneA geneB geneC group 2: geneD geneE group 3: geneF geneG geneH For each pair of genes, geneX and geneY I have a score telling how similiar the two genes are (actually, I have two scores, since I used BLAST which is 'directional': I first searched geneX against all the other genes then geneY against all the other genes, so I have two geneX--geneY scores, but I guess I can take the lower score of the two, or the average). So, let's suppose I have only one score for each pair of genes. My data can be viewed as a undirected graph: and recall each edge has a score attached to it. Now, what I would like to do is: Visualize my data interactively: being able to click on gene nodes and open a link attached to them, show only edges above/below some threshold, control how the network is "spread", etc. Cluster together groups which are similar, i.e. groups that have similar genes. Any ideas of how can I do that? I guess it's basic clustering and I would appreciate any hints on packages/software that can be of any help here. Thank you.
