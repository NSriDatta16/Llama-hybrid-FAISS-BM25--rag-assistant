compare the outcome of logistic regression (predictive probabilities) before and after an event

To train a glm model, I'm using using clinical data (~10 features) of a large cohort of patients and healthy subjects. I'm using a smaller test group (around 20 people) and predict their outcome (healthy or patient) based on the training model. Now, some of the patients in the test group underwent surgery and I want to compare the predictive probabilities before and after surgery using the initial training dataset. Looking at the probabilities, I would like to know whether those subjects are closer to the healthy group than they were before surgery. Is there a quantitative way to compare the probability prediction before and after?
