SmartGWT, Spring, Hibernate and Gilead

I'm writing GWTSmart application using the free version. On the client side I have a grid with RestDataSource that make request to my Servlet. I read startrow, endrow ... parameters and decide what to read from database using JDBC (MySQL). With result data I make (manual) JSON data and return it to the client side. And it Works ;) But I decided to look for libraries that can make it easy to write server side of the code. I'm not sure what Spring , Hibernate and Gilead are for ... can you give me some sort of description and tell me how can they help me (if they can) And do you know other libraries that can be useful? P.S. In new in JavaEE Development
