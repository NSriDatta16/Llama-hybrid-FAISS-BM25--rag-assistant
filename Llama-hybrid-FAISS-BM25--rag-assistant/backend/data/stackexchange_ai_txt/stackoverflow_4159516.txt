Let's call the "target" HashMap the one that will get the missing keys and "sources" each of the others. For each key in each source, if the target does not contain the key then associate the zero with that key in the target: for (Map source : sources) { for (String key : source.keySet() ) { if (!target.containsKey(key)) { target.put(key, 0); } } } Now if you want to ensure that all maps have all keys from all other maps then you should first compute the entire set of keys and add the missing ones to each map: Set allKeys = new HashSet (); for (Map map : allHashMaps) { allKeys.addAll(map.keySet()); } for (Map map : allHashMaps) { for (String key : allKeys) { if (!map.containsKey(key)) { map.put(key, 0); } } } Both solutions perform at O(n*k) where n is the number of maps and k is the average number of keys in each map.
