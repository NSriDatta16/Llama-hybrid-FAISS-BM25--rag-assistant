I am a biologist who models the effects of inter-annual climatic variation on population dynamics of several migratory species. My datasets are very large (spatially intensive data) so I run my R code using multicore on Amazon EC2 servers. If my task is particularly resource intensive, I will choose a High Memory Quadruple Extra Large instance which comes with 26 CPU units, 8 cores, and 68G of RAM. In this case I usually run 4-6 scripts simultaneously, each of which is working through a fairly large data set. For smaller tasks, I choose servers with 4-6 cores and about 20 gigs of RAM. I launch these instances (usually spot instances because they are cheaper but can terminate anytime the current rate exceeds what I have chosen to pay), run the script for several hours, and then terminate the instance once my script has finished. As for the machine image (Amazon Machine Image), I took someone elses Ubuntu install, updated R, installed my packages, and saved that as my private AMI on my S3 storage space. My personal machine is a dualcore macbook pro and it has a hard time forking multicore calls. Feel free to email if you have other questions.
