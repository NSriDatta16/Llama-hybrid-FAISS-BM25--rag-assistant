.htaccess redirect for blackberry not working

I am trying to redirect blackberry users to my mobile site by doing: # redirect for blackberry users RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.BlackBerry.$ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/m/ [R=301] in my .htaccess, but nothing happens when I try to access from the device, I've already deleted cache and cookis and nothing works. I have been googling around and it seems I'm doing the redirect correctly but I guess not, what am I missing? My .htaccess only contains that by the way. Edit The .htaccess in my server's root.
