logging time using httpd.conf

I found the extra %D option in the LogFormat section of httpd.conf file. LogFormat "%h %l %u %t %D \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined LogFormat "%h %l %u %t %D \"%r\" %>s %b" common I was told that this is to log the time the page took to load. Is it correct?
