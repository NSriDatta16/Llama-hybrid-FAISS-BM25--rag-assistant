Ways to reconstruct shuffled pixels of a video file?

Suppose that you have a video file which pixel order has been shuffled once. That is, a random order have been defined once and applied to all frames. Does it exist some known approach for retrieving the initial order of pixels? I have some ideas around retrieving the initial topology by placing pixels which values are correlated in space and time closer together. I wonder if this has been studied and if efficient algorithms were published. Also this problem can be thought of as a way to project to a 2D matrix a set of values varying in time in order to be able to apply computer vision techniques (like CNN), with the assumption that these values are indeed somehow correlated.
