This code fragment retrieves a list of all logical drives on the machine and then searches all folders on the drive for files that match the filename "Cheese.exe". Once the loop has completed, the List "files" contains the var files = new List (); //@Stan R. suggested an improvement to handle floppy drives... //foreach (DriveInfo d in DriveInfo.GetDrives()) foreach (DriveInfo d in DriveInfo.GetDrives().Where(x => x.IsReady == true)) { files.AddRange(Directory.GetFiles(d.RootDirectory.FullName, "Cheese.exe", SearchOption.AllDirectories)); }
