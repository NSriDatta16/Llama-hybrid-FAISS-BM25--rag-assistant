We're using different technology (Java/Spring) and not using auto-scaling, but our approach might work for you in a modified form. When we shut down an instance, part of the shutdown script zips the log files and copies them to S3. I suggest you make each instance responsible for writing it's own event log to a suitable location (S3 is probably a great choice). Here's a MSDN entry on how to read the event log from .Net. You can write a simple Windows service that reads the event log, prioritizes if necessary, and writes the events to external storage. Create a custom AMI that includes that windows service (and has it configured to auto-start).
