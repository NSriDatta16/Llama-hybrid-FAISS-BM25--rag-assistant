Exact String Alignment Retrieval in EMAIL Content

StringWriter sw = new StringWriter(); PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(sw); String rowFormat = "%8s %8s %8s %8s%n"; pw.printf(rowFormat, "Col A", "Col B", "Col C", "Col XY"); pw.printf(rowFormat, "A", "19", "Car", "55"); pw.printf(rowFormat, "X", "21", "Train C", "-4"); pw.printf(rowFormat, "B", "-9", "Bike", "0"); String message = sw.toString(); System.out.println(message); The above program prints the following table and the alignment is perfect. Col A Col B Col C Col XY A 19 Car 55 X 21 Train C -4 B -9 Bike 0 Instead of printing the string message , I am passing the string to another function which sends email with the content of the mail as the string message . mail.setContent(message.toString(),"text/plain"); This is how I am setting the content as message in my mail. But the alignment of the table is not appropriate as I do receive while printing the string. What must be done such that I receive the content of my mail as similar as the printing format of the string. Please advise on this regard.
