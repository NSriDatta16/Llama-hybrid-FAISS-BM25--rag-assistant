Just checked my stats, and for the last 30 days I have an average iAd fill rate of 21.54% That's why I decided to use adWhirl . Which acts like a wrapper around different ad networks. For example you can tell adWhirl to deliver 99% iAd and 1% admob. When the request for an iAd fails adwhirl tries to get another ad from another network. They support many ad networks. Adwhirl makes the if (error == no Ads on server) { // Load alternative advertising platform } thing so much easier, because adwhirl handles almost everything for you.
