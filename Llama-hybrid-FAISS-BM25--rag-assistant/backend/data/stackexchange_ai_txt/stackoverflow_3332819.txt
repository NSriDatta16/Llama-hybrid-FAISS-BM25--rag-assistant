"Due to its small size, SQLite is well suited to embedded systems, and is also included in Apple's iOS (where it is used for the SMS/MMS, Calendar, Call history and Contacts storage), Symbian OS, Google's Android, RIM's BlackBerry and Palm's webOS.[20] However, it is also suitable for desktop operating systems; Apple adopted it as an option in Mac OS X's Core Data API from the original implementation in Mac OS X 10.4 onwards."
