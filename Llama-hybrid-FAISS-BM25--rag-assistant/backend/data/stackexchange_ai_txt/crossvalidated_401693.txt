Markov Chains to Predict Weather States

This is my first question so I apologize if it is located in the wrong section or does not follow forum protocols. I am currently working on developing a transition matrix for predictions of weather in Tampa, FL. I used weather.com's data to categorize four states, "rainy", "cloudy", "sunny", and "fair." My attached code used this transition matrix to simulate a sequence, but after running the sequence for 500 iterations, it is only around 64% accurate. I am not sure if this is due to an error in my code, or if the available data from weather.com is not up to par. I would appreciate any and all advice. Data obtained from: https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/USFL0481:1:US Code: transition.matrix
