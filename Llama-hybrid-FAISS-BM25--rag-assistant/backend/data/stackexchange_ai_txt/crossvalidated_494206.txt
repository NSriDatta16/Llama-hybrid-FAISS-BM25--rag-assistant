Representing bias term in simple linear neural network(linear regression) using analztical solution

Assume that output $y$ depends on input $x$ and some noise $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ . $$y = f(x) + \epsilon$$ Suppose we want to model relationship mentioned above using linear neural network: $$ \hat{y} = w * x + b$$ where $w$ is weight matrix and $b$ is a bias term of neural network. We can calculate weights using classical analytical solution for OLS: $$w = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$$ Question: how do we calculate (or maybe represent) bias term $b$ in neural network without using gradient descent?
