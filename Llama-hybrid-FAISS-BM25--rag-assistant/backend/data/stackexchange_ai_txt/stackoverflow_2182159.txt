IE smoothing a map pan when dragging

I've trying to smooth out the performance of a map application i've been building using javascript. I initially implemented a dragging pan using onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup However in IE it feels really sluggish and it appears that when you move the cursor really fast the map doesn't update it position until you stop moving. I converted my code to use the native IE events ondragstart ondrag ondragend The performance was MUCH better when using these events BUT it seems that I can't set the mouse cursor using the standard css properties. I can only set the cursor to a few predefined ones which is not what I want. So my question is. How can I either smooth the drag in IE using the first set of events or how can I set a custom cursor using the native events. EDIT: Code sample The code is very very simple. Even when I remove the logic to load new tiles (i.e only the container is getting moved) it still feels clunky. Below is the pan function: // the "this" object refers to the div containing all the tile layers. function movemap(e) { e = e || window.event; var dx = this.mouseX - e.clientX; var dy = this.mouseY - e.clientY; if (dx !== 0 || dy !== 0) { this.style.left = parseInt(this.style.left) + dx + 'px'; this.style.top = parseInt(this.style.top) + dy + 'px'; this.mouseX = e.clientX; this.mouseY = e.clientY; } }
