Suggested Opensource CMS for managing files by metadata?

I've been wanting to create a resources database for an organisation storing predominantly audio files (lectures) and PDFS. I'm pretty familiar with Wordpress, however I'm looking for another CMS which is more suited to what I want straight out of the box. Can anyone suggest a simple CMS which will allow files to be uploaded and managed by the metadata, rather than folder hierarchy?
