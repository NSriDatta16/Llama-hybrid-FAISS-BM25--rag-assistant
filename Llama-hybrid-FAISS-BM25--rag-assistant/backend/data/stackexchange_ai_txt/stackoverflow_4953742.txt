It is indeed possible. It's just neither simple, nor a particularly a good idea... You'll need to create an ActiveX container for the form, which you can then embed the VB 6 form into. See this article on CodeProject for details: Embedding of VB6 form in .NET applications Another possible (and significantly simpler approach) might be to set the parent of your VB 6 form as the .NET MDI container. I'm not actually sure if this will work (I've never tried it), but it's worth a shot. You'll need to P/Invoke the FindWindow function to get the handle to your VB 6 form window, as well as the SetParent function to change its parent window.
