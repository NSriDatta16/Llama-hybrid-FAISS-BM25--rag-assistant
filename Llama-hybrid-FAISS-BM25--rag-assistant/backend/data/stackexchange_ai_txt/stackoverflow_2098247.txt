Hibernate many-to-many with map collection

I have two tables "Station" and "Route". Route can contain many stations and every station can be a part of the different routes. The logical solution is to create a table with 'station_id' and 'route_id' fields and there are lot of examples on the internet how to organize all of this stuff with hibernate. But I need to store the order number of each station in the route, so 3rd table populates with one more field 'orderNumber', so we get the following structure: RouteStations route_id station_id orderNumber I created the next beans: public class Station extends Identifier{ private String title; } public class Route extends Identifier{ private String name; private Map stations = new HashMap (); } So I use the HashMap collection to store the orderNumber variable. Help me please to map such type of relation using hibernate or propose the other solution. Thanks.
