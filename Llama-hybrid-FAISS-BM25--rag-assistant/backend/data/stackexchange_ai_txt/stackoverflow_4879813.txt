Do you really want to use it as a constraint (with the 'where' keyword)? Here are some examples of straight implementation: interface ITwoTypes class TwoTypes : ITwoTypes Or, if you know the type(s) your class will use, you don't need a type parameter on the class: class StringAndIntClass : ITwoTypes class StringAndSomething : ITwoTypes If you are using the interface as a constraint and don't know the types to specify explicitly, then yes, you need to add the type parameters to the class declaration, as you supposed. class SomethingAndSomethingElse where T : ITwoTypes class StringAndSomething where T : ITwoTypes
