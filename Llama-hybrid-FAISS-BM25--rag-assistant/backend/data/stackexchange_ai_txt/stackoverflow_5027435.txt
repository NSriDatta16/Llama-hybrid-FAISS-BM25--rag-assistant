The my limits the variable to the current scope. With the use strict pragma, which you should use, you must declare the variables (e.g. with my ). The alternative to go without exists for flexibility reasons for very short scripts. The & is seldom used anymore since Perl default-interprets sigil-less words as subroutines, but is useful if you want to create a reference to subroutine. sub say_hi { print "hi\n" } my $sub_ref = \&say_hi;
