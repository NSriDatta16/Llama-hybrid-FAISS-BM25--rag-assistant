Technically it would depend on the query for that data, while I don't know the ins and outs of MS SQL Server too well, if all queries to such a table were only ever querying the primary key index it would be fast. The bigger problem is how many repeats of the same varchar data is there? And does it even repeat in multiple fields as well as records, generally you'll want to seperate this of to an index data table then use integer indexes in main table. After all integers are faster to query than string matching, and it's less data storage.
