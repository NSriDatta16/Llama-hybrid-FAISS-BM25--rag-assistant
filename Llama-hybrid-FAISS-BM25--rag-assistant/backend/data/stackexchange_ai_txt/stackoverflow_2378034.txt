Drag and drop an image into the drop area, you'll not able to get "application/x-qt-image" in minedata since Qt4.6. But if you drag&drop an image from web page, you'll still be able to see the image. I think it's reasonable for drop area to check if the dropped file is an image or not, instead of depending on mine data.
