Suppose that the poll used $n = 2400$ subjects of whom $X =223$ favored candidate Doe. Then a traditional Wald confidence interval would start with a point estimate $\hat p = 223/2400 = 0.093$ of the proportion in favor and the a 95% CI would be $$\hat p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}},$$ which computes to $(0.081,0.104)$ or $(8.1\%, 10.4\%).$ Notice that $\pm 1.96$ cuts 2.5% from each tail of a standard normal distribution. This CI is sometimes called probability symmetric because the same probability is cut from each tail of the distribution. It is by far the most common type of CI. x = 223; n = 2400 p.hat = x/n; q = qnorm(c(.025,.975)) p.hat; q [1] 0.09291667 [1] -1.959964 1.959964 CI = p.hat + q*sqrt((p.hat *(1-p.hat))/n); CI [1] 0.08130184 0.10453150 However, one says a 95% CI because many kinds of CIs are possible For example, one can cut 4% from one tail and 1% from the other and still have a 95% CI. Then another 95% CI is $(0.083, 0.107)$ or $(8.3\%,10.7\%).$ For this type of CI, the point estimate is no longer at the center of the CI. Especially for small percentages, such alternate types of CIs may be used. (If for no other reason. this might be done to summarize a campaign poll in a way to encourage a candidate who is not showing well in the polls.) x = 223; n = 2400 p.hat = x/n; q = qnorm(c(.04,.99)) p.hat; q [1] 0.09291667 [1] -1.750686 2.326348 CI = p.hat + q*sqrt((p.hat *(1-p.hat))/n); CI [1] 0.08254203 0.10670270 So either the newspaper reporting the poll had a typographical error or the pollster is not using a probability-symmetric style of CI. (I'm betting on the typo.)
