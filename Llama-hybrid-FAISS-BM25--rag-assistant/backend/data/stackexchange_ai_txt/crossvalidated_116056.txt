You begin with a misunderstanding. It is important to get the terminology right at the beginning. Logistic regression is not a classifier. It is a direct probability model. You didn't explain why your problem is an all-or-nothing classification problem vs. a risk estimation problem. I have to disagree with the answer above. You will get more efficient/powerful/precise estimates by using maximum likelihood estimation to fit a probability model such as the logistic model, then applying your utilities/cost/loss function to the predicted probabilities to make optimum decisions. If you cannot come up with a utility/loss function it's hard to argue that you should be doing classification in the first place, but you could make the ridiculous assumption that utilities are the same for every observation and make a classification based on predicted probabilities. You will quickly see that classification is arbitrary when you proceed that way. Note that proportion "classified" correct is an improper accuracy scoring rule that is optimized by a bogus model.
