Flume agent - can I specify compression like gzip or bz2?

Is it possible to specify a compression option on a Flume agent so that the data is transferred to the collector in a compressed format? I know there are compression options on the collector level, but it would be also extremely useful to be able to transfer compressed data from the agent, too. Thank you!
