How do I test is storage-conf is being loaded in Cassandra 0.7.3?

I have installed Cassandra and gotten it working on two machines. I have followed the instructions to hook them up to each other by configuring the storage-conf.xml files. Both machines respond well to thrift and to command line cassandra. This is tutorial I used to setup the storage-conf.xml files . The tutorial says that if I run netstat, I should NOT see Cassandra bound to 127.0.0.1 on my seed node. I should see it bound to my internal IP, which I have configured in the storage-conf.xml file. I have rebooted the servers and relaunched cassandra. Still, I see the localhost address insead of the correct internal IP address. Is it that my .yaml file is overriding the storage-conf.xml file? If so, how do I delete the appropriate things in the .yaml? Or how do I tell Cassandra to look for my storage-conf.xml file? A few things I have tried: renaming the cassandra.yaml file. What happens is that cassandra will not load. If i rename the storage-conf.xml, cassandra does load. When I installed Cassandra, it did not come with a storage-conf.xml file. I had to grab it off the apache wiki.
