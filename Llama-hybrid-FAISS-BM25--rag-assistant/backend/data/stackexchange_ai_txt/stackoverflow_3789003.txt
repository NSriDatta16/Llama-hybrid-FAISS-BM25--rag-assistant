It's possible for realloc to move memory on any call. True in many implementations a shrink would just result in the change of the reserved size in the heap and wouldn't move memory. However in a heap which optimized for low fragmentation it may choose to move the memory around to a better fitting location. Don't depend on realloc keeping memory in the same place for any operation.
