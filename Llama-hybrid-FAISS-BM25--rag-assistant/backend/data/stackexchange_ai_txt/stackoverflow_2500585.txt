Get marker position in (x,y) in Google maps

I am using google maps. I want to display custom info-window on marker click. For that the upper-left tip of my custom info window should cover the marker. The problem is I can not get the exact (x,y) ie map-div position of marker on map. For the first time I can get it using : var mposition = map.fromLatLngToDivPixel(marker.getLatLng()); pos = new GControlPosition(G_ANCHOR_TOP_LEFT, new GSize(mposition.x,mposition.y)); But when I drag the map, the marker position in x,y remains same and thus my info-window appears at wrong location. Please help me out how can I get the exact div-related position of marker on map even after drag/zoom. Thanks.
