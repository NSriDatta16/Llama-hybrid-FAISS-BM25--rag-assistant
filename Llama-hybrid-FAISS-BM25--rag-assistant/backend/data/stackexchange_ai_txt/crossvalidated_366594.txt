What conclusion can I draw from this R square?

http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/x01.txt The data records the average weight of the brain and body for a number of mammal species. There are 62 rows of data. I have a task to take any two quantities that are related (min 10 data points is n=10) Derive regression equation, calculate R square Interpret your result So to check if the two quantities are related I calculated chi-square which was 2648.193 which is higher than the critical value of 93.816 if we consider 0.005 significance level for a degree of freedom of 61. Is this enough to say that these two quantities are related? Also the equation of the trendline calculated using the below formula Y=bX+a where b=(sum(XY)-nX̅Y̅)/sum(X^2)-n(X̅^2) and a=Ybar-b*Xbar was y = 0.9665x + 91.004 and R² = 0.8727 Here I am not able to interpret the result of R². Does it means the equation takes into account about 87.27% of the reason out of total reasons responsible for variability of y?
