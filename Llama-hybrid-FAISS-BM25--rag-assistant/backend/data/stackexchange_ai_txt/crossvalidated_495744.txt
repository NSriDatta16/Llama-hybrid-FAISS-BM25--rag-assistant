What is the relationship between knowing physical conditions of a coin toss and the prior distribution?

I am wondering how knowing the initial physical conditions of a coin toss would affect the prior distribution. As far as I know, Bayesians think the parameter as a random variable, the values of which makes the prior distribution but I don't think the initial conditions do not make the prior distribution. It is confusing to picture the relationship between knowing the initial physical conditions of coin tosses and the prior distribution. The following link is a youtube video saying that the probability of heads is the number of heads divided by possibilities for bayesians. Here, possibilities mean initial physical conditions of throwing the coin. I don't really understand the stuff when he talks about the bayesian way of probability. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsJ4W1k0hUg
