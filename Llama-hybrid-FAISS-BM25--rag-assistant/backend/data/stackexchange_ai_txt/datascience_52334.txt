Are there any standard procedure for designing a CNN? Not really. If you want a more detailed answer, have a look at my masters thesis: Thoma, Martin. " Analysis and optimization of convolutional neural network architectures ." arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.09725 (2017). Especially chapter 3 (Topology Learning) and 2.5 (Analysis Techniques) might be of interest to you.
