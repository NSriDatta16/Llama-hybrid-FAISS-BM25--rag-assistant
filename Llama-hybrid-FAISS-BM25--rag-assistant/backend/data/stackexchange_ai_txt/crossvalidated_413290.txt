If I take mean of uncertain observations what happens to SD of the observations?

I have some observations, each with an accompanying standard deviation (shown here as error bars): I want to make a summarised plot of this data by taking mean of all observations for a given X value, so something like this: I'm confused how I will calculate the standard deviation for these averaged measurements. Will it be just the mean of the std. devs of all observations for a given X?
