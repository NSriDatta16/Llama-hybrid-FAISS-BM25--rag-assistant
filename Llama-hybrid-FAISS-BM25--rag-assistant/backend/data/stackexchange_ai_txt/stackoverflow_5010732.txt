They probably chose to use 40 characters instead of 32, just to have their backs covered in case in the future some standards changed or they modified the way they coded id_session. Varchar instead of char... Well, char adds blank spaces at the end (it's a fixed length type, http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/char.html ) to exactly fit 40 bytes. When you retrieve it, it comes back to 32 bytes, but I suppose they use Varchar to save storage space. I have no idea. Sorry! Maybe to use varchar as a standard? I don't know, but in my case, I tend to methodically use varchar instead of char. Bear in mind all of my answers are just suppositions and I'm not clearly sure of any of them (especially the second one xD). Best regards
