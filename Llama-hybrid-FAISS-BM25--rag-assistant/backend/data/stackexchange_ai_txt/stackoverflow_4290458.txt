coding mental block, wants inspiration from beautiful coding

I'm having a coding mental block and wish to draw inspiration from other's coding. Where can I find beautiful coding (elegant, succinct, self-documenting) to refresh my mind. Github can be a place to start but I don't know authors to look for.
