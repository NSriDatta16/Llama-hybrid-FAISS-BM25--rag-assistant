EDIT: I read your code wrong earlier. You are estimating the autocorrelation, not the ISI distribution as I thought before. Your variable name tricked me!! Though the inter-spike-interval (ISI) distribution has a relation to autocorrelogram, they are not the same thing . The (unnormalized) autocorrelation (which should really be called auto-2nd-moment) of spike trains is usually defined as $$ Q(\tau) = E\left[x(t)x(t+\tau)\right] $$ where $x(t)$ is the spike train, and assuming some wide-sense stationarity (hence, doesn't depend on $t$). It's usually estimating by binning with a small window size such that in each bin there's either 0 or 1 spike, and averaging over time. Now, the ISI distribution (which is not what you are estimating) can predict the autocorrelation function, if you additionally assume that your point process is a renewal process . Then the autocorrelation function is an infinite sum of k-convolutions of the ISI distribution (plus a peak at $\tau = 0$). I hope this clarifies your confusion (of variable name). I strongly recommend Theoretical Neuroscience by Dayan and Abbott .
