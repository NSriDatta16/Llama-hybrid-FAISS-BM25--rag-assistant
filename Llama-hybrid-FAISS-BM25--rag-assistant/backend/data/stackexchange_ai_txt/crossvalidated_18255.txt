The situation does seem a bit strange, but I think your plot may provide a clue. It looks like there may be a curvilinear relationship. It is permissible to use polynomial terms and other transformations of predictor variables (e.g., $x^2$) in logistic regression, just as in OLS regression. This might be worth a try.
