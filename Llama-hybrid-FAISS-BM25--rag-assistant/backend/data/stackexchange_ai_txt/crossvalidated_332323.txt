Dependent variables for logistic regression

I am having a mental blank and need some help with a final part of my study. To summarize: I have a population of cats, they have been scored as either obese/overweight (1) or not obese/overweight (O) using two different methods - a visual scoring method and a verbal scoring method. I obtained results that approx 30% were scored as 1 using the visual scale, 32% scored as 1 using the verbal scale, and 23% scored as 1 using both scales. I have completed univariable and multivariable log regression using both the visual and verbal scores as dependent variables. I now want to do a third model using a score of 1 on both scales as the dependent variable. How do I go ahead and do this using R? I feel that it's something quite simple that I have just forgotten. Thanks so much for the help!
