Posting this as a new answer to keep the other one available. This is much less elegant as I have to get into the guts of Rake and manually update the task list, but it works. task :test1 do puts 'test1' end task :test2 do puts 'test2' end task :after do puts 'after' end # top_level_tasks is't writable so we need to do this ugly # instance_variable_set hack... current_tasks = Rake.application.top_level_tasks current_tasks Outputs: $ rake test1 test1 after $ rake test1 test2 test1 test2 after
