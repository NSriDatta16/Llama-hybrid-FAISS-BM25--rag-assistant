Just a suggestion for style, I like doing something like this: In your view: Please note that the = isn't needed any more. The helper then uses concat() to append something to your page and the putting-long-strings-together thing is obsolete too: def display_services concat(" ") form_for @user do |f| f.text_field ... end concat(" ") end Is it nessaccary to put the tag into the helper. If you need a helper for embedding something into a block you could use some yield-magic as well: def block_helper concat(" ") yield concat(" ") end And use it like this in your view - of course with helpers too: cool block
