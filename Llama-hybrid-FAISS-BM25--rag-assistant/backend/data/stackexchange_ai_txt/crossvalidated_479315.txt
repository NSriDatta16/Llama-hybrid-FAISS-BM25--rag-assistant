This is likely to be Simpson's Paradox. The estimates you get from a mixed effects model are the "within subject" associations with the relevant variable and the outcome. That is, the average for each subject. This can be very different from the overall association between the variables and the outcome. These can be, and often are, very different from each other. Sometimes they are the opposite sign and then it is an example of Simpson's Paradox. If you want to disentangle the between-subject association from the within-subject association then you can do so with contextual effects - by group-mean-centering and including the group means. Herre is a recent question and answer that goes into this in some detail: Understanding Simpson's paradox with random effects
