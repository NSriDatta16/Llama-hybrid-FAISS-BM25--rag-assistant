I presume your testers are on Windows? The short answer is that iPhone apps are in fact folders (called bundles) with a specific file layout. On Mac OS you don't notice because finder hides it for you, though you can look inside by selected "Show Package Contents" from the contextual menu in finder. Anyway, yes, they can install it by just dragging the app, assuming everything was decompressed correctly. THe problem is that the most Windows decompression tools mangle archives of bundles (at least with respect to how iTunes expects them). You can read all the gory details on what you can and can't do in this blog post.
