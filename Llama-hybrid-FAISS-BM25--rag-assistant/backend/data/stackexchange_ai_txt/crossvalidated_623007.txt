You can use a PCA (it's a valid mathematical option as long as you have a matrix full of numbers, whether they're 0/1 or not), but (depending on what you want to do with the results of this analysis) you might be better off with a principal coordinates analysis (PCOA), which is like a PCA but based on distances between observations (sites, in your case); a PCOA is the same as PCA if we use Euclidean distances (i.e., $\sqrt{\sum(x_i-y_i)^2}$ , but people usually use different distance metrics when they have presence/absence data, such as the Jaccard index (see e.g. this question ) If you're working in R you can search for vegan + pcoa to get links to lots of examples ( vegan is the main package in R for working with community ecology data).
