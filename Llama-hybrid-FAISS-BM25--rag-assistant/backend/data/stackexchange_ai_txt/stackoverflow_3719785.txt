100ms is plenty of time. The biggest worry would be the display updates, I'd think. If you're wanting to avoid an actual database, this is easy enough to do with a simple index file in addition to your main file. You could store the first N bytes (4 maybe?) of the string and a file offset into the main file in a index every 32 records or so, and binary search across that. You could then linearly search through up to 32 records after a binary search got you pretty close. You can tune the index frequency from 32 records to whatever makes sense given your average string length and the size of a single read on your media. If you had 512 byte filesystem reads, and 8 byte average strings, then you'd do an index every 64 records, etc. There's not much point in having more than one index record per minimum disk read size. The index file could be generated easily, and you could then manage the main file with a simple text editor.
