Perl : get substring which matches regex error

I am very new to Perl, so please bear with my simple question: Here is the sample output: Most successful agents in the Emarket climate are (in order of success): 1. agent10896761 ($-8008) 2. flightsandroomsonly ($-10102) 3. agent10479475hv ($-10663) Most successful agents in the Emarket climate are (in order of success): 1. agent10896761 ($-7142) 2. agent10479475hv ($-8982) 3. flightsandroomsonly ($-9124) I am interested only in agent names as well as their corresponding balances, so I am hoping to get the following output: agent10896761 -8008 flightsandroomsonly -10102 agent10479475hv -10663 agent10896761 -7142 agent10479475hv -8982 flightsandroomsonly -9124 For later processes. This is the code I've got so far: #!/usr/bin/perl -w open(MYINPUTFILE, $ARGV[0]); while( ) { my($line) = $_; chomp($line); # regex match test if($line =~ m/agent10479475/) { if($line =~ m/($-[0-9]+)/) { print "$1\n"; } } if($line =~ m/flightsandroomsonly/) { print "$line\n"; } } The second regex match has nothing wrong, 'cause that is printing out the whole line. However, for the first regex match, I've got some other output such like: $ ./compareResults.pl 3.txt 2. flightsandroomsonly ($-10102) 0479475 0479475 3. flightsandroomsonly ($-9124) 1. flightsandroomsonly ($-8053) 0479475 1. flightsandroomsonly ($-6126) 0479475 If I "escape" the braces like this if($line =~ m/\($-[0-9]+\)/) { print "$1\n"; } Then there is never a match for the first regex... So I'm stuck with a problem of making that particular regex work. Any hints for this? Many thanks in advance.
