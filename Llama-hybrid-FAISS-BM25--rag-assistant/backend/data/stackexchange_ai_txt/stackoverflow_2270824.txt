There will always be "real" languages to do the work, but we can drag and drop the workflow. I'm using Apple's Automator which allows users to chain together "Actions" exposed by the various applications on their systems. Actions have inputs and/or outputs, some have UI elements and basic logic can be applied to the chain. The key difference between automator and other visual environments is that the actions use existing application code and don't require any special installation. More Info > http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/ I've used it to "automate" many batch processes and had really great results (surprises me every time). I've got it running builds and backups and whenever i need to process a mess of text files it comes through. I would love to know whether iHook or Platypus (osx wrapper builders for shell scripts) could let me develop plugins in python .... There is definitely room for more applications like this and for more support from OSX application developers but the idea is sound. Until there's major support there aren't many "actions" available, but a quick check on my system just showed me an extra 30 that i didn't know i had. PS. There was another app for OS-preX called "Filter Tops" which had a much more limited set of plugins.
