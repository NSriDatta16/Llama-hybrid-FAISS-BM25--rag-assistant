Sorry for stiring up old question, but I think this will be useful for you. When I worked on same task, I choose online insertion sort. This is perfect choice on small collection. For example, for 10 books you should do only 14 comparisons (in average case). In best case you should do only 9 comparisions (if your collection is already sorted). If you choose quick sort, you should do 20 comparisons (average), but it's always better then dirty sorting (by comparing each book with all books in collection). Anyway, you should do online ranking (next pair selection based on previous comparision results). Note that all of this solutions has one assumption about transitive relation (If book1 is better then book2 and book2 better than book3, then book1 better then book3). If it is not working for you â€“ you can't rank them. You can find both algorithms perfectly described on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_sort
