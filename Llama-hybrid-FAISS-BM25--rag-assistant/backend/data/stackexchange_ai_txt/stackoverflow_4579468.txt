Domain forwarding (sort-of)

I have been attempting to set up magento on a shared hosting server that doesn't support innoDB, ergo its not been possible. The domain I want to use has also been registered with this rubbish hosting provider. (one[dot]com for anyones reference). So I thought I would be able to point this domain to a different hosting provider that DOES support it, but one[dot]com doesnt allow me to change nameservers for the domain. They just said this: You can only setup IP address, CNAME and web forwarding in our DNS settings but not change of nameservers Would there be any way to change any of these settings or the .htaccess file so that, for example http://www.mydomain.com/folder/page.php?query=string Would display a page from the other server http://xxx.xxx.xxx:xx/folder/page.php?query=string I've created loads of sits doing all sorts but never really needed to other with the domain administration side of things.
