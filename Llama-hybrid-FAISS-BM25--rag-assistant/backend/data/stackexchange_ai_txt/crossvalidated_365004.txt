If N Bayesians estimate the probability of something, how do you aggregate their estimations?

If N Bayesians all estimate the probability of some event, how do you aggregate their estimates to get a final estimate? (Assume they are all equally trustworthy, or at least you have no reason to favor one over another) For example, if one says 50%, another 80%, and a third 70%, do you take the mean, median, geometric mean?
