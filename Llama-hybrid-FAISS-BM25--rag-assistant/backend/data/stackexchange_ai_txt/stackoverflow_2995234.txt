ElggMetadata is used to store information about the actual Elgg entity. So if you created a Car entity and wanted to say what colour it was, that would be a perfect use case for ElggMetadata. ElggAnnotion is used to add additional information (comment, review, etc.) to an entity. So in the above example of a Car Entity, you could allow users to comment or review it. This is a perfect case for ElggAnnotation.
