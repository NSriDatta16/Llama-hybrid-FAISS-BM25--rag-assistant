Convert flat array of delimited strings (filepaths) to a hierarchical, associative multidimensional array

I have a collection of keys in this massive flat single array I would like to basically expand that array into a multidimensional one organized by keys - here is an example: Input: [ 'invoice/products/data/item1', 'invoice/products/data/item2', 'invoice/products/data/item2', ] Desired result: [ 'invoice' => [ 'products' => ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'] ] ] How can I do this? The length of the above strings are variable.
