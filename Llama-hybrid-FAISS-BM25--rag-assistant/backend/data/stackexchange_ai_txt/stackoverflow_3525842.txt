Persisting form state isn't usually approached from the client (JS) side, but from the server side. There are a number of good modules on CPAN for dealing with web forms, including HTML::FormFu and Form::Sensible , although personally I prefer HTML::FormHandler . With it, you can declare your fields and all of their validation rules, and the module will validate the form for you, organize any errors on a per-field basis, and help you to render all of the form controls (including any error messages). You get your choice of control over rendering, from a totally automatic layout (nice for development), to manual layout with FormHandler's builtin widgets, to providing custom templates for the widgets, to doing all of the templating yourself and just using the form object as a repository of field values and messages.
