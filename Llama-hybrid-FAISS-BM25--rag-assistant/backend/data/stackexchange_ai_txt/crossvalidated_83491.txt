If you are interested in the proportion of students who earn at least one degree from school $y$, among those students who enroll at school $y$, then logistic regression is probably the best way to go. The only snag is that you would have to reduce the numerator for each school to exclude those people who earned more than one degree from that school. That is not difficult: the number of over-counts can be easily computed from your second table. If the question of interest really does require you to count individuals earning multiple degrees from one college with corresponding multiplicity, then you are right that a binomial based method is inappropriate. In this case, I think that so long as none of the cells are underpopulated a $\chi^{2}$ goodness of fit test should work, using the $2\times 5$ contingency table generated directly from your first and third datasets. (From the way that you have phrased your hypotheses, I don't think that the possibility of individuals moving between colleges is really relevant to the question of interest.) However, if you want to know whether admission to college $y$ is associated with the completion of any advanced degree(s), whether at $y$ or not, then I think that you have a problem. You have no way of linking students who attend $y$ but do not graduate there to the schools at which they subsequently graduate from elsewhere. If such students are very rare - i.e., if the vast majority of students who enroll at each college do subsequently graduate from that college, then this might not matter much. But otherwise, I think that this version of the question cannot be answered from the data you have.
