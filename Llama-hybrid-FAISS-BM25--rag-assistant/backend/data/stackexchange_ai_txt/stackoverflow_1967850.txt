Do you get an error message when you use wm_concat? Unlike functions like to_char, it is owned by wmsys and you might need to use wmsys.wm_concat to use it. (unless you create the necessary synonyms of course). Now for the actual question, This technique is called string aggregation. You could find a lot of other alternatives here. http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/10g/StringAggregationTechniques.php For other methods, Search for "stragg" on http://asktom.oracle.com Another useful link : http://www.orafaq.com/node/2290 This is probably the most used one. A lot of teams write their own custom functions which more or less do the same. CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employees (p_deptno in emp.deptno%TYPE) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS l_text VARCHAR2(32767) := NULL; BEGIN FOR cur_rec IN (SELECT ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = p_deptno) LOOP l_text := l_text || ',' || cur_rec.ename; END LOOP; RETURN LTRIM(l_text, ','); END; / SHOW ERRORS while this solution works for varchar2 and number, the best generic solution can be built using Oracle ODCIAggregate interface. http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/B14117_01/appdev.101/b10800/dciaggfns.htm#sthref462 Implementation for the same is at the first link above at www.oracle-base.com
