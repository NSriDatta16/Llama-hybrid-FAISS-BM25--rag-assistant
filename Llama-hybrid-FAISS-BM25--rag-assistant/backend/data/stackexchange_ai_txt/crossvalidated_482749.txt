There are a few things going on here. First, non-overlap of 95% confidence intervals (CI) is generally much more stringent than is required for a significant difference between two means. This answer shows that under reasonable conditions such non-overlap is equivalent to about p high shelter and low shelter at the Waikiki site. Second, as a comment on an earlier version of this answer states: When removing the interaction, both Site and Shelter come out significant ... That argues that the anomaly isn't so much with the Waikiki site as with the Hanauma site. With an overall difference between high shelter and low shelter in the model without an interaction, one might expect to find a shelter difference for the Hanauma site, too. You don't see that in the evidently raw data in the bar plots and the first table. Raw data comparisons, however, aren't the same thing as comparing coefficients in regression models. One point of a linear model is to share information about the underlying error terms among all of the conditions. That makes it possible to see differences that are hidden because of random variation within individual combinations of conditions, like the high shelter versus low shelter values at Hanauma. If the model had stopped at that point, one could have analyzed estimated marginal means in a way that would presumably show significant ( high shelter - low shelter ) differences for both Waikiki and Hanauma, both differences equal to the regression coefficient for Site in the additive model without the interaction. Third, adding the interaction term is an attempt to look for further differences in the Shelter effect between the two sites. The interaction term isn't just looking at whether high shelter and low shelter differ at Waikiki. It's looking at whether that difference differs from the difference seen at Hanauma. That's both a mouthful to say and a lot to think about, but understanding interactions requires a lot of careful thought. That interaction term--the difference between the differences--isn't even displayed in the bar plot or the first table. In this case, adding the interaction effect loses the apparent overall "significance" of Shelter while not providing a "significant" interaction term. That result suggests that there simply aren't enough data to support the search for the interaction term. I suspect that an ANOVA test between the models with and without the interaction would have been non-significant, in which case the data would be most efficiently and accurately represented by the additive model. This type of behavior can be seen in situations in which some of the effects are on the borderline of significance. That seems to be the case here for the overall Shelter effect in the additive model. Then the attempt to break down the Shelter effect into separate effects for the two sites with the interaction, plus the loss of a degree of freedom for the statistical tests, ends up confusing more than clarifying. With these data, I'd recommend just sticking with the additive model if possible. If your original hypothesis specifically included the interaction, you simply didn't collect enough data to decide on that. Then it might make sense to show results for both the additive and the interaction model. Finally, do pay attention to the structure of the random-effects parts of the model, as noted in a comment. And if these are percentage survival values you perhaps shouldn't be using a standard linear regression as this seems to be, although in some circumstances (e.g., with limited probability ranges far enough on average from the limits of 0 and 1) such a linear probability model can sometimes be good enough.
