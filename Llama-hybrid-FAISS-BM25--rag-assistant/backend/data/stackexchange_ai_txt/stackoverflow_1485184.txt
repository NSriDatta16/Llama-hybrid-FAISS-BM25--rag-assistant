The easiest way to build an executable, you need project file. The project file extension is .pjx. You create the project file CREATE PROJECT TEMP. Drag your files onto it and Fox will place it in the correct tab based on its extension. Then you can click the BUILD button and resolve any dependencies. To deploy a fox app, there are a minimum number of support files that have to be present on the customer's machine. If you read the FOX help F1, you can get a list of these files. Read it carefully and try it on a clean machine that has never had Foxpro on it. Then you will know if you caught all the files. I do not have it in front of me at this moment..
