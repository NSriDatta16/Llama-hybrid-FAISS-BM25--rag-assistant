I had a very similar question . I'm now almost certain that the key containers cannot be used to store public keys. Their primary purpose appears to be for storing key pairs. The key container does only store the key that is originally generated, and importing a PublicOnly key affects only the instance and not the storage. The "How to: Store Asymmetric Keys in a Key Container" page of the .NET Developer's Guide states that If you need to store a private key, you should use a key container ... which is about as clear a a statement as I've been able to find through MSDN. The substitute mechanism I used was to store the key in an XML file (since it's a public key it shouldn't matter if it's easily visible), with permissions set using File System Access Rules to prevent unwanted modification.
