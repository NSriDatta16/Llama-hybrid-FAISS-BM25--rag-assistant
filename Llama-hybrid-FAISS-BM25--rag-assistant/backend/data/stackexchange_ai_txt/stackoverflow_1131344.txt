Is it possible to suppress the Web Forms Designer in Visual Studio from being opened?

The primary reason for asking how to do this is because I personally never use it. The Designer is slow to load... especially on complex pages with lots of controls. To put it bluntly, I think of it as a crutch that web developers should avoid. I would like to encourage team members to avoid using it as well. If there is a way to do this through a policy setting (either in TFS or otherwise) or some options when installing Visual Studio that would be even better.
