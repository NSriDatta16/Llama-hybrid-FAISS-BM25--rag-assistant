There is a slight performance hit to loading each assembly (even more if they are signed), so that's one reason to tend to cluster commonly-used things together in the same assembly. I don't believe there's a big overhead once things are loaded (though there may be some static optimization stuff that the JIT may have a harder time performing when crossing an assembly boundary). The approach I try to take is this: Namespaces are for the logical organization. Assemblies are to group classes/namespaces that should be physically used together. Ie. if you don't expect to want ClassA and not ClassB (or vice versa), they belong in the same assembly.
