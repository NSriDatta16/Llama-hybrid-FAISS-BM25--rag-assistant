It's perfect library for work with rackspce. I am use it. And i am sure that it's not problem to use this library inside of windows service. But i think possible problems with .net framework client profile and com.mosso.cloudfiles.dll. But try first with client profile. Also i use following code to upload files to Rackspace(Configuration it's my configuration class. Instead of 'Configuration.RackSpaceUserName' and 'Configuration.RackSpaceKey' use yous own creadentials): private Connection CreateConnection() { var userCredentials = new UserCredentials(Configuration.RackSpaceUserName, Configuration.RackSpaceKey); return new Connection(userCredentials); } public void SaveUniqueFile(string containerName, string fileName, Guid guid, byte[] buffer) { string extension = Path.GetExtension(fileName); Connection connection = CreateConnection(); MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream(buffer); string uniqueFileName = String.Format("{0}{1}", guid, extension); connection.PutStorageItem(containerName, stream, uniqueFileName); } Configuration something like this: public class Configuration { public static string RackSpaceUserName = "userName"; public static string RackSpaceKey= "rackspaceKey"; } I you don't want to use com.mosso.cloudfiles.dll very easy create you own driver for rackspace. Because actually for upload file to rackspace you just need send put request with 'X-Auth-Token' header. Also you can check request structure using plugin for firefox to view and upload files to Rackspace and firebug .
