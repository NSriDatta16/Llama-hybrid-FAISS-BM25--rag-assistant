The best answer to this question from what I have found is this: Is deep learning a Markov chain in disguise . This is exactly what I understood, but since there was already a discussion elsewhere in the Internet, I am putting the link here. Markov chains model: $$p(x_1....x_n) = p(x_1)p(x_2 | x_1)p(x_3 | x_2) ...$$ RNNs attempt to model: $$p(x_1 .... x_n) = p(x_1)p(x_2 | x_1)p(x_3 | x_2, x_1)p(x_4 | x_3, x_2, x_1) ... $$ We can use a character sequence as the input instead of a single character. This way, we can capture the state better (depending on the context).
