Respond to applicationWillEnterForeground in a UIView

I have a UITableView that loads remote data from the network. I have logic in viewWillAppear to handle refreshing the data when needed based on state changes and a TTL for the data set. This works fine within an app "session" but isn't effective when the user exits the app to the background and later restores it directly to this view. What I'm finding is that when the app is restored to the foreground in iOS4 - viewWillAppear is not invoked in the view- I can totally understand why this is by design. Is there another UIView delegate I should be taking advantage of? I didn't spot anything in the docs. Since willEnterForeground is available in the app delegate is the best way to handle this firing a notification from the app delegate to the view? Am I missing a more direct an elegant way of catching this in a UIView? Thanks for any tips.
