In practice, almost all "normal" data are really a mixture of two or more normal distributions. For example, heights of students are often modeled as normal. However, there is a known difference in heights of several inches between men and women. The difference is small, so the mixture distribution for men and women does not appear to be binomal. For example, the 200 observations x might be a from a mixture of men and women in Country A and y might be a similar mixture for Country B. set.seed(523) x = c(rnorm(100, 65, 3), rnorm(100, 68, 3.5)) y = c(rnorm(100, 67, 3), rnorm(100, 70, 3.5)) par(mfrow = c(2,2)); mn=min(x,y); mx=max(x,y) hist(x, prob=T, xlim=c(mx,mn), col="skyblue2", main="A") qqnorm(x, main="Normal Probability Plot: A") hist(y, prob=T, xlim=c(mx,mn), col="skyblue2", main="B") qqnorm(y, main="Normal Probability Plot: B") par(mfrow = c(1,1)) With 400 subjects from each country, the relatively small difference of about two inches between the two countries is detected. The sample means are significantly different at below the 1% level. t.test(x,y) Welch Two Sample t-test data: x and y t = -4.064, df = 397.78, p-value = 5.815e-05 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -2.2156924 -0.7709199 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 66.53548 68.02878 By contrast, we consider test scores in two different years for a population that is distinctly bimodal. Here the two components within each group are more than two standard deviations apart so the histograms show bimodality. set.seed(2020) x1 = c(rnorm(100, 50, 4), rnorm(100, 70, 4)) x2 = c(rnorm(100, 60, 3), rnorm(100, 80, 4)) par(mfrow = c(2,2)); mn=min(x1,x1); mx=max(x1,x2) hist(x1, prob=T, xlim=c(mx,mn), col="skyblue2", main="Year 1") qqnorm(x1, main="Normal Probability Plot: Yr. 1") hist(x2, prob=T, xlim=c(mx,mn), col="skyblue2", main="Year 2") qqnorm(x2, main="Normal Probability Plot: Yr. 2") par(mfrow = c(1,1)) A Welch 2-sample t test detects the difference (of about 10 points) between the two years. t.test(x1, x2) Welch Two Sample t-test data: x1 and x2 t = -9.1307, df = 397.58, p-value Because the data are so obviously not normal, one may doubt whether the P-value from the t test is accurate. However, the issue is not so much whether the data are normal, but whether means of samples of size 200 are nearly normally distributed. The data in x2 seem the most aggressively bimodal, so let's re-sample many $B = 100\,000$ groups of 200 with replacement from x2 , the average $A$ for each re-sample is found, and see whether the $B$ sample means are nearly normal. The histogram of re-sampled group averages seems to match reasonably well a normal curve with $\mu = \bar A$ and $\sigma = S_A.$ set.seed(1234) a = replicate(10^5, mean(sample(x2, 200, rep=T))) hist(a, prob=T, br=40, col="skyblue2") curve(dnorm(x, mean(a), sd(a)), add=T, col="red", lwd=2) Note: In a comment @whuber asks how large a sample you have. I wouldn't want to use t tests for very small, distinctly bimodal datasets. Consider the following dataset with $n=10$ observations:
