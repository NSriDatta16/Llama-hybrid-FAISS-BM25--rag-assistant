Scrolling a UIScrollView from outside of that area?

To have paging work in a UIScrollView and to have it stop where you want, each stop must be a multiple of the scrollview size, and using clipsToBounds you can make the UIScrollView image appear outside of the scroll view. This means my scrollview is only 55 pixels wide, but the image inside appears across the whole view. However, I want the user to be able to drag outside the scroll view, where they're seeing the image, and have this touch event have an effect on the scroll view. Suggestions on how I could get this to work?
