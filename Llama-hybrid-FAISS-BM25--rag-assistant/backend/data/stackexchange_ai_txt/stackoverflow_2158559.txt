This may be controversial, but I favour readability, rather than DRY-ness* in unit tests. In other words, set up methods are none existant in my unit tests. They are only used for integration tests. I believe XUnit.NET takes this stance too. So to answer your question, I really would not worry about setting up mock presenters in each of your tests that require one. Some tests may not need a mock presenter, therefore having one set up before the test is run is not necessary. **Naturally, my unit tests span say ten lines average, if this increases or the scope of setting up the test (following AAA - Arrange, Act Assert) is large, only then will I remove the duplication and create helper methods. To clear this point up, for cleaner tests, you can create a base test class that contains the helper methods and other set up code.*
