PHPUnit code coverage not working with configuration

I have my PHPUnit setup and coverage report working fine without a white list filter. Once I add one however, the report seems to only partially generate as if PHPUnit quit unexpectedly. I do not get any errors or warnings. My configuratoon looks like this: ./path/to/suite ./path/to/suite2 ./path/to/suite3 ../path/to/files Any idea on what could be going wrong?
