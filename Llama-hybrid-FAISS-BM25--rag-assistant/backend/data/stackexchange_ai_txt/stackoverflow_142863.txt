How do I import a pre-existing Java project into Eclipse and get up and running?

Comment on Duplicate Reference: Why would this be marked duplicate when it was asked years prior to the question referenced as a duplicate? I also believe the question, detail, and response is much better than the referenced question. I've been a C++ programmer for quite a while but I'm new to Java and new to Eclipse. I want to use the touch graph "Graph Layout" code to visualize some data I'm working with. This code is organized like this: ./com ./com/touchgraph ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/Edge.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/GLPanel.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/GESUtils.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/GraphEltSet.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/ImmutableGraphEltSet.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/Locality.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/TGForEachEdge.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/TGForEachNode.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/TGForEachNodePair.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/TGNodeQueue.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/graphelements/VisibleLocality.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/GraphLayoutApplet.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/GraphListener.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/DragAddUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/DragMultiselectUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/DragNodeUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/GLEditUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/GLNavigateUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/HVRotateDragUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/HVScroll.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/HyperScroll.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/LocalityScroll.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/RotateScroll.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/TGAbstractClickUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/TGAbstractDragUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/TGAbstractMouseMotionUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/TGAbstractMousePausedUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/TGSelfDeactivatingUI.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/TGUIManager.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/TGUserInterface.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/interaction/ZoomScroll.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/LocalityUtils.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/Node.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/TGAbstractLens.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/TGException.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/TGLayout.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/TGLensSet.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/TGPaintListener.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/TGPanel.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/TGPoint2D.java ./com/touchgraph/graphlayout/TGScrollPane.java ./TG-APACHE-LICENSE.txt ./TGGL ReleaseNotes.txt ./TGGraphLayout.html ./TGGraphLayout.jar How do I add this project in Eclipse and get it compiling and running quickly?
