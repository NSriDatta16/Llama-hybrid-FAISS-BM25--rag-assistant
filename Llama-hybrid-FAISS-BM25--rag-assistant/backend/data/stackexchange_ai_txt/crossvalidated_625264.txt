You seem to be confused as to what time series data is. To be clear - using time series data does not necessarily mean that it has a lag effect. Time series data is data that has been collected in a time chronological order and does not exclude data on certain grounds (versus what panel data would do). Heteroscedasticity could be due to missing variables or extreme outliers in your data. You can handle for both whilst keeping a time series approach. How you wish to handle it is up to you/your company/your professors advice/what data you have at hand.
