Scilab is an open source alternative to Matlab. You may experiment with neural networks using the ANN Toolbox for Scilab . Focus on the theory and experiments. Did you choose discriminant features for your samples? What's the state of your training and test sets. For each experiment, study the confusion matrix. Do you have an idea why a sample is misclassified? Does it seem logical to you? If not, which feature you don't use would help? Implementing comes next, use the language you're familiar with. A managed language like Java or C# is likely to be less error prone: at least you're less likely to screw up things because of pointer or memory allocation bugs. Optimizing comes last (after some decent profiling as always).
