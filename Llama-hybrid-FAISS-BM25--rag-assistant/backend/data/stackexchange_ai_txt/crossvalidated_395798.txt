I would first start with a 6x2 contingency table. 6 rows for each segment and 2 columns for the binary variable (or vice versa). From here you can look at conditional probabilities to see how the proportions of the binary variable changes across segments. You can also do a chi-square test to statistically test for differences across segments. If you want to explore further and assess which specific segments are statistically different from each other you can use a logistic regression with the binary variable as the response and the segment variable as a categorical variable. From here you can statistically test each segment group against one another. Be sure to control for multiple comparisons.
