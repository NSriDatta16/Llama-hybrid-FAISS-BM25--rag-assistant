In my brief experience, organizing apply-templates functions is secondary to good documentation. Try to make your execution path obvious and enhance it with comments if needed to make tracing easier. Otherwise there's nothing wrong with splitting your stylesheet into as many logical modules as needed. Anything that's repeated should be in a template (obviously) Path matching should be matchable by a string search. apply-templates and template match should at least look similar. This becomes essential the larger your template becomes.
