Your database retrieval method is running on the server, which has nothing to do with your browser cache (which is why clearing your browser cache won't do anything). Your question isn't too clear, but I'm assuming that you're using the ASP.Net Cache object for your caching. You'll need to add some code to your database retrieval method to refresh the item in the ASP.net cache. It would help if you could post the code that you have, but basically it would look like: var data = DatabaseFetchStuff.... Cache["databaseInfoKey"] = data;
