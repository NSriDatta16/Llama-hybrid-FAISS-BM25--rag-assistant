How to find bits/dim of a gaussian output distribution?

I have images that are 64x64x3 and 64x64x1 8-bit. I transform those images down to [-1,1]. I now want to find the bits/dim for my VAE log probability. How do I find the bits/dim of the log likelihood? Doing $-\frac{ELBO}{log(2) D}$ where D is the dimensions of the image does not give a correct output, it seems that the bits/dim is too low. The output distribution I use is a Gaussian distribution as such the decoder outputs $\mu$ and the variance is fixed, i.e. p(x|z) I assume to follow a Gaussian distribution. Thanks a lot.
