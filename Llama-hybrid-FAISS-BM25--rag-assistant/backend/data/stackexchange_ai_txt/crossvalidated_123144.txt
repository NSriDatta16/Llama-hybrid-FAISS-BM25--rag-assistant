Modeling an I(1) process with a cointegrating I(1) and an I(0) variable

A colleague says that estimating the following time series model is statistically sound: $$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1t} + \beta_2 x_{2t} + e_t$$ where $y_t$ is nonstationary $I(1)$, $x_{1t}$ is nonstationary but cointegrated with $y_t$, $x_{2t}$ is stationary, $e_t$ is a white noise residual and $\beta{_*}$ are parameters. I'm not so sure. The safe approach would just be to fit an Error Correction Model to these variables, but in this case there is resistance to doing that (long story). My intuition is that because the dependent variable is nonstationary and because $x_{2t}$ is stationary, that the covariance$(y_t,x_{2t})$ will be undefined and $\beta_2$ subject to change as the data set grows. So an ECM is the straightforward/classic way to model these series, but is the equation above legitimate?
