Depending on the number of covariates you have ($p$), I suggest you try one of the following: Use LASSO regression to decrease $p$. Run PCA to get a hunch of the actual dimension of your data, or use SVD decomposition to see which singular values are close to 0. Look for the condition number of your covariates matrix in order to find collinearity. Examine a no-intersect model (R: glm(y ~ x -1, family = binomial('logit')) ), especially if you have only one covariate. Once you get a sense of the problem, a proper solution can be found. Personally I refrain from using Logistic Regression when $p=1$ as there are better classifiers (such as LDA).
