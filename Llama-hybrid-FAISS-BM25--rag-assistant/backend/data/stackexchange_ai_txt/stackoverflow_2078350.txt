While not directly related to your actual question, you may want to read what I wrote as an answer here under the title "Identifying the phone" . What you should really be looking for is a way to detect a feature of the current device and boy are you in for a lot of work if you want to do it properly. The problem as I stated in that other answer is that thanks to the history of user agent strings they haven't been reliable for a long time. If mobile phones as a whole won't be your primary platform, you shouldn't dwell into this that much, find something that works such as checking if user agent string contains "Blackberry" and be satisfied with that. If, however, you really do want to do it properly, you have to develop a feature detection framework to do the job with all its possible combinations and permutations for you - there's no easy path when going down that road. I'm sorry that I feel the need to be such a demotivator.
