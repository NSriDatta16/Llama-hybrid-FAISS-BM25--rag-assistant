Set my var to an anonymous function with a parameter?

I'm building my first OO JS library and im having a little trouble with one piece that's probably super easy... I have this: var storageLocker = function(catalog){ if(catalog){ this.catalog = catalog; } //my code... }() i need to be able to do what other libraries like jQuery do where you can select an element (in my case select a localStorage item) and then chain other functions to it. I had all that working, but for best practice and to make it more extensible later i put it in a anonymous function and now i can't figure out how to have the syntax of: storageLocker('localStorageItem').save({"item":"an example item saved to localStorageItem"}) but right now if i do that now with that syntax it returns this error: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'storageLocker' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function Any ideas?
