Well, nobody seems to want to do my work for me, so here's what we ended up doing. (It's not entirely done yet; when it is, I might post the code just for completeness' sake.) We've taken the plunge and downloaded JQuery, specifically the JQuery UI "Sortable" functions. Like I said, the main dropdown is now a pseudo-listbox, i.e. a ul with restricted height and overflow:auto . Each item has five radio buttons next to it, which are hidden with Javascript. (That is, if Javascript isn't available, the user just sees a list with radio buttons.) When you drag items from the main list into the (script-generated) category lists, the appropriate radio button is marked. There will also be some code that runs on page load to move already-marked options from the main list to the appropriate category (i.e. for editing capability).
