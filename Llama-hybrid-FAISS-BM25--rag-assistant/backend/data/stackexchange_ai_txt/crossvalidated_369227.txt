RGB images as input to CNN

Considering a 32*32*3 RGB image, would there be filters/kernels for each color channel? I haven't found examples explaining how CNN works for RGB images and whether each filter is a 3D. If I decide to have 4 filters where each filter is of size 5*5, then would each of the 4 filters be of size 5*5*3? http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/ Tutorial is a good starting point, but I don't understand how the third layer w1 is computed and how come the last output layer is of volume 2? Can somebody please help with the math? This is what I could understand: for the feature map (pink) w1[:,:,0] the element 0 in top left corner is obtained by convolution of the first blue and red filters as 0*0+0*(-1)+0*(-1)+0*0+2*0+2*(-1)+0*0+0*1+2*1 = -2+2=0 Continuing this way, all the element if w[:,:,0] are obtained. Now convolving with w0[:,:,0] and w1[:,:,0] to get 0*0+(-1)*1+(-1)*1+0*1+0*0+(-1)*0+0*(-1)+1*(-1)+1*(-1) = -1-1-1-1 = -4 which is different than the element inside the green square on top left corner of o[:,:,0] Then how is the first green square, o[:,:,0] obtained and why it is of depth 2 is unclear to me. I am getting -4 instead of 3 as the first element of o[:,:,0]
