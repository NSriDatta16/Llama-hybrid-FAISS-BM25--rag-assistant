If you add a PDF iFilter to your SharePoint environment, PDF files will no longer be treated as list items (thus the property view link). Of course Adobe post the instructions for this as a PDF. This change will also start indexing the text of your PDF documents so they will be more searchable. Be aware that if a percentage of the PDF documents size will be added to your search storage costs, so plan ahead . This is a cure for the symptom, I do not know if there are other ways to do this.
