I agree with stimms. Actually, unless you have a massive concurrent development on the same set of files, multisite is quite heavy to setup and maintain... And if the coverage is disjoint, ... actually we have switched to CRC (but we are with CC7.0.1 here, CRC in 6.0 was not advanced enough). That means you have a good connection to allow your user to connect to the web server that represents CRC and that will access your vobs for them. Your remote clients will either use a "semi-fat" client (the eclipse RCP ClearCase client talking to your CRC) or a web interface, for setting up their snapshot views. The other point that drove us away from Multisite is the licensing system: you can not convert a vob into a 'multisite-compliant' one without using (more expensive) multisite licenses, even for your local users... So if you want to use only multi-site licenses for your remote users, you have to isolate your data into a multi-site vob, and then replicate those data into a normal vob! All in all, I believe Multisite is not the only answer to offshore development team. BUT, that being said, one strong force of the Multisite mechanism is its ability to synchronize itself from delta coming from various sources: regular reception of packages files even a CD burned with the latest delta can do it! That means, if your connexion is not always up with the remote site, Multisite can be a valid option.
