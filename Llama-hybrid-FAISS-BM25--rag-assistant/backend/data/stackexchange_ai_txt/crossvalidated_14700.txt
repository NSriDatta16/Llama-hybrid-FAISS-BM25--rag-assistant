For many reasons, classification is not a good goal for most problems; prediction is. Logistic regression (LR) is a more direct probability model to use for prediction, with fewer assumptions. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) assumes that X has a multivariate normal distribution given Y. Using Bayes' rule to get Prob(Y|X) you get a logistic model. So if assumptions of LDA hold, assumptions of LR automatically hold. The reverse is not true, hence LR is more robust (e.g., X's can be dichotomous, far from normal). It is interesting that logistic regression is, in a sense, more related to the normal distribution that is probit regression.
