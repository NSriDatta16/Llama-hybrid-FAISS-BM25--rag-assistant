GWT: http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ Faster AJAX than you'd write by hand With Google Web Toolkit (GWT), you write your AJAX front-end in the Java programming language which GWT then cross-compiles into optimized JavaScript that automatically works across all major browsers. Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/ a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. They have little or nothing to do with each other. Django provides some Javascript; Django can easily handle the server-side of any Ajax conversation. Django doesn't help you write javascript. It helps you write the server-side of the application. Django helps you write the HTML pagess (with templates). If the page includes, or relies on Javascript, Django doesn't care very much at all.
