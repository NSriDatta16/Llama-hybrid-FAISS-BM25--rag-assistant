You can simply calculate proportion of bad contracts, $$ P = {n_b \over n}, $$ so that $P_1 = 1.4 \cdot 10^{-5}$ and $P_2 = 5 \cdot 10^{-4}$, but it's better to add a correction for total number of contracts issued. One way to correct is to add "dummy" bad contracts, $$ P' = {n_b +10 \over n}. $$ Companies with a large number of contracts see their modified percentage alter very little from their real percentage ($P_1' = 1.6 \cdot 10^{-5}$ and $P_2' = 6 \cdot 10^{-4}$), but companies with relatively few contracts will see their modified percentage move considerably toward high values ($n_b =3$,$n= 30000$, so $P_3=1 \cdot 10^{-4}$, and $P_3'= 4.3 \cdot 10^{-4}$). This is known as "Bayesian averaging". In effect, the companies with many contracts will rank higher than those companies with the same percentage but fewer contracts.
