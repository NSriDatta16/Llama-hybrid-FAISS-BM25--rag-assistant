Guides from Samsung . Bet you also developing for that? If your UI is in 1024x600 pixels (in photoshop), it should be no problem. I think the problem may come from a few other issue: density of 160 is called mdpi in Android, make sure you put the pictures to drawable-mdpi folder; Are you sure your picture/graphics isn't stretched by the Android layouts? For example, you may have a button in 100x100 px, but in the layout, it is defined like "fill_parent" or "120dip", then, it is stretched and not in native density. The native density for 160 dpi, will be exactly the same as pixel size, (1dip = 1px in 160dpi), so, your button should be "100dip" (or simply use absolute size to get rid of this trouble) I think you may do a simple test, making a 1024x600 px image (PNG), and put this as the background of the activity, and set the activity to be full screen without title bar. It shouldn't have any problem in showing in this way. One last word, I actually do my final layout in Fireworks, it has better pixel level control in terms of small UI graphics. But photoshop should also able to do the job.
