Regarding the truth of a single experimental hypothesis, there are two cases: In the first case, we assume the null to be true, the false positive error rate $\alpha$ should be assumed to be correct. So given that experiment 1 was a false positive, the probability that experiment 2 is a false positive is still 0.05 - any other value is gambler's fallacy. In the second case, we assume the null to be false - but the precise value of the parameter or estimand is unknown. If the original study is well-powered (say 0.8) and the follow-up is identical, then, if the assumptions are correct, the probability of the replicate showing significance is 0.8. If you update the confirmatory design based on the findings from the first study, it may be less likely to reproduce p Your arithmetic presentation doesn't make sense in the context of a single hypothesis because we cannot speak of a heterogeneous "truth" of the null - not without unnecessarily invoking a Bayesian approach. Regarding a collection of hypotheses such as a scientific body of evidence or a clinical trial repository, you can speak of a distribution frequency of false positives and true positives - assuming negatives primary results are not published, a frequent problem of publication bias. The exact distribution depends on the quality of the science initially performed. So if there are 10,000 initial attempts at experiments and only 1,000 of these are feasible (null is false, and study is well controlled with 80% power) then there are 1000*0.80 = 800 true positives and 9000 * 0.05 =450 false positives that gain publication. That is, the probability that any given publication is actually correct is 64%. If we replicate all publications, for the 800 true positives they will "replicate p $$ N(\text{Confirmed}) = N(\text{Studies with } \mathcal{H}_0 \text{ true}) \alpha^2 + N(\text{Studies with } \mathcal{H}_0 \text{ false}) \beta^2$$ where $\alpha$ is the false positive error rate and $\beta$ is the power (note you can easily generalize this to studies with differing $\alpha$ s and $\beta$ s).
