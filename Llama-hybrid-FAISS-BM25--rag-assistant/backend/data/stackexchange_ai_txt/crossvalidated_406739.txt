For the case of $N=150$ , rolling a d6 three times distinctly creates $6^3=216$ outcomes. The desired result can be tabulated in this way: Record a d6 three times sequentially. This produces results $a,b,c$ . The result is uniform because all values of $a,b,c$ are equally likely (the dice are fair, and we are treating each roll as distinct). Subtract 1 from each. This is a senary number: each digit (place value) goes from 0 to 5 by powers of 6, so you can write the number in decimal using $$(a-1) \times 6^2 + (b-1) \times 6^1 + (c-1)\times 6^0$$ Add 1. If the result exceeds 150, discard the result and roll again. The probability of keeping a result is $p=\frac{150}{216}=\frac{25}{36}$ . All rolls are independent, and we repeat the procedure until a "success" (a result in $1,2,\dots,150$ ) so the number of attempts to generate 1 draw between 1 and 150 is distributed as a geometric random variable, which has expectation $p^{-1}=\frac{36}{25}$ . Therefore, using this method to generate 1 draw requires rolling $\frac{36}{25}\times 3 =4.32$ dice rolls on average (because each attempt rolls 3 dice).
