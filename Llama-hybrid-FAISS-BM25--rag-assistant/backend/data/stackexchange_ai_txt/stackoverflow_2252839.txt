My advice would be implementing a bug tracker and assign tasks. This will show the productivity of anyone of the team. The first time we used it, we achieve to organize the team and measure the time we spend working on tasks. One of the things I liked was the fact that when someone assigned a task it sent an email to the worker and a copy to someone else to check the task. By the way we used BugTracker.Net .
