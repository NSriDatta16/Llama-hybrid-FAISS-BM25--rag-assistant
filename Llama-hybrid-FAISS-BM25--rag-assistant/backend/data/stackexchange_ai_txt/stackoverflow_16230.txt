I used the Microsoft ASP.Net Ajax and AjaxControlToolkit to do something like this. They have a ResizeableControl and a DragPanel. I used these, then hosted an IFrame inside the panel to display the content. Worked pretty well. This site: http://www.asp.net/learn/videos/default.aspx?tabid=63#ajax Has lots of tutorial videos that show you how to get started using the controls.
