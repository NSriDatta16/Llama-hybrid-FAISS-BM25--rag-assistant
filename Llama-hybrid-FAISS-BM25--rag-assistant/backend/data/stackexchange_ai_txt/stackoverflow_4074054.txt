How to implement a Mahjong game?

Mahjong is one of the most popular games in Asia (not the solitaire style found in Windows 7). There were plenty of Mahjong games out there including online ones from Yahoo or offline ones back in the DOS days! Just another day I was thinking to myself, how can I write one (excluding the GUI)? The data modeling part is easy. The winning and scoring rules are... pattern matching? The strategic part of the game, such as determining which tile to throw out and when to make the Chow or Pong moves are the most difficult part. How to implement this? Thanks! Research: A demo of Mahjong (japanese style) : http://www.nobleflash.com/game/4495/Japanese-Mahjong.html http://www.ninedragons.com/ - a Mah Jong game I used to play, its scoring system: http://www.ninedragons.com/mahjong/scoring2.html function language fits better? In what way? Is F# a good language for card game AI? AI Mahjong - http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/proj2009/Loh.pdf
