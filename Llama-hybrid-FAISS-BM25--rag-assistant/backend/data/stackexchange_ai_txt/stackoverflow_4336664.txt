Memory error with Jersey Jax-RS

I am returning a large amount of data via a rest service. The query returns about 200,000 rows of data then gets converted to XML. When I run this service in IE8 I get an error that "there is not enough storage to complete this operation". Is there any best practice for returning a large amout of data this way? The database run the query in about 5 seconds, so I'm guessing that the problem is JAXB converting it to xml. Does anyone have any ideas to improve this?
