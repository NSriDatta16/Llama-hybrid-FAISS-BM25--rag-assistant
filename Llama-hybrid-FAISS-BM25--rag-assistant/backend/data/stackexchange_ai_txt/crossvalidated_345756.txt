One thing you could do is apply the kernel transformation during preprocessing. This will expand your feature dimension from 16 to something bigger. Then you could use a linear SVM solver that should be a lot faster. To get even faster, once you've eliminated the need to do the kernel, you can use the sklearn sgd solver with hinge loss to fit the model. When your data size is big then this is much faster than the convex solver used by the SVC function.
