How to standardize data in Excel?

I have a large set of variables measured on different scales/units, and want to standardize them to the same scale, with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, so that I can run a PCA on them. I have heard that the NORM.S.DIST function in Excel is appropriate - can anyone verify this?
