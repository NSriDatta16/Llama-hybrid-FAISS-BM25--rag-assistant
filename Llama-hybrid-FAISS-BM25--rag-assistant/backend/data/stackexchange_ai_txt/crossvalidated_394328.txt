Feature matrix as the kronecker product of two feature matrices. How to build an alternative?

I have two feature matrices $\textbf{X}$ and $\textbf{Y}$ which I encoded through one-hot encoding the rows of two feature matrices $\textbf{X'}$ and $\textbf{Y'}$ . Thus, they are sparse with a few 1's in each row. I'm trying to solve the following equation $(\textbf{X}\otimes\textbf{Y})\textbf{w}=\textbf{z}$ Using the matrix $(\textbf{X}\otimes\textbf{Y})$ I get 0 error in training. However, this matrix is very large. Is there any other matrix I can use as a basis? I have tried pairwise multiplication and concatenation of the rows in $\textbf{X},\textbf{Y}$ , i.e., $\phi(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{y}_j)=[\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{y}_j]$ but it doesn't work very well. Is there any function $\phi(\textbf{X},\textbf{Y})$ that gives me a matrix with a small number of columns I can use to approximate the space spanned by $\textbf{X}\otimes\textbf{Y}$ ? I would like to avoid using methods such as PCA or kernels.
