Average the hue, saturation and brightness separately while keeping the min/max values. Lock the target hue of all the colours to the average and interpolate the saturation and brightness for the x points between the boundaries. This should return a scheme with a colour cast the same as the foto but with a simple variation. Maybe you'll even get the Apple look. Just hope you don't get 3 shades of dog puke.
