How do you read a word in from a file in C++?

So I was feeling bored and decided I wanted to make a hangman game. I did an assignment like this back in high school when I first took C++. But this was before I even too geometry, so unfortunately I didn't do well in any way shape or form in it, and after the semester I trashed everything in a fit of rage. I'm looking to make a txt document and just throw in a whole bunch of words (ie: test love hungery flummuxed discombobulated pie awkward you get the idea ) So here's my question: How do I get C++ to read a random word from the document? I have a feeling #include will be needed, as well as srand(time(0)); to get some kind of pseudorandom choice...but I haven't the foggiest on how to have a random word taken from a file...any suggestions? Thanks ahead of time!
