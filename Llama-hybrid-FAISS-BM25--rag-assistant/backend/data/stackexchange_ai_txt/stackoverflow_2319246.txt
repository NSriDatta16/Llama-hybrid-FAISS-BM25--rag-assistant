You can not ethically store passwords for later plaintext retrieval. It's as simple as that. Even Jon Skeet can not ethically store passwords for later plaintext retrieval. If your users can retrieve passwords in plain text somehow or other, then potentially so too can a hacker who finds a security vulnerability in your code. And that's not just one user's password being compromised, but all of them. If your clients have a problem with that, tell them that storing passwords recoverably is against the law. Here in the UK at any rate, the Data Protection Act 1998 (in particular, Schedule 1, Part II, Paragraph 9) requires data controllers to use the appropriate technical measures to keep personal data secure, taking into account, among other things, the harm that might be caused if the data were compromised -- which might be considerable for users who share passwords among sites. If they still have trouble grokking the fact that it's a problem, point them to some real-world examples, such as this one . The simplest way to allow users to recover a login is to e-mail them a one-time link that logs them in automatically and takes them straight to a page where they can choose a new password. Create a prototype and show it in action to them. Here are a couple of blog posts I wrote on the subject: http://jamesmckay.net/2009/09/if-you-are-saving-passwords-in-clear-text-you-are-probably-breaking-the-law/ http://jamesmckay.net/2008/06/easy-login-recovery-without-compromising-security/ Update: we are now starting to see lawsuits and prosecutions against companies that fail to secure their users' passwords properly. Example: LinkedIn slapped with $5 million class action lawsuit ; Sony fined Â£250,000 over PlayStation data hack . If I recall correctly, LinkedIn was actually encrypting its users' passwords, but the encryption it was using was too weak to be effective.
