Is parametric Bayesian inference a special case of nonparametric Bayesian inference?

I'm thinking about univariate density estimation. Original Question In parametric inference, you assume the data are generated from a density that can be summarized by finitely-many parameters. You place a prior on those parameters and try to make inference about them. In nonparametric inference, you don't make a parametric assumption. You place a prior on the (infinite-dimensional) space of probability density functions and try to make inference about the density function directly. Question : is parametric inference just a special case of nonparametric inference? That is, by making a parametric assumption and placing a prior on the parameters, are you simply defining a very dogmatic prior on the unrestricted space of densities - one that places no "mass" on densities outside the parametric family? Addendum I think the following is closer to what I had in mind when I asked the original question. Denote the space of probability density functions by $$\mathscr{D}=\left\{f:\mathbb{R}\to[0,\,\infty):\int f(x)dx=1\right\},$$ and denote a generic parametric family by $$\mathscr{P}=\{f_\theta\in\mathscr{D}:\theta\in\Theta\subseteq\mathbb{R}^p\}.$$ If you place a probability measure $P$ on $(\Theta,\,\mathcal{B})$ , I think it induces a probability measure on the infinite-dimensional function space $\mathscr{P}$ as follows: For each Borel set $E\in\mathcal{B}$ , define $$F(E):=\{f_\theta\in\mathscr{P}:\theta\in E\};$$ You can show that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{B}):=\{F(E):E\in\mathcal{B}\}$ is a $\sigma$ -algebra on $\mathscr{P}$ ; Set $P(f_\theta\in F(E)):=P(\theta\in E)$ for each $F(E)\in\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{B})$ . Question : In what sense does the probability measure $P$ on $(\Theta,\,\mathcal{B})$ induce a probability measure on all of $\mathscr{D}$ ?
