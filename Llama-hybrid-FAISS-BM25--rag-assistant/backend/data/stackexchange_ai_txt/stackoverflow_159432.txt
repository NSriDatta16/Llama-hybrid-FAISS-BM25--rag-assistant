Create a static library project, then use the interproject dependency feature of Xcode to build them in the correct order and link the app with the static library. You'll need to have a common build directory set for all the projects for this to work correctly (at least you did around Xcode 3.0, didn't check if this is still a problem with 3.1). You can set the build directory from the target or project's build settings (in the Get Info pane). To create an interpoject dependency: Drag the library project into the application project's Files & Groups pane. Set up target dependency in the application target's Get Info pane. Make it dependent on the library's target. Drag the library product in the application target's Link With Libraries step. You can find the library product by expanding the library project within the app project's Files & Groups (click the arrow). Sounds more complicated than it is. It isn't much. (Small extras: yes, you need a common build folder as indicated in the Xcode Project Management Guide , and the Xcode Build System Guide can help you "get" Xcode's build system, which -- at the cost of starting a religion war -- I think is one of the most flexible and simple build systems out there.)
