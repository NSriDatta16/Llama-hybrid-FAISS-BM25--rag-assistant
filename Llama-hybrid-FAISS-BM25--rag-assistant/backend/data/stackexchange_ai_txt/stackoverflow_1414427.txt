I am not a Project Manager Professional, but I run development projects for complex program analysis tools. I drew Gantt charts of page size back in the late 70s. They never had enough detail, so I gave it up. Gantt charts with 5 tasks are useless. Starting in the 90s, I have used MS project on some 10 real projects of 6-12 months in length with tasks of roughly 1 week size, and anywhere between 50-250 tasks organized into heirarchies related to software architecture elements, with teams of 5-10 people. Such plans print out as a grid of 3 by 5 full pages and we tended to stick this to a wall where it could be seen. These are wonderful for planning purposes, because they force you to detail out the major activities on a project, write down descriptions, sequence and prioritize. The team can see the tasks, and see which ones are theirs, and you can review it with the team members so that everyone can provide useful feedback about durations and task ordering. What they were NOT useful for was tracking project progress seriously. Sun Tzu tells us no plan survives the battlefield intact, and Gantt charts are no exception. It is true that with care, one could revise the plan carefully every few weeks and mark progress made. A "real Project Manager" might have done that. We were careful enough so that the original plan tasks held up pretty well through about half the project, and by that time people pretty well understood the problem and additonal re-planning occured but informally rather than with MS project. I have also used MS Project to plan many similar tasks for serious time and estimation purposes. This has the unfortunate side effect of producing realistic estimates with most of the costs visible. Its amazing how realistic estimates kill project proposals. Industry seems to want bad underestimates to start projects; its no wonder so many overrun time and budget. I have a love-hate relationship with MS project itself. It takes task descriptions, task precedence, and resource assignments. But I cannot say, "I prefer this task to complete first over that task" which would ask as an optional task-precdence, and I cannot assign a resource partly to one task an partly to another and get any sensible schedule. But for complex project estimation, I don't see how you can live without this. The agile people will tell you you can't plan; I don't know who they have as customers. I've never found a customer that was willing to let me work without a plan or a dollar/time budget he would hold me to.
