You cannot present an normal renderbuffer (created with glRenderbufferStorage), it is always offscreen. presentRenderbuffer: can only be used for renderbuffers that were created using the renderbufferStorage:fromDrawable: . If you checked the return value of that presentRenderbuffer: , you should observe it failing. What are you trying to do?
