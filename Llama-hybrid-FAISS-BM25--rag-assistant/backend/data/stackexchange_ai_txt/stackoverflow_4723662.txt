How to feed with 2 or more inputs a Neural Network in Matlab

I want to feed a Neural Network with more than one input (using the Matlab tool Box). If I declare the input vector like P = [1 2 3 4; 1 2 3 4; 1 2 3 4;1 2 3 4] , the target as T = [1 2 3 4] and then the network as net = newff(P,T,1); , when I look at the network parameters it says numInputs: 1 , while in my mind the number of inputs should be 3 (one for each row). My question is: how to feed the network with 3 separated inputs? Thanks in advance, Regards G.B.
