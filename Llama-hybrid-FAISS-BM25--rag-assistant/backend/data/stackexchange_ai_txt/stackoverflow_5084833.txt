The inner class is exactly that: a separate class. Only its name scope is nested inside of the parent class. You can construct an instance of the inner class without an instance of the parent class. If you make the abc member a class variable, then you can access it from the inner class because class vars have global storage independent of the object instances. Otherwise, you will need to pass an instance of the parent class into the nested class in order for the nested class to write to the parent instance's fields.
