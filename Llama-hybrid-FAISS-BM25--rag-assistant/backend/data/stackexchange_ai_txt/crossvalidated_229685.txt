Exponential smoothing versus GARCH(1,1) for conditional variance

I have a panel data of stock returns and I want to estimate the covariance matrix of these returns throughout time. I also want to use exponential smoothing. The scheme is as follows. $$\hat{\Sigma}_t = \lambda\hat{\Sigma}_{t-1} + (1-\lambda)(r_t - \hat{\mu}_t)(r_t - \hat{\mu}_t)^{\top} \tag{1}$$ Here $\hat{\Sigma}_t$ and $\hat{\mu}_t$ are my estimates of the covariance matrix of returns and the mean return at time $t$. In Chapter 10 of Tsay "Analysis of Financial Time Series" the author describes the existing literature on this and gives the following example. He has two index returns, one from Hong Kong and one from Japan. He considers the univariate case first, that is he estimates the variances of the two indices separately. To this end he fits a GARCH(1,1) model to both these index returns. The estimated conditional variance models are as follows. $$\sigma_{1,t}^2 = 0.038 + 0.855\sigma_{1,t-1}^2 + 0.143(r_t - 0.109)^2$$ $$\sigma_{2,t}^2 = 0.044 + 0.861\sigma_{2,t-1}^2 + 0.127(r_t - 0.109)^2$$ I am guessing that $0.855$ and $0.861$ also happen to be the optimal smoothing parameters. Can someone confirm this? In both cases the coefficients (excluding the constant) sum up to $0.998$, which is awfully close to $1$. This is very convenient since this is what we need for exponential smoothing, i.e. the weights of the previous estimate and the current data have to sum up to $1$. I find it very hard to believe that this is some coincidence. Can someone please explain the link between fitting a GARCH model and the optimal exponential smoothing parameter? Furthermore, can someone maybe explain what the author may have done to find those estimates that fit right into the exponential smoothing framework? What would the author have done if the fitted GARCH model had parameters $0.5$ and $0.2$?
