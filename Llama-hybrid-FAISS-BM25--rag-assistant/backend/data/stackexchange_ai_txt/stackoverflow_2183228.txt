Although multiple people have made the argument you should avoid using these codepoints because you can't rely on the users' systems having a font which displays these characters, the reason you're getting the wrong characters in your example case has been entirely missed. All of the symbols you are trying to draw are in the "private use area" which means that the symbols involved will potentially be different in every single font. The Unicode standard states: Private Use Area (E000-F8FF) * The Private Use Area does not contain any character assignments, consequently no character code charts or namelists are provided for this area. If you embed the particular font you want to use to insure you can use these codepoints, that's fine. But that does mean you should, indeed, use the \u#### notation in your code, because embedding the characters as Unicode directly means the source won't make sense unless somebody views it in the correct font. All in all, it's probably better to use icons unless you already have a symbol font you think is simply far superior to any graphical work you would otherwise do.
