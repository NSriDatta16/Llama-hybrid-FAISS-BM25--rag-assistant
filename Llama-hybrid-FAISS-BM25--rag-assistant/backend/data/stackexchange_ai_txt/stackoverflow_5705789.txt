How do I do the products and quantity in the same form with PHP or jquery?

Ok so i have a form I need to find a good way of going the adding products to a system. * System Name: Sort Order: Set to -1 to hide from listing So the problem is that a system has multiple products and each one of those products has its own quantity. So i was looking at a user friendly way of displaying the products. Here is my array with all the products. I was thinking a checkbox but that can get so long since there is 200 products in the db. I really want some sort of jquery draggable or something that will make it easy for the user....I am looking for any good suggestions....thanks again
