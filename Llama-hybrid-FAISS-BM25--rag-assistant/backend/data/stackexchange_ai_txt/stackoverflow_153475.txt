Sounds like a job for an enterprise discovery that is automated as far as it can go. Depending on the size of your organization and the environment there are different solutions. For big landscapes you'll need a CMDB (Configuration Management Database) anyway. Products like HP Universal CMDB can discover and track dependencies in large scale environments. E.g. it can discover the relations between a SAP system and it's related databases and the hosts on which the distributed systems are running and show you the dependencies. More important it can warn you in case some unauthorized changes are done to the actual environment. So the answer depends on what you consider as 'many'.
