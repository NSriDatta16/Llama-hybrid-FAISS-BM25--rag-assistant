Groovy: Reading a range of lines from file

I have a text file with a rather large amount of data of about 2,000,000 lines. Going through the file with the following code snippet is easy but that's not what I need ;-) def f = new File("input.txt") f.eachLine() { // Some code here } I need to read only a specific range of lines from the file. Is there a way to specify the start and end line like this (pseudo-code)? I'd like to avoid loading all lines into memory with readLines() before selecting the range. // Read all lines from 4 to 48 def f = new File("input.txt") def start = 4 def end = 48 f.eachLine(start, end) { // Some code here } If this is not possible with Groovy any Java solution is welcome as well :-) Cheers, Robert
