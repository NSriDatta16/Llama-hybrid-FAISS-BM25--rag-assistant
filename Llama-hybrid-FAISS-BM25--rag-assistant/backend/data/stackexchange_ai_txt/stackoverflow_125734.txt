QTP does not use screen coordinates except as a last resort, if the objects are identified as high level objects ( SwfTable in this case) you should be OK, if however QTP doesn't recognise the object it falls back to WinObject and screen coordinates. If you're using Infragistics then you should know that they extend QTP's support with their TestAdvantage product which will probably solve your issue. Edit: @ MatthieuF said: In fact, we use the Infragistics plugin for QTP, and we still have the problem Can you give me an example of a line that fails?
