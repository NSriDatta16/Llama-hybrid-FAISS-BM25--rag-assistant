Normality assumption in neural networks with linear output layer

I'm learning about neural network from the Deep learning book In chapter 6.2.2.1 they say Linear output layer are often used to produce the mean of a conditional Gaussian distribution: $p(y|x) = \mathcal{N}(y;\hat{y},I)$ (Equation 6.17) I don't know how can we make this assumption, is there any mathematical theory or proof about this? Can someone help me understand?
