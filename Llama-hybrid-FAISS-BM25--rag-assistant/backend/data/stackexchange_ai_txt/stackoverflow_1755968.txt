VisualVM breaks jetty

I'm trying to profile application that is run by "mvn jetty:run", when I connect VisualVM to it and click on Profile jetty crashes with: Profiler Agent: Waiting for connection on port 5140 (Protocol version: 8) Profiler Agent: Established local connection with the tool # # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: # # EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x6da5e5d4, pid=5124, tid=5704 # # JRE version: 6.0_16-b01 # Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (14.2-b01 mixed mode windows-x86 ) # Problematic frame: # V [jvm.dll+0x1ae5d4] # # An error report file with more information is saved as: # c:\dev\workspaces\credentials\credentialsgui\hs_err_pid5124.log # # If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit: # http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport/crash.jsp # Profiler Agent: JNI On Load Initializing... Profiler Agent: JNI OnLoad Initialized succesfully The same thing I get with different application run using mvn jetty:run. What's funny is that when I used profiler from NetBeans (should be the same as VisualVM) it works correctly, but I would prefer to use VisualVM any hints on fixing this? VisualVM from jdk 1.6 (but I used also before a downloadable version).
