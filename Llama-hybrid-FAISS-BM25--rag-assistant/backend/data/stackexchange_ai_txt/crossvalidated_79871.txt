Clinical trials significance

I have been a studying high energy physics (HEP) for the last few years but I recently started working on a project in medical imaging. I have been a little surprised (not entirely I was aware that 95% was commonly used) to find major studies reporting using 95% cl. In HEP the convention is not worry too much until 3 sd if not 5. I appreciate in the 'real world' such idealistic situations cannot always be created but even so 95% doesn't seem such a high level of confidence. What is the rationale behind this? Is it simply a pragmatic one in the interests of completing in a timely manner? I have already come across trial or two which appear, to say the least, couterintuitive in their findings. Can anyone recommend a good book to jump into the mathematics of this? I have borrowed a fairly qualitative introduction but things like power calculations and kaplan meier curves are essentially totally new to me.
