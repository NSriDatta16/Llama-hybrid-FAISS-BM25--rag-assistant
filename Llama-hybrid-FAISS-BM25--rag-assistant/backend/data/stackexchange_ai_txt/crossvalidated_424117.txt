You use a pipline to tell scikit-learn in advance what preprocessing should be applied: from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline clf = make_pipeline(preprocessing.StandardScaler(), svm.SVC(C=1)) cross_val_score(clf, iris.data, iris.target, cv=cv) Here is a good pipline example using PCA . From the documentation : Pipeline of transforms with a final estimator. Sequentially apply a list of transforms and a final estimator. Intermediate steps of the pipeline must be ‘transforms’, that is, they must implement fit and transform methods. The final estimator only needs to implement fit. The transformers in the pipeline can be cached using memory argument
