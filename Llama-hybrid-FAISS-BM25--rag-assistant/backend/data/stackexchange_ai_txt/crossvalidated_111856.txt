Why (mathematically) is the parametric bootstrap usually better than the empirical one?

As I know from experience, the parametric bootstrap performs better in terms of coverage probability for confidence intervals then the empirical bootstrap. Of course, this makes sense because you put in some information about the distribution and that is used to reduce the error. However, thats not really a mathematical description of what is going on ... Books such as Efron/Tibshirani don't go into details. Van der Vaarts Asymptotic Statistics only covers higher order consistency for studentized vs unstudentized intervals. I think Hall doesn't write anything about it either ... Can I read up on this somewhere?
