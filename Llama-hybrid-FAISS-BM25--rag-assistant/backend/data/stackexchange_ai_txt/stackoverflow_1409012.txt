Proper alignment is at least helpful (performance-wise) on most x86 implementations (and some kind of alignment is actually mandatory in other architectures). You might ask (like calloc does) for a pair of arguments, size of items in bytes and number of items, rather than just one (size in bytes, like malloc does); then you can intrinsically align (by rounding up block sizes) to the next-higher power of 2 above the item size (but switch to multiples of 16 bytes above 16, don't keep doubling forever, just like @derobert recommends and explains!-). This way, if a caller just wants N bytes w/o any alignment nor padding, they can always ask for N items of 1 byte each (just like they would with calloc and for the same reason;-).
