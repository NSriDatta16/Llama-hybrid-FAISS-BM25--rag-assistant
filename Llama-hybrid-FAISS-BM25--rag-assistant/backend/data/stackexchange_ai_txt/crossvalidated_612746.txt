By "simple logistic regression," do you mean a logistic regression with one explanatory variable? $$\log(odds(x_i))=\log\left(\frac{p(x_i)}{1-p(x_i)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$$ We may be interested in estimating the odds for a certain $x_i$ : $$\frac{\hat p(x_i)}{1-\hat p(x_i)}$$ Or just the probability of $y_i=1$ at that $x_i$ : $$\hat p(x_i)$$ But the way I've always used odds ratio in logistic regression is regarding $\exp(\hat \beta_1)$ . That's because $\hat\beta_1$ is the estimated (additive) increase in log-odds when $x_i$ increases by 1 unit, so $\exp(\hat\beta_1)$ is the estimated (multiplicative) increase in odds when $x_i$ increases by 1 unit, so $\exp(\hat\beta_1) = \frac{\widehat{odds}(x_i+1)}{\widehat{odds}(x_i)}$ , so it's an odds ratio. Let's say we are studying a disease which is more likely among older people, so $p(x_i)$ is the probability of having this disease at age $x_i$ , and let's say the simple logistic model fits well. Then for every additional year of age, the log-odds go up additively by $\hat\beta_1$ . So the odds for someone my age are $\hat\beta_1$ times the odds for someone 1 year younger than me.
