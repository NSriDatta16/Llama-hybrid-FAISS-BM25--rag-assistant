Which is the best license for my Open Source project?

I am a web developer, and I don't have enough knowledge about software licenses. I wish to publish some of my works, and I need to select licenses for them. My software product is free of cost, but I have some restrictions on distribution/modification of the code. It’s free of cost (but donations are acceptable). The source code is freely available. You can use, customize or edit/remove code (as long as the basic nature of the software is not changed). You don’t have any permission to change the product name. There are some libraries and classes which are in a folder called “myname”. You don’t have permission to rename “myname”. You can contribute any additions or modifications to my project, to the original source repository (the contributor’s name/email/site link will be listed in the credit file). You can’t remove the original author’s name from the license. You can put the license file or license code anywhere in the project file or folder. You can redistribute this code as free or commercial software. Are all these restrictions valid? Given these restrictions, which license should I use? My main intention is to make the product more popular with free source code while ensuring the original author is not ignored. The product is open. Thank you all; the above points are because of my lack of knowledge of license terms. You can help me to correct or remove some of the above points. What I’m basically looking for is in the paragraph above.
