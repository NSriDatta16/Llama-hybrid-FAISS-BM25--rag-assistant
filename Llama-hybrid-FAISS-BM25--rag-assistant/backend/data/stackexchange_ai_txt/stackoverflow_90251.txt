I've assembled your comments here: I'd like to do all this "w/o writing my own file I/O code" I need access from "Java Ruby MATLAB" and "FORTRAN routines" When you add these up, you definitely don't want a new file format. Stick with the one you've got. If we can get you to relax your first requirement - ie, if you'd be willing to write your own file I/O code, then there are some interesting options for you. I'd write C++ classes, and I'd use something like SWIG to make your new classes available to the multiple languages you need. (But I'm not sure you'd be able to use SWIG to give you access from Java, Ruby, MATLAB and FORTRAN. You might need something else. Not really sure how to do it, myself.) You also said, "Actually, if I have to have files, I prefer text because then I can just go in and hand-edit when necessary." My belief is that this is a misguided statement. If you'd be willing to make your own file I/O routines then there are very clever things you could do... And as an ultimate fallback, you could give yourself a tool that converts from the new file format to the same old text format you're used to... And another tool that converts back. I'll come back to this at the end of my post... You said something that I want to address: "leverage 40 yrs of DB optimization" Databases are meant for relational data, not raster data. You will not leverage anyone's DB optimizations with this kind of data. You might be able to cram your data into a DB, but that's hardly the same thing. Here's the most useful thing I can tell you, based on everything you've told us. You said this: "I am more interested in optimizing my time than the CPU's, though exec speed is good!" This is frankly going to require TOOLS. Stop thinking of it as a text file. Start thinking of the common tasks you do, and write small tools - in WHATEVER LANGAUGE(S) - to make those things TRIVIAL to do. And if your tools turn out to have lousy performance? Guess what - it's because your flat text file is a cruddy format. But that's just my opinion. :)
