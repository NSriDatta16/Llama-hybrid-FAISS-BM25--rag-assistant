As far as I know the Gmail API doesn't offer access to the total of send items. Tthe g4j project (written in Java) reverse engineered Gmail's protocol in order to access an account using HTTP calls. However, the solution is fragile since it could be easily broken whenever Gmail decides to change its HTTP protocol. Screenshot of a Java application build on top of g4j: It's not easy but there is a way to access a gmail account.
