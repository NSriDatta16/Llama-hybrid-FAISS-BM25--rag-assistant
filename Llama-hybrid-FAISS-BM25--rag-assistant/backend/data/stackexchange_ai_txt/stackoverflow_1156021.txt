We have built some JMX beans (the ones that come with log4j are not very friendly) that can display/scan/truncate/copy log files. As WolfmanDragon pointed out, you can use custom appenders to send your log messages to other destinations. Combined with a filter, you can send log4j error messages to a management application using JMX notifications, etc. If you have absolutely massive amount of logging over many machines, you can use something like Splunk .
