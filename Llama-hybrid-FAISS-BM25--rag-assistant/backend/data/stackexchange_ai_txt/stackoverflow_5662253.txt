I guess I understand your question right, so you can organize your code with modules, which will be connected in one file further. For modules you can use CommonJS technique. It looks like this: (function(window) { var Module = {}; window.Module = Module; })(window); And addition: (function(module) { module.NewProp = {}; })(window.Module); Of course, you can use your own variables instead window etc. And, if you will use Node.js - it's a good way to share variables between server and client. (function(exports) { exports.Func = function(){}; })(typeof exports === 'undefined' ? wow : exports); Hope it helps!
