To the best of my knowledge there is not yet a comprehensive academic computer vision textbook (as of 2019) that has been written that incorporates the deep learning. It's useful to separate the discussion and formulation of a problem from algorithms deployed to solve it. @shimao makes good point that often earlier methods are recycled with new deep learning components. Goodfellow et al., and Bishop's book are good books on deep learning and machine learning, respectively but they don't talk much about computer vision problems. By that I mean the tasks the occupy a lot of the computer vision research like noise filtering, 3D reconstruction, image registration, computational photography, structure from motion, etc. To better understand CV, Szeliski's book is still quite good, although it is a high level survey. Topics which CNNs dominate such as segmentation and recognition are only two chapters in that book so there's lots of interesting material. I think the following books are also useful and worth having a look at although they cover classical methods: Prince, Simon JD. Computer vision: models, learning, and inference. Cambridge University Press, 2012. - Hartley, Richard, and Andrew Zisserman. Multiple view geometry in computer vision. Cambridge university press, 2003. - Gonzalez, Rafael and Woods, Richard. Digital Image Processing. Pearson Higher Ed, 2011. If you are really interested in CV, I think it can also be interesting to learn about human visual perception and optics as well as related fields like robotics, computer graphics and medical/scientific imaging.
