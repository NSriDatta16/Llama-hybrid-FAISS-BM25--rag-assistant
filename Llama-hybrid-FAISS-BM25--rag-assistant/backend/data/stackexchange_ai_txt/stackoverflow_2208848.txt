Having just entered the world of Android/Eclipse/Java (on MAC-OSX 10.6) etc., I went down exactly the same path and had EXACTLY the same experience. Here's a few "First Timer" tips I'd like to offer you... A. Things take time... to refresh your components, to launch the emulator, to load a new/old project, etc. I am running on a screaming MACBook Pro and --- Things Take Time. B. "Eclipse" is NOT Visual Studio. e.g. To open a demo project you'd think "PROJECT - > OPEN..." bzzzzt. Wrong answer.. you "IMPORT..." into your current WORKSPACE. The workspace seems like the VS "Solution" space ... but early impressions tells me its probably A LOT more than that. C. The DEFAULT PORT Number for attaching DDMS (the debugger) to your emulator is WRONG. My Version of Eclipse-Galileo (downloaded just yesterday) has the TCP port for connecting to the emulator set as default to 8600.... I could NOT get the d@rn thing to attach. I had read (somewhere --> starting a brand new development adventure like this always means a ton of reading up front) that the emulator really wants to talk on port 8200. I went into the PROPERTIES of DDMS and made the change and viola' And finally, D. Pay attention to the little "progress bar" in the lower right-hand corner of the IDE. I am amazed at how many times it wakes up by me pressing some "refresh" or other button... see A. regards, tob
