how to bring in splines (bs()) into lasso logistic regression (cv.glmnet)

Assume I have train dataset below, I avoided using model.matrix() and instead I used dummyVars() because I want dummy variables to represent all levels of my categorical variable. Now I am confused where to enter bs() function for numerical variables. I want all numerical variables to enter the lasso model like bs(train_x$a, df=3), bs(train_x$b, df=3) . In my actualy dataset I have a large number of numerical variables though. Spline regression with many features in R is the only post I found pointing out this problem but the answer there would not work for large number of variables. in fact even for one variable, I would have to change the column names and ... I would appreciate any hint, example, thoughts on what is the procedure of performing a lasso regression model over variables some of which need spline calculations. train
