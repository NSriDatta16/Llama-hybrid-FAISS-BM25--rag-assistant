How to test the significance of an intervention

I have a database of hourly energy consumption of a country throughout the year. I wish to test if an energy efficiency measure (daylight saving)which is instated twice a year and removed twice a year has: H0: negative or no improvement //H1: improved efficiency The daily profile shows two peaks, one occurring at noon and the second peak at 10 pm. Furthermore, I wish to see if, throughout the year, temperature variations affect the energy use or the energy efficient measures themselves. I have organized the data in groups of weeks, to reduce variations due to weekends and public holidays. It shows the 4 weeks prior to the hour change and the four weeks after. I'm at a loss as to what statistical method will be most appropriate for this analysis. Thanks in advance for any help or pointers. Cheers
