Starting Android Development: Native or cross-platform?

I am an experienced professional programmer who wants to delve into Android programming. I also wish to investigate cross-platform programming using tools like PhoneGap or Titanium. However, I am a bit in doubt of which learning strategy is best. One approach is to get a good feeling of the Android environment and later on explore the possibilities of the cross-platform tools. Another approach is to jump start using say Titanium (which to me looks like the better option of the two mentioned) and then after a while look into the underlying Android building blocks. The reason why this approach seems worth considering is that although I have earned my living on programming for 20 years, I have no experience whatsoever with Java. And the feeling of getting something done has always been encouraging to me. What do you think? Does option 2 make sense, or would it be more sensible to get an understanding of the Android environment first? Thanks in advance, Martin
