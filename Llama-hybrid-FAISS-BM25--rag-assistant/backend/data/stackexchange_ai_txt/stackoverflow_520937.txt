Organizing a Web Application

How do you guys organise your asp.net web applications? Do you have you classes in the applicaiton, or in a seperate class library? How do you split your classes into name spaces, by type, function, tier? I've got a great working applicaiton, but the codes a bit messsy, I want to look at the best way to organise it.
