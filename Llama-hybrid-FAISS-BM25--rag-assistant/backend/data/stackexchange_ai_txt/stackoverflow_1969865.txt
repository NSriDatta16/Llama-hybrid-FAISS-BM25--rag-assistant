Parent view/controller context If you use MVC 2 RC (don't know about previous releases) you can get to parent controller via view's context, where you will find a property called: ViewContext ParentActionViewContext; which is parent view's context and also has a reference to its controller that initiated view rendering... Routing It seems to me (from your question) that you have requests with an arbitrary number of route segments... In this case you have two options: Define your route with a greedy parameter where actions in this case will catch all actions in your request URL {controller}/{*actions} Create a custom Route class that will handle your custom route requirements and populate RouteData as needed. the second one requires a bit more work and routing knowledge but it will help you gain some more knowledge about Asp.net MVC routing. I've done it in the past and it was a valuable lesson. And also an elegant way of handling my custom route requirements.
