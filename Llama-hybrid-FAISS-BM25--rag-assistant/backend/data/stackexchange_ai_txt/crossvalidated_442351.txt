If it's not very costly, it's always preferable to run cross-validation to alleviate impact of dataset split, which is exactly what you need. Otherwise, you may try to cluster data points by their embeddings produced by a pre-trained embeddding netowrk such as resnet, then split your dataset in the aid of these clusters.
