In my opinion a machine learning approach is going to be overkill for your problem. The first thing I would try is a system that looks something like Given a new address compute the Levenshtein distance to all the fraudulent addresses. If the distance is less than some threshold $\tau$ flag it as suspect. How to deal with potential suspects depends on your needs/capabilities, at this point you could either reject it straight away or have a human verify that it is likely fraud. If the address is rejected, add it to the list of fraudulent addresses. You may need to do a literature search for alternate distance functions that take into account the type of edits you expect to see, for example you may want something that allows transpositions like Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance . All that being said, it isn't clear to me what an ML solution to this problem even looks like. Binary classification with character n-grams as features? I don't imagine this would work well at all, but I could be wrong.
