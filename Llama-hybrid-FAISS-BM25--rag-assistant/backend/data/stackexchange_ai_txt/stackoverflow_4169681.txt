Since you're in Rails, you might be better served using validates_numericality_of in your model: validates_numericality_of :cost, :greater_than_or_equal_to => 0.01, :less_than_or_equal_to => 0.99 To prevent fractional pennies, use this in conjunction with validates_format_of : validates_format_of :cost, :with => /\A\d*(\.\d{1,2})?\Z/ This leverages the strength of each validation.
