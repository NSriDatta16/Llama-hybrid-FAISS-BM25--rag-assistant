I believe the problem is you aren't setting a width and height for the image (somehow redundant for embedded images): dragImage:IFlexDisplayObject (default = null) â€” The image to drag. This argument is optional. If omitted, a standard drag rectangle is used during the drag and drop operation. If you specify an image, you must explicitly set a height and width of the image or else it will not appear . If you define a width and a height for the Image proxy in your example, it will probably work: var dragProxy : Image = new Image (); dragProxy.source = dragInitiator.source; dragProxy.width = dragInitiator.width; dragProxy.height = dragInitiator.height;
