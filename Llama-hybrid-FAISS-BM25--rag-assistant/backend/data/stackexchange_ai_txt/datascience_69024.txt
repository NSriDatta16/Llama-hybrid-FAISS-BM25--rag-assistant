Why are the weights of my first layer and last layer in the CNN change while the middle layers don't?

The weights of my first and last convolution layers do change in a noticeable way. However, the rest of my convolution layers, in the middle, do not. I should add that all convolution layers' biases change noticeably, however the kernel weights of the middle layers (as opposed to the first and last layers) do not change significantly. Has anyone else encountered this? Can anyone suggest why this is might be happening? Can I rule out vanishing gradients...? Any ideas for resolution (if this is at all a problem)? Thanks in advance. I'm happy to add details based on comments.
