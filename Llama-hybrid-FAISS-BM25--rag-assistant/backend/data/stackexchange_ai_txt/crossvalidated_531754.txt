Problems in the example Please consider the following issues to understand the particular output of fdrtool: In the example there are too little data points that constitute the background. fdrtool assumes that the data consists of two types of points. One type that follow the null hypothesis (background or "Null-Component" in the plot) and anothers that dose not follow the null hypothesis ("Alternative Component" in the plot). Since points that follow the null hypothesis have a uniform distribution of p-values, fdrtool is capable of explaining the observed distribution of p-values as a combination of this uniform distribution and an alternative component. p-values are never normally distributed, so using normally distributed values here breaks some assumptions. Answers Lower fdr values are better. So if you want to select all points with an an fdr below 0.05 do so with the index from result$lfdr . Alternatively, if you want to select a set of points in which only 5% of points may be false positives, do so with the index from result$qval . lfdr represents the local false discovery rate for a specific point and qval represents the average false discovery rate in the set of points with the same or lower qval . cutoff is a value of the input statistic (in this case p-values) below which data points are excluded to estimate the ratio of Null-Component" and "Alternative Component". N.cens shows the number of data points that have been excluded based on cutoff . eta0 is the fraction of the data points that may be explained by the null-hypothesis. E.g., if eta0 is 1, then all your data seems to follow the null hypothesis.
