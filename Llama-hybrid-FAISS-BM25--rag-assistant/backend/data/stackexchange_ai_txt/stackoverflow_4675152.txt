Git push to live server through limited ssh

I'm using GitHub to keep track of my source code. Although I work alone, it comes really handy to test new features and rollback if it doesn't work. So, I installed in Git Bash in my windows machine, and commit & push to github when the code is ready. Now, I want to take this further and deploy from the same terminal. My shared-hosting has SSH access but is kinda limited. They told me they had Git, but only as a client, to read repos. I don't know what that means. I was trying to make a repo on the live server, add it as remote on my machine and then just 'git push remote live' but that didn't work. Whenever I type 'git init' on the live server it returns: warning: templates not found /usr/share//git-core/templates/ Initialized empty Git repository in /www/example.com.ar/htdocs/example.com.ar/.git/ And I can't 'git clone' or 'git pull' or anything! Is there any tips you can give me? I'm just tired of drag&dropping my folder via FTP, it just feels so wrong! Thanks in advance
