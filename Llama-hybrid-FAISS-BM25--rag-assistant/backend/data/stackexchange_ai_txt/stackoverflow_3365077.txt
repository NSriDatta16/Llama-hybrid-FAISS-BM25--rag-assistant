Without the ORDER BY clause, the results are returned in random order. However, it seems logical to me that the easiest (and the fastest) way for db engine to return data as it's stored. So it's why the fist resultset is ordered by PK (no fragmentation, logical order is the same as physical). In the second case I would assume that you have an index on field name , and for the query select name from difficulties this index is covering, so db engine scans this index, and it's why you see results ordered by name . Anyway, you shouldn't rely on such "default" ordering.
