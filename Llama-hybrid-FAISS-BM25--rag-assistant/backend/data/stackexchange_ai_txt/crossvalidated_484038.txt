Literature of one-hot encoding performance v.s. others

For categorical classification, I couldn't find literature comparing one-hot encoding v.s. others from either theoretical or empirical point of view. I understand one-hot encoding is probably too intuitive to have any 'foundation' or 'derivation'. I also know that ordering category as scalar makes no sense. What about the compact binary encoding? On one hand we'll have fewer parameters to train and thus the model will be more robust, but on the other hand could the model using binary encoding be more sensitive to parameter fluctuation? I guess we'd be particularly interested in the context of neural network given its popularity and prevalence.
