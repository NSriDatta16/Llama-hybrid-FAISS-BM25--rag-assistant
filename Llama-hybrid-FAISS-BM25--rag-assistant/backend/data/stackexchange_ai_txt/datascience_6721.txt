How to preprocess different kinds of data (continuous, discrete, categorical) before Decision Tree learning

I want to use some Decision Tree learning, such as the Random Forest classifier. I have data of different types: continuous, discrete and categorical. How do I have to preprocess data in order to have consistent results?
