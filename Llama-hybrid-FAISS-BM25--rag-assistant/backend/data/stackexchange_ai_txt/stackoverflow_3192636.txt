This article is about game development but has the best description of how and why this happens that I've been able to find http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee419001(VS.85).aspx This paragraph from the article describes what is happening most likely - Attempting to create or write a file or directory under a folder which does not grant write permission to the process will fail under Windows Vista if the application does not have administrative privileges. If your 32-bit game executable is running in legacy mode, because it did not declare a requested execution level, its write operations will succeed, but they will be subjected to virtualization as described in the section "UAC Compatibility with Older Games" later in this article.
