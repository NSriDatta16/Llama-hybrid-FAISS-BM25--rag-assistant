10K in-memory strings would be too much for most Android devices. Assuming you don't get an OutOfMemoryException error, your app will constantly garbage-collect, and your performance will suffer as a result. Assuming your strings are of average length (around 128 characters long), I would recommend storing no more than 250 in memory at any given time. A better approach would be to repeatedly fetch data from the database; grabbing around 15 records per fetch.
