500 error from a RESTful web service which doesn't even act on the http request

I have a set of ASP.Net pages running on IIS7. Being RESTful, we expect to receive some XML. This is not going to be a public service so the XML format is agreed upon. We need this service as an integration between two sites and the the service pushes data in one direction. I tested how it works by using the Poster add-on for Firefox and everything went fine. However, the expected caller would be another website (making a server side call every few hours or upon user action) and I get the expected response. However, when we try and call it from the other site (from where it needs to work) it throws an 500 error. I weren't sure which part of the code was creating a problem so we commented out the whole of Page_Load() and still the same! I tried with cURL, through some other code but only the calls from the server is throwing a 500. The IIS logs confirm the right URL is being called. I even tried making calls using the same User Agent, but my web service doesn't like that server alone. Am really scratching my head on this one - how can no code at all throw a 500? Could it be because of some HTTP headers or maybe the server is sending a SOAPAction header? (I cannot confirm this right now because am out of office ATM)
