How does CCA find a low-dimensional common subspace?

According to Wikipedia, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) finds pairs of canonical variables. CCA has also been used in many cases as dimensionality reduction tool to find low-dimensional subspaces. I am wondering how the subspace is found? and how the subspace is related to the pairs of canonical variables?
