Howto get hardware information in Linux using C++

I need to get specifications of hard disk on both Win and *nix machines. I used on Linux like this: static struct hd_driveid hd; int device; if ((device = open("/dev/sda", O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK)) I need hd_driveid to tell me some more information about disk. I want to know: Number of partitions Specifications of each partition (format, label, flags, size, start point, number of tracks etc.) Number of tracks per cylinder Number of total tracks Maximum block size Minimum Block size Default block size Total size of device My questions are: Is there a common (platform-independent) way to connect hardware? I would like use same code for win and *nix. (even if there was no way other than embedding assembly code into cpp) If there isn't, how do I get above information in *nix?
