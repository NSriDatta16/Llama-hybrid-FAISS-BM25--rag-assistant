How to combine nlp and numeric data for a linear regression problem

I'm very new to data science (this is my hello world project), and I have a data set made up of a combination of review text and numerical data such as number of tables. There is also a column for reviews which is a float (avg of all user reviews for that restaurant). So a row of data could be like: { rating: 3.765, review: `Food was great, staff was friendly`, tables: 30, staff: 15, parking: 20 ... } So following tutorials, I have been able to do the following: Created a linear regression model to predict rating with the inputs being all the numerical data columns. Created a regression model to predict rating based on review text using sklearn.TfidfVectorizer. But now I'd like to combine models or combine the data from both into one to create a linear regression model. So how can I utilize the vectorized text data in my linear regression model?
