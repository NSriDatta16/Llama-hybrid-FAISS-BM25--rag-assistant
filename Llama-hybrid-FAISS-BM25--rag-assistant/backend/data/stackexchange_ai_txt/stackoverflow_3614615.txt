Given that you receive the HTML fragment in a similar manner to this, I think you can remove all of the src attribute, then add them back one by one as the previous images load, something like: $.ajax({ source: 'somewhere/over/the/rainbow', // ... other options success: function(data){ var images = $('body').find('img').each(function(){ $.data(this, 'source', this.src); this.src = ''; }); images.appendTo('body'); seqLoad(images.children('img:first')); seqLoad(images.children('img:eq(2)')); } }); Where seqLoad() would be a function like this: function seqLoad(element){ element.attr('src', $.data(element, 'source')); element.load(function(){ seqLoad(element.next().next()); }); } Basically the idea is to grab the src of each img , store it, then add it back to the img tags one by one as they load. Of course there are several problems with this, like say if one of them never loads (this can be fixed with a timeout that 'skips' the image in question if loading takes too long). Two instances are started, because, as far as I can remember, most browsers can load things from the same domain only two at a time. Just don't go and plonk this code into your site... I don't have time to set up a proper test environment, so this thing's probably riddled with bugs. Take the idea and go write your own. Any suggestions on improvements are welcome.
