You have to be careful to distinguish the probability estimate from a logistic regression model from the probability cutoff you use when you apply the model in practice to make a decision. Logistic regression results can be expressed in terms of the probability of class membership. I take your terminology $h(x) = 0.6$ to mean that your model $h$ predicts that case $x$ has probability of 0.6 of belonging to Class 1. That's the probability estimate from the model. It has nothing to do directly with a probability cutoff. When you apply the probability model, practical considerations come into play. Say that false-positive decisions about membership in Class 1 cost more than do false-negative decisions. Then you would want to avoid a decision that places a true Class 0 case into Class 1. Using a high probability cutoff like 0.8 to make assignments of class membership for your purpose would accomplish that. So if a case has $h(x) = 0.6$ that still means it has a 60% chance of actually being in Class 1. You just will have made a decision not to assign it to Class 1 for your purposes because you don't want to risk that it really is in Class 0.
