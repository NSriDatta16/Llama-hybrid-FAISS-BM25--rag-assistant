Why do neural networks need feature selection / engineering?

Particularly in the context of kaggle competitions I have noticed that model's performance is all about feature selection / engineering. While I can fully understand why that is in the case when dealing with the more conventional / old-school ML algorithms, I don't see why this would be the case when using deep neural networks. Citing the Deep Learning book: Deep learning solves this central problem in representation learning by introducing representations that are expressed in terms of other, simpler representations. Deep learning enables the computer to build complex concepts out of simpler concepts. Hence I always thought that if "information is in the data", a sufficiently deep, well-parameterised neural network would pick up the right features given sufficient training time.
