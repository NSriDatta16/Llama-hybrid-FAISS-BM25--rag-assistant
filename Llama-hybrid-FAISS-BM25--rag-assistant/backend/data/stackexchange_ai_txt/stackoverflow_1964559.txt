Android "hover" event in custom layout

I have a custom layout that I have written that basically just displays a bunch of ImageViews . I am handing onTouch events for all the ImageViews in my layout. However, if a user touches one imageView and then drags over another ImageView , I would like to be able to handle that as well. How would I go about capturing this behaviour?
