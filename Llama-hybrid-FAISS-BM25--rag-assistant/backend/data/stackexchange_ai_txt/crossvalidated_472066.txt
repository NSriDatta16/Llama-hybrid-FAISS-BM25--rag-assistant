Bayesian AB Test Prior Distribution

I am trying to figure out the following issue - while using bayesian method for A/B testing and while comparing control to new variant (i know the control prior data but not the variant), can i use $Beta(a_1,b_1)$ with the historical data for the control ( $a_1$ - success of control) and $Beta(1,1)$ for the variant since there is no prior knowledge of it? How it would impact the sampling the posterior distribution? Or should both priors (control and variants) should use the same prior? thanks
