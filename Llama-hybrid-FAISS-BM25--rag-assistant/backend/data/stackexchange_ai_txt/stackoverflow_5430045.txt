T-SQL and PL/SQL are two completely different programming languages with different syntax, type system, variable declarations, built-in functions and procedures, and programming capabilities.

(In Oracle Forms, PL/SQL is even used for client-side code, though integration with database-stored PL/SQL is (almost) seemless)
