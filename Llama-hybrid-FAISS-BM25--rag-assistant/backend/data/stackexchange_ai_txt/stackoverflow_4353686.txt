After making a change like that to the database, even if successful, you would need to rebuild the images cache in Cache Management. You might be able to do it with a script like this and not worry about caching or indexing. getCollection()->addAttributeToSelect('*'); foreach ($products as $product) { if (!$product->hasImage()) continue; if (!$product->hasSmallImage()) $product->setSmallImage($product->getImage()); if (!$product->hasThumbnail()) $product->setThumbnail($product->getImage()); $product->save(); } ?>Done! Save this in your Magento directory and access it by typing the URL into your browser's address bar. I haven't tested this script yet.
