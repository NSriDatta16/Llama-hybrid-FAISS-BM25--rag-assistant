Fit mixture of distributions to your time-series data in R

I have time-series data containing 1440 observations and the plot of the data is I want to fit the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to the above plot, and for the same I am using Mclust function of mclust package. Finally, I want a fit somewhat like this: On using Mclust function, I do get following statistics mclus_data summary(mclus_data) ---------------------------------------------------- Gaussian finite mixture model fitted by EM algorithm ---------------------------------------------------- Mclust E (univariate, equal variance) model with 8 components: log.likelihood n df BIC ICL 9525.438 1440 16 18934.52 18183.67 Clustering table: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1262 0 0 0 0 13 114 51 In the above statistic, I can not understand following: Significance of log.likelihood , BIC and ICL . I can understand what each of them is, but what their magnitude/value refers to? It shows there are 8 clusters, but why cluster no. 2,3,4,5 has 0 values? What does this mean? From the plot it is clear that there must be two Guassians, but why Mclust function shows there are 8 Guassians? Update: Actually, I want to do model based clustering of time series data. But currently I want to fit the distribution to my raw data, as shown in Figure 1 on page no. 3 of this paper. For your quick reference, mentioned figure in said paper is
