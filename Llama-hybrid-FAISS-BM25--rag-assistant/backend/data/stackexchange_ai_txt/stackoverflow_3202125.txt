Hide content based on URL string (PHP)

I've signed up to one of those affiliate sites to help drive traffic to my online store. They've asked that I hide the telephone number on my site for referring traffic. All traffic that they refer will append any of my site urls with something like '?affiliate'. Does anyone know how I can hide content on a page if a URL contains '?affiliate' but show it if the URL does not contain this text? I'm using the Magento system, in case that makes a difference. :D Thanks, Neil
