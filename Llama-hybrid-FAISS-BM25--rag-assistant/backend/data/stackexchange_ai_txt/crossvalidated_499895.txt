Evaluation of gene regulatory network

I am new to this forum and data science, I will try my best to describe my question. Question background: I am molecular biology student and have recently inferred a gene expression network using 105 RNASeq gene expression datasets related to a bacterium, CLR algorithm from Minet R package. This network has 1784 nodes and 9897 edges. Now I would like to evaluate the network and determine precision recall metrics. Minet package has validate function where one compares their network with a reference network. My question or problem: I do not have a reference network to compare my network to in order to evaluate my network. Could you please let me know if there is a straight forward software or R package to generate a synthetic network and to validate my network or if there are synthetic bacterial networks with at least 1784 nodes that I could use for this purpose. Finally, thank you very much and please let me know if I need to provide more information. Best, Ash PS: I am an amateur when it comes to using R or data science. Learning snew mething e
