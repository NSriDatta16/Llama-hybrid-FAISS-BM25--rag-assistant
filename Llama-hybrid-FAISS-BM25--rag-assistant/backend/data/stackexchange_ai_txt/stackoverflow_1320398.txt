If you are looking for an easy introduction to databases in C# you want to use LINQ and a data context. Simply add a "Data Context" to your project. Double click the file to open the designer for the LINQ data context. Open the "Server Explorer" in visual studio (under View) and connect to your SQL Server. Using that you can drag and drop your tables onto the LINQ designer in visual studio. Jump on google and have a look at using linq with a context to do work on your DB. I'll jump in here with LINQ to say that it encourages you to write better database code, that doesn't pull the whole dataset out in one go and operate on it, you defer queries and you can benefit greatly from the functional infrastructure they've built upon it. But this has a big learning curve, best way to do it is to try different kinds of code and see the ones that make sense to you.
