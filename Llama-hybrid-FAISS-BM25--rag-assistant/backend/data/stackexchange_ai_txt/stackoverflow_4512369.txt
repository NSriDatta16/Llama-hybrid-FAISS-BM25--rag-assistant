Google Maps API using jQuery Plugin: How to get a marker's latitude and longitude on click?

I am using a plugin for Google Maps API V3. I use it to put a marker on the map and allow the user to drag the marker to a spot on the map. I want to get the lat,lng of the marker on click. goMap Plugin Page: http://www.pittss.lv/jquery/gomap/index.php This function that sets up the marker in the first place. $("#map").goMap({ zoom: 16, maptype: 'ROADMAP', navigationControl: false, mapTypeControl: false, scrollwheel: true, disableDoubleClickZoom: false, markers: [{ draggable:true, latitude: data.lat, longitude: data.lng, icon:'./images/pink.png' }] }); I tried calling the native getLat() method on goMap(), but I don't think I was doing that right. Any help is much appreciated.
