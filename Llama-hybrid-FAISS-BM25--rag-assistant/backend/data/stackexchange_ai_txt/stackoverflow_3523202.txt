Well, it looks like StructureMap has decent docs: http://structuremap.github.com/structuremap/index.html . Also I expect Unity to have pretty complete docs as it's an official MS release. What I can tell you for sure is that Ninject has pretty much no docs at all. Some basics are quickly covered in their GitHub's wiki, but that's pretty much it. It's sad that despite all the hype about it this part is still missing. Ninject is the container I started with first and it was frustrating to google things that could have been explained in a short paragraph. Truly, this is very discouraging if you have to deliver a project rather than be "wasting" time searching for some info on your container. It's my biggest complain about Ninject. Actually I'm thinking about switching to another container for a few reasons (the docs being one of them).
