It's the idea that the branch began branching off at that point. A branch is a set of versions that branch off the main trunk at some point, and maintain their own independent development (which may of course be closely coordinated). It isn't a set of changes that will be automatically applied to later versions. It's not a tag in the usual sense: if you check out according to a tag, you'll get a snapshot of the source tree at the time the tag was made, while the results of checking out according to a branch will vary over time, as changes are made to the branch. It is similar to a tag, and does work in much the same way; CVS uses the old RCS file format, and uses RCS tags both for branches and CVS tags. There's several good references for CVS. Read up on tags and branches.
