Retention period in SQL Server 2008 Change Tracking

I'm a little worried about the default retention period in SQL Server 2008 Change Tracking (which is 2 days). Is it a good idea to set this period to eg. 100 years and turn auto cleanup off or will it bite me back in the future with excessive storage usage and/or performance degradation? Anyone has experience in that matter?
