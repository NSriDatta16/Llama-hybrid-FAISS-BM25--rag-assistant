The reason people do cross-validation is that there is no mathematical formula to accurately get at the same thing except under very restrictive conditions. And note that k-fold cross-validation does not have adequate precision in most cases, so you have to repeat k-fold cross-validation often 50-100 times (and average the performance metric) to get accurate, precise estimates of model performance. There is certainly no mathematical formula for that.
