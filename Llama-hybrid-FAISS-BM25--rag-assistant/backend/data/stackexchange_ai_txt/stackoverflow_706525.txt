Message Driven Bean Selectors (JMS)

I have recently discovered message selectors @ActivationConfigProperty( propertyName="messageSelector", propertyValue="Fragile IS TRUE") My Question is: How can I make the selector dynamic at runtime? Lets say a consumer decided they wanted only messages with the property "Fragile IS FALSE" Could the consumer change the selector somehow without redeploying the MDB? Note: I am using Glassfish v2.1
