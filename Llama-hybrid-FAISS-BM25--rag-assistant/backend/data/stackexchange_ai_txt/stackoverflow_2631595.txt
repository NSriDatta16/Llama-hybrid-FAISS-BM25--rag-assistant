Your examples just seem to be composed of a lot of nice images. Your first example looks pretty static and could probably be made from buttons with custom images and setting lots of backgrounds on your layout items. The second looks like you would need to make a custom Gallery and do a little more manipulation and composition of images so it might be worth your time to go a little lower level for performance. Basically, you're looking at using a lot of images. You can make them work with existing widgets and components and get the functionality more easily, or you can use OpenGL ect. To get some more flexibility and performance at the cost of having to code all the functionality in yourself. If you're looking at drag and drop this post points to the source for a ListView with some rudimentary drag and drop functionality.
