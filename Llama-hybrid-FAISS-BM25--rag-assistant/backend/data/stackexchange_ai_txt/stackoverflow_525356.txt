It really depends on what you want to do. If you just need basic DOM manipulation, even handling, and things like that, then use jquery.js. If you need advanced UI components and functionality (dragging and dropping, sorting, etc.) then you'll probably need jquery.ui.js. EDIT My mistake on misreading the question. Yes, you need jquery.js for jquery.ui.js
