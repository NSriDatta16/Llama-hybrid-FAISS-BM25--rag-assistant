A simpler way to code multiple MKAnnotations?

This code is from the MapCallouts demo. Say I had hundreds of different annotations. The way that Apple has done it, it would result in a lot of code duplication. I want to access the annotation properties of the instance of the class that triggered the delegate, no matter which class instance triggered it. Is there a simpler way than writing if statements to handle each annotation and have one universal method? - (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)theMapView viewForAnnotation:(id )annotation { // if it's the user location, just return nil. if ([annotation isKindOfClass:[MKUserLocation class]]) return nil; // handle our two custom annotations // if ([annotation isKindOfClass:[BridgeAnnotation class]]) // for Golden Gate Bridge { //do something } else if ([annotation isKindOfClass:[SFAnnotation class]]) // for City of San Francisco { //do something } return nil; }
