Could you solve this by generating a unique ID before inserting the new row and then adding this ID into each record? This would enable you to identify both records after they're created. I'd also be asking why you need this functionality. You're adding records into 2 different tables when a file is copied into a folder. Obviously, I have no idea what the solution is, so I can't advise one way or another. My advice at this point however, would be to re-consider putting the logic of organising FileMaker data in your ODBC process. It sounds like the original record is supposed to act as a marker or trigger. Can the ODBC process be left as just a mechanism to create a record and the logic of how that record is used be left to another process, say a FM script?
