How do you install files in the assembly in Windows Server 2008?

Typically what I used to do is drag and drop the files onto the GAC folder. This works in Windows 2000 & 2003, however when I try to do this in Windows Server 2008 I get 'Access is denied'. The user that is doing this is a local administrator. The only reference I can find to this is: Forum link Is there another way to achieve this? Note: I tried running explorer as the administrator, but I get the same error. Edit: Ideally whatever solution there is should not turn off UAC, or install any software development kit. (So it can be applied to production servers). Edit: Does anyone have anymore thoughts on this? I've currently on gone with disabling UAC in dev, however this is unacceptable in live.
