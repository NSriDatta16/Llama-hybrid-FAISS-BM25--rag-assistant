To answer your basic question 0.0.0.0 is not equivalent to null . Your test should be: if (Data.AgentVersion == null || Data.AgentVersion.Equals("0.0.0.0") assuming Data.AgentVersion is a string. You might want to implement something along the same lines as String.IsNullOrEmpty which you can call where ever you need to do this test.
