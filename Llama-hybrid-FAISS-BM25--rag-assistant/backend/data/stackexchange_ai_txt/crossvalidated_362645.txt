Partially answered in comments: You can check whether predictions is valid or not by Cross Validation , for example. But I didn't get your point about Q2: why do you need to reduce the effect of a good predictor? In most practical cases that would mean that you reduce classification quality? â€“ Dmitry Laptev You should still check if the predictor is legitimate, could it be that it is almost a version of the $Y$ variable? Another possibility is that there is (quasi)separation, which isn't a problem per se if the strong predictor is correct, but might be a problem if the goal is inference and not (only) prediction, since it invalidates the usual approximations. See How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression?
