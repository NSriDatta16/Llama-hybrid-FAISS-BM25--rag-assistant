How can I do tree_method ='exact' in XGBoost classifier?

I am doing XGBoost classification on a huge data set and its showing: Tree method is automatically selected to be 'approx' for faster speed. to use old behavior(exact greedy algorithm on single machine), set tree_method to 'exact' How can I shift it to be exact? I have tried clf = xgb(tree_method='exact') and it returned error!
