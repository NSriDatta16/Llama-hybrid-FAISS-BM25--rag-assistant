A probability question with and without information about distribution

Employees of company XYZ travel an average of 28 km per day to the office, with a standard deviation of 8 km. Assuming a normal distribution of miles traveled, determine the percentage of employees who travel between 20 and 36 km per day. Explain what conclusions you might draw in the absence of information on the distribution. Try The phenomenon is a normal distribution: $X \thicksim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ . The values of the population are $\mu = 28$ and $\sigma = 8$ . The probability of the event $\{20 has calculated as follow: $$ P(20 $$ = \Phi(1) - \Phi(-1) = \Phi(1) - [1 - \Phi(1)] = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826 $$ The point is that I wouldn't know what conclusions to draw in the absence of distribution information, that is, without saying that $X$ followed a probability distribution. How can I write it down? Do you have any advice for me? Thank you. Update About the second point of the exercise, I should use the Chebyshev's inequality. But I notice that the multiple of the standard deviation is $k=1$ . Besides, the ratio $1 - 1/k^2$ it would be null. How should I proceed? Should I calculate the probability according to the formula?
