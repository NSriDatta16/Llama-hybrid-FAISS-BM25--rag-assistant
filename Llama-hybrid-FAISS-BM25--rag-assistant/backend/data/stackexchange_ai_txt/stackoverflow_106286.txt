If you want some space around an element, give it a margin. That means, in this case, don't just give the a bottom margin, but give a top margin. Remember, when two elements are vertically adjacent and they don't have a border or padding between them, their margins collapse. That means that only the larger of the two margins is considered - they don't add together. So this: h1, p { margin: 1em; } ... ... ...would result in a 1em space between the heading and the paragraph.
