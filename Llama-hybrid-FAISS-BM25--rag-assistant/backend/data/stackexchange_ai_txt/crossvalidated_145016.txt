I tried to reduce the dimensions of the input layer by using a different feature vector. This helped. When the input layer has a large number of neurons then the Neural Network requires a larger number of instances to train and find the best combinations of weights. When I reduce the number of neurons in the input layer then the number the weights that needs to be updated decreases too thus the NN converges.
