Cocoa Touch: Displaying a structured document

I'm fairly new to Cocoa and am having trouble Googling for the best way to design my iPhone app. This app is for viewing a stageplay. It should pretty print the script such that character headings are centered and in small caps, say, and stage directions are in italics etc. It should also allow one character's lines to be highlighted (i.e. dynamic formatting). Looking at this question it looks like NSTextView / NSTextStorage will provide the formatting requirements I want, I'm just confused as to how to construct the view from the underlying data. I'm thinking at the moment my source will be XML in the following form: Hello Sue! He moves to the table Hello Bob! Which would output something similar to the following: BOB Hello Sue! He moves to the table SUE Hello Bob! How do I go from a document model (XML / CoreData / ...) to a view containing pretty formatted text? Any advice or pointers would be great; I just can't get my head around this problem!
