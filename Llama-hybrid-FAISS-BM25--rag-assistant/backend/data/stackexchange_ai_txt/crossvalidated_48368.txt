If by quantifying the overlap you're simply looking to quantify how much red area is away from the blue area, you could treat your two time series and calculate the Manhattan distance between them. This is essentially the sum of the absolute value of the differences between each point. (You may also be interested in other distances , perhaps the Chebyshev distance , which will certainly be interesting if you want to measure the peak differences.) The example you're giving is jumping quite a lot (it looks like perfect noise). It's not clear whether actual experimental data would present such variations. It may be interesting to consider applying a moving average transformation first, although this will have a significant impact on the distances results. If the phenomena are somewhat meant to be repeating themselves, it might be worth considering using signal processing techniques. In particular, you could compute an FFT on both time series and compare their resulting spectra. For example, comparing the first "bin" (the "DC component") should indicate how centered they are with each other. Using distances comparisons between each spectrum should also be an interesting comparison tool, possibly more relevant than doing this in the time domain. How to interpret this will certainly depend on the actual nature of the problem.
