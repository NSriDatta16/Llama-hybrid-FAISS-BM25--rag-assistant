How to apply Principal components (Eigenvectors) in PCA?

I struggle to understand how to get further in my PCA analysis after computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. I choose the number of principal components which contain 95% of the information and reduced the number of dimensions from 168 to 8. But now I end up with 8 eigenvectors. How do I use these? I don't know how to continue from this point.
