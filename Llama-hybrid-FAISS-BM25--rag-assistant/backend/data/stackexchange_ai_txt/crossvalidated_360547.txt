Do we need to average all predictions from neural network or other learners?

When neural network is ran multiple times to get N predictions, do we need to average all of them, including runs with bad validation scores or early stopping triggered too soon? One theoretical reason to exclude is bad weight initialization, therefore bad runs are not from the same distribution. Is this good enough reason to exclude bad runs?
