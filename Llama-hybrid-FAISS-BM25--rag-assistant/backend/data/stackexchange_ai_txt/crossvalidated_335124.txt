Problem on the stability of discrete-time Markov chains

There is a system which follows the equation: X(n+1) = X(n) - 1 + A(n), where A(n) is a random variable taking values 0,1,2 with probabilities po,p1 and p2, respectively. Now, X(n) = n and X(n)>=1 are two provided conditions. I need to find the relation between po,p1 and p2 which ensures stability of the Markov Chain. Answer is po>p2, but I can't figure out the way to proceed. My progress: I tried to derive the steady state matrix, but am not getting po>p2 as the answer. In fact, I don't understand how an inequality like this can be obtained.
