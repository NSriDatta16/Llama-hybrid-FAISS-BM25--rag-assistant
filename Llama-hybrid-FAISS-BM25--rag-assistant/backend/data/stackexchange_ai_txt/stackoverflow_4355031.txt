You should probably modify your query to return the data in two columns, tag and count . Without seeing your query, I can't tell you how to do this. You could also change the organization of your tags without modifying the query: // Build a tag => count mapping $tags = arrya(); foreach ($db['products'] as $product) { if (array_key_exists($product['tag'], $tags)) $tags[$product['tag']] += 1; else $tags[$product['tag']] = 1; } // Display the tags with their counts foreach ($tags as $tag => $count) { echo " $tag($count) "; }
