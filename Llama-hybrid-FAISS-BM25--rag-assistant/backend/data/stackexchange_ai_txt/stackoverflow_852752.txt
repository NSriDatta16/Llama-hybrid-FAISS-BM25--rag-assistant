How to know when a new USB storage device is connected in Qt?

I want to know when a USB device is connected to the computer that my Qt application is running on (in Windows). In my main QWidget, I've reimplemented winEventFilter like this: bool winEventFilter ( MSG * msg, long * result ) { qDebug() I'd expect qDebug to send at least something when I connect a USB device, but I don't get anything. I'm guessing that I'm fundamentally misunderstanding the process here - this is my first Qt app!
