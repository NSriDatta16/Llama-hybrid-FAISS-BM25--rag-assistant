I don't think there is a problem with negative $\omega$. The conditional variance equation of the EGARCH model as used in "rugarch" is* $$ \sigma_t^2 = \exp (\omega+\dotsc). $$ If we neglect the terms in $\dotsc$ for the moment, we have $\omega Negative $\omega$ values are also encountered in applications, see e.g. Chen & Kuan (2002) , Table IX. *Note that this is not the only possible definition of the EGARCH model; see e.g. Tsay (2010, 3rd ed.) section 3.8 and 3.8.1.
