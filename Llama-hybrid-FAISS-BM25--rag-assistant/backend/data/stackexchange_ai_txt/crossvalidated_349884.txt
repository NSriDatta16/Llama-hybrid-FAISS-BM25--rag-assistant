The most important question here is: why does the data have this imbalance. If the imbalance reflects the base rate* of your classes, you should go with the imbalanced data. Resampling to rebalance the data should IMHO be avoided unless you positively know the proper base rates and resample to get there . But applications with equal base rates are very rare in my experience. So if you know the base rates should be equal but your data doesn't reflect this, go ahead and rebalance. Training and validating on equal base rates will often yield a model with seemingly nice performance - which however often breaks down if evaluated for the real (imbalanced) base rates. As you already noticed, plain acuracy may not be the best figure of merit for unbalanced classes, and the naive model to compare your performance to is not 50:50 random guessing but "always predict 0" with 98 % accuracy. have a look at your misclassification costs: is missing a positive worse than a false positive? and adjust your loss function accordingly. Consider only figures of merit that properly take into account class base rates (or are independent of class base rate). Classifiers that take class imbalance "naturally" are obviously better suited. However, this is often a question of implementation than of the general capability of the classifier in question. If you cannot "tell" your SVM implementation about base rates and misclassification costs, but it can return a continuous score (e.g. predicted class membership probability) you can request that score and then choose your working point (cutoff score) yourself. E.g. you can choose the cutoff so that the number of false positives = number of false negatives (times factor for respective costs). Seeing that you have only 98 positive examples, consider resampling validation (stratified cross valiation or out-of-bootstrap) rather than hold out. * base rate or prior probability: the fraction of cases truly belonging to the class in question in the relevant population (which is not necessarily the same in the sample at hand). "Balanced situation" typically refers to all classes having equal prior probability (or base rate) of $\frac{1}{nclasses}$, so 50:50 in case of 2 classes.
