You really want to take a look at TreeMap . Assuming the counts are unique, you simply reverse the tuples, storing the count as the key and the name of the fruit as the value. TreeMap then stores the items sorted in ascending order by the key value, and you can read the values back. Since the sorting is done on the insertion the retrieval time is very low. If you have non-unique counts there's an easy solution here that will let you take advantage of TreeMap.
