I think you are misunderstanding session_start() What happens with session_start is, yes, it will create a file for the individual user. But the next time you call session_start(), it is going to use that same file for that same user because the user has a cookie on their system that tells it what ID to use. In order to have the $_SESSION array available, you must call session_start() on every page. It is very possible that someone could whip up a scenario like you just described. In reality, yes, a hacker could always have a robot that clears its cookies after every attempt, make 10,000 requests, and possibly create a disk writing problem, but I really wouldn't worry about it too much, because the files are tiny, much smaller than the script you are writing. You'd have to write a lot more files (on the size of millions or billions) to actually create a problem. If you really want to see what the effects would be on your server. Write a script that creates files in a directory with the equivalent of 2 paragraphs of text. and put it in a loop for 10,000 files. If you are then worried about the affects it would have, I suggest implementing a tracker that can see an large amount of hits coming to the site from a single IP address and then either temporarily ban the IP address, or do what Google does and just provide them with a static captcha page that doesn't take many resources to serve. So, going back to the actual 'question': I set a session for every single user that ever visits my site, because I use sessions for not only User Authentication, but for tracking other variables on my site. So, I believe that you should set it even if they aren't logged in.
