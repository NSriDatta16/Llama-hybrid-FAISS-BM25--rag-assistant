Machine Learning Model To predict game outcome During the game

I'm trying to build a ML model to predict sports (tennis, soccer, basketball, football). I would like to have two models : model A to do the pre-game prediction (given historical matches data, injury data, weather, places, player ages, etc) to predict a game before the game starts. Second model B to predict the game during the game (for tennis, given previous states to predict the next round; for soccer given previous 10 minutes to predict the next minutes or final game outcome). However, I'm quite stuck on the second model; I don't know where to start; where do I get the during-game data? How should my Model B looks like; what algorithm would be good? what kind of in-game feature should I consider ? etc any suggestions (a link with relevant papers would be awesome.)
