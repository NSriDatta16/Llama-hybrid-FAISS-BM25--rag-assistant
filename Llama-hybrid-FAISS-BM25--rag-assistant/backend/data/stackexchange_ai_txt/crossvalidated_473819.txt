How would I assess goodness-of-fit considering single participants?

I am designing a psychology experiment which is designed to look at the proportion of different types of errors people make. There will be four response categories: correct; incorrect [type 1; type 2; type 3]. Ignoring the correct category, one could then compare expected versus observed error proportions (or counts) for each response category using some goodness-of-fit test, like a chi-square test. However, I don't believe it would be statistically valid can create mean proportions (or counts) across participants and assess GoF using this data, as you might do in an ANOVA. Normally, each participant provides their own single datapoint for a cell. But in my proposed design, I would be conducting one chi-square test on the expected versus observed proportions (or counts) for each subject. Is there a more elegant way of conducting such an analysis? A single model goodness-of-fit test that accounts for the data for individual participants? How would this be implemented in, say, R?
