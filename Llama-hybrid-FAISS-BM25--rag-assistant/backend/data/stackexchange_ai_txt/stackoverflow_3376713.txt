The following might be helpful: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.mule.user/29342 I can't find any examples either, but it looks like the built-in HTTP transformers are http-response-to-object-transformer A transformer that converts an HTTP response to a Mule Message. The payload may be a String, stream, or byte array. http-response-to-string-transformer Converts an HTTP response payload into a string. The headers of the response will be preserved on the message. object-to-http-request-transformer This transformer will create a valid HTTP request using the current message and any HTTP headers set on the current message. message-to-http-response-transformer This transformer will create a valid HTTP response using the current message and any HTTP headers set on the current message. object-to-http-request-transformer might be your best bet; perhaps you can create a map of key-value pairs and then convert that into URL encoded form? Not sure but hopefully this gives you some things to Google.
