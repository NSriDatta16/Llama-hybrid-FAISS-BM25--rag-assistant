You do need reference hardware (i.e., a reference mic) to calculate noise level (dB SPL, or sound pressure level). One thing Radio Shack sells is a $50 dB SPL meter. If you're doing scientific calculations, I wouldn't use it. But if the goal is to get a general idea of a weighted measurement (dBA or dBC) of the sound pressure in a given environment, then it might be useful. As a sound engineer, I use mine all the time to see how much sound volume I'm generating while I mix. It's usually accurate to within 2 dB. That's my answer. The rest is FYI stuff. Jorg is correct that dB SPL is a relative measurement. All decibel measurements are. But you've implied a reference of 0 dB SPL, or 20 micropascals, scientifically agreed to be the most quiet sound a human ear can detect (though, understandably, what a person can actually hear is very difficult to determine). This, according to Wikipedia, is about the sound of a flying mosquito from about 10 feet away ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel ). By assuming you don't understand decibels, I think Jorg is just trying to out-geek you. He clearly didn't give you a practical answer. :-) Unweighted measurements (dB, instead of dBA or dBC) are rarely used, because most sound pressure is not detected by the human ear. In a given office environment, there is usually 80-100 dB SPL (sound pressure level). To give you an idea of exactly how much is not heard, in the U.S., occupational regulations limit noise exposure to 80 dBA for a given 8-hour work shift (80 dBA is about the background noise level of your average downtown street - difficult, but not impossible to talk over). 85 dBA is oppressive, and at 90, most people are trying to get away. So the difference between 80 dB and 80 dBA is very significant -- 80 dBA is difficult to talk over, and 80 dB is quite peaceful. :-) So what is 'A' weighting? 'A' weighting compensates for the fact that we don't perceive lower frequency sounds as well as high frequency sounds (we hear 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz). There's a lot of low-end rumble that our ears/brains pretty much ignore. In addition, we're more sensitive to a certain midrange (1000 Hz to 4000 Hz). Most agree that this frequency range contains the sounds of consonants of speech (vowels happen at a much lower frequency). Imagine talking with just vowels. You can't understand anything. Thus, the ability of a human to be able to communicate (conventionally) rests in the 1kHz-5kHz bump in hearing sensitivity. Interestingly, this is why most telephone systems only transmit 300 Hz to 3000 Hz. It was determined that this was the minimal response needed to understand the voice on the other end. But I think that's more than you wanted to know. Hope it helps. :-)
