You can start trying EMC (free) at http://www.linuxcnc.org/ Just a few comments: CNC is a generical name for computer controlled machines (the "N" comes from Numerical) There are several standards (as always) for the language, perhaps the most used is ISO 6983. However you'll find out quickly that each machine implementation is different. There are also relatively cheap machines (under $1000) that you can buy or DIY to effectively run your programs and make "real" things. See for example http://buildyourcnc.com/default.aspx or http://wiki.makerbot.com/cupcake . You'll not catch up the quirks of the trade until you can run your programs in a real lathe or mill. CAD and CAM programs from the programmer's POV can be thought as visual CASE tools.
