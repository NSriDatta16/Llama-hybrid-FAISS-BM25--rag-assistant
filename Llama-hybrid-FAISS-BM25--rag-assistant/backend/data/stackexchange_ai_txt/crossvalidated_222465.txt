Statistical signifiance between two related populations

I have the mean of the number of people below the poverty line for census tracts for the entire state of Washington and also for census tracts of selected counties within Washington. The means come from the same sample/population. One mean comes from the average number of impoverished people in a subset of counties from Washington. The other mean comes from the average number of impoverished people the entire state of Washington. Which method do I use to test for the statistical significance between the two means? A simplified data of my real data is in the following: All counties in Washington (each observation is the number of impoverished people within each census tract): 303 372 1516 813 1344 476 300 572 471 978 513 303 315 1315 Selected counties in Washington (again, each observation is the number of impoverished people within each census tract): 351 1137 1819 564 1014 Thank you! Sincerely, Lois
