CSS layout problems, floats, nested divs

Alright, I have received some helpful information on this personal site I am working on already. Somewhere in my jumbled mess of nested divs I have created some problems for myself. I have floated both that image and the text next to it inside another div and centered that div, which is fine. But in order to start a new paragraph below it, I must put that paragraph within a div because the floats above it need to be cleared(or it displays the text in that right margin next to the div). I am sure there is an easier way of doing what I want to do. If someone might be able to take a look at my code and see where I am going wrong structure wise it would be a great help...thanks a lot. As you can see, there heading that says "Recent Work" is being centered like it is supposed to but it is not being given the usually margin from that box above it.
