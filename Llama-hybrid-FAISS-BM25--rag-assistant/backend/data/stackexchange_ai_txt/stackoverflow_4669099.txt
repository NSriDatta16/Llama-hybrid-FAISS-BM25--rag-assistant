how to get payment information on Magento?

I have to export the orders to a file, here is my code to go through the orders: $orders = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSelect(array('status', 'ncm')) ->addFieldToFilter( array( array('attribute' => 'status', 'eq' => 'complete') ) ); $order = $orders->getFirstItem(); //print_r($order); //exit; //foreach($orders as $order){ $id = $order->getIncrementId(); $payment = $order->getPayment(); $method = $payment->getMethodInstance(); print_r($payment); //} I need to print some information about the payment like the method, the amount, how many months it was split, if was credit card, i need the reutrning id of the transaction and so the list goes on how can I do that?
