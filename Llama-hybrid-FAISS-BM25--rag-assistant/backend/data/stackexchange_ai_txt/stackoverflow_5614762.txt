.NET double rendered differently when shown in TextBox or Label (WPF)

When the least significant values of a double are non-zero, it gets rendered with different precision depending on which control is showing it. In my case, I tried using a TextBox and a Label. ToString seems to give the same result than a TextBox. However, a Label control shows more precision. Here's an example (just drag the thumb to see what I mean): Value Value Why is used a different way to render doubles in each control? What can I do to render doubles in a Label just as they are rendered in a TextBox?
