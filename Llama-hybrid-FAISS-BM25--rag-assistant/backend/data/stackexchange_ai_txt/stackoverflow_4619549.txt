Have a look at this answer to a similar question . Basically you can just use the same views and just return different templates based on the user-agent. Also, if you structure your application logic so that it is broken up into different "apps" in django terms, then you can re-use them if you need different flows with similar components. Hopefully this gets you off and running. UPDATE: So lets say you have your main site http://www.mainsite.com/ which has it's own urls.py models.py and views.py that makes your functionality for the main site. Then you have http://www.m.mainsite.com/ which has it's own set of urls, and views. Then you can just import the main site's models and use them in the mobile sites views.
