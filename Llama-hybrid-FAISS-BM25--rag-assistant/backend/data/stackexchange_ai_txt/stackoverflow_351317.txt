It can be done, but I believe that the only way is through the following monstrosity (assuming your time interval column name is "ti"): select to_char(floor(extract(epoch from ti)/3600),'FM00') || ':' || to_char(floor(cast(extract(epoch from ti) as integer) % 3600 / 60), 'FM00') || ':' || to_char(cast(extract(epoch from ti) as integer) % 60,'FM00') as hourstamp from whatever; See? I told you it was horrible :) It would have been nice to think that select to_char(ti,'HH24:MI:SS') as hourstamp from t would worked, but alas, the HH24 format doesn't "absorb" the overflow beyond 24. The above comes (reconstructed from memory) from some code I once wrote. To avoid offending those of delicate constitution, I encapsulated the above shenanigans in a view...
