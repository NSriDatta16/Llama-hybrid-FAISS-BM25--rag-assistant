Lua Syntax Highlighting in Java

I'm using Java Swing to develop an application and I want to use Lua as an embedded scripting language. For that I need to create a text component that would provide syntax highlighting and automatically organize the code by adding tabs and so on. Is there a library or resource that I could use in order to achieve this? Here is an example of what I want to do: http://openendedgroup.com/field/attachment/wiki/OverviewBanners2/p2.png Thanks,
