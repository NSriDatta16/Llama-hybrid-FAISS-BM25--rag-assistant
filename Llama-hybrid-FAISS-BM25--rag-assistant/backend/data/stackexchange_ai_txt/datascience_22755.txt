Stratified Sampling for XGboost

I have a multiclass-classification dataset with the target (dependent) variable highly imbalanced. While using the randomForest package in R, I usually use the parameters sampsize & strata to account for the imbalance in training data. Are there any similar options in xgboost package also? Summary of the number of datapoints available in each class. Factor 1 : 667 Factor 2 : 676 Factor 3 :7807 Factor 4 : 850
