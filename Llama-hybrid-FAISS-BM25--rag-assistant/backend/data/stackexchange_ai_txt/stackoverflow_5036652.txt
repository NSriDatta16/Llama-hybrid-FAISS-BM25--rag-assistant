One way to achieve this is to set an empty hash in your application.rb file: MY_VARS = {} Then you can add whatever you want in this hash which is accessible everywhere. MY_VARS[:foo] = "bar" and elsewhere: MY_VARS[:foo] As you felt, this is not the Rails way to behave, even if it works. There are different ways to use caching in Rails: simple cache in memory explained here : Rails.cache.read("city") # => nil Rails.cache.write("city", "Duckburgh") Rails.cache.read("city") # => "Duckburgh" use of a real engine like memcached I encourage you to have a look at http://railslab.newrelic.com/scaling-rails This is THE place to learn caching in all it's shapes.
