Why we shouldn't be obsessed with unbiasedness

In my Bayesian statistics class, my professor makes the remark that we should not be obsessed with unbiased estimator. First: I understand this statement in the sense of trading biasedness for smaller variance, i.e. "good" estimator = estimator with smallest Mean Squared Error (MSE). This idea is seen among Frequentists also. But second, and the confusing part: My professor then said something about an unbiased estimator is picking up noise and not signal. Since most of the observed data are just noise, we want to shrink our estimate to 0. I do not quite understand what is noise and signal: 1) Don't all data points come from the same distribution, with the difference due only to sampling variation? 2) Why can't unbiased estimator (say, sample mean of a normal model) differentiate noise and signal? If it can't, what sort of estimator can? An example would be great, and a social science example would be best!
