Feature selection is a more relevant process when there are large number of features (in the order of 1000's) with correlations betweent them and some being irrelevant as well. Here in this case, as the dataset has only 14 features, and already it is a standard dataset with relevant features. More than feature selection, feature importance is more important scenario here. For this one can use algorithms such as Random forests. In your examples, it shows that feature selection is not working as seen from the results. If you are to use feature selection, then PCA or l1 based selection might work better.
