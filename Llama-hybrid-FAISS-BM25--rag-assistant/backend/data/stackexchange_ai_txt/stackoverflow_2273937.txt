InnoDB not supported by webhost. What now?

I was developing a small WAMP web application on my laptop, where I have an instance of mySQL running and I chose InnoDB for my DB engine. After several weeks' development I wanted to make it available to the public and found out the database server provided by my web host does not support InnoDB, only MyISAM. The create-and-populate script generated from the innoDB schema on my laptop, when executed against the live database, can manage to create individual TABLES but then runs into problems creating the VIEWs. Are views not supported in MyISAM? I know FOREIGN KEYs are not. That's very much why I made the choice of InnoDB... What are my chances of making my innoDB schema design work with myISAM? Is there any straightforward way of converting the whole schema from one storage engine to the other? Should I look for another web host that does provide a mysql db that supports innoDB?
