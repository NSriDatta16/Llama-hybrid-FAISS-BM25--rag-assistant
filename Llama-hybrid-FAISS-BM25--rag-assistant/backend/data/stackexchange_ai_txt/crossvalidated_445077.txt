Calibration with or without temporal structure

Setup I have a sensor which measures some air property outside. It outputs values on a continuous range. The sensor is expensive, so I want to replace it with multiple cheap sensors, which may give less precise measurements. My goal is to create a statistical model to calibrate the cheap sensors to the output of the expensive sensor, which I define to be the 'correct' value. Map interpretation Based on this setup, I can view my goal as finding a map $f$ between the, say two, predictors $x_1$ and $x_2$ and the output $y$ . $$y \sim f(x_1,x_2)$$ Viewed in this way, I can construct scatterplots which indicate that, indeed, the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ contain information about $y$ . If, at some point in the future, I obtain a new value for both $x_1$ and $x_2$ , I can use my map $f$ to predict the value for $y$ . A straightforward value-to-value calibration. Time series interpretation The original measurements where taken over the course of some time period. Let's say one year. It turns out that there is a lot of temporal structure in both the $x$ 's and in $y$ . Now my goal can be restated as saying that I want to predict the entire sequence of $y(t)$ based on the entire sequences $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ . Note that I am not trying to forecast, or to extrapolate beyond this fixed time range. I just want to map sequence-to-sequence . Viewed as a time series, $x_1(t)$ includes seasonal variation. Both at a 24 hour frequency and over the course of the entire year. The time series of $x_2(t)$ does not show seasonality, but does have persistence. This means the values change slowly over time. Seasonality For each data point, I know the time of day and the day of year. So I may include seasonality in my model for $y$ . For example, I could add some periodic function $s(t)$ . As the time of day and the day of year provide additional information, this can help predict $y$ . Then my regression becomes $y \sim x1 + x2 + s(t)$ . Persistence Given that $y$ changes only slowly over time, I can exploit this. For example, I can use ARIMA -like terms for $x_2(t)$ . Then my regression becomes: $y \sim x_1(t) + x_2(t-1) + x_2(t) + x_2(t+1)$ . Philosophical Question My question is a purely philosophical one. My goal is to calibrate the cheap sensors so that they give the best approximation of the value of the expensive sensor. Adding temporal information to my prediction will likely give a better estimate of $y$ . However, does this count as calibration ? Time or season do not cause air quality, though they may correlate . Once the cheap sensors are calibrated, I will use them to gather more data. This data should approximate whatever the expensive sensor would have measured. So my aim is to make my statistical model generalisable . But which view leads to the most general model? The map view, discarding temporal information, or the time series view? I realise this is a weird question, but: what should I want? Further considerations Even if I exclude explicit temporal information, $x_1(t)$ includes seasonal variation, i.e. $x_1(t)$ and $s(t)$ correlate. So if I want to find $y \sim f(x_1,x_2)$ and not $y \sim f(x_1,x_2,t)$ by excluding $s(t)$ from my regression, wouldn't my regression simply extract the seasonal effect from $x_1(t)$ , giving me more-or-less the same prediction? I'm not even sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing? Code Although the code which generated the plots should be irrelevant, I include it here for completeness. Note that my question is not about code, nor implementation, nor mathematics. It's about philosophical considerations when hypothesizing a mechanism. set.seed(123) timemax
