@OP, i see you accepted the answer whereby your paragraph sentences are "hardcorded", so i assume those paragraphs are always the same? its that's true, you can use grep . Store the paragraph you want to get rid of in a file eg "filter", then use -f and -v option of grep to do the job, grep -v -f filter file
