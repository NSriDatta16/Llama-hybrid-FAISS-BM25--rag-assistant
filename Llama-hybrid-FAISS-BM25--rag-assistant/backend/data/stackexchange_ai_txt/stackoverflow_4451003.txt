Binning sequence reads by GC content

I would like to "bin" (split into separate files) a multi-fasta nucleotide sequence file (e.g. a Roche-454 run of ~500,000 reads average read length 250bp). I would like the bins based on GC content of each read. The resultant output would be 8 multi-fasta files: 21-30% GC content 31-40% GC content 41-50% GC content 51-60% GC content 61-70% GC content 71-80% GC content >80 % GC content Does anyone know of a script or program that does this already? If not can someone suggest how to sort the multi-fasta file based on GC content (that I can then split it down into the relevant bins)?
