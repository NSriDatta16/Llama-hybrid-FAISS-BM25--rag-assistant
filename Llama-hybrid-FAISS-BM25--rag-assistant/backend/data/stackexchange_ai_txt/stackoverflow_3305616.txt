function to generate 26 (A-Z) * 26 (A-Z) * 26 (A-Z)

I'd like to create a function which will generate a 3 char key string after each loop. There are 26 chars in the alphabet and I'd like to generate totally unique 3 char keys (A-Z). The output would be 17,576 unique 3 char keys (A-Z) - not case sensitive. Can anyone give me an idea on how to create a more elegant function without randomly generating keys and checking for duplicate keys? Is it possible Thank you.
