I'm not sure where you got that list of assumptions, but it is seriously wrong. 1. both independent and dependent variables need to be normally distributed 2. the model is linear 3. there is more observations than variables 4. homoascedasticity (variance is equal for all observations) 5. The residuals have normal distribution 6. None of the predictors are correlated is incorrect, neither the DV nor the IVs need to be normal. 3. Is correct but too limited; there should be a lot more observations (although exactly how many more is debated, some say 10 observations for every IV). 6. Is sort of right, but modest correlations are OK and what is problematic is not correlations but colinearity, which is not quite the same. You have also misinterpreted "linear" in this context it means linear in the parameters. In any case, with 8 levels I would do an ordinal logistic regression. It gives you different information that linear regression, but it's hard to say if it is more information or less information. As to the rest of your questions, I think they get too broad for this forum. A good book on ordinal logistic would help.
