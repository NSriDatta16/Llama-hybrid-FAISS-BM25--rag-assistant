Copy from QStringList to text file

How do I copy data from a Qstring list to a text file for later retrieval? Is it possible to do this in Qt? How to put a newline character into a text fiel using QFile I did like this QFile data("output.txt"); if (data.open(QFile::Append )) { QTextStream out(&data); out
