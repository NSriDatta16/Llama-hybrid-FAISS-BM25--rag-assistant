I run into this problem on a regular basis and often use the "add a method" solution. However, there are definitely cases where "add a method" or "compute it in the view" don't work (or don't work well). E.g. when you are caching template fragments and need some non-trivial DB computation to produce it. You don't want to do the DB work unless you need to, but you won't know if you need to until you are deep in the template logic. Some other possible solutions: Use the {% expr as %} template tag found at http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/9/ The expression is any legal Python expression with your template's Context as your local scope. Change your template processor. Jinja2 ( https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/ ) has syntax that is almost identical to the Django template language, but with full Python power available. It's also faster. You can do this wholesale, or you might limit its use to templates that you are working on, but use Django's "safer" templates for designer-maintained pages.
