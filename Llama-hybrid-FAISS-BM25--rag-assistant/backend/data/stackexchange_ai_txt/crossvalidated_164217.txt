What is the limiting distribution of the Bayesian Filtering

I've got a question about the iterative Bayesian filtering, the general form of which is shown as follows: $P(x|z_0,...z_{k+1})\propto P(z_{n+1}|x)P(x|z_0,...,z_k),\,k=0,1,\dots$. $P(x|z_0)=P_0(x)$ where $x$ is the hidden state, $z_i\, (i\in \mathbb{N})$ are evidences and $P_0(x)$ is the initial distribution of the state $x$. Suppose $z_1,\dots z_{n+1}$ are conditionally independent given $x$ from the $P(\bullet|x)$. Then when $n$ tends to infinity, will the posterior distribution $P(x|z_1,...z_{n+1})$ have a limiting distribution? If so, will the limiting distribution be irrelevant with the initial distribution $P_0(x)$? This seems to be related to the stationary distribution of Markov Chain (since the filtering process can be modeled as a HMM). But I have no idea how to prove it. Can anyone give any hints about the proof?
