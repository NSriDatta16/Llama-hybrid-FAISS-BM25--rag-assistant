Lambda Expression vs Functor in C++

I wonder where should we use lambda expression over functor in C++. To me, these two techniques are basically the same, even functor is more elegant and cleaner than lambda . For example, if I want to reuse my predicate, I have to copy the lambda part over and over. So when does lambda really come in to place?
