Guidance on time-series change point detection or identification of contributions

Let me preface this by saying that I am not a data scientist. Please excuse any imprecision in my use of subject specific terms or notations. Please feel free to edit my question, to improve any ambiguity. Plain English problem description: I am using an analogy to describe my problem, to keep to description comprehensible. Let's assume I measure the amount of water pouring out of a pipe. Lets also assume, the pipe is fed from multiple (hidden) sources where each contributes a set amount. Any individual source may be active or inactive at any given point in time. Depending on which sources are currently active, more or less water will pour out at the end. Given only the water output at the end, I am trying to identify: how many individual sources there are in total (that can contribute in theory) how much each individual source contributes if it is active which sources are active at a given point in time. Attempt to formalize the problem: I have a time-series dataset $X_t$ generated by a random process that is the addition of $N$ normal distributions ("sources"). $$X_t \sim \sum_{i}^{N}\textbf{1}_{i,t}\,\,\mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\,\sigma_i^{2})$$ where $\textbf{1}_{i,t} = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if source } i \text{ is active at time } t \\ 0 &\text{if source } i \text{ is not active at time } t \end{cases}$ Assumptions: At any point in time, typically only a small number of individual "sources" are active: $\sum_{i}^{N}\textbf{1}_{i,t} \ll N \quad \forall\,t$ The frequency of change of the activity of individual sources is small compared to the sampling frequency of $X_t$ . I.e. the value of $\textbf{1}_{i,t}$ does not change very often. $\mu_i \gg \sigma_i \quad \forall\,i$ Given the dataset $X_t = \{x_0, x_1, ..., x_t\}$ , I am trying to determine: How many sources $N$ have been active at one point or another in the dataset. I.e. determine the best estimate of the value of $N$ . For a given point in time $t$ , which of the sources were active at that point. (And what their individual $\mu_i$ are.) If this is a standard problem with a well known solution, could you please let me know its name to allow me to research it further? If this is not a well-known problem, could you provide some keywords to help guide my literature research? Of course recommendations for any papers or books or advice on a solution strategy would be much appreciated as well. Current solution strategy: At present my thought is that I could use a change point detection algorithm to segment the time series and go from there. But I am sure there are more suitable approaches. Am I with the keyword "gaussian process" on the right track here?
