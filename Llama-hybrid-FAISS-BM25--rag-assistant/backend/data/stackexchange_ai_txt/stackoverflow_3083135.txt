Your first problem is how to build a conceptual framework to hold all this information (NB: I'm not talking about the format of the data, but rather how you attach meaning to it). This is harder than it looks, but luckily there's been quite a bit of work done on this already (see Figure 1) so you don't need to start from a blank sheet of paper. Then you need to collect the information. Thankfully the client isn't too big so you might be able to succeed at that, but for large organizations it is often the case that they have no idea what the real dependencies between different pieces of their IT infrastructure really are. (They may well think that they know, and will persist with that illusion up until they change something and the law of unexpected consequences bites.) I wish I was able to recommend some products (free or commercial) that could help with this, but all I've really got is a mix of war-stories and lack of satisfaction. In particular, a lot of the more traditional tools for this sort of thing don't seem to cope well with virtualized servers. If there's something open-source for this sort of thing, I'd love to hear about it! Finally, you need to present the information. That's the easiest bit which most of the other answers here address. My only comment here is that the overall (conceptual) graph of information is probably going to be too complex to display in its entirety and remain understandable, so whatever you do you're going to be having to think about how to hide information so that only partial views are ever presented.
