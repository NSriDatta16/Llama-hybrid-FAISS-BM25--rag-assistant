Implementing a neural network is not really that technically challenging, especially if you are planning training them with a genetic algorithm instead of backpropagation or something. You can use this tutorial as a good starting place if you want to go that route. In general I find that until I have implemented an algorithm I will not understand the details that I glossed over while reading about the paper. If your purpose is to really understand neural networks, I would whole heatedly recommend that you implement it. Once you have something in place, go implement backpropagation. Add in momentum for better training times. Use the implementation as a learning experience. On the other hand, if you only want to run the algorithm on some data and see results, it is probably best to just take some off the shelf implementation and run with it. There are lots of packages in pretty much any language you want which can allow you to quickly get a neural network up and running. In short, whether you implement an algorithm or use an off the shelf package depends on whether you are trying to dive deep into the details of the algorithm or just want to tinker.
