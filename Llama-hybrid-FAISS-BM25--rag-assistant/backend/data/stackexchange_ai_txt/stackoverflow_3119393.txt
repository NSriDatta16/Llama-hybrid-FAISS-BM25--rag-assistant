How should I store ftp log on credentials in a MySQL database?

I'm really just looking for some guidance. Here is the scenario: A user can add an FTP account via a password protected control panel. I need to save these credentials so that the FTP account can be connected to automatically. This is easy but I want to take the most secure approach possible. I was thinking of possibly encrypting the password client-side and then sending the encrypted password to the server for storage. Then the encrypted value would be pulled out and decrypted client side before the FTP connection was made. I know that isn't too secure but it's all I can think of. Do you guys have any other bright ideas to make this more secure? Thanks!
