Role of Session in user authentication/login?

I was hoping someone could help me with a question I've come up on. I have a Session object that handles storage of general session data, I also have a Authentication object which validates a users credentials. Initially I passed the desired Authentication class name to my Session object then had a login method that created an instance of the Authentication object and validate the credentials. I stored the result of this validation in a Session variable and made it available via a getter. The user data was also stored in the Session for later use. In addition to all this, I have a logout method, which removes the user data from the Session and thus logging the user out. My question is what role should the Session object play in users logging into their account? And what other ways might one suggest I go about handling user login, as it stands right now I feel as though I'm getting too much wrapped up in my Session object.
