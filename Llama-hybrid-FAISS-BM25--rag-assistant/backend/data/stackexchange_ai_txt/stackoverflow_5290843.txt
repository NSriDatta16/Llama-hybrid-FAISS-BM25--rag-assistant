Project with high coverage sought

I was wondering if there is any project with high coverage requirement. To be more precisely, I'm looking for: Open Source Project, I need to access to the code Any class of software, e.g., library, operating system, gui Data on the coverage achieved. Here coverage can be meant as statement coverage, branch, MC/DC Any language I already have such an example. It is a free open source RTOS, RTEMS . Do you have any other examples? Thank you in advance.
