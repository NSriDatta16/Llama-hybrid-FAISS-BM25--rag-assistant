Bayesian linear regression is the same as linear regression. If you find the parameters of linear regression with maximum likelihood, the difference in the case of a Bayesian flavor is that it would also consider the priors. You are asking about uninformative priors, but there is no such a thing as "uninformative" prior . Every prior does affect the result, some just do this only slightly. The exception would be if you used constant, improper prior $p(\theta) \propto 1$ , that would not affect the result, and the Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimate would be equal to the maximum likelihood result. Your second question about the advantages of using a Bayesian model with uninformative priors is answered in the Why would someone use a Bayesian approach with a 'noninformative' improper prior instead of the classical approach? thread.
