Revert AR process with constant

I have got this task at the Time Series course as a part of Statistical minor. I am math major, and have gone through basic Probability (read:measure theory) course. Let us have $y_t = 0.4y_{t-1}+2+\epsilon_t$ This is AutoRegression process, and I am asked to find $E(y_t)$ and write the corresponding $MA(\infty)$ process (if it's possible). If the process was $y_t = 0.4*y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ then the mean would be 0 (I don't know why) and the corresponding $MA$ would be $y_t = \epsilon_t+0.4 \epsilon_{t-1} + 0.16 \epsilon_{t-2} ....$ . Is the corresponding MA correctly defined in this case? What is the definition of equivalent AR and MA processes, by the way? Here $y_t = 0.2y_{t-1}+3+e_t$ is written as $(1-0.2L)(y_t- 3.75) = e_t$ Why is it so? UPD ( because there is one more progression and $3 * {10 \over 8} = 3.75)$ After plugging the appropriate $y_{t-n}$ I get $y_t = (1+0.4L+0.16L^2...)e_t + 2*(1/(1-0.4))= (1+0.4L+0.16L^2...)e_t + {10 \over 3}$
