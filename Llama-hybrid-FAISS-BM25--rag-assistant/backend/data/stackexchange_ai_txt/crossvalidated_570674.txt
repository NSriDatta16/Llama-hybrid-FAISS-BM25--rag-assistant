Are there any way of removing impact of a certain data from a trained model (about "right to forget")

I was reading about wearable technologies ( Recent Advances in Wearable Sensing Technologies ). They briefly talk about Right to forget and a question came to my mind. Suppose that we trained a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) by using face images collected from 1000 participants (10 face images from each participant = 10x1000 images in sum). After training, participant 1 wanted to remove his/her face data from the model. Instead of re-train the model with 999 participants, are there any way of removing the impact of participant 1's data from the trained model? I made a quick search but I could not find it. Did you hear about something like that? PS: When I think about the forward and backward propagation processes and how we decrease the error, it seems to me to be not possible.
