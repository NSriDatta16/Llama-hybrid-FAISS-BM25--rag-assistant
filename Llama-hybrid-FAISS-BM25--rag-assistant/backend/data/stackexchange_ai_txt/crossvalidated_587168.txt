The foraging substrate category 3 has 100% species_1 as response. This makes that you can not model it well with the logit link function. That is because the fitting/modelling will try to make an estimate equal to one, $\hat{p} = 1/(1+e^{-X\hat\beta}) = 1$ , and this will be associated with an infinite coefficient.
