When I log transform data, the Lilliefors test still says my data is not normal...why?

I carried out PCA on a dataset, only for someone to point out to me that there is an inherent assumption of normality for this method. When I checked to see if my data was Gaussian using the lillietest function in Matlab, only 2 of my 20 columns returned a zero...meaning that for 18 of them the null hypothesis ("the data are normally distributed") is rejected.i.e. my data are not from a normal distribution. Then I thought I could simply log transform the data (x) to give me a normal distribution. However, when I do this using: for i=1:20; xnorm(:,i)=log(x(:,i)); l(i)=lillietest(xnorm(:,i)); end I am still getting mostly 'ones' returned from the lillietest function. Should each column not be normal following the log transform? I also tried using the boxcox transform, however, despite all my data being positive, I keep receiving this error: Error using boxcox (line 51) Input DATA must be positive. Is there a way I can transform my data to a normal distribution, so I can adhere to the assumption of normality required for PCA?
