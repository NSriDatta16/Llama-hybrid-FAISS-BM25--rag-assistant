Calculating the bandwidth between a client and the server?

I have an app that calls my ASP.NET page on my server, every 30 seconds. I want to use this for two purposes: Graph the uptime of my client Graph the average bandwidth from my client to the server What is the best way to calculate the bandwidth (in bytes per second) from the client to the server? I assume that I record the time, call the page, wait for a response, then get the time again, compare the times and calculate the bandwidth... but how to calculate the bandwidth?
