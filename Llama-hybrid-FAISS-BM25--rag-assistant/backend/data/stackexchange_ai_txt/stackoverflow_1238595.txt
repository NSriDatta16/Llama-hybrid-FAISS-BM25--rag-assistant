There are a few good answers above for distributed hashmap. For actually copying the file if at all possible I would prefer to not copy anything and just have some shared storage solution. If you must use separate disks for each computer, then something simple such as setting up an FTP server on each computer should work. This doesn't have to be Java based, but if you want Java only solution something like Apache MINA could work.
