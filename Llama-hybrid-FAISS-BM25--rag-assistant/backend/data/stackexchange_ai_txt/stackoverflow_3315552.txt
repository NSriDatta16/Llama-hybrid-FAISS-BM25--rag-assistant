how many DBMS are supported by Java and which one is the best for storing XMLs?

I am working with Jsbs and want to select a DBMS for my application that require a native XML database. Can you people guide me? 1) how many DBMS are supported by Java (is it true almost all DBMS are supported by java?) 2) Which one will be the best selection for XML storage and retrieval? Thanks in advance.
