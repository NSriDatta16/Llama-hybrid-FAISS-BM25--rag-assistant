In your particular example, both control and test generated the same total revenue. In such a case, no statistical method will tell you whether one of the two groups will be likely to generate more in the future, or whether the (non-existent) difference is statistically significant. So I'll take the liberty of changing the control data slightly so we do have an effect we can test. When in doubt, permute. That is, run a permutation test. In the present case, this is very simple. Throw your data together, labeled control and test . Now randomly permute these labels and calculate the difference in revenues between the two "permuted" groups. Do this many times. You now have a distribution of the difference in revenue under the null hypothesis that group membership does not make a difference. Finally, insert the actually observed difference in revenue into this distribution and check whether it is greater than, e.g., 95% of the permutation results. If so, the observed difference is statistically significant at the conventional 5% level. # control In this particular example, the actually observed difference in revenues only exceeds about 60% of the randomization results, so this would not be statistically significant at the conventional levels. For more on permutation tests, in particular the very simple one I sketched here, I recommend Good, Permutation, Parametric, and Bootstrap Tests of Hypotheses (2005).
