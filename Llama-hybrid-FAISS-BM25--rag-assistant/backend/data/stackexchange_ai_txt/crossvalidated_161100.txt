Prediction with time series model

I have a data from last 28 years about the yield of cornstover on different states. I want to make a prediction for next year using this data. I am entirely new on time series model and don't know about fitting the data on a multivariate model and predict to consider the correlation of yield of neighboring states. Simple MATLAB code to predict the data for future time period using historical data will be appreciated.
