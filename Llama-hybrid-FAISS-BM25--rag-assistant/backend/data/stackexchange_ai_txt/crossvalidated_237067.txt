For random forest, what's the difference between out-of-bag error and k-fold cross validation?

I am trying to forecast a time series using random forest. In order to validate my model, I came cross two tests: OOB and K-fold cross validation. My question is: For a time series, is out-of-bag error a out of sample test, does it make sense to test the accuracy "backward" using the historical data when I am trying to find the prediction accuracy? What is the difference between holding the last few points of the data and do a out of sample test vs a OOB?
