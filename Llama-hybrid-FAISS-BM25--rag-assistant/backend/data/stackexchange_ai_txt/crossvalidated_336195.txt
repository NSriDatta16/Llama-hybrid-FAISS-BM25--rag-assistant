Modelling approach for determining who to target with advertisments

This might be more appropriate for the Data Science stack exchange, but I'm fairly interested in the most 'scientific' or statistically sound approach. This is probably a fairly routine scenario in some areas, but I've never encountered it in my training. The Problem Say we're running a promotional campaign in an attempt to increase sales. You can target $N$ people with promotional material out of a total population of $M$ people. You have a budget to initially target a sample of $B$ people, which should allow you to work out who the best $N$ people to target are, out of the total $M$ people ($B We can assume all $M$ people have a loyalty card so we can track their purchases. This also gives us a bunch of features for each of the $M$ people (such as age, address, job, etc). My naive First Thoughts Randomly send out promotional material to $B$ people and then see if they purchased anything in the next month (or so). This gives me a data set of features for each individual, and whether or not they bought something in the month after receiving the promo. Now, we can construct a model (a binomial GLM for example) which predicts the probability of purchase after having received the promotional material, conditioned on the individual's feature set (age/job/location etc). Let's call this model A. I then use that model generate predictions on the total population ($M$ people) and send out the promo's to the $N$ people with the highest predicted probabilities. However This approach fails to account for the fact that some of those targeted $N$ people, were probably likely to buy something anyway - and we don't want to waste resources targeting them. What's the best way to approach this? Second Thoughts So we don't want to waste resources on the people who are likely to buy things even if they don't receive any promo material. We build a second model (on all, or a random sample?) on the $M-B$ people who DIDN'T receive the promo material. This gives us the probability that a person buys something conditioned on their individual features AND having not received any promo material. Let's call this model B. Now, it seems to me, using the 2 models we have a way of identifying who is likely to make a purchase if they did AND if they didn't receive the promo material. Let's call $\hat{P}_i^A$ the probability that individual $i$ makes a purchase given he was sent promo material (the output from the first model A), and $\hat{P}_i^B$ the probability that individual $i$ makes a purchase if he wasn't sent any promo material (the output from model B). Could we simply look at $\Delta P_i = \hat{P}_i^A - \hat{P}_i^B$ and send promo material to the $N$ individuals with the greatest $\Delta P$? Less formally, this would be: to send promo material to individuals who would have the biggest uplift in purchase probability given they have received promo material?. At this point, you may also want to consider some sort of threshold. For example we may care more about an uplift from $P=0.45$ to $P=0.55$ than we care about an uplift from $P=0.1$ to $P=0.4$. So we might filter on customers whose $\hat{P}_i^A$ is greater than a certain amount. Questions Is this approach reasonable? valid? statistically sound? Would you randomly send out the $B$ promo's? Would you stratify by some variable? What about for the second model? Would there be a more optimal way of sorting out who should and shouldn't receive the promo material if all we care about is maximising the number of items sold?
