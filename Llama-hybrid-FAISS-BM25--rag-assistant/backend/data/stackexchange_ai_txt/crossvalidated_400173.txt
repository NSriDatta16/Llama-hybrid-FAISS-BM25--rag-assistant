In loocv method we divide the dataset as one data point for test data while all the remaining data points as our train data. We then validate our model by using this n-1 train data against 1 test data. We perform n iterations like this with 1 test data being forwarded and remaining n-1 data being our new train data. This is suitable in time series analysis. We then find the average of n rmse values obtained. While in k fold method we divide the entire dataset in mot k folds and one fold will be the test fold and k-1 fold will be the train fold. We then validate our model by training k-1 train fold against 1 test fold. We do such k iterations and average the k rmse values. The test fold here moves backward and forward. Hence it cannot be used in time series analysis since it messes up with time. Please somebody correct me if am wrong somewhere
