How to include longitudinal information in logistic regression?

I have a binary outcome $y_i \in \{0,1\}$ , $i=1,\dots,n$ , and some covariates $x_i\in{\mathbb R}^p$ . I am planning to model these using a logistic regression model. However, I also have information from a period of time before $y_i$ was observed at time points $t_1,\dots,t_{m_i}$ . This longitudinal information is basically another set of covariates $z_i(t_j)\in{\mathbb R}^q$ that are measured at the times $t_1,\dots,t_{m_i}$ . How can I include the longitudinal information into my logistic regression model?
