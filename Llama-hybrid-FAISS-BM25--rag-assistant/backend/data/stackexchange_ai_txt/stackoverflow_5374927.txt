One approach I've seen for making map tiles is to use Microsoft MapCruncher - see http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/mapcruncher/ and http://www.bdcc.co.uk/GoogleCrunch/Crunch.htm - this enables you to build custom tiles for an overlay. This blog - http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.com/2010/10/showing-open-source-maps-on-windows.html - tells you how to show custom tiles within the Bing Maps Silverlight viewer. I would guess (don't know) that OziExplorer tiles could be used in this way - you just need to find a way to map the tile co-ordinates to a custom tile layer. Another option for you is to use OpenStreetMap data: You can use CloudMade's services - www.cloudmade.com - to produce map tiles with customised look-and-feel. You can produce your own tiles using MapNik - but (as I'm sure you are already aware) the processing and storage size needed for map tiles is large
