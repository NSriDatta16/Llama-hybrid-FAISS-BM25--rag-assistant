No, this is not possible or supported. (Well, it may be possible if you want to rely on undefined or implementation defined behavior... I strongly advise you to not do that.) The typical explanation of stack and heap taught in Computer Science courses has very little in common with how real systems (which use Virtual Memory) operate. Generally speaking it is not worth it. (If it was, std::auto_ptr , std::unique_ptr , or boost::shared_ptr , or boost::scoped_ptr would do it) C and C++ users are generally used to working with APIs which allow undefined behavior if the user does something stupid. Particularly when storage locations (stack versus free store) are concerned.
