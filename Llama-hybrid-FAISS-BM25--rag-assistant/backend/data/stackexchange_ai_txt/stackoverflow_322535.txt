For the files you listed, the simple answer assuming you are using all the defaults, the order is (note the conf /Catalina/localhost): ...tomcat/conf/context.xml ...tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/myapp.xml ...tomcat/webapps/myapp/META-INF/context.xml I'm basing this (and the following discussion) on the Tomcat 5.5 official documentation for the Context Container . So if that's the simple answer, whats the complete answer? Tomcat 5.5. will look in a couple of other places for elements beyond those you've listed (see the official docs). The META-INF/context.xml will never be opened if Tomcat finds a Catalina/localhost/myapp.xml . So if you actually have all the files above, its more correct to say the the META-INF/context.xml is irrelevant , not that it's the lowest precedence. If you say in your Catalina/localhost/myapp.xml that will make it the highest precedence, regardless of conf/context.xml . Same thing in your META-INF\context.xml , as long as you don't have a Catalina/localhost/myapp.xml (see previous paragraph). Also, the /Catalina/localhost/ portion of the path in the files above actually comes out of the "default" conf/server.xml and matches the . If your server.xml uses different values for name and defaultHost in the , that's the dir structure where Tomcat will look. Finally, for the ...tomcat\ portion of the files you listed, Tomcat uses the dir from the $CATALINA_BASE environment variable. If that's not set, then it uses the dir from the $CATALINA_HOME environment variable, which is the directory of the Tomcat installation. I like to set and use $CATALINA_BASE so that I don't "pollute" my Tomcat installation.
