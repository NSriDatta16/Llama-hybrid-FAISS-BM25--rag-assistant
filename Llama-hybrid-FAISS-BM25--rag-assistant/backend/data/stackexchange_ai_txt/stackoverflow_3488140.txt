The solution is simple, really. Add a margin-top to the parent of the label element, and add overflow: hidden to the div#contact div .field selector. However, can I just say that the code can be rewritten for much better efficiency and semantic correctness. For instance, I would contain the last massage in a p tag and not a label in a div . Also, I would have each input element placed in an unordered list ul instead of div s. You also have a lot of unnecessary float s and the br at the end of each input is wholly uneeded. Oh, and unless you are embedding Calluna somehow, don't use it - stick to web safe fonts (and if you are, you still need to suggest an alternative, in the user's browser does not support it, and also to give the browser something to display while the font loads). Edit Fixed the load for ya, I should be paid for this kind of stuff :) Just stick to better HTML and CSS next time. http://www.jsfiddle.net/SNrtA/
