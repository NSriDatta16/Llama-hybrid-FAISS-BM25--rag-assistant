Let's say you have two products with the following ratings. Rating ID Product Value (0-5) 1 A 5 2 A 4 3 A 2 4 A 3 5 A 5 6 A 5 7 A 4 8 B 2 9 B 3 10 B 3 The overall average rating would be: $$\mu_{overall}=\frac{\sum{Value}}{n}=\frac{5+4+2+3+5+5+4+2+3+3}{10}=3.6$$ The average rating for each product would be: $$\mu_{A}=\frac{5+4+2+3+5+5+4}{7}=4$$ $$\mu_{B}=\frac{2+3+3}{3}= 2.67$$ If the product with the highest rating (Value in the example dataset) is "best" then product A is better than B. Note that the average rating for each product is weighted in the denominator (the number of times it was rated). Note that the sum of the denominators for each product will add up to the total number of ratings. Note that if you only had the product averages, you could calculate a weighted overall average. Here the weights are equivalent to the proportion of the total ratings that the particular product got. For example, $$\mu_{overall}=\mu_A*Wt_A+\mu_B*Wt_B=(4*\frac{7}{10})+(2.66667*\frac{3}{10}) = 3.6$$
