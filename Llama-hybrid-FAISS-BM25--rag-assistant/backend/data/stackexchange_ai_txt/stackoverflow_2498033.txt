If you're OK with using a custom component, try this one: File Properties Task . It's open source, so you can see exactly what it's doing. You need to install it on your dev and prod boxes - with the installer or manually into the GAC. But do that, and you have a drag and drop task easier to use than the File System Task... but then, I'm biased...
