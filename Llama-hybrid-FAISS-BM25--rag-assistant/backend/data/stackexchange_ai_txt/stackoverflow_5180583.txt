Select inner HTML item in CSS

How can I use CSS selectors to apply a style only to the inner item in a list. Example: HTML fragment: Item 1 Subitem 1 Subitem 2 Subitem 1.1 CSS fragment: ul.list { border: 1px solid red; } What I need is to have a border only arround the "Subitem 1.1" string. The list is generated and it's not possible to add an extra class or id and as the list has no fixed depth it's not an option to specify an "ul > ul > ul.list" or similar selector.
