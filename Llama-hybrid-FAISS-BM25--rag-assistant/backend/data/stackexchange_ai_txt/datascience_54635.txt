Is it possible to build a regression model for predicting movie gross using sections on their wikipedia pages?

I got this as an assignment from a company recruiter and I've successfully scraped a dataset of about 650 movies with their 'Plot', 'Music' and 'Marketing' sections and gross. I've tried tfidf and count vectorizers and performed LSA/PCA to reduce the dimensions which originally are around 20k terms. This is really boggling me, due to less instances(650) I guess the no. features should be around 100 or atleast Also my regression model is way off target or in some cases overfitting excessively. I've also tried normalizing and de-normalizing the target(gross) for no improvements. I know I should try NN and other models too but the results of linear regression should be atleast comparable too, right? This makes me ponder if its even possible to model such a problem or am I doing something wrong with latter being more probable as I'm no expert in the field. PLEASE HELP !
