The CS231n online Stanford course has some great assignments about training neural nets on images. They are written in Python and not Java though unfortunately. They include a good tutorial on Python for the course though. Assignment 2, Q1 specifically is about training the CIFAR data set using a two layer neural network. Each question of the assignment comes with its own ipython notebook that take you through the whole process, step by step. It's pretty ideal for beginners if you know the theoretical background already. And if not the notes themselves are very comprehensive.
