How do Aweber and FeedBlitz report subscriber numbers to Feedburner?

I've looked all over for some documentation on this, but haven't found it. Some posts reference a user-agent string: http://groups.google.com/group/feedburner-services/browse_thread/thread/7aee14cf6a2432e7/49464335d2228e25?lnk=gst&q=aweber#49464335d2228e25 I had assumed there would be an API or something. More generally, how does ANY rss feed reader/aggregator (like Bloglines, etc) report subscriber numbers to Feedburner? I'm working on developing a new app that would need this functionality. Thanks for your help! Brian
