This is a bit opinion based, but here are my thoughts: How relevant is the curriculum? (For example, the UCSD data science major) Since most DS majors have been developed the past 2-3 years they tend to be well structured and curated. Their subjects are usually a mix of some theoretical background (e.g. stats, linear algebra), some basic programming courses (usually python or R) and some ML topics at a near state-of-the-art level. However, some face organization issues due to them operating only for a couple of years. How reliable is the degree in the upcoming future? (Would I be able to easily get a job like if I had a CS BS) No one can tell, but the trend seems to be that DS will be adopted universally by tech companies in the future. From what I can tell you'll have no problem at all finding a well paying job right out of college. Am I better off doing CS and minoring in stats or something else? Personally, I think no. DS at the moment is very undermanned in the labor market and demand is rising like crazy. To fill this demand there will be a lot of former programmers with a heavy CS background and years of experience making the transition. This, however, will change when people with DS degrees flood the market and I don't think it will be as easy in the future for CS to shift to DS, as it is now...
