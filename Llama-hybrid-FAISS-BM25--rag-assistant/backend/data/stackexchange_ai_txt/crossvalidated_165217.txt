As @Zen referenced in comments, 'Bayesian $p$-value' has a specific definition, distinct from your quantity of interest. As defined in Bayesian Data Analysis : The Bayesian $p$-value is defined as the probability that the replicated data could be more extreme than the observed data as measured by the test quantity [...] where the probability is taken over the posterior distribution of $\theta$ and the posterior predictive distribution of $y_{rep}$[.] $$ p_B = Pr(T(y^{rep}, \theta) \ge T(y, \theta \vert y)) = \iint \mathbb{I}_{T(y^{rep}, \theta)\ge T(y,\theta)}p(y^{rep}\vert \theta)p(\theta \vert y)dy^{rep}d\theta $$ $\mathbb{I}$ the indicator function, $T$ some test statistic. All to say that a $p$-value reference is not what you're looking for: I'd follow others commenters' advice and stick to "the posterior probability that $\beta$ is greater than zero," or whatever similar language is natural in context.
