What you are doing right now is regression on the review score, therefore accuracy is not a suitable metric to assess performance. Your model is optimizing the mean squared error, thus it makes sense that it is predicting the (almost) average review score. Since you are interested in the accuracy on the rating's prediction, you should set your output layer as a softmax layer with 10 possible outputs, as in: model.add(keras.layers.Dense(10), activation='softmax') Then you can optimize the categorical_crossentropy of your model, and report the accuracy. In this way, you'll do classification of the ratings. model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
