What PCA does is "squeeze" the variance of the original variables into a smaller set of variables (the principal components). The problem you describe requires a Feature Selection algorithm or a simple correlation analysis between the input variables and your chosen output. If you insist (or you're required) to do the task using PCA, then search the literature for "feature selection using pca" . However, I suggest you don't go in the latter direction if you're just starting to use PCA.
