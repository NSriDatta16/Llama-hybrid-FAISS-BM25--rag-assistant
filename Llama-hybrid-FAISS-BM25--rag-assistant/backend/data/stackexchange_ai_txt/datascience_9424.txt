SPARK Mllib: Multiclass logistic regression, how to get the probabilities of all classes rather than the top one?

I am using LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS to train a multi-class classifier. Is there a way to get the probability of all classes (not only the top candidate class) when I test the model on new unseen samples? P.S. I am not necessarily obliged to use the LBFGS classifier but I would like to use the logistic regression in my problem. So if there is a solution by using another LR classifier type, I would go for it.
