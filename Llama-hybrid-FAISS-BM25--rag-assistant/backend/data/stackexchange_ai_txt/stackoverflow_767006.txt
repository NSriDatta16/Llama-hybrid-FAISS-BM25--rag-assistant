I assume you're referring to Raw Sockets (where you have to write the network layer, transport layer, and application layer information). New Windows versions (XP SP2 and up) have very limited support for raw sockets with many restrictions. More info (scroll down to "Limitations on Raw Sockets") The solution, I believe, is to use WinPcap , which allows you to send raw packets on those systems.
