C++ -- Which one is supposed to use "new Car" or "new Car()"?

Possible Duplicate: Do the parentheses after the type name make a difference with new? Hello all, class Car { public: Car() : m_iPrice(0) {} Car(int iPrice) : m_iPrice(iPrice) {} private: int m_iPrice; }; int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[]) { Car car1; // Line 1 Car car2(); // Line 2, this statement declares a function instead. Car* pCar = new Car; // Line 3 Car* pCar2 = new Car(); // Line 4 return 0; } Here is my question: When we define an object of Car, we should use Line 1 rather than Line 2. When we new an object, both Line 3 and Line 4 can pass the compiler of VC8.0. However, what is the better way Line 3 or Line 4? Or, Line 3 is equal to Line 4. Thank you
