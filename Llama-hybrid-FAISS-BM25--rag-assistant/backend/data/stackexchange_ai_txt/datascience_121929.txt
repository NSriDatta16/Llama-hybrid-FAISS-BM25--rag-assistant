First of all, the paper only implies that under certain conditions, neural networks and kernel functions exhibit an equivalence. This is because the neural networks with their hidden layers converge during the training process to some optimal weight values for each neuron . These values align with a kernel matrix which means that their representations can be approximated by a kernel function. Take for example support vector machines (SVMs) where the boundary between classes is determined by the similarity/kernel function between the inputs. A neural network would learn this through complex non-linear transformations using their activation function .
