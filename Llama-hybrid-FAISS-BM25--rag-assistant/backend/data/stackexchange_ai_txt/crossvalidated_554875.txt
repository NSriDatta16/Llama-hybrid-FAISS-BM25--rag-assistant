How to conduct sensitivity analysis on IPSW for survival data?

I am working on survival data, comparing two groups of patients (with or without treatment). These data have some selection bias, thus, I have chosen to weight my sample by Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPSW) in order to estimate the Average Treatment Effect which is log(HR) here. I am asked to do sensitivity analysis to corroborate my estimations. I was wondering what kind of sensitivity analysis I could do in this case. Rosenbaum analysis is only for matched pairs and the other articles I have found are particularly challenging... Have you some ideas ? Thank you so much.
