If you wanted to know what is the average weight of american citizens, then in the ideal case you'd immediately ask every citizen to step on the scales, and collect the data. You'd get an exact answer. This is very difficult, so maybe you could get a few citizens to step on scale, compute the average and get an idea of what is the average of the population. Would you expect that the sample average be exactly equal to the population average? I hope not. Now, would you agree that if you got more and more people, at some point we'd be getting closer to population mean? We should, right? In the end the most people we can get is entire population, and its mean is what we're looking for. This is the intuition. This was an idealized thought experiment. In reality, there are complications. I'll give you two. Imagine that the data is coming from a Cauchy distribution . You can increase your sample infinitely, yet the variance will not decrease. This distribution has no population variance. In fact, strictly speaking, it has no sample mean either. It's sad. Amazingly, this distribution is quite real, it pops up here and there in physics. Imagine that you decided to go on with a task of determining the average weight of american citizens. So, you take your scale and go from home to home. This will take you many many years. By the time you collect million observations, some of the citizens in your data set will have changed their weight a lot, some had died etc. The point is that increasing sample size in this case doesn't help you.
