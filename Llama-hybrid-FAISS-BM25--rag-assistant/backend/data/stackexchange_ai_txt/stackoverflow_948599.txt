This is happening because you are mis-using exceptions. Getting 50 before you get to the "interesting code" is not a good sign. There is no way in Visual Studio to skip them in some code, because it's not designed to encourage what you are doing. That said, what I'd do would be to turn off catching first-chance exceptions in the debugger, explicitly try/catch the exception you do want to catch, and put in a Debugger.Break() when you've caught it.
