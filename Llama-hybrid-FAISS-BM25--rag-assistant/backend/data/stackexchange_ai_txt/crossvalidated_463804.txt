What Survival Analysis model to use for event occurring multiple times?

I have a dataset about when do people with genetically inherited disease have infections. There are several variables like treatment type, placebo or not, age, sex etc. I also have time to first infection, and time to every consecutive infection of the person, some of which are censored I have to estimate hazard rate of infection. Should I consider those time intervals between consecutive infections of a person or should I take only time to first infection? Thank you for attention
