One solution would be to assemble the expression as a string, and then send it SQL Server, or whatever your database is for evaluation. Replace the actual variables with 1=1 or 0=1 for True and False respectively, and you would end up with a query like this: SELECT 1 WHERE (1=1 And 0=1) Or (1=1 And 1=1) Or (Not 0=1 And 1=1) Then when you run the query, you get a 1 back when the result is true. May not be the most elegant solution, but it will work. A lot of people will probably advise against this, but I'm just going to throw it out there as a possible solution anyway.
