IsolatedStorageSettings needs Update?

I'm using IsolatedStorageSettings on WP7 to store an objects list: List I need to search an item inside my list and to update some properties of the searched item. I'm using this code: List listArt = null; IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.TryGetValue("ArticleListStorage", out listArt); var queryList = (from anItem in listArt where (anItem.Id == _id) select anItem).ToList (); a = queryList[0] as Article; //mark Article as read a.Readed = true; When I continuously navigate the various page inside the app, I can see the property Readed correctly evalued. But, when I click on WP7 Start button and reopen my app ( without close emulator ) I see the property not correctly evalued. Need I to update my object inside list and so inside Isolated Storage? Not updated by reference? I tried also this, ant it doesn't work: listArt[0].Readed = true; listArt[0].Favorite = true; IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings["ArticleListStorage"] = listArt; IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.Save(); What is wrong? Thank you so much!
