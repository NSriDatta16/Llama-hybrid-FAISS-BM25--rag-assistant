ADF & KPSS Test Reporting Series as I(19)

I am currently attempting to determine the order of integration for a nonstationary time series of the Federal Funds Rate ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS - Monthly, 1990 to 2004, 168 obs.) in R, and am using both the ADF and KPSS tests (using the adf.test() and kpss.test() commands). When I test the undifferenced time series, I find that the time series is non-stationary. Then, I difference the time series ( df$effr %>% diff(1) %>% kpss.test() ) until I get a result that the test finds the series stationary. However, I have tested this series to a result of nonstationary until the 19th difference, where the series is finally reported to not have a unit root by the KPSS test at the 5% significance level. Why is it taking 19 differences to make this variable stationary (is this normal? from papers I have read, orders of integration do not typically range this high), and what is the "maximum" number of differences before the results seem BS?
