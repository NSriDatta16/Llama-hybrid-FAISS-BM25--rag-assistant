Idea of downloading 15k records smells pretty bad but lets assume you must do it. The scenario you must follow to make this work should look like: Create first context for data retrieval. Execute query to get your 15k records. Execute query as NoTracking ( MergeOption of ObjectQuery )! It will improve performance because these records will never be used in context again. Close first context User picks and invoice = create deep clone of the invoice and attach it to a new context (in case of WPF or WinForm application) User saves changes and exception is fired. If you want to deal with exception somehow you still have only context with single invoice. You can dispose context and return to your original set of unaffected records. If the entity is saved you should merge changes back to list because your entity in 15k records will not be updated automatically.
