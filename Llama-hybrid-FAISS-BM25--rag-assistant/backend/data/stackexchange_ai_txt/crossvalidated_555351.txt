A discrete-time survival model suitable for panel data with time-varying covariates is essentially a set of binomial regressions for the included time periods. See Willett and Singer , for example. So if you really want to use a linear probability model for each of those binomial regressions there's nothing to stop you, as @AndyW implies in a comment. The reason why you aren't finding pre-built software to do linear probability model fitting in this context is that standard logistic regression or other binomial modeling that restricts probabilities to [0,1] (e.g., probit regression, complementary log-log link) is superior for the binomial modeling. It's hard to imagine a situation in which a linear probability model would be superior, particularly for "statistical inference." You claim that its "results are much easier to explain," but how do you explain predictions of negative probabilities from a linear probability model? Particularly if you are intending to publish your results, stick with established statistical approaches.
