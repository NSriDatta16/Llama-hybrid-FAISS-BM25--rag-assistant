Even if you could calculate the date/time from the auto-generated build number, I wouldn't recommend it. The build number wasn't meant for that purpose. It was simply meant to be an auto-generated value you can depend on to continually increase. No further logic should be assumed by a consuming application. If you want a fragment of the version number to include a date/time stamp, then you should integrate that logic into your build process / scripts / however else you may choose to do so.
