How to deal with Covid outlier in time series/machine learning forecasting?

Disclaimer: I checked some similar questions but I could not find anything in particular that would work for my case. I am dealing with a time series going from 2015 to 2023. The data points are the results of an aggregation of scores calculated on a European country's financial news (simplifying: I take financial news per day, perform sentiment analysis, and get a score per sentiment (n. of pos, n. of neg and neutral per day) and then aggregate it to get one data point per day). Now, the model I built would work pretty well, if it wasn't for the huge Covid outlier: my target is GDP, and it's well captured, but in 2020 my sentiment curve goes way deeper compared to GDP. In fact, the country I am working in was particularly hit by Covid, hence there was a huge mass of negative news in 2020. This means I can't just remove the outlier or use the traditional methods, cause I would lose information, i.e. part of that info is important, cause GDP decreases considerably in that period, but not that much... Now, I have tried changing the aggregation techniques to better deal with that. More specifically, I tried the following: np.log(n_positive_news + 1) / np.log(n_negative_news + 1) np.log((n_positive_news + 1) / (n_negative_news + 1)) -1 * n_negative_news I also tried applying exponential moving average, rolling mean, and rolling sum. But none of these techniques helped a lot. Exponential moving average and the third aggregation technique improved results, but slightly. Any suggestions on other aggregation techniques or in general, on how to deal with that outlier? Train/test split: what do you think would be the optimal split? One that would include or exclude Covid in the training period? and why? for the moment, I am including it in the training period ( train 01/01/2015-31/12/2020, test 01/01/2021-10/01/2023 Plot looks something like this (that drop is 2020, and the red line is my forecast).
