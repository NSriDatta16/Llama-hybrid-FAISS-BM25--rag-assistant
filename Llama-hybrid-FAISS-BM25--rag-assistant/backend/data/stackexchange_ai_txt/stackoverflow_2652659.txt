Add properties to stdClass object from another object

I would like to be able to do the following: $obj = new stdClass; $obj->status = "success"; $obj2 = new stdClass; $obj2->message = "OK"; How can I extend $obj so that it contains the properties of $obj2, eg: $obj->status //"success" $obj->message // "OK" I know I could use an array, add all properties to the array and then cast that back to object, but is there a more elegant way, something like this: extend($obj, $obj2); //adds all properties from $obj2 to $obj Thanks!
