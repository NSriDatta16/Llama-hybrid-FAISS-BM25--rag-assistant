The short answer is, yes, 302 redirects tend to hurt your organic search results because obviously you could change that to something nefarious. It would not likely affect any SEM quality scores since it's common practice for SEM shops to host an interstitial URL for additional tracking and analytics. If you are able to get URL rewriting to work such that the user's address in the address bar doesn't change (i.e., no 302 redirects), that will only improve your SEO value. Consider too that any content you think users might link to should be off of the domain you've registered on 1&1, or you'll lose some of your "link juice" to the other domain.
