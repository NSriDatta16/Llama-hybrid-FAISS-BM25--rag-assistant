JavaScript is fragile. There are lots of things that can make it break, from bugs in browsers you've not tested (especially mobile browsers), to browser extensions fiddling with your code, to dodgy ‘internet security’ apps blocking parts of your code. If your site works without JavaScript, you don't have to worry so much about that, because it'll likely still function in these circumstances. JavaScript tends not to interact well with accessibility aids. A site that works without JavaScript will be more likely usable to screen readers and other unusual user agents you may not have bargained for. And apart from the people who browse with JS off for security/privacy or because they have no choice, there's also a fairly important class of user-agent with no JavaScript support: the spider. Hide all your content so it can't be accessed without JavaScript and you've just lost a friend in Google. Hope you weren't counting on a lot of visitors or anything. Build a site that works without scripting, and then add the progressive-enhancement JS magic on top. You'll have a site that works for more people, that is likely to have fewer usability problems(*), and is friendlier to SEO. It's all-round win, unless (a) you've got a task that due to its nature requires scripting, or (b) you're just lazy. (*: eg, links that you can middle-click but which just open into a JS error, unbookmarkable subpages, UI elements that don't respond to keyboard interaction, broken navigation... you can write JS in a clean way to minimise these problems. But most people don't.)
