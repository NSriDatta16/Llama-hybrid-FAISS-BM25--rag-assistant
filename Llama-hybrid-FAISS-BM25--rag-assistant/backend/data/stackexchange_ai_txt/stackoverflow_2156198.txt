The right way to think of ref is an alias for a storage location. Thus, when you say int x; Foo(ref x); and Foo is declared as void Foo(ref int y) you are to think of x and y as aliases for the same location in the method call above. So, void Foo(ref int y) in C# is analogous with void Foo(int &y) in C++.
