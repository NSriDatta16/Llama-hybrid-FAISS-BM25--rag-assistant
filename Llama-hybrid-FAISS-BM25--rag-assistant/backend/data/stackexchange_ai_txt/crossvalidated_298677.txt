Case 1: Entertaining the hypothesis that average height may have increased or decreased, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that neither has happened. Case 2: Entertaining the hypothesis that average height may have increased, we reject the null hypothesis that it hasn't. Both examined at the same accepted Type I error probability. (e.g. 5%). By "casting a wider net" (Case 1), we require more from our data sample, since we ask from it to statistically "disprove/not disprove" two effects at once (increase-decrease). Assume that descriptive statistics of the data sample indicate that the current average height is greater than in the past. The data is already showing us the way, and what is left is to test statistically whether the observed increase is statistically large enough. To execute here a two-tailed test would be wrong, since it would artificially dilute the informational potential of the data sample.
