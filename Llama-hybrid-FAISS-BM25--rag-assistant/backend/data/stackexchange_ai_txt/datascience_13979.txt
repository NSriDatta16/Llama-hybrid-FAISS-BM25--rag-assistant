In order to learn data science you should know about main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox. Two steps which most newbee's follow are: The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge which involves following steps: Getting and Cleaning Data,Data Analysis,Reproducible Research Statistical Inference, using Regression Models and Machine Learning The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R, and RStudio. I would advice you to complete a general course on data science from any website or tutorial you find easy for example I personally like this course: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science And then start building some projects of your own for example in my free time I build a lot of small data science projects playing with any available data like US census, petroleum data etc. For example see following link for one of my many data science projects: https://arjun-chaudhary.shinyapps.io/Data_Analytics/
