Deep learning - aesthetics data modelling

I want to train neural network on aesthetics. I am getting confused on how to go about for training data. Assume, I have large data set of landscapes, portraits, wildlife etc which are aesthetic according to humans. But, I want to train them for the quality, the kind of colours involved, contrast levels, background blur etc. How do I train images for this criteria? Is there a way for doing this by unsupervised learning?
