The #import directive is not part of the standard C++ programming language. I don't know what (if anything) it does in GCC. The normal way to use a DLL is to include its header file(s) in your code and then link with its import library (the .LIB file). I've never programmed in ADO, but in ODBC you would #include and when compiling/linking g++ mystuff.cpp -lodbc32 to get the import library. Also, the version of the MinGW compiler you are using is very old. You can get a much more up-to-date one at http://tdragon.net/recentgcc .
