I just reorganized the html code and put the slider at the end of the first line of portfolio images. Made it float left and the correct size while adding at the top: So I it didn't follow the previous style from the top images div. Hope I made myself clear but if anyone has more questions on how I solved it and would like to use this code, let me know! Thanks Sophie.
