You need to analyze sentence structure and extract corresponding syntactic categories of interest (in this case, I think it would be noun phrase , which is a phrasal category ). For details, see corresponding Wikipedia article and "Analyzing Sentence Structure" chapter of NLTK book. In regard to available software tools for implementing the above-mentioned approach and beyond, I would suggest to consider either NLTK (if you prefer Python), or StanfordNLP software (if you prefer Java). For many other NLP frameworks, libraries and programming various languages support, see corresponding (NLP) sections in this excellent curated list .
