POSTing a DateTime from Android to a WCF RESTful JSON Service

I'm trying to send a DateTime as a parameter to a method exposed over a WCF RESTful service with JSON encoding. The request looks like this: POST http://IP:PORT/LogService/json/GetLogEntriesByModule HTTP/1.1 Content-Length: 100 Content-Type: application/json Host: IP:PORT Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/UNAVAILABLE (java 1.4) Expect: 100-Continue {"maxentries":10,"upperdate":"1280703601462","lowerdate":"1277938801462","module":"Windows Service"} I tried several formats for the DateTime : 2010-07-01T10:54:00 (which is send by the WCFTestClient application over NET.TCP and it gets results \/Date(12345678+0100)\/ 01.07.2010 10:54:00 The method definition: LogEntry[] GetLogEntriesByModule( string module, DateTime lowerDate, DateTime upperDate, int maxEntries, out bool maxEntriesReached ) I always get the following response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 60 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0 Date: Fri, 02 Jul 2010 09:07:04 GMT {"GetLogEntriesByModuleResult":[],"maxEntriesReached":false} It seems the DateTime isn't correctly parsed, because there are several entries in the Llog for that time. Does anyone know on how to do this? Update : The problem was on the server side and has been resolved.
