Actually, with Silverlight 3 Silverlight 4 you should be able to code a Silverlight app to accept a drag-drop straight from Outlook. Tim Heuer has a good article about it here . All you would need is to add a drop target area to the Silverlight app, users would navigate to the correct lead in the app, then drag emails straight from their Outlook to the Silverlight app. Corrected: That was v4, which is still beta.
