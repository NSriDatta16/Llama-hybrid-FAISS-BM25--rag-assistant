The best advice I could offer would be to move away from using CS4 ide for coding. Take a look at FlashDevelop. It is a free, small download. It will allow you to organize your code better, provide code hinting and much more. You will never look back. EDIT: There is also FDT which I think is the best but it cost $$$
