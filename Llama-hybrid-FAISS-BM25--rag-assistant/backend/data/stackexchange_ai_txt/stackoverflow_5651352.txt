ajax requests vs. dom/browser efficiency? who wins?

I have an app that employs a scrollable jQuery carousel type display. This display contains photos that belong to a user... Each photo has a considerable amount of sibling html content (data pertaining to the photo that displays when you hover over it, etc)-- So this markup, plus the image tag is all nested within a container element with a css class "photo".. To further complicate things, each photo is draggable, and has several other behaviors/event listeners attached to it. When I was initially designing this, I felt worried about this carousel being loaded with too much data (like imagine a user that has 10000 photos).. I was quickly imagining the dom being overloaded with too many elements, and everything being draggable, and then spinning color balls of death followed by a crash. My solution to this was to limit the load of the carousel through pagination, and only fetch the assets for a given page... This means there will be a considerable amounts of xhr requests for a given user browsing their photos..... And that concerned me also. So I am wondering what the community says... What is better? an overloaded dom? or many xhr requests? Or is the answer maybe more of a balance between the two? Opinions?
