Average standard error

I have several measurements from the same population spanning over the course of several years, each year with its own mean and standard error (based on the same replicates at same location each time), and I want to calculate the grand mean and grand standard error. The grand mean seems fairly straight-forward (average the means?) but I am not sure if I can calculate the grand SE averaging annual SE values. For instance: means Thanks
