Why doesn't EclEmma cover syncronized(MyClass.class)?

I'm using EclEmma for coverage analysis. My Java code includes a synchronized(MyClass.class) {} block. EclEmma says it is only partially covered, event though I've got a unit test in which one thread gets access and another thread is blocked. Is it possible to get full coverage of synchronized using EclEmma? Can I annotate the code in some way to tell EclEmma to give this line full coverage? Kind regards Roger
