One is that the model we estimated is the true model. This assumption is not correct. Several types of time series (for example those from retail demand) don't correspond to a single data generating process, so there is no "true model" - there is at best a combined effect of multiple processes, so the model we use is chosen because it gives the best forecasts, not because it corresponds to a true model. See for example this discussion : Many statisticians like to use BIC because it is consistent â€” if there is a true underlying model, then with enough data the BIC will select that model. However, in reality there is rarely if ever a true underlying model, and even if there was a true underlying model, selecting that model will not necessarily give the best forecasts (because the parameter estimates may not be accurate).
