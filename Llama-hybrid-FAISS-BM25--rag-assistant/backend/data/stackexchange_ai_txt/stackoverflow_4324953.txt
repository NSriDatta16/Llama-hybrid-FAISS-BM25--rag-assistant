There are many inter-related factors which influence the answer to your questions. They include, but are not limited to The distribution of queries to your slave The timing and types of updates coming in via replication Your dataset Your hardware Your MySQL version and engines being employed Having said that, the stat of "5000 question s per minute" by itself it not sufficient to raise any flags in my books. It might be more worthwhile to determine if your application is operating within an acceptable range; e.g. what the application's average response time or worst case response time. It's worth noting that the question s counter includes more than just SELECT s. I can't find a comprehensive list or reference, but, for some examples, I believe that " UPDATE s, DELETE s, SHOW STATUS , USE $db, SHOW TABLES " all increment the questions status variable.
