Suppose I give you the choice between the following two deals: Deal 1: I have a biased coin which lands heads with probability 55%. I flip it. If it comes up heads, you win a million bucks. Deal 2: The same, but instead of my trick coin we use the next random coin we find lying in the street, regardless of whether that coin has heads on one side, both sides, or neither side. If you prefer Deal 1, that suggests that you agree with the Bayesian that the probability of the unknown coin flipping heads is (The Bayesian won't necessarily think the probability of getting heads is exactly 50% - e.g. they might believe there are more double-headed coins than double-tailed coins in the world.)
