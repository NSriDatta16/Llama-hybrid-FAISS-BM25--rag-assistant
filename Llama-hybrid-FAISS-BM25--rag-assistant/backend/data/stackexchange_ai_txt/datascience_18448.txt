If you are interested, I recommend you try the Ryskamp Machine Learning (RLM) engine in your project. You can visit our site to learn more about it and, from there, you can get the source code (hosted on github) and give it a shot. Note that the RLM is very different from traditional machine learning. Although some basic concepts still apply such as inputs, outputs, etc. but one (out of 7 breakthroughs) of what really sets it apart is the core algorithm. The RLM does not apply the same mathematical algorithms used by traditional ML rather it goes about the problem in a logical approach. See the 7 breakthroughs on our site to learn more about the differences. As for your project, here are some suggestions on how you can apply the RLM: You could have it do Supervised Training. Like you will do in traditional ML, you should gather the participants data together with the ratings you mentioned. With the dataset in hand, you can then proceed training the RLM with it. You could set the input to always 1 while the output to be the three fruit ratios. The reason you have 1 as your input is because you are trying to find the best ratio for the entire population. Where you to find the best ratio for certain groups of participants, you could then have different values on your inputs (i.e., 1 = Participants Age >= 30, 2 = Participants Age Or, you could do Unsupervised Training. Instead of preparing a predefined list of ratios to let your participants try and rate, the RLM can do that as it will try different ratios until it comes up with the optimal one. You can still follow the same inputs and outputs I mentioned in #1. Although, I worry that having only 200 participants might not be enough to fully find the optimal fruit ratio using this method. On both options, the participant's rating (1-7 as you mentioned) is the Score you will provide to the RLM. I hope this helps. If ever you need any technical assistance or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me. P.S.: Although the RLM has been recently open sourced, there are some limitations to its use.
