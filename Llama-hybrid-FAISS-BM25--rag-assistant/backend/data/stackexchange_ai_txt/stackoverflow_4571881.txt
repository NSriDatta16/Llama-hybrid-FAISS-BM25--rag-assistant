With any given HTML, I need to: • Remove all tables and their contents • Remove everything after the first h1 tag • Keep only paragraphs (INCLUDING their inner HTML (links, lists, etc)) This can be done very easily with XSLT : In case your element names are not in the XHtml namespace, simple delete any occurence of h: in the above code.
