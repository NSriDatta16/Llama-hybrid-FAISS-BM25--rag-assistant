I think your process is nearly as good as it can be. Without the designer knowing sharepoint all you can do is encourage them to make as many changes in css as much as possible. (then do your diff and apply it). With ASP.Net and Sharepoint you are limited to how the markup can change if you wish to take advantage of certain components. It's possible that you could convince the designer to use Expression Blend. But most likely unless they have development experience or you are willing to train them somewhat then there will have to be some developer engagement. I trained my designer to use Visual Studio and it's made my life a great deal easier.
