XML data storage database? free and opensource

I need a way to store data inside xml files and write to differant parts of the file, as well as add elements and structure to the xml document. I need full control over the file names and xml documents, and it would be much easier if I could use some kind of SQL layer to read and write from the xml. Just due to project constraints I am tied into using XML, but if possible would like a trust and tested open source solution for this. Or should I be using out of box .net functionality for this?
