I solved that problem now. It seems that the default database storage engine was set to MyISAM on my server, so because I didn't specify it explicitely, all foreign key relations just discarded (without saying so though). After converting it to InnoDB I no longer get the warning, so it seems that everything is working as it should. However in this special case, I'll stick to MyISAM, and leave the foreign key relations outside for now, because I want to auto increment the second attribute in that multi-key (and that is not supported by InnoDB), and that's a bit more useful for this application than having foreign keys (especially when having data where updating and deleting will be done very rarely). Also in regards to MySQL Workbench, that behaviour still seems to be a bit buggy, and it was already reported .
