Does the regression intercept capture the effect of the treatment year?

I read in a notes that runs the following regression $Y_{it}=\alpha+\beta_1D^{-1}_{it}+\beta_2D^{+1}_{it}+\gamma X_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$ $Y_{it}$ is some health index for individual $i$ in year $t$ , $i=1,...,1540$ represents individuals(patients) and $t=1,2,3$ represents years and a treatment happens at $t=2$ . $D^{-1}_{it}$ and $D^{+1}_{it}$ are dummy variables: in particular, $D^{-1}_{it}$ equals one if the individual is in one year before the treatment (individuals with $t=1$ ), $D^{+1}_{it}$ equals one if the individual is in one year after treatment. $X_{it}$ is some individual or time varying control variable, and $\epsilon_{it}$ is the regression error term. My question is: does the OLS estimate of $\alpha$ capture the effect of $t=2$ (the treatment year) on the average value of $Y$ ? Why or why not? It would be great if you could show it either intuitively or mathematically. Thanks!
