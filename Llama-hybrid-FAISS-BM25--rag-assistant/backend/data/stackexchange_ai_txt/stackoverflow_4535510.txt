How to use netbeans module in my own project?

I hvae done a netbeans tutorial to create a wizard dialog, and the result wizard dialog module have appear on the toolbar of my netbeans, but the problem is how could I use that module in my own project. I created a new project called 'testDemo' and copied all the source code of the module, then I tried to create a instance of that wizard dialog, but failed with 'org.openide could not found'. Thanks.
