C++ introduction: self study

I created the program to read from text file and remove special characters. I can't seem to code better the if statement. Please help. I searched online for the right code statements but they have all advanced code statements. The book I am learning from has the last(14th) chapter with strings and file open and closing code. I tried creating an array of special chars, but did not work. Please help me! int main() { string paragraph = ""; string curChar = ""; string fileName = ""; int subscript=0; int numWords=0; ifstream inFile; //declaring the file variables in the implement ofstream outFile; cout > fileName; inFile.open(fileName, ios::in); //opening the user entered file //if statement for not finding the file if(inFile.fail()) { cout " ||curChar=="/"||curChar=="#"||curChar=="*"||curChar=="_"||curChar=="+" ||curChar=="=") { paragraph.erase(subscript, 1); numWords-=1; } else subscript+=1; } cout
