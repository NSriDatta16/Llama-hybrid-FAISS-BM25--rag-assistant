Poisson distribution confidence interval

Edit : this is the data I used for the first part of the problem : \begin{matrix} Rocks & 0& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6 & 7\\ samples & 12& 27& 28& 19& 8& 3& 1 & 1\\ \end{matrix} I did hypothesis to test if it follows poisson or binomial and concluded it could follow both. Part 2 Let p be the probability that a sample taken on a land contains strictly more than one rock. A) What is the p value if we suppose the following : finding rock in samples follows a Poisson P(2) with $\lambda = 2$ ? For this part I just do Poisson average is 2 and random is 1 : $0.594$ B) What is the empirical proportion $\hat p$ of the samples that contains $ > 1$ rock ? For this part, I have, using the continuity correction ( +0.5) : $P(X > 1 - 0.5 - 2) / \sqrt{2} = p(z > 0.5 - 2) / 1.41 = -1.0638$ $ = p(z my answer : everything below 1.06 standard deviation left from the mean. Am I right with my interpretation of empirical proportion ? C) Give a 98 % confidence interval for $p$ I found an interval using this calculator but I'm not sure if it's right to use 1 as my observed events value. $[0.01, 6.64]$ also found this is the formula to use $\lambda \pm 1.96\sqrt{\lambda / n}$ but in my case it's going to be $\lambda \pm 1.96 * \sqrt{1}$ ? D) Test at $\alpha = 5%$ the hypothesis $p = 0.5$ versus $ p > 0.5$ I don't know where to start this part.
