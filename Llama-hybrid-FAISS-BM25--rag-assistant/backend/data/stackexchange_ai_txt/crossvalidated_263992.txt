I think you should consider two different measures to define the agreement between two persons. The first measure is the ratio of agreement between these two persons (such as the AgreementScore you have defined), and the second is the number of opportunities that these persons had. This is similar to support and confidence measures in association rule mining. The support measures the coverage of the rule and the confidence assesses the accuracy of the rule.
