When I worked for my previous employer, the company reorg'ed the whole dev organization and product management. They put engineers, qa, and analysts in each team. The split was mostly vertical/functional with some exceptions. Those exceptions were a mistake - the architecture vertical did not fit, because it was really horizontal. I thought that cross-functional teams worked well. In your case, the db and front-end departments need to merge with the rest if possible, and new verticals specific to your product may be created
