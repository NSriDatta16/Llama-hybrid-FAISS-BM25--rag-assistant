Do we ever use the prior predictive distributions of Bayesian Statistics?

As my question states, I am wondering if there is any chance we use the prior predictive distribution. I am studying Bayesian Statistics and have understood what it is. It is a must to go through in Bayesian Statistics and seems very useful(at least to my understanding). My understanding about it is that it is used before seeing data to see what the distribution of observations might be. But I still cannot understand if we ever use it. Why would we use it? Is this for a simulation purpose? I wonder if you have ever used or if you are using it.
