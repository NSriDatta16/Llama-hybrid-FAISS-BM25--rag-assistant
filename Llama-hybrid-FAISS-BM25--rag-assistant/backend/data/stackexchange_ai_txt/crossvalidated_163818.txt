Root-Mean Squared Error for Bayesian Regression Models

I'm trying to get a sense of my prediction errors for a Bayesian regression model and I was using the Root-Mean-Squared Error. My question is, since are predictions are stochastic, would it make sense to take multiple draws of each sample point to account for variability in your parameter draws. That is, if we had 10 observed data points points, should one make 10 predictions for each data point, which would give us a total of 100 error values, average the sum of squares of those error values over 100 and take the square root? Thanks!
