How can I use OS X's Accessibility API to write acceptance tests for my applications?

I'm writing a GUI application in Cocoa. I'd like to use Cucumber to write acceptance tests to continually verify that the application's features work. I'm already writing the application in MacRuby. Can I use the Accessibility API to click things and drag things around? Where can I read about how to do such things? I've found Apple's site to be relatively mum on the topic.
