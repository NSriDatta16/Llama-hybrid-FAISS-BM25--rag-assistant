Can anyone verify my NN diagram if it is properly drawn?

I am working on a Neural Network that can estimate building's carbon footprint based on the set of features and an image of urban surroundings (via CNN). I have used Netron to visualize the network (up) but this image is not readable in a publication so I drawn one myself (down). Can anyone comment if this is proper representation - especially the last part after the concatenation - I am not sure if there should be 2 or 3 dense layers?
