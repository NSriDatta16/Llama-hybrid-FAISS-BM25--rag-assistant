IMHO, you could do a lag plot, it is the most simple visual technique, very efficient. More technical, another way to answer your question is to ask if the average of your series change over time when the seasonality effect is discarded. For the stationarity, you could see that one . In your case, it is a bit different, as you have a seasonality. It is lightly discussed here . In the end, the easiest way is to aggregate your time series to get rid of the seasonality then to test this new time serie with the tests in the first link. The hard way is to do a Threshold Autoregressive model.
