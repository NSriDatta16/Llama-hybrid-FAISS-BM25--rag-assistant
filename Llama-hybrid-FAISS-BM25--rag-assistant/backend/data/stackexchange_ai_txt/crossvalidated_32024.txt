I did some work for a organization called the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness. The organization promotes the public's awareness of Celiac Disease and provides a checklist of symptoms of the disease which involves intolerance to foods containing gluten. They conducted a survey on the internet by just opening it up to anyone who wanted to participate. Over the years they collected thousands of responses from the public. However they were hoping to draw conclusions about the general public based on the survey results. I had to tell them that the respondents were selfselected rather than random and this could create bias. Since the degree of bias is unknown we could not do any inference inspite of the large amount of data. Now the respondents seemed to be a peculiar group. Many are very serious and answered to express concern that they or a relative might have the disease. But there also were a distnct number of people answering in a wise-guy fashion. This was obvious from the fake names, strange email addresses and postal addresses that they provided with their answers. I felt that the data was only useful in an exploratory sense and the frequency of responses might be useful for fomrulating hypotheses that could be tested in a well planned future survey. But thus far my advice has not been heeded and they are running another one of these easy to do self selecting surveys on the internet.
