The usage of TOC curves?

In machine learning literature ROC curves are common performance measures. Quite recently published and not as popular (50+ citatations) are TOC curves as proposed by Pontius Jr, Robert Gilmore and Si, Kangping (2014). Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve graphically illustrates TPR and FPR trade-offs as its threshold varies. Total operating characteristic ( TOC ) depicts the underlying confusion matrix for each threshold. "TOC reveals more information than ROC" A confusion matrix seems like an improper performance measure of a model, because its outcome depends on the (implicitly) specified decision rule/threshold. What are reasons for and against TOC statistics in comparison to ROC or Precision-Recall curves? Also, shouldn't confusion matrices be replaced by TOC visualizations?
