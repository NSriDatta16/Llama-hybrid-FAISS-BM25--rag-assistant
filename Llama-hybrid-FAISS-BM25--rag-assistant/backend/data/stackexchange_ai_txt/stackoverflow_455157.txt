Assuming you're talking about trying to replace " and ' with smart quotes automatically: it's not necessarily a good idea. Algorithms to choose the right way for the quotes to face are fragile and can easily be fooled. There is a common formula to do with looking at the character before the quote, which is used by programs such as Office. But they often make mistakes, leaving the text worse off than if one hadn't tried. Sometimes, of course, you don't want smart quotes at all (especially on a site like this where we're talking code). If it's for your own personal typing convenience you could try installing a keyboard layout that allows smart quotes to be typed directly and explicitly. That said, if you must, here's some code to start with... ... function AutoReplacer(element) { // List of replacement rules. Note currently with this simplistic code // replacements should be the same length as the original text. // replacements= [ [' "', ' \u201C'], ['("', ' \u201C'], ['"', '\u201D'] ]; // Only attempt to use replacer behaviour if we can retain the cursor // position. Setting value by default moves the cursor to the end of the // input, which is too irritating. // if (getInputSelection(element)!==null) { element.onkeyup= function() { value= element.value; for (var i= 0; i
