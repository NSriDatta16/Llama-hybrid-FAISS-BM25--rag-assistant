"I'm not ready to commit the changes locally yet." Commits in git are local things that can be undone, redone and re-re-done at will. It's only when you push the commit somewhere that you need to pay attention. Plus, commits are visible to local tools like gitk , and can have diffs taken of them and can be rebased onto other commits, etc. It's a very powerful tool. Learn to use it. I frequently do: git add .; git commit -a -m 'WIP' just to stash away everything in the current work tree if I think I might be interrupted. If I make a few more changes, I use: git add .; git commit --amend to update my "WIP" commit in-place. When I'm finally ready for the real commit, I just: git reset --soft HEAD~; git reset and now I can carefully control what the final commit will be.
