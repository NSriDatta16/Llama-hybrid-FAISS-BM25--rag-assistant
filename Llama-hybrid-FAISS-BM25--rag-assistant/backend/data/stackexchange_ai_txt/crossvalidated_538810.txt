For large data sets, once could use bootstrap aggregation to speed up and gain more accurate estimates. This article is a good exposition on how to do it: https://towardsdatascience.com/bootstrap-regression-in-r-98bfe4ff5007 . For glm , one could replace the lm function in the provided code and use whatever distribution family, whether Poisson, Binomial, etc. For machine learning and other methods more ideal for big data, one can use Elements of Statistical Learning to study the theory: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/ . I'm not familiar with machine learning for R or Stata beyond a few libraries.
