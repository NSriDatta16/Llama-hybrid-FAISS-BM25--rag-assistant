@RAEGTIN, I believe that you think right. After extraction and prior rotation, each successive factor does account for less and less of covariation/correlation, just like each successive component accounts for less and less of variance: in both cases, columns of a loading matrix A go in the order of fall of sum of squared elements (loadings) in them. Loading is correlation bw factor and variable; therefore one may say that the 1st factor explains the greatest portion of "overall" squared r in R matrix, the 2nd factor is second here, etc. The difference between FA and PCA, though, in predicting correlations by loadings is as follows: FA is "calibrated" to restore R quite finely with just m extracted factors (m factors R without error. P.S. Just to add. In FA, a loading value "consists" of clean communality (a part of variance responsible for correlating) while in PCA a loading is a mixture of communality and uniqness of the variable and therefore grabs variability.
