It looks like you're just trying to get a list of parents with a loaded collection, plus some data from other entity, is this correct? In that case: var parents = session.CreateQuery(@" select p, o from Parent p, OtherClass o join fetch p.MappedBagField ...") .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.DistinctRootEntity) .List (); Each item of the result has two elements, [0] is the Parent, [1] is the OtherClass.
