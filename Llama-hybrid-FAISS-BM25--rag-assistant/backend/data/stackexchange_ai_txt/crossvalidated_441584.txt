(This started as a comment to @kjetil nice answer +1.) Just to be clear, before dismissing the "rule-of-10", please check the original publication; Peduzzi et al. (1996) A simulation study of the number of events per variable in logistic regression analysis . It is a very nicely structured paper and lays out a reasonable way of testing the validity of a logistic regression analysis. I have used it in the past to inform how to conduct my own simulation study for my particular problem settings. That is an invaluable insight and should heavily on your choice of minimum sample size. Following that, going through van Smeden et al. (2016) No rationale for 1 variable per 10 events criterion for binary logistic regression analysis is super-helpful to see why this is criticised. If anything, using a biased corrected approached (like Firth's regression (Firth, 1993) , jack-knifing (Bull et al. 1996) , etc.) is very likely preferable to safe guard against separation and/or other finite sample bias issues.
