To visualize what happens, first think about the case where there are two predictors, say height and weight. Then your regression mod,el fits a plane to the data. If you exclude the intercept, you are forcing that plane to pass through the origin, which can tilt it considerably from what it would be if the intercept is included. So by omitting the intercept, you are giving a lot of leverage to the origin, which is often very remote from the data (like height 0 and weight 0). The same ideas apply with 1 predictor, only it's a line -- and with 3 or more predictors, where it's just harder to visualize. And note also with the gender variable you mention included, omitting the intercept from the model has the consequence that the predicted plane for females passes through the origin, while the predicted plane for males does not. And the reverse would be true if you had coded gender the other way. That's an additional reason that it almost always makes sense to include the intercept.
