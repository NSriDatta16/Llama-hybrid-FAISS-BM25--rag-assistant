The best thing to do is use an accelerator of some kind, APC or eAccelerator or something like this to keep them cached in RAM. The reasons behind this are quite a few and on a busy site it means a lost. For example a friend did an experiment on his website which has about 15k users a day and average page load time of 0.03s. He removed most of the includes which he used as templates - the average load time dropped to 0.01 secs. Then he put an accelerator - 0.002 secs per page. I hope those numbers convince you that includes must be kept as little as possible on busy sites if you don't use an accelerator of some kind. This is because of the high I/O which is needed to scan directories, find the files, open them, read them and so on. So keep the includes to minimum. Study the most important parts of your site and optimize there by moving required parts to general includes and so on.
