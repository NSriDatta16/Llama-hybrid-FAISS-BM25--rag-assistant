The new Enterprise Library Silverlight Integration Pack provides you with capabilities of caching on the client. 2 types of data caching are supported: in-memory and to isolated storage. You'll also get flexibility of configuration of the expiration policies (programmatically or via external config) and a config tool support. Note: it's a code preview now, but should be releasing as final in May.
