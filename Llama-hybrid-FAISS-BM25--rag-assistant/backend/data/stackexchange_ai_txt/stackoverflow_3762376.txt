Selenium IDE: Click on a particular item by name (not the XPath)

I've recorded a Test Case in Selenium IDE where I access to a newspaper and click on a certain element (a link to a blog by KEITH DUGGAN). The commands recorded are these: open | http://www.irishtimes.com/ clickAndWait | link=Sport clickAndWait | //div[@id='content']/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/ul/li[3]/a/span http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/8971/seleniumtest.jpg The problem I see with this, is that if the order of the blogs displayed are changed, my Test Case won't work anymore, because instead of accessing to KEITH DUGGAN's blog it will access to a different one. Is there a way I can tell Selenium that I want to access to KEITH DUGGAN's blog and not the third blog in a list? Basically, I want to access to an item by its text linked and not the possition (XPath)
