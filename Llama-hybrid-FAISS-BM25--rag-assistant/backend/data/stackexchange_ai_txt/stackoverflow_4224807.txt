c++. libxml2. are replaced to INSIDE tags

I'm writing a library that creates xml tree from given data. The problem is that the data contains tags inside nodes. for example "this is a very huge text" quotes - just to separate text given to me=) When I create an xml using libxml and then write it to console (using xmlDumpMEmeory) I get: this is a very &lt;bold&gt;huge&lt;/bold&gt; text I understand why it's so but have no ideas how to fix that normally. The only solution I see is to manually replace in my ::ToString() But are there any other symbols (like ) that I should replace? Thx for attention
