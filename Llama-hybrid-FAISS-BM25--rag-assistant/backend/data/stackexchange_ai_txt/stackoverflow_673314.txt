Place your image within a UIImageView, then either subclass that view and replace touchesBegan:withEvent: or set a delegate for it and implement the same method as a delegate method. This will give you the ability to respond to touch events (the beginning of a touch, in this case, although you can do the same for ending a touch or moving of the finger). Within this touch handling method, you can implement something similar to what I describe here in order to perform a Core-Animation-enabled rotation of your UIImageView at a given speed. To alter the speed, change the duration property on the animation I provide. As I suggest there, you may want to look into a CAKeyframeAnimation to do a smoother animation with acceleration and deceleration at the beginning and end.
