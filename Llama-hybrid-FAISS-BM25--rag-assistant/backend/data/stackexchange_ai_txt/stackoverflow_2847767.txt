I guess you would have to use the maven shade plugin (see link below) Either build an Ãœber-jar that includes your dependency minus the persistence-xml or just transform the dependency into something new that does not have the persistence.xml. This should be the way to go: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/resource-transformers.html Sean
