What tooling do you use to do Design by Contract?

I used to use Microsoft CodeContracts for three weeks and now half of my code is just contracts. I have dozens of unproved places, I cannot use runtime-check because IL rewrite prevents coverage tool to show something and compile time is less then acceptable. I do not like this. And seems now is a good time to ask a help. What tooling do use use for your regualr developments?
