Many paints will take place on the same image. Windows fires the Paint event whenever part of the control needs to be repainted. Like when you drag another window across the PB. Or minimize and restore the form. In other words, Paint doesn't tell you that the image changed. You'll need to derive your own class from PictureBox and override the Image property. The setter will be called when the image is changed.
