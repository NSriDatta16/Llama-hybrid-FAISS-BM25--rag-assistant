UIViewController vs. UIView - which one should create subviews?

I'm trying to wrap my head around the roles of UIViews and UIViewControllers. If I'm creating and inserting subviews programmatically, is it typical to do this from the view or the controller? I'm really just wondering if there's a convention/pattern for this. In my sample application, I'm loading 50 images at runtime, adding them as subviews to the main view, then letting the user drag them around the screen. I'm currently doing all the initialization in the view's initWithCoder: - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder*)coder { if (self = [super initWithCoder:coder]) { // load UIImageViews and add them to the subview } return self; } The view also implements touchesBegan/touchesMoved to allow dragging. My problem comes when I try to access [self frame].size in initWithCoder, it doesn't seem to be initialized yet. This makes me think I may be loading the images in the wrong place...
