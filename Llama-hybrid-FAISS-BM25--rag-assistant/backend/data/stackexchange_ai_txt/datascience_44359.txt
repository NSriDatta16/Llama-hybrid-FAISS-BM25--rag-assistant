Is there a clustering algorithm that can cluster time series dataset based on variation ratio (or quantity)?

I am learning machine learning from scikit-learn and reading its docs. Clustering clusters groups based on the Euclidean distance and filters them by different ways ex: Gaussian distribution, or mean-shift...etc. But none of the clustering algorithms cluster samples based on the variation ratio. EX: below every items has there sold numbers of everyday. Item,D1,D2 A,1,5 B,10,50 C,4,70 The variation ratio below: A:500% B:500% C:1750% So A and B are the same group, C isn't. Are there any clustering algorithms that can cluster time series dataset based on variation ratio (or quantity)?
