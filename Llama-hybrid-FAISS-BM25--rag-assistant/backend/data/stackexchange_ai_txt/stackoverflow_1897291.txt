Looks like you've got an INI file of some kind... The best way to read these is using the *PrivateProfile* functions of the windows API, which means you can actually have a proper full INI file quite easily for anything you need. There is a wrapper class here you may like to use. Microsoft recommends that you use the registry to store this sort of information though, and discourages use of INI files. If you wish to just use a file manually with the syntax you have, it is a simple case of splitting the string on '=' and put the results into a Dictionary. Remember to handle cases where the data was not found in the file and you need a default/error. In modern times though, XML is becoming a lot more popular for data text files, and there are lots of libraries to deal with loading from these.
