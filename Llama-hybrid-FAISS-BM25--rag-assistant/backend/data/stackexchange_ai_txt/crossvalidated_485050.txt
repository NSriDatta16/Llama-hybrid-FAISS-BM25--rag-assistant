With respect to AIC, the Wikipedia page says: AIC can be used to form a foundation of statistics that is distinct from both frequentism and Bayesianism. Convincing a reader that you can use the AIC to choose among non-nested models depends on the reader's appreciating what AIC means.* Someone with that level of statistical sophistication will probably already be convinced that a search for a "better" cutoff of a continuous predictor is not worth the effort. I'm struck that even the simple linear form for the continuous predictor used for model1 seems to outperform both cutoffs of model2 and model3 in terms of the AIC. Such a reader would certainly appreciate a more sophisticated modeling of the continuous predictor. For example, with a spline fit of that predictor you could use standard tests of nested models to come up with a useful nonlinear relationship. Maybe such modeling will find a value of the predictor at which the hazard changes rapidly, which might be used to argue for a cutoff, but even then the continuous model should contain more information. A plot of the continuous relationship of the predictor to outcome should be highly convincing even to those who would prefer to believe in cutoffs. With respect to the Fine test, I don't see a discrepancy in the results (although I'm not an expert on that). The Fine test tries to determine which of a set of models might be closest to a "true" model. As I understand it, you can tell that your model2 and model3 differ from each other (the first reported test), but the Fine test can't determine that either of them is closer to the "true" model than the other (the second set of tests). Maybe they are in some sense on different "sides" of the "true" model yet equally far away from it. *For reference, with nested models that might also be evaluated by chi-square tests, the AIC criterion is equivalent to a p-value cutoff of 0.157 versus the traditional value of 0.05. Also, as discussed on the page you linked , not all are convinced that the AIC is suitable for selecting among non-nested models.
