Computing C90 ellipse area for two dimensional time series data

I am trying to determine the area of the ellipse which contains the true mean of $(X_n, Y_n)_{1\leq n \leq N}$ with a probability of 90%. The 90% confidence ellipse area, or C90 area. The sample consists of N = 3000 $X,Y$ coordinate pairs. The problem is that definitions I've come across differ in how they end up calculating the actual area of this ellipse. After assuming this and that about the sample ( distribution etc ), the main steps are as follows : Determine the covariance matrix of the sample. In this case its a $2\times 2$ matrix Determine the eigenvalues of this matrix $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ The square roots of the eigenvalues correspond to the axes of the ellipse. Hence the area can be calculated as $C90 = \pi\chi^2\sqrt{\lambda_1\lambda_2}$ , where $\chi^2=4.605$ Step 3 is the one I'm confused about. I've looked at a couple of sources and each seems to compute the area differently. Some sources also claim that this corresponds to the area of the prediction ellipse, not the confidence ellipse. My question is whether this 3 step procedure to find the C90 area is correct, or is this the area of the prediction ellipse. Edit : updated my definition of the C90 area.
