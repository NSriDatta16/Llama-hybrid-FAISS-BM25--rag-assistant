Looks like you've added to the config (probably in a module's config.xml file) to enable your new payment method. Magento is trying to load a class for your payment method, but because the class it wants doesn't exist, it is erroring out. Please provide the XML changes you've made and any new models you've defined as part of the module. Thanks! Joe
