The model output does not underestimate systematically the historical data: it underpredicts/underestimates high prices and overpredicts low prices. This is exactly what we should expect from a, say, optimal in terms of Mean Squared-Error, estimation/forecast function to do : Optimal forecasts "represent a shrinkage towards the mean", and have lower variability than the actual data. This can be easily shown as follows: Denote $X$ the actual series $f$ its forecast and $e$ the forecast error, and $X = f+e$. If $f$ is MSE-optimal, it is efficient, and so "no information is left unexplored", which in technical terms means that $f$ is uncorrelated with $e$, and also, that no systematic error occurs, so $E(e) =0$. We have $$\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname{Var}(f)+\operatorname{Var}(e)$$ which necessarily implies that $$\operatorname{Var}(f) Such kind of forecasts/estimations are optimal "on average" and "in the long run", and may tend not to work very well with high-frequency data, or when you are after short-term optimization... Perhaps one could visually "detect" the possibility that the model output could exhibit the same variability but be shifted higher along the vertical axis, (i.e. that there may be a downward bias in estimating the long-term mean of the process), but this is just a matter of having a constant term in the estimation function, nothing more... I believe that you can see that your question is very general for us to provide a truly useful answer. You will have to provide much more specific information, about the characteristics of the real data you try to estimate/forecast, and about the estimation/forecast methods that you are using.
