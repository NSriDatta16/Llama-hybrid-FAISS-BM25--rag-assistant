Interpreting ACF and Partial ACF Plots with Python

I have time series data which is measured in each 5 second. I am trying to forecast the data. But, ACF and PACF results are seems to different than other plot that I have seen. I am using statsmodels as a library like below. from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_pacf plot_pacf(ts, lags = 40, method = "ols"); from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf plot_acf(ts, lags = 50); What I need to interpret with these plots?
