When plotting lines, you should watch out for green and yellow, which don't display well on projectors. Since I eventually re-use most of my plots in presentations, I avoid these colours even if the original intention is for screen or paper publication. In the interests of maintaining high contrast, that leaves me with black, red, blue, magenta, cyan and if I really need it I use grey. Indeed, most of these are bright, primary or secondary colours. I know it might not be optimal from an aesthetic point of view, but I'm more interested in the clarity of what I'm presenting. On the other hand, consistently reusing the same colours from a limited palette can be a good thing aesthetically. If you're using more than 6 lines, you're filling up more space and moving towards plotting blocks of colour. For these kinds of plot I think each case needs to be considered separately. Do you want the extremes to stand out, or the zero-crossings? Is your data cyclical (e.g. 0 and 2Ï€ should use the same colour)? Is there an analogy to standards such as blue/red for temperature? Does white represent NaN, no data, or will it be used as a highlight? etcetc.
