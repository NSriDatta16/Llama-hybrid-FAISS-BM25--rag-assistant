Multivariate testing

I'm going to run a test with 4 different variants (3 variants and a control group), and we want to find the variant with the highest conversion. Are there any resources/methods in R/python to: Perform a test to tell if a variant converts significantly better than the others? Calculate sample size before performing this test? Either frequentist or Bayesian methods work for me, thanks! The context is that the amount of data is not huge, I have around 5000 users every month in that funnel.
