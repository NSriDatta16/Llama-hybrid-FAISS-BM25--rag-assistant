Where the term `cross-attention` is first used? (couldn't find the term in attention is all you need paper)

I am looking for the paper that first used the term cross-attention . I carefully read the paper Attention is all you need (NeurIPS 2017) but couldn't find the term cross-attention . I understand that cross-attention could be seen as a modification of self-attention in terms of query, key, and value, but I want to find the exact sentence that first used the term cross-attention . Thank you very much. noted picture
