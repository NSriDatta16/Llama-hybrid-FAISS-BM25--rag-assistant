It seems you have quite serious code design issues. Besides many signs of such issues, one is the circular unit reference. But as you said: you cannot refactor all the code. Move all what is possible to the implementation section. They are allowed to have circular references. To simplify this task you can use 3rd party tools. I would recommend Peganza Pascal Analyzer - it will suggest what you can move to the implementation section. And will give you many more hints to improve your code quality.
