JFreechart Rendering a timeseries on a tick scale

I have a timeseries of data which i'd like to plot on a tick scale rather than a time scale. e.g. If the series contains points received at times: 10, 15, 30, 100. Instead of plotting these against a regular time series axis where the distance between the 30 and 100 point would be 70, i'd like the distance between each of these points to be 1 unit . Essentially I want to plot the points at the points index in the underlying dataset. Can this be easily done in JFreechart. I've had a go at implementing my own Timeline but it's getting messy. I'd also like the labels to reflect the time and not the tick number.
