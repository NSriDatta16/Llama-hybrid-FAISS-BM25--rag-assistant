Trapping Error Status in MSBuild

As part of some build automation of running xUnit.net tests with MSBuild , I'm running into a case where I need to loop over a batch of items. Inside the loop, I need to detect whether an iteration failed, but I want to continue executing regardless. Then after the batched bit, I need to know whether one or more errors have occurred in order to report the outcome to TeamBuild. IOW, in pseudocode: Task Name=RunTests CreateItems ForEach item CallTarget Target=RunTest ContinueOnError=true CombineNUnitResults Report success/failure Task Name=RunTest XUnit item I'm hoping this can be achieved without a custom task (or hacking the xunit.net MSBuild task as Jonne did). (But willing to use MSBuild Community or Sdc tasks) And @BradWilson: I this is isnt possible to do cleanly, I'll be looking for Jonne's change a la the NUnit task to also make it into the xunit task See also: How do I get Team Build to show test results and coverage for xUnit.net test suite?
