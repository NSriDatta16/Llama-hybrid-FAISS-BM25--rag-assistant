Embedding HTML into an email via MAPI32

I have a program in C# that has a call: myEmail.SendMailPopup("Hi", "This is my email body"); which uses MAPI32.DLL to open an Outlook email with the subject of Hi and a body of This is my email body. However, when I send it HTML, such as myEmail.SendMailPopup("Hi", " Bold text "); the message body contains what it literally in the quotation marks. Is there a way to parse this HTML to show "Bold text" in bold? Thanks.
