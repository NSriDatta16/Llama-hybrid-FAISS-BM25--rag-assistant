I'm making a few assumptions here, but it looks like you're using the autocomplete plugin incorrectly. You are attaching to the change event on a textbox, and based on the name of that textbox I'm assuming you're looking to use autocomplete for search suggestions based on what the user inputs. If that is the case, then you simply need to attach the autocomplete functionality to the textbox in this way: $(document).ready(function() { $("#tbSearch").autocomplete("AgentList.aspx/LoadData"); }); The plugin will take care of the AJAX request â€” you don't have to.
