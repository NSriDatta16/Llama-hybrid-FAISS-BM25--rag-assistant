You can use whatever multi-category supervised classification algorithm you like, for example multinomial logistic regression or trees (but not linear regression or binary logistic regression). Make sure you use training/evaluation/test set or a type of cross validation, though. (Also, if there is no specific relationship between predictors and target as you say, then your classification will most likely perform poorly).
