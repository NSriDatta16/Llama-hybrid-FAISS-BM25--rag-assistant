They are not perfectly collinear, but they are collinear to a problematic degree: set.seed(123) gdp The largest condition index is 21, which isn't outrageous but isn't good. And all the IVs have variance decomposition proportions over 0.75, which is also not good. So, you should leave one of the IVs out, both for the logic of the model and for colinearity.
