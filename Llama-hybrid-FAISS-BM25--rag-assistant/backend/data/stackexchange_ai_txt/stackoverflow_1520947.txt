NHibernate queries return multiple copies of the target objects

I have two classes mapped in NHibernate: Dragon and its subclass FierceDragon , with a few FierceDragon s stored stored in a table called Dragons . When I run an HQL query like from Dragon... I get back two objects per row: the expected FierceDragon and an ordinary Dragon that's a copy of the FierceDragon (insofar as is possible; naturally it lacks the FierceDragon 's extra Ferocity and TimeSinceLastMeal properties). In particular, their IDs are identical. When I do from FierceDragon I get only FierceDragon s, with no extra copies, but that won't work for me in general. Why does this happen, and how can I prevent it?
