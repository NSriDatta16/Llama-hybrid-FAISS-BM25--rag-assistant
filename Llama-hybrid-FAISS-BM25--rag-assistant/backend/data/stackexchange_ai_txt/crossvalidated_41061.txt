Let's start with the definition of a confidence interval. If I say that a 95% confidence interval goes from this to that I mean that statements of that nature will be true about 95% of the time and false about 5% of the time. I do not necessarily mean that I am 95% confident about this particular statement. A 90% confidence interval will be narrower and an 80% narrower still. Therefore, when wondering what the true value is, I have less credence in values as they get closer and closer to the edge of any particular confidence interval. Note that all of the above is qualitative, especially "credence". (I avoided the term "confidence" or "likelihood" in that statement because they carry mathematical baggage that may differ from our intuitive baggage.) Bayesian approaches would rephrase your question to something that has a quantitative answer but I don't want to open that can of worms here. Box, Hunter & Hunter's classic text ("Statistics for Experimenters", Wiley, 1978) may also help. See "Sets of Confidence Intervals" on pp 113, ff.
