It is not the same as taking the weighted 70/30 average of the output predictions, because logistic regression uses a nonlinear transform of $X'\hat{\beta}$ to form its predictions. Let us assume we have one independent predictor $X$ that takes on values in $\{0,1\}$ . Let's further assume the coefficient estimate equals $1$ . We then have: $$\begin{eqnarray} p(y=1 | x=1) = {e^{1} \over 1+e^1} = 0.731...\\ p(y = 1 | x = 0) = {1 \over 1+e^1} = 0.269...\\ \end{eqnarray}$$ The 70/30 weighted average of these two numbers is 0.5924. This would, as Frank Harrell suggested in a comment to the OP, be the correct calculation. But $$ p(y = 1 | x = 0.7) = 0.668...$$
