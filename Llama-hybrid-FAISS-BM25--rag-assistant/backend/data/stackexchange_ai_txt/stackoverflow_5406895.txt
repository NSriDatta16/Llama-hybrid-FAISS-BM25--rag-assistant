Detecting GPS coordinates properly is always an issue in Android. After trying lots of stuff I finally saw how the Android camera app was embedding the coordinates in the clicked image. The best thing to do is to register for both NETWORK_PROVIDER and GPS_PROVIDER and keep minDistance as 0 when you request for location updates. It usually takes some time to get a GPS fix, so if something in your activity depends on the location, then check for a location after say every 250ms. To get the location you first check if you have a fix from the GPS and then from the network provider.
