what is the default action happening when we drag over an image?

What is the default action happening when we drag over an image ? When I drag over an image the cursor changes to a black circle with a line inside (in Firefox) I could block it by the code e.preventDefault() using jquery, but I didn't understand what is the default action happening when I drag over an image. Thanks
