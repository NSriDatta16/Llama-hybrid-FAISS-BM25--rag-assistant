I would recommend a dotchart-type of plot. In R: set.seed(1) mins The dots give the average of minima and maxima, and the horizontal lines give the ranges. It should be immediately understandable to your audience. You may want to order participants in ascending or descending order of the minimum (or maximum or mean) - however, this might indicate spurious structure, so whether this is useful will depend on what you want to do. Or you may want to group the dots in some way, or possibly color-code them.
