I do like to work on the keyboard alone. Why? Because when you use the mouse you have to grab it. A time loss. On the other hand sometimes it seems that every application has its own keyboard type-rates built in. Not to speak from BIOS-properties or OS-settings. So I gathered shortkeys which can be pretty fast (i.e. you are faster typing Ctrl + right(arrow)-right-right than keeping your finger on the right(arrow) key :). Here are some keyboard shortcuts I find most valuable (it works on Windows; I am not sure about OS X): ctrl-right: Go to the end of the previous/the next word (stated before) ctrl-left: Go to the beginning of the previous/the word before (stated before) ctrl-up: Go to the beginning of this paragraph (or to the next paragraph over this) ctrl-down: Go to the end of this paragraph (or to the next paragraph after this) ctrl-pos1: Go to the beginning of the file ctrl-end: Go to the end of the file All these may be combined with the shift-key, so that the text is selected while doing so. Now let's go for more weird stuff: alt-esc: Get the actual application into the background ctrl-esc: This is like pressing the "start-button" in Windows: You can navigate with arrow keys or shortcuts to start programs from here ctrl-l: While using Firefox this accesses the URL-entry-field to simply type URLs (does not work on Stack Overflow :) ctrl-tab, ctrl-pageup ctrl-pagedwn Navigate through tabs (even in your development environment) So these are the most used shortcuts I need while programming.
