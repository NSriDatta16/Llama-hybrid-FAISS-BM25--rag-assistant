Maybe the conductance of the Markov chain is the right notion to look at. Let $P\in[0,1]^{n\times n}$ be a transition matrix with stationary distribution $\pi$ (in your cases, $\pi$ is always the uniform distribution). The conductance of $P$ is $$\Phi(P):=\min_{S\subset [n], \pi(S)\le\frac{1}{2}}\frac{\sum_{i\in S,j\in S^c} \pi(i)\cdot P_{i,j}}{\pi(S)}.$$ See for example "Conductance and Rapidly Mixing Markov Chains" by James King. Your examples yield $\Phi(A)=0.5$, $\Phi(B)=0.1$, and $\Phi(C)=0.99$.
