Overfitting GBM by simultaneously adding trees and lowering learning rate?

I understand that you can overfit a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) by using too many trees (unlike random forest), and also that you can overfit a GBM by using too high of a learning rate. My question is, if I simultaneously lower the learning rate and increase the number of trees in an inversely proportionate manner, could I expect to change the amount of overfitting in a predictable way? More precisely, could I expect this to decrease the extent of overfitting?
