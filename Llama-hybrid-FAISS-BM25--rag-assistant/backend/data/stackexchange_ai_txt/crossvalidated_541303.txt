You've correctly identified that the shaded region is likely a confidence interval (the confidence level is unknown but it is reasonable to assume it is 95%). how do I interpret the coloured area The interpretation of a confidence interval remains a hotly contested matter in many circles. We can start with a definition. A 95% confidence interval is an interval estimator which has the property that 95% of the time it is constructed (from the same data generating processes, under ideal conditions) it will contain the true estimand. Suppose we are regression $y$ onto $x$ and we are interested in estimating the conditional mean of $y$ given $x=x_0$ . This would simply be $\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_0$ . However, our estimate might change from sample to sample (because our sample changes). If we repeated the experiment which generated the pairs $(x,y)$ which were used to fit the model ad infinitum and computed the confidence intervals, then on average 95% of them would contain the true conditional mean $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ . Now, one could understand if this is not a satisfactory explanation of how to interpret the interval. One popular method I like for interpretation of a given interval (and one that appears here, in this very lengthy and quality discussion on the matter ) is that the confidence interval provides us with values of the parameter (or in this case, the conditional mean) which are compatible with the observed data.
