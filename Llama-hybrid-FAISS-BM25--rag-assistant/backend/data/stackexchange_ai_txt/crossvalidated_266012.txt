Is there any way to extend kernel smoothing regression for extrapolation.

Kernel smoother is a typical non-parametric regression method that can be used well for interpolation. However, it can not predict the data outside the range of training data. Why ? If we have a look at the prediction function : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_smoother The prediction function $\hat{Y}(x_0)$ on the provided link will be the average of positively weighted training output. Therefore, $\hat{Y}(x_0)$ can not go over the range of training output. Is there any way to modify kernel smoothing regression for extrapolation ? Thanks
