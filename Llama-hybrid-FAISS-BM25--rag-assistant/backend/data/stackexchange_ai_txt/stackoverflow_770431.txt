I often find that with questions starting "Is it best to" that there's usually a someone and a sometime involved (a kind of pragmatics type thinking - whome and in what context) Different contexts will offer up different pro's and con's for each of the scenarios you've presented here and depending on who requires what functionality may also sway your choice. With regard to the "who" part there may be other questions you'll be asking yourself about the process you're going through. Is it my users that require admin access, is it my development team, is it the managing director with little I.T. experience etc etc. Questions about the medium used may also play a role in the decision you make. Are the "admin" people going to be on a PC, sales reps on-the-road using a palmtop which might suit it's own software application etc.
