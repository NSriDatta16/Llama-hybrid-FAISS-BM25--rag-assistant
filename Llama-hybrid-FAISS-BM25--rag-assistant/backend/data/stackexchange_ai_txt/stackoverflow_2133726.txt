From the documentation : If the size of post data is greater than post_max_size, the $_POST and $_FILES superglobals are empty . This can be tracked in various ways, e.g. by passing the $_GET variable to the script processing the data, i.e. , and then checking if $_GET['processed'] is set. So unfortunately, it doesn't look like PHP sends an error. And since it sends am empty $_POST array, that is why your script is going back to the blank form - it doesn't think it is a POST. (Quite a poor design decision IMHO) This commenter also has an interesting idea. It seems that a more elegant way is comparison between post_max_size and $_SERVER['CONTENT_LENGTH']. Please note that the latter includes not only size of uploaded file plus post data but also multipart sequences.
