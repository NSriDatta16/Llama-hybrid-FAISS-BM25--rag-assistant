I recommend breaking them into separate methods, where each method takes care of one small task, and have a descriptive for each private method. Breaking the methods up and the method names would make the logic code more readable! Compare: double average(double[] numbers) { double sum = 0; for (double n : numbers) { sum += n; } return sum / numbers.length; } to: double sum(double[] numbers) { double sum = 0; for (double n : numbers) sum += n; return sum; } double average(double[] numbers) { return sum(numbers) / numbers.length; } Code Complete addresses the interface that each class exposes, not the implementation. It may make more sense to make those smaller methods as package protected, so you can easily unit test them, instead being able to test the complicated RunLogic only.
