Magento Installation error..redirects to localhost?

I am unable to login into magento admin. In magento, (in newest release..) it needs proper domain to login ...but how it is possible in a local machine... I found some solution ...in magento forum here... http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/4337/P15/ They asked to change localhost to http://127.0.0.1 but when tried it redirects to localhost...?!
