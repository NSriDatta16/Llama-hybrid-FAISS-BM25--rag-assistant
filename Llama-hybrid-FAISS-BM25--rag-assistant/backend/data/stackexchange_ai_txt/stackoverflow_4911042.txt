Positioning textboxes over 'login box' background image

I have a 'background graphic' which is basically a design with two premade 'white boxes' where I would like to position my login/password textboxes. Stubbornly they refused to move from the top left of that image. I'm using 960 grid system but I think the question probably isn't affected by that. I've tried various things - trying absolute positioning, padding/margin settings. Even in visual studio I used the menus (gasp!) to select position as absolute and dragged the box down. In the designer it looked to be in the right spot, css had been added but in the browser, there it was at the top left again. Any suggestions before my computer learns about a new type of 'windows'? My goal is to be able to specify the x,y coordinates of where each textbox should be. I'd rather not resort to slicing and tables and all that stuff. The css is the standard grid960 setup, I won't post it due to size. For the box containing the login image: #loginPanel { background: url('/images/Main_Login2.png'); height: 300px; } [have put various positioning settings against #loginPanel and #txtLogin but no luck so far] The markup: Any help appreciated!
