For production code, I generally prefer C++. Even if you don't plan to go all out with OO, generics and metaprogramming, you can use C++ as a better C (in this case, just to get std::stack for free). If you have to use C, try to keep it simple and make pragmatic choices based on your particular circumstance. For instance, if you know for sure that your stack is bounded to some small limit and the data you're holding is simple, then your stack code could be as simple as stack[tos++] = x; and return stack[--tos] without needing a reusable library. The answers suggesting a library based on void* are also appropriate under different circumstances. C++'s std::stack pretty much solves this problem once and for all; C doesn't quite give you that luxury.
