At the time window is loaded the body isn't still loaded therefore you should correct your code in the following manner: window.onload = function(){ window.document.body.onload = doThis; // note removed parentheses }; function doThis() { if (document.getElementById("myParagraph")) { alert("It worked!"); } else { alert("It failed!"); } } Tested to work in FF/IE/Chrome, although thinking about handling document.onload too. As already mentioned, using js-frameworks will be a far better idea.
