The issue with using correlation measures for time series, is that one doesn't know whether those correlations are statistically significant or simply a function of time. For instance, if one analyses the movement of oil and the S&P 500 index over a period of 50 years, one will generally find a strong correlation between the two series. However, this does not indicate that the movement is necessarily statistically significant - it simply means that the two series have trended upwards over time - as we would expect over the longer-term. So, how can one determine whether a correlation is significant or due to chance? The way we can test for this is by determining if two time series are cointegrated . A cointegrated pair is one where the movements between two time series are statistically significant, i.e. not simply due to chance. Imagine a drunk woman walking with her dog on a leash. The two might walk in opposite directions at times, but because the dog is on a leash, the woman and the dog will ultimately end up going in the same directions. If you are using R, the coint.test available from the aTSA package is a good way of testing for cointegration using the Engle-Granger method. Consider the following variables X and y: X A cointegration test is run for X and y: coint.test(y,X) Here are the generated results: Response: y Input: X Number of inputs: 2 Model: y ~ X + 1 ------------------------------- Engle-Granger Cointegration Test alternative: cointegrated Type 1: no trend lag EG p.value 4.00 -4.76 0.01 ----- Type 2: linear trend lag EG p.value 4.000 0.555 0.100 ----- Type 3: quadratic trend lag EG p.value 4.0 -1.9 0.1 ----------- Note: p.value = 0.01 means p.value = 0.10 We can see that we have a p-value 0.05. In this regard, this indicates that no trend exists between the two time series, and they are not cointegrated . If you have access to R, you might find the above of use in checking for the existence of cointegration between volume and proportion.
