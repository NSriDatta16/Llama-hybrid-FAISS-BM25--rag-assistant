This is not a straightforward task using plain javascript, because you have to trace the div's ancestry and sum the relative positions until you find an absolutely positioned div. On the other hand, this task is quite trivial with a javascript library such as jQuery or Prototype. In jQuery, for example, $(myDiv).offset() returns the div's position relative to the document. If you also include jQuery UI , and make your main div a "Draggable", and all other divs "Droppable", all you need is hook up on the Droppable's over event to get notified when the main div is dragged over the other one.
