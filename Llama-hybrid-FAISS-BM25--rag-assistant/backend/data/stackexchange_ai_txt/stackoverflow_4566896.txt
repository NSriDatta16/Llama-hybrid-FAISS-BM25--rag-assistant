I believe that "aura" is caused by anti aliasing. The technique averages pixels with their neighbors. I realize you don't seem to be using OpenGL but this chapter might help explain some of the theory. Wish I had a better answer, but hopefully this points you in the right direction. My first attempt would be to disable Antialiasing since it seems to do more harm than good. There is probably a better solution than that though.
