If you need to leverage the userID(guid) from your Membership database then you are going to have to create a skeleton account when they first login, then figure out some mechanism of rotating a fresh password on subsequent logins. This password would obviously be for your Membership provider and would be transparent. Now the fun part is finding metadat that is common? HMM e-mail address maybe? I am working on this dilemma as well with facebook connect. I have to have a userid to tie them to the classified postings in my database. Fun stuff. Just an update. I got this working nicely. I created a table CREATE TABLE [dbo].[OAuthUsers] ( [OuthUserID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, [UserID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL, [access_token] [varchar](150) NULL, [expires_in] [datetime2](7) NULL, [refresh_token] [varchar](150) NULL, [issued_at] [datetime2](7) NULL, [user_id] [varchar](50) NOT NULL, [domain] [varchar](50) NULL, [scope] [varchar](150) NULL, CONSTRAINT [PK_OAuthUsers] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ) Store the access_token for facebook or openid. OpenID has a refresh token you can ask for, so store it as well I have an ashx handler as my redirect_url. In that handler you can do all of the processing for each case, user already has an account in provider database, user does not have an account in provider database so we create one. All that neat crap :) Have fun with it.
