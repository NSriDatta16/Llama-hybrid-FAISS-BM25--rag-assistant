I'll begin briefly with the headline news before addressing other parts of your question. There is nothing necessarily wrong with your model. A p value of approximately 1 suggests that there is almost certainly no significant three-way interaction in your model. That being said, there are a few components of your question worth unpacking. First, to borrow from your example, an interaction model is not testing whether two lines cross. It is testing whether two lines are different. There are several ways in which two lines may not cross but still differ in their slopes. This is all to say that two lines crossing over is not an appropriate criteria to use when evaluating the presence of an interaction. However, if there is an interaction, plotting the effects is useful for interpretation. The second aspect of your example that deserves consideration is what it is the lines represent. Whether testing a continuous or categorical interaction, the lines plotted invariably represent mean differences or associations or change. While knowing these sorts of average estimates is useful, inferential statistics require that we also think about and model the error associated with our sample-based statistics. Though we may be able to calculate the average differences for subgroups in our analyses for instance, we also have to admit to some degree of uncertainty in those estimates when we want to make inferences about populations. What is missing from your plots in a sense then are confidence intervals. For an example from some of my own work see below: The inclusion of error bars provides some sense of the degree to which we are uncertain about our estimates. It also lets us know where significant differences do and do not exist (which again is only really useful when there is a significant interaction that requires probing). Finally, one last aspect of your question worth noting is that three-way interactions are particularly hard to detect and often most analyses that attempt such analyses are wildly under-powered. I would be sure that your analysis has sufficient statistical power before attempting the inclusion of a three-way interaction.
