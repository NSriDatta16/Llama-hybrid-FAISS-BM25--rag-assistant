Are there any benefits of suspending a thread over making it wait?

I was going through a legacy code and found that the code uses SuspendThread Function to suspend the execution of a worker thread. Whenever the worker thread needs to process a request, the calling thread resumes this worker thread. Once the task is done the thread suspends itself. I donâ€™t know why it was done this way. According to me it could have been done more elegantly using an Event object with WaitForSingleObject API. My question is, what are the benefits (if any) of suspending a thread as compared to making a thread wait on a synchronization object? In which scenarios would you prefer SuspendThread, ResumeThread APIs?
