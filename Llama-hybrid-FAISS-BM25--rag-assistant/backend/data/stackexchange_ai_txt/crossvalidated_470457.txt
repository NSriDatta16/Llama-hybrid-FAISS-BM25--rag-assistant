Here is a paper talking about using t-test with extremely small sample size "Using the Student's t-test with extremely small sample sizes" . For the normality part here is something I found on Wikipedia For exactness, the t-test and Z-test require normality of the sample means, and the t-test additionally requires that the sample variance follows a scaled Ï‡2 distribution, and that the sample mean and sample variance be statistically independent. The normality of the individual data values is not required if these conditions are met. Notice the sample mean in the above text refers to the average of cell means in your case. Let's denote the mean value of each cell is $C_i$ . Here 'i' only ranges from 1 to 5. The number of cells can't guarantee $\bar{C}$ to have a normal distribution. It would be easier if $C_i$ s are $i.i.d$ normal. When you calculate the mean value of each cell (assuming samples in each cell across the entire group are from the same population), $C_i$ s are $i.i.d$ normal by CLT. Although median can follow CLT in some case (Please see Central limit theorem for sample medians for detail), using mean works in the most general setting.
