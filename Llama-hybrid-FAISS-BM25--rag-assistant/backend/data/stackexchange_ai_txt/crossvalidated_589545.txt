Can I combine dichotomous and continuous outcomes into a single regression model?

I am doing analysis on an educational product that aims to predict what impacts whether or not a student gets a question correct or incorrect. The DV includes item scores from four different question types. For two question types, True/False and Multiple choice, the value per item is dichotomous, i.e 0 or 1. However, for the other question types, the value returned for each item ranges from 0 to 1, i.e. the value is continuous. My understanding is that psychometricians refer to these types of items as polytomous. My question is whether all of these question types can be included in a single predictive model, or whether this violates certain assumptions. Also what type of model would you recommend? Linear regression, logistic regression with weighting, decision tree, something else? For more context, some of the independent variables are length of the question, number of choices, subject, grade level, etc. (Edit starts here) For question types that had a score of 0 or 1, then a logistic regression would make sense. For the other "continuous" type, a linear regression may make sense. I would prefer to run a single predictive model to facilitate comparisons in my independent variables. For example, I'd like to know if math content is more difficult than English content. I would also control for question type. A proposed model might look something like: score ~ question_type + subject + grade_level + item_seen_before Regarding the levels of the controls and IVs, they look like: question_type: 4 levels subject: 2 levels--Math and English grade_level: 3 levels--elementary, middle, high school item_seen_before: Dichotomous--yes/no Thanks in advance for any assistance.
