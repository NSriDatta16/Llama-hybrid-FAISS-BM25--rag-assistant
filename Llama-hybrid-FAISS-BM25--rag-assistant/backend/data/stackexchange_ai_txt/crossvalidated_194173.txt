What does make SVM a "soft computing" method?

Soft computing is defined in [1] by the capability of " operating with uncertain, imprecise and incomplete information in a manner that reflects human thinking ". So, based on my limited understanding, SVM is not a soft computing method as it is not intrinsically capable of dealing with imprecise information like it is the case with fuzzy logic, for example. I assume that I am wrong. If so, what are the properties and capabilities of SVM that makes it a "soft computing" method? [1]: Negnevitsky, Michael.
