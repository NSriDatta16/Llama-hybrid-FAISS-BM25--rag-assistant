I think the WScript object does not provide such a method however you can show an input box from vbscript running on WSH. So here is one possible solution which lets you call that VB function from within JS! Please note the file extension for the following code fragment ".wsf". Function VBInputBox(promptText) VBInputBox = InputBox(promptText) End Function WScript.Echo("Hello from JScript") var x = VBInputBox("Enter text") WScript.Echo(x)
