Isn't an OCX an ActiveX User Control? (something that you put onto a form for the user to interact with)? The easiest way I know of to test COM/ActiveX stuff is to use excel. (Yes I know it sounds dumb, bear with me) Run Excel, create a new file if it hasn't done this for you Press Alt+F11 to launch the Visual Basic Editor (if you have excel 2007 it's on the 'Developer' ribbon tab thing Now that you're in happy visual basic land... From the Tools menu, select References Select your OCX/COM object from the list, or click Browse... to find the file if it's not registered with COM - You may be able to skip this step if your OCX is already registered. From the Insert menu, select UserForm In the floating Toolbox window, right click and select Additional Controls Find your OCX in the list and tick it You can then drag your OCX from the toolbox onto the userform From the Run menu, run it. Test your OCX and play around with it. SAVE THE EXCEL FILE so you don't have to repeat these steps every time.
