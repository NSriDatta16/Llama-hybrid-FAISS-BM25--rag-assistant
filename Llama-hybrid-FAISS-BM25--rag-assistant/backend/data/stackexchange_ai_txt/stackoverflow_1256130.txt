Setting the start position for OpenFileDialog/SaveFileDialog

For any custom dialog (form) in a WinForm application I can set its size and position before I display it with: form.StartPosition = FormStartPosition.Manual; form.DesktopBounds = MyWindowPosition; This is particularly important when dealing with multiple monitors. Without such code, when you open a dialog from an application that you have dragged to a second monitor, the dialog appears on the primary monitor. This presents a poor user experience. I am wondering if there are any hooks to set the position for the standard .NET OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog (which do not have a StartPosition property).
