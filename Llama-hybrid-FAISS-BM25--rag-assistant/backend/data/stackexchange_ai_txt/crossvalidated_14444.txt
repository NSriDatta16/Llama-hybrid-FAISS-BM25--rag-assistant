How to understand Bayesian statistics?

How can one easily and quickly grasp the idea of Bayesian statistics and modelling? I can understand the Bayesian theorem on conditional probabilities, I understand how frequentist statistics works (test statistics, p-values, hypothesis testing...), I understand some ideas of Bayesian statistics , but how does Bayesian inference work (technically) - that's still a little mystery to me.
