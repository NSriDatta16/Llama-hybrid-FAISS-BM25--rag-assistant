Yep. This is just de Morgan's law. I had to think a bit about the effect of NULLS but in both versions if [Panels] IS NULL then the end result will be unknown. In answer to your clarified question. Yes as well. I added a new "Yes/No" column to the Northwind Customers table called "TF" and both the following statements had the same effect. UPDATE Customers SET TF = not ([Last Name] Like '*A*' Or [Last Name] Like '*B*' Or [Last Name] Like '*C*'); UPDATE Customers SET TF = ([Last Name] not Like '*A*' and [Last Name] not Like '*B*' and [Last Name] not Like '*C*');
