Scalar queries return a List of Object arrays ( Object[] ) - or a single Object[] in your case. It is however possible to return non-managed entities using a ResultTransformer . Quoting the Hibernate 3.2: Transformers for HQL and SQL blog post: SQL Transformers With native sql returning non-entity beans or Map's is often more useful instead of basic Object[] . With result transformers that is now possible. List resultWithAliasedBean = s.createSQLQuery( "SELECT st.name as studentName, co.description as courseDescription " + "FROM Enrolment e " + "INNER JOIN Student st on e.studentId=st.studentId " + "INNER JOIN Course co on e.courseCode=co.courseCode") .addScalar("studentName") .addScalar("courseDescription") .setResultTransformer( Transformers.aliasToBean(StudentDTO.class)) .list(); StudentDTO dto =(StudentDTO) resultWithAliasedBean.get(0); Tip: the addScalar() calls were required on HSQLDB to make it match a property name since it returns column names in all uppercase (e.g. "STUDENTNAME"). This could also be solved with a custom transformer that search the property names instead of using exact match - maybe we should provide a fuzzyAliasToBean() method ;) See also 16.1.5.
