I've come across the same problem and also haven't been able to find a suitable answer. We also have a site which is being ran as separate websites with each site in its own separate application pool, all on the same webserver. Pragmatically, you'd be better off just switching to Identity mapping, if your databas supports it. It shouldn't be too hard to do, you should be able to modify your database schema with a bit of TSQL and the ID mappings with a bit of search/replace. Do you have a concept similar to UoW in your application? Because a downside to identity generation is that it'll break the UoW (early inserts in order to get the identifier). It might be a price worth paying, though. In my case the system could easily exist as a single site/app pool (it's multi-tenant on a single database, with single shared connection string, and is designed to run as a single instance on a webserver) so I'm going to test that before I make the jump to database-identities..
