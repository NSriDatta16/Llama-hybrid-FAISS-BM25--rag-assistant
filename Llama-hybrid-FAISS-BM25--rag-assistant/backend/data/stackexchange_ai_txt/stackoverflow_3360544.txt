It's mostly a matter of supply and demand - nobody wants to write a botnet which could, maybe, theoretically run on 5% of the computers available worldwide, when it is possible to write one for Windows and it will run on at least 40% of computers (a guess based on Windows market share * percentage of users who will blindly click on anything, especially if it promises them animated smilies ). This is not a matter of "Mac OS/Linux is more secure/has smarter users" - the average end user will bypass any security, if driven by a promise of dancing pigs ; and both MacOS and Linux are now usable by the average user. It's just that there are many more average Windows users, because there are more Windows workstations. In a hypothetical world where Linux would have 90% of the market share, we'd see users following malware's instructions such as "to see dancing pigs, execute chmod +x ./thisevilprogram && sudo ./thisevilprogram ", precisely because the userbase would be large enough to make it profitable to write Linux malware. Ease of development or ease of overcoming security measures are rather insignificant, compared to target system's market share.
