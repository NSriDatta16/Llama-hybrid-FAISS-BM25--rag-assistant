A few thoughts: 1) the binning of the DV may influence how you think about the problem. 0-10 scale is very different than selective binning which both explicitly changes the scale as well as implicitly making assumptions. Have these assumptions been validated? I would suggest running on the original DV as well as the new binned series. 2) By definition of seeds, using one should replicate the same results across trials. The goal is randomness but the seed makes sure we can replicate the randomness again. It is thus pseudo-random. Here's a quick read http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.jones/GoodPracticeRNG.pdf to get a better feel for the importance of, or lack of (depending on the problem at hand), seeds. 3) You may not want to use the function if there is seasonality or other patterns in your time series data. IE: if the sum is really greater than its parts than when the sum is split it can only be its component parts, not the sum.
