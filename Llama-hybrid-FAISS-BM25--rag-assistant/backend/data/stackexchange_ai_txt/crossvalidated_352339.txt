Frequentist Methods for Bayesians

Over time I've learned that many (most?) methods used in classical statistics can be interpreted as evaluating a Bayesian model in some plausible way while I find the standard explanations much less intuitive. So I was wondering whether there are any resources which explain standard stats methods in a Bayesian manner?
