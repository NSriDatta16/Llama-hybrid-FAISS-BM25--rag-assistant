It's hard to understand well your question because of a lack of information, but did you know an update panel is asynchronous itself? UpdatePanel is an ASP.NET AJAX control that lets some part of your page to be partially-rendered, meaning it can be updated without a full-postback. If you want to do other asynchronous things, you may need to use more than an UpdatePanel, or leverage ASP.NET Callback API, or just use jQuery/AJAX. Perhaps you've a single update panel that updates the entire page... If this is true, why you'd want to use UpdatePanel? :)
