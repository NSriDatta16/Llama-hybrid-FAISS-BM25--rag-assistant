The function decompose in R does the following: Decompose a time series into seasonal, trend and irregular components using moving averages. Deals with additive or multiplicative seasonal component. Since you have no seasonality ( frequency = 1 ), the decomposition fails. You should look for methods that can work with nonseasonal data instead. The test-for-trend tag could be useful.
