Convert interval to minutes

Let's suppose I have 2 intervals: INTERVAL '0 00:30:00' DAY TO SECOND INTERVAL '0 04:00:00' DAY TO SECOND What is the most elegant way to get amount of minutes in each interval. 30 and 240 accordingly. Yes, I know I can perform EXTRACT(HOUR FROM interval) * 60 + EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM interval) , but this looks terrible to me. Any better solutions?
