The first paragraph in the shelve module documentation : A “shelf” is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with “dbm” databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python objects — anything that the pickle module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings. [emphasis mine] yaml module allows tuples as keys: >>> d = {} >>> d["word1"] = 1 >>> d[("word1", "word2")] = 15 >>> import yaml >>> yaml.dump(d) 'word1: 1\n? !!python/tuple [word1, word2]\n: 15\n' >>> yaml.load(_) {('word1', 'word2'): 15, 'word1': 1}
