How to compare two discrete series?

Suppose I have two series of numbers and they don't have to be time series. $S_1=$ {9,8,1 ...} $S_2=$ {7,9,2 ...} What are the methods to compare these two series and make a conclusion such that these two series are statistically similar, they have similar patterns or they are completely different? I'm looking for pattern similarity, for example do they both draw an S curve, or they are linear, and I want to ignore time shifts.
