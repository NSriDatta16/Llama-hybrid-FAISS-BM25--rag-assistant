Sorry, the short answer is no. CSS (2.1) will only mark up the elements of a DOM, not their attributes. You'd have to apply a specific class to each input. Bummer I know, because that would be incredibly useful. I know you've said you'd prefer CSS over JavaScript, but you should still consider using jQuery. It provides a very clean and elegant way of adding styles to DOM elements based on attributes.
