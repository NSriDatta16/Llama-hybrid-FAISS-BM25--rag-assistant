Using organic URLS with my site?

How would I go about making my site use organic urls (like http://www.mysite.com/aboutus ) - i don't want to use a CMS - my site is powered from index.php is there anyway of getting the text after the / so that I can select that page from the database? I'd rather not do /?aboutus Thank you :D
