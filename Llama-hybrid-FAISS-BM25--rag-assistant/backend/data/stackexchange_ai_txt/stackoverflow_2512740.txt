Hopping from a C++ to a Perl/Unix job

I have been a C++ / Linux Developer till now and I am adept in this stack. Of late I have been getting opportunities that require Perl, Unix (with knowledge of C++,shell scripting) expertise. Organizations are showing interest even though I don't have much scripting experience to boast off. The role is more in a Support, maintenance project involving SQL as well. Off late I am in a fix whether to forgo these offers or not. I don't know the dynamics of an IT organization and thus on one hand I fear that my C++ experience will be nullified and on the positive side I am getting to work on a new technology stack which will only add to my skill set. I am sure, most of you at some point of time have encountered such dilemmas and would have taken some decision. I want you to share your perspectives on such a scenario where a person is required to change his/her technology stack when changing his/her job. What are the merits and demerits in going with either of the choices? Also I know that C++ isn't going anywhere in the near future. What about perl? I have no clue as to what the future holds for perl developer? Whether there are enough opportunities for a perl developer? I am asking this question here because most of my fellow programmers face this career choice dilemma. EDIT: Since the last time I asked this question, I made up my mind to switch. I was just about to sign on the dotted line but some divine intervention made me seek some clarification about the working hours, and to my horror, the profile required me to work in shifts which I am never comfortable with. I was all the more livid because they didn't clarify this point earlier. It was a reputed organisation but still I gave them my piece of mind and said thank you very much. Thanks.
