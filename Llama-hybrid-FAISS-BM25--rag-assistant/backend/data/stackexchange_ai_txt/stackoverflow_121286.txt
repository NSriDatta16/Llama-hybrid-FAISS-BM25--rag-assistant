If it's for handling the request, look at the User-Agent header on the incoming request. UPDATE: If it's for reporting, configure your web server to log the User-Agent in the access logs, then run a log analysis tool, e.g., AWStats . UPDATE 2: FYI, it's usually (not always, usually) a bad idea to change the way you're handling a request based on the User-Agent.
