Embeddings is a good way to go, however, the way I am thinking about embeddings, is that you can convert these lists to a form like A 1, A 4, B 1, B 4, by concatenating every element in list X to its corresponding element in list Y, and then learn embeddings, using word2vec model(example), however, I am not sure if this would be able to learn relationships where combination of items in list X might lead to an item in list Y. I think this aspect should be tackled while learning embeddings. You can also look at market basket analysis as one of the ways of solving this problem.
