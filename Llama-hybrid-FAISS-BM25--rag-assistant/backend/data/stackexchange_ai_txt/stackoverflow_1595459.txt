You can maintain tags. When you drag and drop the button, check the interface build and you will see "tag" property for these buttons. Assign different values for each of your button ( I assume you have different buttons for different rows, this solution will not work if you have same cell identifier for different rows ). And when you receive an event check for tag value. I had similar problem with my work and i was maintaing NSArray for each button tag created.
