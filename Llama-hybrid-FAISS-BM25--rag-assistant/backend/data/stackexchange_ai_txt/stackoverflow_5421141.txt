Looks like there's some hope for those of us still working with 2000 - "In order to accomplish this in SQL Server 2000 the DBA must add the user to TargetServersRole role in MSDB database. Prior to Service Pack 3 on SQL Server 2000 the user must be added to the sysadmin group in order to get a chance to view the jobs that are owned by sysadmin group."
