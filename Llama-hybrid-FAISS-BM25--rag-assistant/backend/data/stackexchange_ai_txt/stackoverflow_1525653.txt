Calculated field in RoR (act as an ActiveRecord method)

I am building an app for cognitive tests in Rails. I have a number of tests ( Quiz objects) for my visitors. In the home page I want to show only quizzes that are ready for consumption: they must have a number of questions and a number of possible answers. Of course I could query with SQL, or create a class method retrying all objects where Quiz.questions.size > 1 && Quiz.answer.size > 1 . Still, I'd like a more elegant/abstracted way. Is there a way to query have a 'ready' method acting as if it were an ActiveRecord method, so I can call Quiz.find_all_by_ready(1) and put ready in any quiz condition? Caching is a possibility, I was wondering if there was a dynamic alternative. How would a rails guru solve the problem? Cheers, Davide
