Silhouette values less than 0.4 are bad. So none of your clusterings worked well. The clusters are not reliable. You probably need to use a different algorithm, metric, or your data might not contain any clusters at all (categoricial data frequently does not contain clusters). P.S. Silhouette plot commonly refers to a plot showing the Silhouette of each point in just one data set, not parameter k vs. average Silhouette like you used for plotting.
