What is meant by 'training patch size'?

Currently I read a paper about symmetric skip connections for autoencoder ( link ). One experiment of them changes the the 'training patch size'. In my understanding patches are sub-boxes of an image that is used at one time of an convolutional layer. So if you have a 3x3 filter the patch is a part of the image with the size 3x3. Do they mean by 'training patch size' the size of the input image? (The network is a symmetric autoencoder, so the input size is arbitrary) Thanks in advance
