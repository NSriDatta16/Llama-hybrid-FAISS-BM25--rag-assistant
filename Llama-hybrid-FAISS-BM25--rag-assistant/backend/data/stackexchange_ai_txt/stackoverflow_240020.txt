There are two projects that I'm aware of and that you could find useful: CIL Transformers They both parse a standard C source code to allow further analisys and transformation. I've not used them so you have to check for yourself if they fit your needs. The suggestion of using GCC is also valid, of course. I know there's not much documentation on this aspect of gcc, though.
