Averaging angles

I looked at some solutions here but none provide what I need, so: I need to average an array of angles(0 to 359.9, no negatives) (A1 + A2 + A3 + An) / n The issue is when you get an array {1, 359, 2, 358} the average if you use the formula above is 180, but actually it is supposed to be 0. Any thoughts?
