I believe I have found the answer. A great thank-you to @Javier TG for pointing me to Andrew Ng's notes CS229 Suppor Vector Machines . I would not write down the full context as materials in the lecture notes and questions references do a much better job than I ever will. I will, however, try to fill in the tiny logic gap in many notes: why $w*x+b=1$ can represent any $w*x+b=\lambda, \lambda \ne 0$ . The key understanding is that the distance $d_i$ from a point $x_i$ to the plane $w*x+b=0$ is invariant to scaling of $w$ and $b$ . Below is a proof. From the notes, we derived the distance as $$d_i=\frac{y_i(w*x_i+b)}{\|w\|}$$ This shows that $d_i$ is invariant to scaling of $w, b$ . Meaning replacing $w, b$ with $2w, 2b$ gives the same $d_i$ . You should see it for yourself. Then it is straightforward that the maximum of $d_i$ , $$ d=\max_{w} d_i, i=1,...,n $$ Is also invariant to the scaling. However, let $l_i$ represent the nominator in the distance equation, $l_i = y_i(w*x_i+b)$ . You will see $l_i$ scales at the same magnitude as that of $w, b$ . Meaning replacing $w, b$ with $2w, 2b$ gives $2l_i$ . You should also see it for yourself. Then the maximum of $l_i$ , $l$ as $$ l=\max_{w}l_i, i=1,...,n $$ scales with $w, b$ . Now revisit the optimization problem derived in the notes, $$ \begin{aligned} \max_{w,b} \quad & d\\ \textrm{s.t.} \quad & y_i(w*x_i+b)\geq l, i=1,...,n \end{aligned} $$ It is okay that we tweak $w, b$ to find the optimum solution, but we also got $d, l$ in the problem statement which makes the problem more complex. It will be great if we can get rid of $d, l$ . We do this by leveraging the aforementioned findings. With $l$ scales with $w,b$ , we can require that $l'=l*k=1$ . To maintain the inequality constraint, we do the same scaling on the left hand side. $$y_i(kw*x_i+kb)\geq kl=1$$ . Since $d$ is invariant to scaling, the objective function is not changed. We are still solving the same optimization problem. Finally, we replace $w=kw, b=kb$ , and $d=\frac{l}{\|w\|}=\frac{1}{\|w\|}$ , and get the form of the same optimization problem stated in the notes: $$ \begin{aligned} \max_{w,b} \quad & \frac{1}{\|w\|}\\ \textrm{s.t.} \quad & y_i(w*x_i+b)\geq 1, i=1,...,n \end{aligned} $$ Now we know, in our optimization problem, any constraint $y_i(w*x_i+b)\geq l$ is equivalent to $y_i(w*x_i+b)\geq 1$ .
