We use a couple of solutions. We have an offsite backup with another company that we do. We also use several portable hard drives and swap them out each day. Neither solution really handles multiple terabytes of data. More like gigabytes. In the future, however, we will probably be looking at going the tape router, or something else that is similarly permanent and storable. Terabytes of data is too much to transfer over the wire. When bluray discs become reasonably priced and commercially viable, it may be a good idea to look into the 400GB discs that were touted not long ago. Those would be extremely storage friendly (both in the physical sense and the file size sense), and depending on the longevity stats, may keep for a while, similar to tapes.
