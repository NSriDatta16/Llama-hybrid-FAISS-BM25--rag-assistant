The solution of logistic regression is a solution of maximization of certain function, namely log-likelihood: $$\sum_{i=1}^ny_i\log p_i+(1-y_i)\log(1-p_i),$$ where $$p_i=\frac{\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1x_{1i}+...+\beta_kx_{ik})}{1+\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1x_{1i}+...+\beta_kx_{ik})},$$ and $(y_i,x_{1i},...,x_{ki})$, $i=1,...,n$ is the data. So mathematically speaking the unique solution of logistic regression exists for given data set if the log-likelihood has a unique maximum. If I am not mistaken full rank of matrix $X=[1,x_{1i},...,x_{ki}]$ is necessary for that. For more mathematical conditions you might look into iterative reweighted least squares , since maximisation of log likelihood function for logistic regression is a special case of IRWLS.
