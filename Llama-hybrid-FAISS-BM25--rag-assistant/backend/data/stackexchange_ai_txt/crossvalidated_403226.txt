Suppose Alice has a higher free throw rate than average. Then the probability of a shot being successful, given that it's attempted by Alice, is greater than the probability of a shot being successful in general $P(successful|Alice)>P(successful)$ . We can also conclude that Alice's share of successful shots is greater than her share of shots in general: $P(Alice|successful)>P(Alice)$ . Or suppose there's a school that has 10% of the students in its school district, but 15% of the straight-A students. Then clearly the percentage of students at that school who are straight-A students is higher than the district-wide percentage. Another way of looking at it: A is more likely, given B, if $P(A\&B)>P(A)P(B)$ , and that is completely symmetrical with respect to $A$ and $B$ .
