You can vary the probability cutoff values over the range 0 to 1, and check the optimum cut off for maximum accuracy: logmodel considering logmodel as your fitted model, which outputs the probabilities, use a function that calculates the accuracy of classification for each cut-off value like below cutoffs = cutoffs[i], 1, 0) #Predicting for cut-off accuracy And then you can visually explore the cutoff vs probability by plotting plot(cutoffs, accuracy, pch =19,type='b',col= "steelblue", main ="Logistic Regression", xlab="Cutoff Level", ylab = "Accuracy %") This will be the type of output:(I've added some ablines)
