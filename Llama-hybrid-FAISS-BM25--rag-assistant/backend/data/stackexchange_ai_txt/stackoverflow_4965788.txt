If you don't mind paying for the transfer, store all of the files using a cloud storage service. There are many options, to name a few: Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud Storage, even Google is launching its own storage solution. The easiest way to do this is with a flash player that are freely available through open-source solutions. One of the more popular player is the JW Player - available at http://www.longtailvideo.com/ Playing audio can happen as mentioned above in the player or through the new HTML5 audio tags. You have multiple choices here. There are no frameworks for building this exact type of app you've described. But there are a number of PHP frameworks out there. Check out Cake PHP, Zend, and CodeIgniter to get started. Best of luck!
