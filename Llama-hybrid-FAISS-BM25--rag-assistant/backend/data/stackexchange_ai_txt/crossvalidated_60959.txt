It depends on your research question. Are you forecasting a multivariate time series model ? Are you trying to forecast a univariate time series model ? Are you trying to implement this in excel to share results with executives that may not understand ARIMA/ARMA. From my experience working with ARIMA models is that it is very powerful to answer specific questions. Much much better than OLS or other regression techniques since it not only takes into account the moving average component it also takes care of the auto regressive portion. In many cases most time series are affected by other variabes and i strongly recommend using VARMAX in that case if you have that kind of data. http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/etsug/63348/HTML/default/viewer.htm#etsug_varmax_sect001.htm You can now do this in other packages as well.
