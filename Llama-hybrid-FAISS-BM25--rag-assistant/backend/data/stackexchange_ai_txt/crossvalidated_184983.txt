What is the interpretation of the number that is the output of the logistic regression function? Logistic regression as understood in recent decades is explicitly used as a model for Bernoulli or binomial data (with extensions into other cases such as multinomial), where the model if for the parameter, $p$, which is indeed a probability. However, logistic regression has its origins in modelling the growth of a proportion over time[1] (which may be continuous), so in origins it bears a close link to nonlinear models that fit logistic growth curves And frankly anything between 0 and 1, what else could it be other than a probability. Well, something between 0 and 1 could be a model a continuous fraction such as the proportion of substance A in a mix of things. Can logistic regression model such a thing? The model for the mean makes sense, but the model for the variance doesn't necessarily make sense; in logistic regression the variance function is of the form $\mu(1-\mu)$. This is directly related to the variance of a Bernoulli. However (for example) one could consider approximating something like a beta (which has variance function proportional to $\mu(1-\mu)$) by a quasi-binomial model; then we wouldn't necessarily be modelling a probability as such, but we'd still arguably be using logistic regression to do it. So while it's nearly always conceived as a model for a probability, it doesn't necessarily have to be. Suppose it is a probability, or more exactly the probability of a 'true', '1', or 'positive' classification of a point in the domain. How is this justified? I don't understand the question here. If it's explicitly a model for $p$ in a Bernoulli, what additional sort of justification do you seek? Of course the link function may be wrong (while that's no great difficulty - since other links could be used - we would no longer be doing logistic regression). [1]: Cramer, J.S.
