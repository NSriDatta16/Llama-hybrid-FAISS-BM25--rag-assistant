jquery: calculating 'margin-left' or 'left' relative to $(window).scrollLeft() is really jagged in Firefox â€” using .animate() or .css()

I have a horizontally scrolling website, and I have a block that I want to stay in frame at all times as the user scrolls right. It looks perfectly smooth in webkit browsers, but is crazy jagged in Firefox and I don't really care about IEs. function fixMyId(){ $('#myId').css({'margin-left': 150 + $(window).scrollLeft()}); } function fixMyIdAlt(){ $('#myId').stop().animate({'margin-left': 150 + $(window).scrollLeft()}, 300); } And then I have it triggered on window scroll. What would be a best way to average out the scrolling, so that maybe every so many seconds or pixels of scrolling it fires the function, or upon stopping the scrolling it animates the block into place? I tried playing with delay() but that doesn't do anything. And this one just looks stupid (plus I have no idea what the overhead of this kind of crunching is): function fixMyIdStupid(){ window.scrollCounter++; if(window.scrollCounter % 20 == 0) $('#myId').stop().animate({'margin-left': 150 + $(window).scrollLeft()}, 300); } So what do I do? setTimeout and setInterval may be required, but those always make my head hurt. EDIT: Here's a jsfiddle of it in action: http://jsfiddle.net/xsxSq/ The #f0f square is the #myId.
