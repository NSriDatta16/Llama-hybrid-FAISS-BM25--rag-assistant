I would go for a reference book on machine learning and graphical models. For example, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning As for your question, latent variable models are graphical models where some variables are not seen, but are the causes to the observations. Some of the earliest models were factor analysis . Here the idea is to find a representation of data which releveals some inherent structure of the data. You may want to have a look at the publications by Christopher Bishop (the author of the second book) on the topic.
