Have you tried calling out.print() instead of out.println() ? ( edit oh durr, I see you mention that. Well read the next paragraph ...) You can use out.flush() to force buffers to be dumped without affecting the actual written stream of characters. out.print(this.jTextField1.getText()+'\u0000'); out.flush();
