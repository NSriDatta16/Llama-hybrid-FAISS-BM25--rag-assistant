How to find out how many concurrent users on a Magento website

We are switching web hosts, and I have been asked to find out how many concurrent users the Magento-based websites have in order to estimate the appropriate hardware. How can I find this information out? The webserver is lightspeed (like apache) and it is PHP-based. Other information that may (or may not) be helpful is that the sites are currently hosted on a shared hosting solution, so I don't think I can install any monitoring software. I have noticed that Magento has a built in report that may be similar to this... Admin -> Customers -> Online Customers. But I have a feeling this report isn't really what the new web host is looking for. Should this question be posted in another Stack Exchange site?
