Have you checked out the Magento design guide? My suggestion would be to start there: Magento Official Design Guide I'm not sure if that will help, because it's hard to judge your understanding of Magento - it's pretty goofy at first. Just make sure you take the time to get cozy with the layout XML files and the blocks. Once you get an understanding of how the pages are built, it'll be a lot easier to start customizing a template beyond hacking up the CSS files.
