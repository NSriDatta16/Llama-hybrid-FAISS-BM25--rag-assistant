The average color is not neccessarily the color most used. I recommend calculating the HUE of pixels which have saturation over a certain threshold, and use an array to create a histogram of the image. (How many times a certain hue value was used). Then smooth the histogram (calculate local average values with both neighbours), then get the place where this smoothed histogram takes the maximal value. You can get HSL values with: Color.GetHue Color.GetSaturation Color.GetBrightness
