Just to add a bit to Rook's answer. The iPhone keychain is able to be cracked in under 6 minutes even if the device has a passcode enabled. Of course, this requires physical access to the phone but honestly that's the only reason to bother encrypting anything on it anyway. It's done by first jailbreaking the device. Obligatory link: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/10/iphone_password_retrieval_hack/ Point is, you absolutely can not depend on any device (iphone or not) to retain it's secrets once the device it outside of the control of the owner. Heck, even their secure backups have been shown to be less than secure . If you can just get a backup of the phone then you have everything you need. You can't even depend on remote wipe as those require the phone to contact the home network to receive the wipe instructions; and that can be stopped. The only way to get even a modicum of security is to simply not store the data on the device itself and instead store it on a centralized server... But even that has it's own challenges with securing data going over public phone networks, etc. However, at least this is no different than trying to secure a regular website.
