Statistical difference between multiple groups using percentage data

I have 3 groups of data. Group 1 contains 11 values, group 2 contains 7 and group 3 contains 11 values. The values are in the form of 'percentage change over time'. I would like to test to see if the groups averages are statistically different from one another. It seems like Chi-squared would work but the data is continuous. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
