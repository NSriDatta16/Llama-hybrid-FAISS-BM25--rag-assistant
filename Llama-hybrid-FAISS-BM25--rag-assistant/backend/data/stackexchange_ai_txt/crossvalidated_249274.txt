table frequencies analysis

I am a researcher in cognitive psychology, I have to analyze a set of frequencies in a sample of 30 subjects. Each subject was submitted to 3 different conditions, with 3 different outcomes. In total, for each participant, I have 90 trials, so the data set to enter in SPSS is huge. How can analyze this data? Is it better a logistic regression or a chi-squared? Moreover, is it correct that chi-squared cannot be applied when more of 20 % of the categories has a frequency
