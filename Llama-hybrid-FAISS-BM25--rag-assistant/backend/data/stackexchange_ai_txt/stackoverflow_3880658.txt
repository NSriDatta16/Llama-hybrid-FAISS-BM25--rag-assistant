Need help to re-enable dragging of a draggable

I have a draggable element $(".element").draggable({ helper: "clone", revert: 'invalid', containment: '#parent', appendTo: '#parent' }); I have two issues: After this element is dropped, the original gets disabled automatically. A close anchor tag is appended to the dropped element. On click of this 'close' the original element should again become draggable and should be removed from the droppable 'div'. I have written a handler for the close anchor as follows, it removes the element from the droppable but it doesn't make it draggable aggain. $('.cancel a',ui.helper).click(function() { $(ui.helper).remove(); $(ui.draggable).draggable('enable'); }); Please help. Thanks in advance.
