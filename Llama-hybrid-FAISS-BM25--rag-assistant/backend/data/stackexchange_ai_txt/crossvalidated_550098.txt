Bayesian updating when data is partially observed

Consider two distinct coins (COIN_1 and COIN_2) whose respective prior probabilities are given by: $Pr_1(HEAD_1)=\alpha_1$ $Pr_2(HEAD_2)=\alpha_2$ Suppose that those two coins are jointly tossed $n$ times but the outcome of each joint toss is observed if and only if "HEAD_1, HEAD_2" is realized. Is it possible to compute $Pr_1(HEAD_1 | ``HEAD_1,HEAD_2" realized\ k\ times\ in\ n\ tosses)$ ?
