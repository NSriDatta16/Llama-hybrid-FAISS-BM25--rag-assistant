Setting the default ssh key location

ssh will look for its keys by default in the ~/.ssh folder. I want to force it to always look in another location. The workaround I'm using is to add the keys from the non-standard location to the agent: ssh-agent ssh-add /path/to/where/keys/really/are/id_rsa (on Linux and MingW32 shell on Windows)
