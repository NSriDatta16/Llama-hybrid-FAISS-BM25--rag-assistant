XML comments on delegate declared events

I am visiting some old code, and there are quite a few events declared with delegates manually rather than using EventHandler , like this: /// /// Delegate for event Added /// /// Index of the item /// The item itself public delegate void ItemAdded(int index, T item); /// /// Added is raised whenever an item is added to the collection /// public event ItemAdded Added; All well and good, until I come to use sandcastle to document the library, because it then can't find any XML comments for the private Added field that is generated by the event declaration. I want to try and sort that out, but what I would like to do is either: Get sandcastle to ignore the auto-generated private field without telling it to ignore all private fields entirely or Get XML comments generated for the private field Is there any way of achieving this without re-factoring the code to look like this: /// /// Delegate for event /// /// Index of the item /// The item itself public delegate void ItemAdded(int index, T item); /// /// Private storage for the event firing delegate for the event /// private ItemAdded _added; /// /// Added is raised whenever an item is added to the collection /// public event ItemAdded Added { add { _added += value; } remove { _added -= value; } }
