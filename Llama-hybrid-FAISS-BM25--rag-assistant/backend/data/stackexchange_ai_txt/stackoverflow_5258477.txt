No. Besides that fuu.example.com is an invalid Domain value (it must start with a . , i.e. .fuu.example.com ) (see update below) the cookie would get rejected : To prevent possible security or privacy violations, a user agent rejects a cookie (shall not store its information) if any of the following is true: The request-host is a Fully-Qualifed Domain Name (not IP address) and has the form HD , where D is the value of the Domain attribute, and H is a string that contains one or more dots. The request-host is example.com and the Domain attribute value is foo.example.com . But the request-host example.com does not has the form HD where D would be foo.example.com . Thus the cookie gets rejected. Update The current specification RFC 6265 , that obsoleted RFC 2109 that is quoted above, does ignore the leading dot. But the effective domain is handled the same: […] if the value of the Domain attribute is " example.com ", the user agent will include the cookie in the Cookie header when making HTTP requests to example.com , www.example.com , and www.corp.example.com . (Note that a leading %x2E (" . "), if present, is ignored even though that character is not permitted, but a trailing %x2E (" . "), if present, will cause the user agent to ignore the attribute.) […] the user agent will accept a cookie with a Domain attribute of " example.com " or of " foo.example.com " from foo.example.com , but the user agent will not accept a cookie with a Domain attribute of " bar.example.com " or of " baz.foo.example.com ".
