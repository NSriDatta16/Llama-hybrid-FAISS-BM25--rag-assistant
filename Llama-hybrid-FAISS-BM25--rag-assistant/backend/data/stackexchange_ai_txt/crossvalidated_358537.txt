What is the cost/loss function of K nearest neighbors?

I am able to visualize how KNN works. Essentially take avg of the k nearest train neighbors for regression problem. However every ML algorithm optimizes a cost/loss function for example: Linear regression minimize MSE and Logistic regression minimize logloss Similarly what is the cost function of KNN? How is it optimized? From scikit-learn documentation I see the below algorithm options for K nearest neighbors algorithm : {‘ball_tree’, ‘kd_tree’, ‘brute’} How does these algorithm works?
