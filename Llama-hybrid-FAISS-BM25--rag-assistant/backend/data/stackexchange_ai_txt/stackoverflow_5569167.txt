oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver found in application, not in Test

When I connect to the OracleDriver in the application, everything is fine. But when I want to connect to run the JUnit Tests, I got a ClassNotFoundException. And I do exactly the same! I have the ojbc added to the library and the testlibrary. public JDBCDataStorage(boolean production) throws DataStorageException { this.production = production; try { rb = (PropertyResourceBundle) PropertyResourceBundle.getBundle("app.control.database.JDBCconfig"); Class.forName(rb.getString("driver")); } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) { throw new DataStorageException("Something went wrong in new JDBCDataStorage()" + ": " + e.getMessage()); } DriverManager.setLoginTimeout(3); }
