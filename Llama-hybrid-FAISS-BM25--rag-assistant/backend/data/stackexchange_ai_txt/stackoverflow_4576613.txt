Getting 404 page not found in the log using Codeigniter 1.7.2 + HMVC

I am using Codeigniter 1.7.2 and HMVC (https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc/wiki/Home). I have these files and they are organized according to the HMVC: system/application/modules/welcome/controllers/welcome.php system/application/modules/welcome/views/index.php In the routes.php , I have set up a route: routes['welcome']='welcome/index'; Everything works if the url is in this pattern: http://www.mydomain.com/index.php/welcome But now I would like to remove the index.php from the url, so I created the .htaccess file: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?$1 [L] Then I set the $config['index_page'] to empty: $config['index_page'] = ""; Now I can access the page in this url pattern: http://www.mydomain.com/welcome Although everything seems to work, I find that every time I access the page, it generates a 404 page not found error in the log: DEBUG - 2011-01-02 08:28:52 --> URI Class Initialized ERROR - 2011-01-02 08:28:52 --> 404 Page Not Found --> This is not specific to the welcome page, all pages are having the same problem. I digged into the codes and discovered that this 404 Page Not Found message is generated from the MX_Router.php that comes with HMVC. Specifically, it's from this function: public function _validate_request($segments) { /* locate module controller */ if ($located = $this->locate($segments)) return $located; /* use a default 404 controller */ if (isset($this->routes['404']) AND $segments = explode('/', $this->routes['404'])) { if ($located = $this->locate($segments)) return $located; } /* use a default 404_override controller CI 2.0 */ if (isset($this->routes['404_override']) AND $segments = explode('/', $this->routes['404_override'])) { if ($located = $this->locate($segments)) return $located; } /* no controller found */ show_404(); } It's the show_404() function that gets called and therefore I am getting that error message. But since I can access every page without any problem using the url pattern which has index.php removed. Why is HMVC thinking there's no controller found in this _validate_request() function? I will not get the 404 error message in the log if I revert the changes but this also means that I have to keep using the url pattern that has index.php , which looks pretty bad. Anyone has encountered the same problem before? Many many thanks to you all.
