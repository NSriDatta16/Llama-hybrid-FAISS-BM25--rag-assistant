How can I get `find` to ignore .svn directories?

I often use the find command to search through source code, delete files, whatever. Annoyingly, because Subversion stores duplicates of each file in its .svn/text-base/ directories my simple searches end up getting lots of duplicate results. For example, I want to recursively search for uint in multiple messages.h and messages.cpp files: # find -name 'messages.*' -exec grep -Iw uint {} + ./messages.cpp: Log::verbose id) ./messages.cpp: Log::error id) ./messages.cpp: Log::verbose id) ./messages.cpp: for (uint i = 0; i id) ./.svn/text-base/messages.cpp.svn-base: Log::error id) ./.svn/text-base/messages.cpp.svn-base: Log::verbose id) ./.svn/text-base/messages.cpp.svn-base: for (uint i = 0; i How can I tell find to ignore the .svn directories? Update : If you upgrade your SVN client to version 1.7 this is no longer an issue. A key feature of the changes introduced in Subversion 1.7 is the centralization of working copy metadata storage into a single location. Instead of a .svn directory in every directory in the working copy, Subversion 1.7 working copies have just one .svn directoryâ€”in the root of the working copy. This directory includes (among other things) an SQLite-backed database which contains all of the metadata Subversion needs for that working copy.
