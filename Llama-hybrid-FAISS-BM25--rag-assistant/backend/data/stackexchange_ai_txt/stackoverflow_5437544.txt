There is nothing to confuse. The very straight answer which I tested and it is working perrfect. To send the command line argument to any JNLP is very simple. command prompt > javaws -open space arg1 space arg2 ... space arg n JNLP url Ex: c:\>javaws -open arg1 arg2 arg3 c:\myjnlp.jnlp But remember one thing, We can get the -open also as args[0] in main method, so just avoid args[0] . Also it is not possible to avoid -open with direct argument prepixed with - .
