I want to use it to logically parse and sanitise something like this from the HTML: HALL (J&amp;E) LTD Head Office Questor House 191 Hawley Road Dartford Kent DA1 1PU Tel: +44 (0)1322 223456 Fax: +44 (0)1322 291458 Website: www.jehall.co.uk Email: helpline&#64;jehall&#46;co&#46;uk Any suggestions gladly appreciated.
