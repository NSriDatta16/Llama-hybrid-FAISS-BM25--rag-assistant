What you are experiencing is not a problem, but rather an inherent attribute of all classifiers. The performance of a classifier depends on the training set, therefore the performance will vary with different training sets. To find the best parameters for a specific classifier you will therefore want to vary training and test split (such as in crossvalidation) and choose the parameter set which achieves the best average accuracy or AUC. Finally you will want to test the trained classifier on another dataset - evaluation set - which has not been part of the dataset used in crossvalidation.
