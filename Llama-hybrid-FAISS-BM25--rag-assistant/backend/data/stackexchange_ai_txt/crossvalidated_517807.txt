Examples of a modern ARIMA algorithm from scratch?

Where can I find a modern/robust algorithm for the fitting of an ARIMA model? Or in other words, if one were to implement an ARIMA model from scratch in 2021 what would be the most correct/efficient algorithm? I have been looking into a number of different ARIMA implementations. C: ctsa Julia: ARIMA.jl Python: statsmodels.tsa.arima.model R: arima.c All of these sources differ a good deal in lines of code from 36 in Julia to 1660 in ctsa. Also, of these scripts listed above none of their implementations are the same. It seems that there are statespace implementations, but I remember reading that not all statespace models are arima and not all arima are statespace. If this is true I would want to avoid a statespace implementation. AS154[1] seems like one of the first algos, but it looks like it is fitting an ARMA and it is using Kalman filtering. If my understanding is current, I think we are estimating ARIMA with maximum likelihood. Are their any recent papers or old papers that are considered the gold standard which lay out the ARIMA fitting algorithm? [1]: Gardner, G, Harvey, A. C. and Phillips, G. D. A. (1980). Algorithm AS 154: An algorithm for exact maximum likelihood estimation of autoregressive-moving average models by means of Kalman filtering. Applied Statistics, 29, 311--322. 10.2307/2346910.
