Assessing peaks in time series of cell signal data

I am measuring for the existence of response in cell signal measurements. What I did was first apply a smoothing algorithm (Hanning) to the time series of data, then detect peaks. What I get is this: If I wanted to make the detection of the response a bit more objective than "yeah you see a raise in the continuous drop", what would be the best approach? Is it to get the distance of the peaks from a baseline determined by linear regression? (I am a python coder and have almost no understanding of statistics) Thank you
