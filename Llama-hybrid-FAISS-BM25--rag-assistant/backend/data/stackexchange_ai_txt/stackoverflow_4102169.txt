Trouble with Selenium Client for Ruby and Xpath Selectors - multiple links from a single table

I'm porting over a few scripts from Watir to Selenium-RC to see how difficult the change may be for our organization. I have a table with class 'global-list', that contains 4 columns, each column with an unordered list, and each list element containing a word with a hyperlink. In Watir, I would simply use: @browser.table(:class, /global-list/).links.each {|link| puts link.text,link.href} With Selenium there doesn't appear to be such an easy way to do this. I want all of the links (href and text) from that single table. At first I thought my Xpath was incorrect because it would only show me the first column (of 4), or the first href element. puts @browser.get_xpath_count("//table[@class='global-list']//a[@href]") - gives me a result of 64 links (the total across all 4 tr's and/or ul's). puts @browser.get_text("//table[@class='global-list']//a[@href]") - gives me a single text result (just the first td in the first tr). puts @browser.get_text("//ul[@class='global-list']") - gives me the first column of text only (the first ul in the first tr). I am new to Selenium, but I have read the documentation and available methods ( http://selenium-client.rubyforge.org/ ) and do not yet see a straightforward solution. I have also tried the DOM locator method, but if get_text or get_attribute are my only options, I'm not able to improve my results that way.
