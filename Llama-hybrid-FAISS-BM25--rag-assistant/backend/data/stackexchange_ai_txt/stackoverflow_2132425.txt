How does iPhone development compare to Symbian development?

Having spent several years doing Symbian C++ development, I'd like to know how iPhone development compares to Symbian development. I am interested in answers from people who have spent some time working on both platforms. To clarify: Examples: How do the following compare: Symbian C++ vs Objective C - the former is yuck IMHO. Symbian libraries vs iPhone libraries emulator - how close is the emulator to the real device - the Symbian emulator is really a simulator as it Symbian libraries modified to run on Win32. E.g. a process is a thread on the Symbian emulator and not a Symbian process. The emulator is a separate build target. IDEs - how do they compare (e.g. eclipse or codewarrior vs relevant iPhone IDE) documentation - how does the documentation compare - Symbian documentation leaves a lot to be desired. community support fragmentation - There are many Symbian OS versions and phones that can can potential target - this can be a real development and maintenance nightmare. Plus various flavours of UI. deploying apps - e.g. Symbian signed / private APIs / operators vs what? on iPhone
