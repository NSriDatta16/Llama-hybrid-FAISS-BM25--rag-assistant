Can feature importance change a lot between models?

I have a random forest classifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes. For feature importance, I used gini index for random forest and for Multinomial Naive Bayes I used the coefficients of each feature. Then normalized to compare the two lists but there is a big difference between the two. Is this normal? Something like RF vs NB A - C B - D C - A D - B
