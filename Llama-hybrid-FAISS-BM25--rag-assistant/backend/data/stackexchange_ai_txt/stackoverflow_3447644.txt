How to link Magento admin menu to role resources

Here's the situation: I would like to add a Menu in the Magento backend navigation menu. I accomplished this by adding the following code in app/etc/config.xml : Inventory 110 Set It! helloworld/index/goodbye The problem is I can't include this menu in the permission->role resources so I can't assign this to a specific user. How do I include this menu in the permission->role resources? Thank you and more power!
