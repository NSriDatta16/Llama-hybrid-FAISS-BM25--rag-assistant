For the means of debugging, we tried: alert(url); xmlhttp.open("GET",url,true); which gave the expected result of: UnlockQuery.ashx?QueryID=319&UserID=11648 Now we can check what the server has to say through: xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4) alert(this.status + ": " + this.StatusText); }; EDIT: As it turns out, the browser cache was the reason for the unexpected results. I suggest to forbid caching the AJAX page through appropriate HTTP headers ( Pragma , Cache-Control , Expires ).
