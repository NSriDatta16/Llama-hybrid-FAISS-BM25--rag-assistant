There is nothing out there pre-built that I'm aware of, but you have some options for integration. The simplest, if users have direct access to the RS server, is to just redirect or link them to the report using their URL-based strategy, possibly opening a new window. If users do not have direct access, you can still use the URL-based strategy, but perform a request on the back end from your Rails app to the MS Reporting Services server, and stream all the report bytes through to the browser: open("http://ReportServer/reports?querystringxxxx") { |f| @response = f.read } This is drastically simplified, of course. You'll need to pay particular attention to your content types to ensure things get interpreted correctly by the browser. The next option is to use their web services API, but unless you need particularly advanced functionality, I'd say the URL/REST based approach is far, far simpler. If you get it working, take the opportunity to try creating your first gem, put it up on github, and then maybe somebody else will use it one day... :)
