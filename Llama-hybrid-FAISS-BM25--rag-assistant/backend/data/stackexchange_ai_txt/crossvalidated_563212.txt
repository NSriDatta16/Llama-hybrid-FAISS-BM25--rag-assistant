The following is my personal opinion relating to how to answer your question. It is not meant to disparage or suggest it is singularly better than your or other suggestions, which may present interesting information content. It does, however, recommend for validation, a simulation exercise that can conveniently be performed in a spreadsheet environment. My approach is actually analytically more simple, but does require data input from schools that one would consider as your peers. It focuses on the relative change in enrollment (a factor of interest) for your school versus the peer group across time. In essence, the data as such can be viewed as self-adjusted for events such as normal time trend, pandemics, economic up/down turns and such events likely to impair the goal of performing an accurate unbiased quantitative assessment of a newly appointed school administrator contribution to enrollment/retention across time. Next, depending on the amount of data, fit a parsimonious model with, for example, a simple dummy variable. If the question relates to female vs. male, the peer group could perhaps be so grouped, and perform a test of this select group results vs. your school administration gender. Just keep the model selection/estimation process simple. I am wary of expanding a model with limited underlying data including, for example, even a moderator variable specification. To verify my assertion, I recommend constructing a database with a precisely known specified generating model + noise term and, upon repeated simulations, see how good a selected estimation/testing methodology is performing given data constraints and noise level. I hope this helps.
