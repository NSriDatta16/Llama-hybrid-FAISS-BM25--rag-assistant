Javascript is just a terrible language to learn OOP in. I would recommend learning OOP in another language (like Java or C++) and then learn Object Oriented syntax in Javascript. At that moment you have all the ingredients. That's when you can decide whether or not you want to be using an object for a task in Javascript or if it is enough to use just functions. Personally, I mostly write non-object javascript and leave objects for when a task feels object oriented to me. For example, I used an object oriented design for a drag and drop script, in which you simply made a DragNDrop object with the correct parameters and the items in your page would be dragable from that moment on, or when I wanted to simplify some javascript xml handling functions, I wrote an object that wrapped the normal xml objects.
