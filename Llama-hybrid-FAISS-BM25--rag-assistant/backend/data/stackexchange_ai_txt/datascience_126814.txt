When would pandas.get_dummies()'s parameter of drop_first=False be appropriate to use?

While working on some case studies that use various machine learning models, I came across a project for predicting churn in the telecom industry. The Jupyter Notebook I saw had the following lines of code: dummies1 = pd.get_dummies(df_churn, columns=cat_cols, drop_first=False) #for kNN and decision trees dummies2 = pd.get_dummies(df_churn, columns=cat_cols, drop_first=True) #for logistic regression As far as I knew, drop_first prevents the so-called 'Dummy Variable Trap'. Is there a reason for not dropping the extra dummy variable in the case of running kNN and Decision Tree models? The Jupyter Notebook's author is unreachable, and I could not find the answers elsewhere.
