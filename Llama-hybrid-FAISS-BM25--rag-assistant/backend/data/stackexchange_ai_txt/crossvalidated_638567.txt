Comparing probability threshold graphs for F1 score for different models

Below are two plots, side-by side, for an imbalanced dataset. We have a very large imbalanced dataset that we are processing/transforming in different manner. After each transformation, we run an xgboost estimator over it. On the left are the PR-curves of three xgboost models over three differently transformed datasets. As can be seen from the left diagram, all the three PR curves overlap; and in fact, areas under the curve of two of them (red and green) are the same. On the right are the plots from the same three models but of F1 score (calculated over test data) at various probability thresholds. Colors of models in both left and right plots match. Peak F1 score, at different probability thresholds, is about the same for both red and green models. Peak F1 score for blue model is a little less than the peak F1 score of the two other models. My questions are: a. Can I say, model green is better than model red as its F1 score is quite stable over a large range of probability thresholds, while that for red model F1 score falls rapidly with a little change in probability threshold. b. Of the two, models red and blue which one is better and why? Briefly, the question relates to interpreting F1-score threshold graphs of different models, given that PR curves lead to no conclusion. I will be grateful for a reply. Incidentally I have gone through a large number of discussions on F1 score, AUC and PR curves including this one .
