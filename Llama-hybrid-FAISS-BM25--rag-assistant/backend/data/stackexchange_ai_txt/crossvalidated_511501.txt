Mean number of throws to exceed a threshold

Say that you have a die with n faces, and you need to throw the die until the sum of your results exceeds a given threshold. What is the average number of throws needed? I think that to compute that average, you need the probability distribution of exceeding the threshold for a given number of throws, but I can't seem to find any "classical" distribution fitting that description...
