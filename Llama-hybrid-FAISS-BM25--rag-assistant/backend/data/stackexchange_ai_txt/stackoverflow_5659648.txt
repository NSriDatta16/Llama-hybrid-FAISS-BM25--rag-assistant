Adding product price without VAT

When adding or editing a product inside the Magento administrator the prices has to be entered as a price including VAT. For our purposes it would be a lot easier if we could enter the prices excluding VAT. It doesn't seem this is a configurable option of Magento. What is the best way to change the admin so we can use it as proposed above?
