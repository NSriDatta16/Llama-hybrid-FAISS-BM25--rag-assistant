Ignore trials in a repeated measures design?

I am planning to run an analysis on data where each participant rated (scale 1 to 7) two types of products - three products of type A and three products of type B. I am only interested to know whether on an average, ratings for type A and B differed. I am not interested in product level stats. To illustrate, the data follows this structure: id, type, product, rating|| 1,A,1,4|| 1,A,2,5|| 1,A,3,3|| 1,B,1,3|| 1,B,2,4|| 1,B,3,5|| 2,A,1,3|| 2,A,2,2|| I only want to know whether type A and B differ. Can I run the following code? model I can also add two fixed effects for 'product' above, if needed. However, question is that although 'product' is nested within 'type', is it incorrect for me to ignore this nesting?
