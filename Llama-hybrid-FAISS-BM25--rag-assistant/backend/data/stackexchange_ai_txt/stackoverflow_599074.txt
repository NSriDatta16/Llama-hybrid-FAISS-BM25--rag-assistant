I don't know if there's a more elegant way in Visual Studio, but the cross-platform solution we use it to have two macros that force the problamatic object file to be linked. One is placed in the source file of functions that are being excluded, the other is placed in a function that the linker knows will be called. Something like; #define FORCE_LINK_THIS(x) int force_link_##x = 0; #define FORCE_LINK_THAT(x) { extern int force_link_##x; force_link_##x = 1; } It's not exactly elegant, but we haven't found a better solution that works across platforms.
