@Lars Truijens suggested Remember that PowerShell can access .Net objects. The Start-Sleep as suggested by Blair Conrad can be replaced by a call to WaitForInputIdle of the server process so you know when the server is ready before starting the client. This is more elegant than sleeping for a fixed (or supplied via parameter) amount of time. However, WaitForInputIdle applies only to processes with a user interface and, therefore, a message loop. so this may not work, depending on the characteristics of launch-server-application. However, as Lars pointed out to me, the question referred to a windowed application (which I missed when I read the question), so his solution is probably best.
