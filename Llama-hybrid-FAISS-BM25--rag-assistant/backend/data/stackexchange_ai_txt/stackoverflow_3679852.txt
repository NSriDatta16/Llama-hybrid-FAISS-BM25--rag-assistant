Yes, that's what the set object is for: var myWords = r.set(); myWords.push( r.text(190, 100, "Hello"), r.text(480,100, "Good Bye" ); // now you can treat the set as a single object: myWords.rotate(90); Additional answer: OK, I see that you've tried using set but you are using it wrong. A set creates a group of things. Just like if you were to group shapes and text in Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape or Microsoft Word or Open Office. If I understand you correctly what you want is this: shapes = [ r.set(r.text (190, 100, "node1"), r.ellipse(190, 100, 30, 20)), r.set(r.text (290, 80, "Center"), r.rect(290, 80, 60, 40, 10)), r.set(r.text (290, 180, "node2"), r.rect(290, 180, 60, 40, 2)), r.set(r.text (450, 100, "node3"), r.ellipse(450, 100, 20, 20)) ]; You'll also have to modify your dragger and move functions since the shapes are no longer of type 'rect' but are of type 'set': var dragger = function () { this.ox = this.attr("x"); this.oy = this.attr("y"); this.animate({"fill-opacity": .2}, 500); }; var move = function (dx, dy) { var att = {x: this.ox + dx, y: this.oy + dy}; this.attr(att); for (var i = connections.length; i--;) { r.connection(connections[i]); } r.safari(); }; All sets have x and y attributes.
