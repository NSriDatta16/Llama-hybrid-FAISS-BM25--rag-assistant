When you set the jsonpCallback property, jQuery adds the following code to your document, so the jsonp has something in the global scope to call. That code is something like this window['myCustomCallBack'] = function(args){ success(args); //really more complicated than this because success may not be in scope delete window['myCustomCallBack']; } When you call this method multiple times there is a race condition between creation of document['myCustomCallBack'] and deletion of it. It is possible for a jsonp response to come back and have myCustomCallBack deleted already, this leads to errors.
