Will defunct processes prevent proper running of other processes?

My mongrels were not responding, and neither god restart nor cluster restart made a big difference. I dug a little deeper, than i realized that i had plenty of zombie processes. app 29607 27948 0 19:45 ? 00:00:00 [mongrel_rails] app 30578 21681 0 19:52 ? 00:00:00 [mongrel_rails] app 30704 21405 0 19:53 ? 00:00:00 [mongrel_rails] However, after i killed the parent processes using this: "ps -ef | grep defunct | grep -v grep | awk '{print $3}' | xargs kill -9" The restarts began working. Did my killing of the zombies help the restarts work? If so, it is weird, because i cannot find any references that explains how defunct processes affect normal ones
