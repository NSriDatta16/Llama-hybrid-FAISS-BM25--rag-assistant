Programmatically assigned CheckChanged event does not fire for checkbox control in gridview

I have a custom gridview control that extends the standard asp.net gridview control. The first column of the gridview is composed of dynamically created checkboxfields. I have assigned an event to the CheckChanged event of the checkboxes during the OnRowDataBound event, but the checkboxes do not even fire the event. I have their autopostback property set to true, and they ARE doing a postback, but it doesn't even attempt to fire the OnCheckChanged event. Here is my code: The OnRowDataBound event of the gridview: protected override void OnRowDataBound(GridViewRowEventArgs e) { base.OnRowDataBound(e); if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow) { CheckBox chkSelect = (CheckBox)e.Row.Cells[CheckBoxColumnIndex].FindControl(InputCheckBoxField.CheckBoxID); if (chkSelect != null) { Guid selectedValue = new Guid(DataKeys[e.Row.RowIndex].Value.ToString()); chkSelect.Checked = SelectedValues.Contains(selectedValue); chkSelect.CheckedChanged += new EventHandler(CheckChanged_click); } } } The CheckChanged event: protected void CheckChanged_click(object sender, EventArgs e) { CheckBox chkSelect = (CheckBox)sender; GridViewRow gvr = (GridViewRow)chkSelect.Parent.Parent; Guid selectedValue = new Guid(DataKeys[gvr.RowIndex].Value.ToString()); if (chkSelect.Checked && !this.SelectedValues.Contains(selectedValue)) { this.SelectedValues.Add(selectedValue); } else if (!chkSelect.Checked && this.SelectedValues.Contains(selectedValue)) { this.SelectedValues.Remove(selectedValue); } DataBind(); } One other thing. This USED to work, but as I was developing the control, I discovered that it was databinding multiple times on page load. I went through and began trimming down the databinds so that it would only bind once during page load. This is a side effect of doing that. I've tried moving the CheckChanged assignment into OnInit, and into OnRowCreated as well, but it still doesn't fire.
