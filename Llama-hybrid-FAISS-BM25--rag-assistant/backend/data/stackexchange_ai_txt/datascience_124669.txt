Once you are done fitting the model, you can label each of your records based on the cluster. df['cluster_labels'] = kmeans.labels_ For ease of analysis, you can convert all the one-hot encoding back to the original format data i.e. create a df column to convert back 8 region columns to the single region column in data frame. Once you are done converting all the columns back to their original format. You can filter out each cluster one by one. df[df['cluster_labels']==0] Say you first pickup this cluster and then you can plot the distribution of each column to see if there are any patterns say this cluster has most of the inc_type as Avalanche, number of houses destroyed were more and most state of the rows in the cluster is Badakhshan. You can say Badakhshan is a mountain surface that is why there are more houses destroyed due to Avalanche. This way you can filter out next cluster and plot distribution of each column to find patterns Other way to analyze the data is to calculate the mean/median/mode of the entire dataset and then calculating the mean/median/mode of the individual clusters and then comparing the values amongst all the cluster to draw inferences. Example say cluster 0 have average value of the number of houses destroyed as 90 whereas cluster 1 has average value of the number of houses destroyed as 5.
