how to refresh magento tier price cache after sql insert

I've imported new tier prices into the magento database using the sql shown below and when I view the product in the admin, the tiers are correct. However, on the front-end, the tiers are not displayed under I Save the product in the back-end. I've deleted the var/cache, rebuilt the Catalog Index, refreshed Inventory Stock Status (?) and even tried doing a bulk Update Attributes on those products, none of which seem to refresh the price cache. I can't find any value in the product entity tables that relate to tier pricing to tweak. I see that there is a Price object in Mage_CatalogIndex which makes me think that it needs refreshing... I'm using Magento v1.3.2.4 and have a couple of hundred SKUs that I don't want to manually have to Save in the backend! insert ignore into `catalog_product_entity_tier_price` (all_groups, customer_group_id, qty, entity_id, `value`) select '0','5','12',entity_id,'10' from `catalog_product_entity` where category_ids = 3; All suggestions welcome. Thanks, JD
