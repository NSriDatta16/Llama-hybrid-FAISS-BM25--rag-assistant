How to spot and analyse similar patterns like Excel does?

You know the functionality in Excel when you type 3 rows with a certain pattern and drag the column all the way down Excel tries to continue the pattern for you. For example Type... test-1 test-2 test-3 Excel will continue it with: test-4 test-5 test-n... Same works for some other patterns such as dates and so on. I'm trying to accomplish a similar thing but I also want to handle more exceptional cases such as: test-blue-somethingelse test-yellow-somethingelse test-red-somethingelse Now based on this entries I want say that the pattern is: test-[DYNAMIC]-something Continue the [DYNAMIC] with other colours is whole another deal, I don't really care about that right now. I'm mostly interested in detecting the [DYNAMIC] parts in the pattern. I need to detect this from a large of pool entries. Assume that you got 10.000 strings with this kind of patterns, and you want to group these strings based on similarity and also detect which part of the text is constantly changing ([DYNAMIC]). Document classification can be useful in this scenario but I'm not sure where to start. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that also it's possible to have multiple [DYNAMIC] patterns. Such as: test_[DYNAMIC] 12 [DYNAMIC2] I don't think it's important but I'm planning to implement this in .NET but any hint about the algorithms to use would be quite helpful.
