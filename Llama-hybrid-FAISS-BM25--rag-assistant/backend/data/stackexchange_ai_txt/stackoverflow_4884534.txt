If you really wish to get the file to download in this way via PHP you can use header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=myfile.jpg"); echo file_get_contents("http://host.tld/path/to/myfile.jpg") Quoted from Byron Whitlock on another SO question here . He explains that this code will put the file in temporary storage, so the download and deletion of the original file will be dealt with automatically. If you don't have to use PHP, you could use a hidden iFrame on the page to download the file
