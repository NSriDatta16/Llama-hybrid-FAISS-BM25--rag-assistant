Only your organisation and its processes can be SOX-compliant. If you're asking whether Git can be used to implement a version control/software development process which is SOX-compliant, you should clarify your question and provide links/information to the aspects of compliance (I assume you're referring to security/access control) which you're interested in instituting, if possible. That having been said, since Git operates using a secure protocol (SSH), gives you a high degree of confidence in the integrity of a repo's contents (due to commit and tree SHA1 hashes), and can implement granular access controls (using e.g. Gitolite ), the answer to your question is most likely ‘yes’
