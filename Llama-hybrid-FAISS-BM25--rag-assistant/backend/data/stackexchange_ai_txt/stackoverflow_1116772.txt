Just wanted to close the loop on this a little bit... We have worked through implementing this with a LINQ to SQL application, but it should work fine with EF also. Essentially, it's laid out in the devx article listed above. http://www.devx.com/dbzone/Article/31336 There are several things we ran into, one of which is the need to "flatten" our data. We have custom routines to flatten the data into a row set that can be consumed by the SSRS reports. You will also need to pay attention to the setup instructions in the article above. Just a reminder, we need to use the Web Service functions of SSRS in our implementation. If you can utilize the local reports, it's much easier. If you are interested in local reports with your domain model, here is a good series I just ran across that uses nHibernate with SSRS. http://codebetter.com/blogs/peter.van.ooijen/archive/2009/07/01/reporting-against-a-domain-model.aspx http://codebetter.com/blogs/peter.van.ooijen/archive/2009/07/08/domain-driven-reports-adding-custom-code.aspx John
