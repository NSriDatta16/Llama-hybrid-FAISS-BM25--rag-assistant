One common algorithm used is the Self-Organizing Map . It is a type of neural network that will automatically categorize your articles. Then you can simply find the location that a current article is in the map and all articles near it are related. The important part of the algorithm is how you would vector quantize your input . There are several ways to do with with text. You can hash your document/title, you can count words and use that as an n dimensional vector, etc. Hope that helps, although I may have opened up a Pandora's box for you of an endless journey in AI.
