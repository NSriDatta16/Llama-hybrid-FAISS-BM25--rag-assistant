Magento - Downloadable products with guest checkout support?

Greetings Iâ€™m having a bit of trouble with the guest checkout system and downloadables. I know that in magento it says that guest checkout will only work with shareable items. Unfortunately none of my products will be shareable. I would like users to be able to checkout as a guest, receive an email with a download link, and download the product. Is this possible? Thanks,
