Explicit bounds for logistic regression parameters

To simplify things, I will ask my question in the case of simple logistic regression but I am also interested in the case with multiple explanatory variables. Let $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ be the observed values of the explanatory variable and $\vec{y} \in \{0,1\}^N$ be the corresponding observed values of the binary response variable. We want to fit a model of the form $p_{\beta_0,\beta_1}(x) = \sigma(\beta_1x+\beta_0)$ which minimizes the logistic loss function: $$ \ell(\beta_0,\beta_1) = \vec{y}\cdot \log( p_{\beta_0,\beta_1}(\vec{x})) + (\vec{1} - \vec{y}) \cdot \log(\vec{1} - p_{\beta_0,\beta_1}(\vec{x})) $$ Letting $$ X = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{1} & \vec{x}\end{bmatrix} \hphantom{dsds} \vec{\beta} = \begin{bmatrix} \beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \end{bmatrix} $$ we have $$ \nabla \ell = X^\top (p_{\vec{\beta}}(\vec{x}) - \vec{y}) $$ I understand that if the data is separable ( if the convex hull of $\{ x_i : y_i = 0\}$ is disjoint from the convex hull of $\{x_i: y_i = 1\}$ ) then there is a unique global minimum of the loss function. If the data is not separable then there is a unique global minimum. Are there any easy bounds on the parameters in the non-seperable case? Let the intersection of those convex hulls be the interval $[x_{min},x_{max}]$ . I would guess that if the data is not separable then we can bound $ x_{min} : graphically this says the inflection point should be located in an area of 'overlap'. It would be nice to have a proof of this. Can we give any bounds on $\beta_1$ in terms of $x_{min}$ and $x_{max}$ ? If we can that would give a nice elementary argument that the global minimum exists and is unique: a minimum would exist by compactness and the uniqueness could be established by computing the Hessian and observing that it is positive semidefinite. It might also be valuable for computational reasons: a good first guess for a solver might be the center of the rectangle in parameter space.
