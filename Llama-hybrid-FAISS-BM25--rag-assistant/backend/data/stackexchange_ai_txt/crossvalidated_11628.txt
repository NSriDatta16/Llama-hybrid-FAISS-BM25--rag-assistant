Assessing reliability of a questionnaire: dimensionality, problematic items, and whether to use alpha, lambda6 or some other index?

I am analyzing scores given by participants attending an experiment. I want to estimate the reliability of my questionnaire which is composed of 6 items aimed at estimating the attitude of the participants towards a product. I computed Cronbach's alpha treating all items as a single scale (alpha was about 0.6) and deleting one item at a time (max alpha was about 0.72). I know that alpha can be underestimated and overestimated depending on the number of items and the dimensionality of the underlying construct. So I also performed a PCA. This analysis revealed that there were three principal components explaining about 80% of the variance. So, my questions are all about how can I proceed now? Do I need to perform alpha computation on each of these dimension? Do I have remove the items affecting reliability? Further, searching on the web I found there is another measure of reliability: the lambda6 of guttman. What are the main differences between this measure and alpha? What is a good value of lambda?
