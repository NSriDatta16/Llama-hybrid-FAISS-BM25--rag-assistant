You have shown no attempted solution so there is no way to know the exact approach you are intended to take for this assignment. Many mathematical statistics books have a general formula for the density function of the $k$ th order statistic of a sample from a distribution in terms of the CDF of the population distribution. In this case, where the population distribution is standard uniform, the formula easily simplifies to show that order statistics of a uniform sample have distributions in the beta family. From there it is trivial to find the mean of the third order statistic out of ten. To illustrate, here is a simulation in R based on a 100,000 samples of size $n=10.$ set.seed(2020) u.3 = replicate(10^5, sort(runif(10))[3]) mean(u.3) [1] 0.272989 # aprx mean; exact 3/11 mean(u.3 > .5) [1] 0.0548 # aprx prob > .5; exact 0.0546875 hist(u.3, prob=T, br=30, col="skyblue2") curve(dbeta(x,3,8), 0, 1, add=T, col="orange", lwd=2) The mean of the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(3, 8)$ is $\mu = \frac{3}{3+8} = \frac{3}{11} = 0.2727,$ which is closely matched by the approximate value $0.2730$ from the simulation. With 100,000 iterations one can expect two or three place accuracy. Note: Very roughly and intuitively, one might expect ten observations from $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1)$ to be spaced on average among 11 intervening intervals (including one at each end), so that the third order statistic would be on average $3/11$ of the way from $0$ to $1.$
