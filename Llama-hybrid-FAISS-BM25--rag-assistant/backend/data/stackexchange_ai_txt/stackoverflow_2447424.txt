According to the codex , it's just robots meta tags, robots.txt and suppression of pingbacks: Causes to be generated into the section (if wp_head is used) of your site's source, causing search engine spiders to ignore your site. Causes hits to robots.txt to send back: User-agent: * Disallow: / Note: The above only works if WordPress is installed in the site root and no robots.txt exists. These are "guidelines" that all friendly bots will follow. A malicious spider searching for E-Mail addresses or forms to spam into will not be affected by these settings.
