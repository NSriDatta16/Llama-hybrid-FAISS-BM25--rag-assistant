I believe that it's best practice (according to some PEP's) that you keep import statements at the beginning of a module. You can add import statements to an __init__.py file, which will import those module to all modules inside the package. So...it's certainly something you can do the way you're doing it, but it's discouraged and actually unnecessary.
