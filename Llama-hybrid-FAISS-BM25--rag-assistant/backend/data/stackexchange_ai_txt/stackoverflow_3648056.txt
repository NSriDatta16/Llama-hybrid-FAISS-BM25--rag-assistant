Help with debugging JQuery Fade Script

For one of my first ventures into JQuery, I have the very simple goal of stepping through the children of a div and fading them in and out one by one. For some reason though, if I manually define an index for nth-child , say 1, then the first child fades in and out four times. If I use the variable "i", however, then all of the children fade in and out four times. Why is this happening? Here is my code: Text1 Text2 Test3 Text4 $(document).ready(function() { var $elements = $('#slideshow').children(); var len = $elements.length; var i = 1; for (i=1;i Each of the paragraphs is set to display: none; initially.
