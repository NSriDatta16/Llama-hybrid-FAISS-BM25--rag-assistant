Regularisation aims at reducing the effects of design matrix being overdetermined or underdetermined , recall solving $Ax=b$ , $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$ . Regularisation is appropriate to use if $p>>m$ (underdetermined) or $p (overdetermined). Here the case is $m>>p$ , overdetermined (m=3000, p=9 in this case). Using LASSO or elastic net regularisation are recommended instead of plain logistic regression. Without regularisation, solution may not be correct. glmnet's introduction will give a good idea how to use LASSO and elastic-net regularisations. See also rank deficiency .
