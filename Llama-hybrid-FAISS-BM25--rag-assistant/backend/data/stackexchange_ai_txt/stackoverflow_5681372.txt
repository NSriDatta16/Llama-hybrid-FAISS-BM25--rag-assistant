Initialize Type by name string in .net

I have an application that reads its setting at startup from App.config. The application may use different presistent storage providers. Currently I have two implemented: Oracle and Dummy (for test purposes). Now in my Program.cs I read the name of the type of storage to use. It may be either OracleStorage or DemoStorage. These are type names, the implementations of which reside in a separate dll project. Now, how do I instantiate an object given that I have a type name? So I could write: IStorageProvider storage = new typof(myStorageClassNameReadFromAppConfig);
