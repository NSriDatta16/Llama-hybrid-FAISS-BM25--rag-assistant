How to increase McFadden score and choose proper predictor for binary logistic regression

This is my first modelling indeed so I need your kind help! Model goal: Generating a predicted surface for forest-loss Model input variables: Response variable is just coded 1(loss) or 0(not loss) and explanatory variables are several types of distance like distance from several types of roads, distance from nearest markets,distance from forest guard posts. I ran the model and found as below: summary(logit_binom_mdl_1) Call: glm(formula = expression_logit_binom_mdl_1, family = binomial(logit), data = model_data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.3371576 -0.9578162 0.1747445 0.9299094 3.3762210 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.6372122561920 0.0826167037310 -31.92105 PseudoR2(logit_binom_mdl_1) McFadden Adj.McFadden Cox.Snell Nagelkerke McKelvey.Zavoina Effron Count Adj.Count 0.1807342677 0.1802847914 0.2216281372 0.2955041829 0.3173878971 0.2233253378 0.6916159945 0.3832319890 AIC Corrected.AIC 211548.5463978653 211548.5819260052 And the ROC curve (AUC is 0.7718432397) Now my question is how can I improve McFadden (>.2). I am trying for this for many days went though several articles. PS. For further background on this question please refer at here .
