How can I find a representative point in 3D matrix (time,lon,lat)

I have temperature in a matrix of time, longitude and latitude. I need to find a way or criterion to find a point or location (lon *, lat *) that is representative of my entire area of interest (time, lon, lat). The idea is that by extracting the time serie from that locality (lon *, lat *), it is a time serie that is most similar to the time series of the other locations. I was thinking of using correlation, that is, finding the point that is mostly correlated with all the other points (spatial autocorrelation is the name?), And thus get a single 2D map where I can do a contourf and see the point (or area) that has the highest correlation. The problem is that I do not know how to get a single 2D map !. Â¿it is there a function in any language (hopefully R, Matlab or Python) or way to do that?
