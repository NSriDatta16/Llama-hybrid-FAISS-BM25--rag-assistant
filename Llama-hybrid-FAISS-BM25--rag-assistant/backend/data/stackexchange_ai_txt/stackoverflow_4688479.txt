What difference does it make if I declare and access a class' property directly?

public class MyData { public String id_number,first_name,last_name,age,level; public MyData(String raw_string){ String[] parameters = raw_string.split(","); for(int x = 1;x I usually declare classes like the one above on my school projects, and now I have been programming for real world applications, I practiced using the get - set approach on the understanding that it provides control only for the class itself. From how I understood it, declaring class properties like the one above can result in unexpected change in value simply by MyData.name = "Here's a new name for me."; Being lazy, I tend to return to that practice because typing getName(); and setName("This is my name"); is too time consuming (I'm aware IDE's can speed things up but still...) Not to mention the time it takes to writing two functions (get and set, plus a clear() if necessary) for each property. So question is, do I really need to comply with the get - set approach? PS: Please rephrase my question to reflect the proper programming terminologies (i did not really pay attention to class that much).
