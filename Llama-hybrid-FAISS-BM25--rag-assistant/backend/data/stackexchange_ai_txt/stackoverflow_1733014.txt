PHP DOM - accessing newly added nodes

I use the following to get a html document into DOM: $dom = new domDocument('1.0', 'utf-8'); $dom->loadHTML($html) and then I add some new content to an element in the html: $element = $dom->getElementById('mybox'); $f = $dom->createDocumentFragment(); $f->appendXML(' foo '); $element->appendChild($f); But if I now want to manipulate the #newbox, I can't do it because I can't access it with getElementById() . In order to do that I have to do the following (reloading with the new html): $html = $dom->saveHTML(); $dom->loadHTML($html) Which works fine, but when having to do this between every dom manipulation, it becomes expensive performance-wise. Is there any better way to "refresh" the DOM so that it works with the newly added elements? Thanks in advance! :)
