I would say grid search is an engineering approach instead of mathematical approach. In addition, the definition of "more intuitive and realistic approach" is not clear to me. For any hyper parameter tuning in machine learning (including SVM gamma and C), we need to consider the bias variance tradeoff. For example, C is the regularization parameter, we need to know making it bigger or smaller will fix overfitting or underfitting (and currently where we are). Many of my answers covered this basic idea of checking overfitting or underfitting. Do not know if you think these are "intuitive and realistic". How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance? How to chose the order for polynomial regression?
