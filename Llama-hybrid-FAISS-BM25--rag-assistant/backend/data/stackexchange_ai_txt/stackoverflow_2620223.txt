I've found an answer to my own question. Sorry! I seem to be doing that a lot lately. Document fragments have a nodeType of 11, and are never inserted into the document, so you can check it like this: if (!node.parentNode || node.parentNode.nodeType == 11) { // this node is floating free } You only need a Document fragment when you are inserting more than one peer node. IE implicitly creates one for all newly created nodes though. Anyway checking the nodeType for 11 works.
