Detect anchor is leading to an active window.location

Having such an html: Blah ... along with such javascript: $("a.someclass").onclick(function() { var link = $(this).attr("href"); if (link == window.location) // this code obviously doesn't work. How to reliably detect that some anchor is leading to the current browser location? Here are some notes: Anchor's href could be either absolute or relative. the fragments of the URLs should be ignored.
