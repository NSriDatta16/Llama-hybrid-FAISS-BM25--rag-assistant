Given an average and a maximum, how determine the minimum range

Suppose that we have $k$ non-negative values. We know the average $A \in \mathbb{N}$ of these values and we know that the maximum value is $M$ (not necessarily $\in \mathbb{N}$ ) we don't know the remaining $k-1$ values. How to determine the smallest possible minimum $m$ such that $$\frac{m+M+\textrm{other_values(unknown)}}{k}=A$$ . We can assume that $M > A$ since $M=A$ if and only if all of the other values are equal and $m=M$ . Note that the assumptions $M> A$ , $m are equivalent.
