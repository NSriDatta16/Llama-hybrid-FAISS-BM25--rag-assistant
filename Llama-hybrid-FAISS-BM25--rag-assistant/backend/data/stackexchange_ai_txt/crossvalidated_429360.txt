Calculating SMD from posttest only - is this possible?

I am performing a meta-analysis (with 'metafor' R-project) as described by Becker (1988), and I compute the standardized mean change for a treatment and control group. I compute a (standardized) effect size measure for pretest posttest control group designs, where the characteristic, response, or dependent variable assessed in the individual studies is a quantitative variable (Morris 2008). See link: http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/analyses:morris2008?s[ Now, two new articles are published recently with only the posttests. Question: can SMDs still be calculated with only the posttest (and sd) of treatment and control groups? Thank you in advance, Roberto
