An organisation/software dev team might want to enforce certain coding standards. For example, in order to improve readability, they might only want attribute X of class Y to be modified with method Z and nothing else. If the class were not final, some developer might extend class Y and add method W, which could modify X in a different way and cause confusion and delay when it came to comprehending the code written.
