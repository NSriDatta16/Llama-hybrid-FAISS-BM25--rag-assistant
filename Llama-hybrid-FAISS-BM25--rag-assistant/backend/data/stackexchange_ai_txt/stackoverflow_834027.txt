How to embed Java Web Start (with jnlp) application on google?

I have created some simple app in Java, and 'deployed' it using Java Web Start (and jnlp) on my local machine. Now I would like to put it on the web, to have some feedback from various people. I was thinking about embedding my app in Google infrastructure (pages.google.com/sites.google.com/blogger.com - whatever). Question: How do I do that? What do I change in my .jnlp file (now i have there local path hardcoded - 'jnlp codebase="file:/D:/Projects/SomeApp/dist"...')? How to embed file structure (/../dist/somefiles and /../dist/lib/somefiles) into (mentioned) Google infrastructure?
