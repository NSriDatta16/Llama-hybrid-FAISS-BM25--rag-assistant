drag and drop- only COPY vs move

I am looking to implement the drag and drop functionality in flex. I have been able to do that using the drag manager Drag and drop examples Only my need is slightly different- I want a copy of the dragged object to be placed, rather than the original object. Any guidance on how to make this possible. Also, I would like a id to be created dynamically for this dropped object for control. Thanks
