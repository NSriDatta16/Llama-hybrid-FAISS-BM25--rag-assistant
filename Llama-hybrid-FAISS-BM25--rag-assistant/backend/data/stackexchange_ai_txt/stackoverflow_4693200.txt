SQL query erroring - need fresh eyes

Ok, first, I'm building a query to search MLS data that has been provided in the form of a MySQL database, So I don't have control over the data format, and thus I believe I have to do a lot of casting to get the data in a manageable form. The SQL error is being thown. #1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ' DECIMAL(2, 1)) / .5, CAST(idx1.full_baths, DECIMAL(2, 1))), DECIMAL(2, 1)) AS b' at line 1 Looked up the error code and it sends me to a reserved words page, but I can't identify any reserved words. and now the sql (all fields are natively VARCHAR ) SELECT idx_common.mls_no AS mls_no, CONCAT_WS(" ", idx_common.street_no, idx_common.street_direction, idx_common.street_name) AS address, idx_common.city AS city, idx_common.state AS state, idx_common.total_sqft AS total_sqft, idx_common.asking_price AS price, idx1.bedrooms AS bedrooms, CAST( SUM( (CAST(idx1.half_baths, DECIMAL(2, 1)) / .5), CAST(idx1.full_bath, DECIMAL(2, 1)) ), DECIMAL(2, 1) ) AS bathrooms, idx1.residential_prop_type AS type, "Listing Agent" AS agent FROM (idx_common) JOIN idx1 ON idx_common.mls_no = idx1.mls_no WHERE `idx_common`.`mls_no` = 'query' OR idx_common.zip LIKE '%query%' OR idx_common.city LIKE '%query%'
