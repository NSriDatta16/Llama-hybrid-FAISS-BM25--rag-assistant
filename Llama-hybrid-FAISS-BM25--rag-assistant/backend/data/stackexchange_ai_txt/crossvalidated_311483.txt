Estimating total number of objects based on sample weights

I have a collection of bugs which is unfeasible to count because they are too numerous, tiny, and fragile. I would like to estimate how many bugs are in the collection. So, I thought to do a simple plot based on weights of samples. I would weigh x bugs, several times, and then plot sample size against sample weight. Then I could look at the graph at the weight of the entire collection, to get the estimated count. Considering that I can weigh the entire collection as a whole, how do I determine what sample size I would need? And how do I consider the error in the weights, i.e. the amount of spread in the weights recorded for samples of a given size?
