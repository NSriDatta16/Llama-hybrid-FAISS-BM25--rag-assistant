What is happening is that when python sees foo = bar as the first reference to foo in a function it assumes that it is a local variable. In python3k you can get around this by using the nonlocal keyword. For 2.x you can wrap your retval in a list so that you aren't directly assigning to it. retval = [True] def cb(widget): retval[0] = False gtk.main_quit() ... return retval[0] not really an elegant solution, hence the addition of nonlocal in 3.x ( PEP )
