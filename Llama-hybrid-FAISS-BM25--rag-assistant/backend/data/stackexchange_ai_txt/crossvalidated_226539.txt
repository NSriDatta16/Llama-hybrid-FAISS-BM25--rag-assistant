Backpropagation Neural Network stoppping criteria with online training with stochastic gradient descent

I have implemented backpropagation algorithm for neural network. The neural network is trained using online stochastic gradient descent. (with regularization). I have used a separate training and validation data sets. would like to know the how to determine the optimum number of epochs. Thanks
