how to parse XML document?

I have xml document in variable (not in file). How can i get data storaged in that? I don't have any additional file with that, i have it 'inside' my sourcecode. When i use DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance(); DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder(); Document doc = db.parse(XML); (XML is my xml variable), i get an error java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\netbeans\app-s7013\ File not found.
