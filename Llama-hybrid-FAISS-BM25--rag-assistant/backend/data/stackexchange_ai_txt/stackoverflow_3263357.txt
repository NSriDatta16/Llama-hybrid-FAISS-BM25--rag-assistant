Using the Facebook Graph API, how can I get the contents of a page?

For example, here's a 'page': http://www.facebook.com/facebook That page has an RSS feed (which I'd like to use, ideally), but a) it browser-sniffs meaning I need to fake the user-agent from a script to fetch it - and that feels really brittle b) the quality of the data returned is really poor. Can I use the graph api to fetch the same data? This URL: https://graph.facebook.com/facebook/feed implies that I can , and json is fine for me, although I'm fetching this from a PHP script rather than client-side. However, when I try that URL for my actual page, I get the following: { "error": { "type": "OAuthAccessTokenException", "message": "An access token is required to request this resource." } } I don't understand why an access token is required for my page, whilst other pages are 'more public' - is that a configuration on the page somewhere? If not, what's the best way of obtaining the access key - note that this is not an interactive script asking the page owner to authenticate.
