LETOR data sets, which contain the queries and documents?

While researching information retrieval evaluation, I found LETOR . This is a test collection used for evaluation of ranking algorithms. Since the data contains relevance judgements for queries, it can also be used as a test collection for information retrieval evaluation (precision, recall...). I checked the whole site, but didn't find the queries and the documents, which are the foundation for the relevance judgements. Where can I find the actual data? (I am afraid it is not freely available)
