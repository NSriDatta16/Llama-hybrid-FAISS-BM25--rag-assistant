ICC Value of 0. Boundary singular fit? Interpretation?

In this case I have 7 samples in which the concentration of a particular analyte was measured and the measurement was repeated 3 times for each sample. Here's the data 1 2.17 3.36 3.54 2 2.97 2.16 2.85 3 2.75 2.99 2.07 4 2.46 1.92 2.83 5 2.63 2.56 2.48 6 2.44 2.47 2.49 7 2.53 3.81 2.32 I want to calculate the test-retest reliability using ICC but the results I get are this > ICC(df,missing=FALSE) boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular Call: ICC(x = df, missing = FALSE) Intraclass correlation coefficients type ICC F df1 df2 p lower bound upper bound Single_raters_absolute ICC1 0 1 6 14 0.46 -0.31 0.59 Single_random_raters ICC2 0 1 6 12 0.47 -0.32 0.59 Single_fixed_raters ICC3 0 1 6 12 0.47 -0.32 0.59 Average_raters_absolute ICC1k 0 1 6 14 0.46 -2.50 0.81 Average_random_raters ICC2k 0 1 6 12 0.47 -2.73 0.81 Average_fixed_raters ICC3k 0 1 6 12 0.47 -2.73 0.81 Number of subjects = 7 Number of Judges = 3 Why would the ICC be 0 and what does the warning boundary (singular) fit mean in layman terms?
