So while posting my own answer, I'm not saying that gems like domainatrix or public_suffix_server aren't good elegant solutions (although the latter bugged on me immediately which caused me to go this route). People suggesting using split() made me realize that I could just sub out 'www.' if it existed and otherwise leave domains as they are without installing gems and using 1 simple line of code: url = request.original_url domain = URI.parse(url).host.sub(/\Awww\./, '') This works with subdomains and multi-part suffixes (eg. co.uk). Anybody see anything wrong with this? EDIT: Thanks sorens for pointing out the weak regex I was originally using. This expression is certainly better.
