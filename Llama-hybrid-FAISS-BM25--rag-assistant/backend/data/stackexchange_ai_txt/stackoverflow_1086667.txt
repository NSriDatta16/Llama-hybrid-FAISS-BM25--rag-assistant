I downloaded the Eclipse SDK and checked the differences, and I finally got it to work. Download this JAR into your eclipse/plugins directory. Edit the file source.info in your eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.source directory, and add the following line: org.junit4.source,4.5.0.v20090423,plugins/org.junit4.source_4.5.0.v20090423.jar,-1,false Open the file artifacts.xml in your eclipse directory, and add the following fragment: If Eclipse is already open, you'll need to restart it for the changes to be detected. Note: For Eclipse 3.6 (Helios), you should use the updated JAR(s). See the comments by @Supressingfire and @Milo. Note: on Eclipse 3.6(Helios), step 3 (artifacts.xml) is not necessary. Tested on Ubuntu Eclipse 3.6: Version: Helios Service Release 2 Build id: 20110218-0911
