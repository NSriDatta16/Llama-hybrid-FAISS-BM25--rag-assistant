FA for mixed data types, including dichotomous

I wish to conduct factor analysis on data that I have. The data is collected from a questionnaire and contains different types of data, for example, there are answers to the following questions: What is your age? (Number) What is your gender? (4 - Female, 5 - Male) Which country are you from? (Number - different number assigned to different country) Do you have a smartphone? (0 or 1) Do you have a tablet? (0 or 1) Do you have an activity tracker? (0 or 1) What is your level of education? (0,1,2 or 3) How many days will you input data? (Any number between 0 and 100) and then one I have combined one more question which is obtained from an app, not a questionnaire and it answers the question: How many days was data input (for this particular person)? (Any number from greater than 0) I am trying to "categorise" types of people based on these questions. I want to understand any patterns or correlations occurring between all these different dimensions. At first, I started out conducting PCA on this data but quickly realised, after reading lots of posts on here about PCA, that this is probably wrong given my data is quite different and it would be hard to find meaningful correlations between these different types of data. So I moved on to factor analysis which is better at handling this type of data (or that's my understanding). What I don't understand is that can I only do the analysis on the data that is similar? For example, can I only compare the data that has answers O's and 1's with each other or can I still conduct FA on this? I am new to both PCA and FA and would really appreciate any guidance! Many of the posts on this forum have been massively useful in furthering my understanding but this is sort of the last point that is unclear to me.
