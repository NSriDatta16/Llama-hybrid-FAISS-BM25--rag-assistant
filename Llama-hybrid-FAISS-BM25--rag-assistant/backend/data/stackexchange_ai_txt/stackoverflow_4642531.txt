There are multiple methods of communicating between documents on different domains, amongst these HTML5 postMessage, NIX, FIM(hash/fragment), frameElement and by using the window.name property. These are available on different browsers and in different versions, but collectively they allow you to do reliable XDM (cross domain messaging). One project that have done this earlier is Apache Shindig, which probably pioneered quite a few of these, and more recently, the project easyXDM has come, unifying all of these approaches with a common API, making it easy to create complex applications using XDM and RPC. You can read in depth about the various methods of transporting the data in this article at Script Junkie . Now, to answer your question directly, earlier on it was quite common to believe that there was only postMessage, the FIM (Fragment Identifier Messaging) available, and for the latter to work efficiently, one often had to upload a special file to your domain. As more methods have been discovered, this has by many been deprecated as a technique, and hence; no more need for the file. Just for the record; I'm the author of both the Script Junkie article, and the easyXDM library (that is what Twitter, Disqus and quite a few more are using by the way).
