What is the intuitive reason behind doing rotations in Factor Analysis/PCA & how to select appropriate rotation?

My Questions What is the intuitive reason behind doing rotations of factors in factor analysis (or components in PCA)? My understanding is, if variables are almost equally loaded in the top components (or factors) then obviously it is difficult to differentiate the components. So in this case one could use rotation to get better differentiation of components. Is this correct? What are the consequence of doing rotations? What things does this affect? How to select appropriate rotation? There are orthogonal rotations & oblique rotations. How to choose between these and what are the implications of this choice? Please explain intuitively with least mathematical equations. Few of the spread out answers were math heavy but I am looking more for intuitive reasons and rules of thumb.
