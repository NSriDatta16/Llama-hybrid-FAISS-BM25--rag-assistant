Getting error publishing Silverlight 3 app on IIS 6 \ Windows 2003

I get the error below when I'm publishing a Silverlight 3 app on a IIS 6 \ Windows 2003 box. The app is just a vs08>file>new project>Silverlight App with the mainpage having one textblock that says "TEST". I get this error when I'm in IE only, but Firefox, Chrome just show nothing (no error and no app). The error is a bit confusing since the error has "Mozilla" in it, but maybe that is something i'm not familiar with. This server already has a Silverlight application on it that runs fine, although that one is a bit more complicated since there is an aspx login page first. If I publish the test Silverlight app on my IIS5\XP box it work fine. I just create new virtual dir and point to the website. I'm assuming that i'm missing something that I need to do on IIS 6. Or perhaps I'm just missing something else that is probably some obvious. Any ideas? Thanks!
