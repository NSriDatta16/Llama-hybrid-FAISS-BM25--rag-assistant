There's not much you can do. You can use an activation scheme which calls home. Every purchase will have a unique serial # which is in your database. If the keygen creates a # which is not your database, it's not genuine. If too many users (different ip addresses) are using the same serial #, the serial # has been leaked and the activation will disable the installation. However if it's a cracked version where the call home routine has been disabled, you're out of luck. Keep adding new good features so that the people who have an old copy/cracked version will be encouraged to buy it. Make sure a 'look for updates' is implemented so they get the prompt as a reminder.
