Break down what "BLUE" means. BEST (minimum-variance) LINEAR UNBIASED ESTIMATOR The MLE estimators for GLMs are estimators, sure, so that covers E . In general, MLEs are not unbiased. For instance, most logistic regressions will have biased coefficient estimates. Thus, general GLM MLEs could, at best, be BLE . The LINEAR refers to the estimator being a linear combination of the outcome, so some matrix times the $y$ vector. This would be a closed-form solution to the GLM MLE, not all of which have closed-form solutions (again, such as logistic regressions). Finally, the BEST refers to having the smallest variance among some class of estimators, linear and unbiased estimators in the case of the Gauss-Markov theorem. With both the L and the U not holding in general for GLM MLEs, the class to which BEST would apply is to estimators that need not be linear and might be biased, so basically anything. As constants have zero variance, any constant is a zero-variance estimator of GLM coefficients, thus having lower variance than an MLE that can vary, depending on the data. (By a "constant" estimator, I mean that you predict the same values for the coefficients, regardless of the data. This is silly, sure, but it is an estimator.) So GLM MLEs need not be unbiased, need not be linear, and need not be the best. So you wind up with just the letter E from BLUE , that the GLM MLEs are estimators. Fortunately, maximum likelihood estimators have a number of other desirable properties, hence their common use.
