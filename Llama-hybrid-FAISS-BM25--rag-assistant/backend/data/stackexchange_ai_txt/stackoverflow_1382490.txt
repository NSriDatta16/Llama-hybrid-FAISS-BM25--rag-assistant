Combining the two above answers, one really convoluted way of doing it could be to have a footnotes section, like print text, where it goes below the content (in terms of the DOM), but each footnoted area gets a span with an id like footnoted-1 and the footnoted area gets a corresponding id like footnote-1 . Then use a nice js framework like jquery that grabs all footnotes and gives them a position relative to the area of the content. Quick note, though: I was trying something like this (not quite as fancy but same principle) for a site, and another problem became obvious really quickly. Sometimes your margin notes are longer than the cooresponding paragraph and sometimes there are several notes for one paragraph. Things get crowded quickly and styling becomes useless. While I'm not a fan of this style of site, you may want to consider ditching the side margin idea and use the technique other sites employ, which is having noted text in a different style (dotted underline or highlighted background) and users can see notes when they hover over the text.
