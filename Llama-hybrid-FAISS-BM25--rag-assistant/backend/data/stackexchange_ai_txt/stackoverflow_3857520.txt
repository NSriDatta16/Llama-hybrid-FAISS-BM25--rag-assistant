XAML and UI Development

I've been given the task of coming up to speed, at least at a basic level, with WPF. I'm going through the WPF 4 Unleashed book. The first part of the book is going through XAML. My questions are these: Do people really design their forms using pure XAML (manually creating XAML code)? The only thing I can think of that might be more tedious than this approach is writing forms in assembler. Are tools like Expression Blend designed to allow you to develop WPF forms the traditional drag/drop way and then create the XAML for you? Thanks very much.
