A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learns the spatial relationships in the data that are associated with the target values. In text data, the spatial relationships are which words are near each other. A specific example is the "changing on the fly" is associated with the rec.sport.hockey category. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learns single latent representation of the data over the sequential sequence. That representation does not have an advantage on the evaluation metric performance for this problem. In other words, learning a couple of important words to categorize text is faster and has just about the same evaluation metric performance as learning to represent the entire body of text.
