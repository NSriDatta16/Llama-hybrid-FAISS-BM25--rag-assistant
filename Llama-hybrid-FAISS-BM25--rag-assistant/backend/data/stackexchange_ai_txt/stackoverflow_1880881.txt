jQuery : Attaching mouseup event to all textnodes of a container

I want to attach a "mouseup" event on all nodes of a container, including text nodes using jQuery. How do I do that? Update: If I had some HTML fragment like this: Some text node strong text another text node. Currently, $("p *") will apply the event to the and but not to the 2 textnodes within separately. Modifying the source to add classes is not an option.
