Multiple storage of images and BLOB files in SQL Server

I have a question about this query on inserting. INSERT INTO BLOBTest (BLOBName, BLOBData) SELECT 'First test file', BulkColumn FROM OPENROWSET( Bulk 'C:\temp\nextup.jpg', SINGLE_BLOB) AS BLOB It works great, but my question is how do I insert more than one image at a time? I have a directory that has 1000+ images I need to insert. They are all named in order (image0001, image0002, etc...) Any assistance is greatly appreciated.
