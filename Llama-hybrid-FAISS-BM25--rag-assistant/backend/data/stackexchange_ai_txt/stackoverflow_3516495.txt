You can use the standardized versions available in modern C and C++ implementations in the header file: stdint.h It has types of the like: uint8_t, int32_t, etc. In general this is a good way to protect code against platform dependency. Even if you haven't experienced a need for it to date, it certainly makes the code easier to interpret since one doesn't need to guess a storage size as you would for 'int' or 'long' which will vary in size with platform.
