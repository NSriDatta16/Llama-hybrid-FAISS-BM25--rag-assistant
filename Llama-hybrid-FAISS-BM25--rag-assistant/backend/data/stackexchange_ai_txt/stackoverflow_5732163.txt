For starters, you can leverage chaining to make your code a bit more succinct: $('.grid_12').each(function(){ $(this) .find('img') .each(function(){ $(this) .attr("src", $(this).attr('src').replace('/StandardImage/','/MidSizeImage/')); }) .end() .width($(this).find('img').outerWidth()); }); Now, as to your problem, what's happening is that you are loading an image (by changing it's src) and then immediately trying to get its dimensions without first checking to see if the image had finished loading yet. It looks like this question may help steer you in the right direction: How can I determine if an image has loaded, using Javascript/jQuery?
