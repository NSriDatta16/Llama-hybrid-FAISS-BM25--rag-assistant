Interpreting CCF correlation in R

I am using ccf to find a correlation between 2 time series. I am getting a plot that looks like that: Note that I am mainly interested in correlation for the lag=0. Questions: Do interpret it correctly that there is a cross-correlation for the lag=0, as for this lag the cross-correlation is above the dotted line? How should I interpret the level of cross-correlation in this example, is this significant (as I interpret it right now, there is a small cross-correlation)? How can I extract only acf value for lag=0?
