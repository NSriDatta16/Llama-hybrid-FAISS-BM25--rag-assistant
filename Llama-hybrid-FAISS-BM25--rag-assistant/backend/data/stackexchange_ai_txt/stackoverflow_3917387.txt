Easy way to turn a Rails form into an AJAX form?

I have the following form in my Rails application: 'recoverPasswordForm' do %> Email Address: &nbsp; Login Instead When this form is submitted, the page must reload. I would like to easily turn this form into an AJAX form, such that the form submits via AJAX, and a page reload does not happen. I could do this easily using jQuery, hooking into the .submit() function. But, I am curious: does Rails provide some easy way to turn any given form into an AJAX form? Or, what's the simplest (yet elegant) way possible? Maybe something like 'recoverPasswordForm', :ajax => true do %> I'm using Rails 2.
