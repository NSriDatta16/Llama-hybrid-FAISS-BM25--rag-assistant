Monitoring and reporting on Performance of .NET components

I am looking for a solution for monitoring a number of .NET components for a system where performance is critical. I have been looking at performance counters, which generally provide the information needed. The end result is that I would like a number of counters written to a database to be able to report upon. I would like to hold a history of the counters but to be further summarised as time goes by, i.e. show average for hour, day, week etc. Performance and availability is key for this system. Are performance counters the way to go or is there a better solution to collect required performance statistics? I would welcome any suggestions, links etc
