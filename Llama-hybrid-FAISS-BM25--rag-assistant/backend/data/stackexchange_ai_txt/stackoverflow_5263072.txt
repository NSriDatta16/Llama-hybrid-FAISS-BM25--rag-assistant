You could very well create a class for the green circles, and contain all listeners and tweened reaction features within it. A very solid method. You may also leverage event propagation on a movie clip / sprite containing all mouseable elements to achieve the same thing with a single listener set: var myContainer:Sprite = new Sprite(); //add all elements myContainer.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OVER, over, true, 0, false); myContainer.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT, out, true, 0, false); private function over(e:MouseEvent):void { TweenLite.to(e.target, .5, { alpha:1.0 }); } private function out(e:MouseEvent):void { TweenLite.to(e.target, .5, { alpha:0.5}); } Basically, you add the listener to the containing object, and events are passed down to the children, who then receive the event instructions. The ".target" of the propagating object, received in the MouseEvent argument is the key here. I'm using the fantastic TweenLite framework here, as mentioned by others, and you should too. cheers and good luck!
