Get Position Of Field In Struct

A fairly simple question (I hope). Given a struct in C (the layout of which is known at compile time), is there a way (via macro, or other) that I can access the byte position of a named field in the struct? Support for unions would be a bonus. The compiler is VC++ 2008. Assume that #pragma pack(1) is used. Cheers
