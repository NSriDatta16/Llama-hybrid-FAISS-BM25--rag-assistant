Just a guess but if organArray is intended to be a member of your app delegate, you are creating a new organArray when prefixing it with "NSMutableArray" so if I understand your code, change your app delegate to: organArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; instead of: NSMutableArray *organArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
