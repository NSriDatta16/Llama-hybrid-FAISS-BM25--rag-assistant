Outlier detection in short time series with two seasonalities

I have short daily time series (less than 4 years) representing sales and exhibiting two seasonalities (weekly and yearly) and I am seeking to identify outliers (not only data reporting errors but also particular events impacting the sales). Because of the presence of a trend and seasonalities, I think detrending and deseasonalising data beforehand is necessary; so I was thinking of using decomposition models based on moving averages to get the irregular component and then use statistical tests (Z score methods, use of interquartile range...) or distance/density based algorithms but the results will be closely related to the quality of the decomposition (that depends itself on the number of outliers) and I am not even sure it will work. Or I was thinking of using the method exposed by Tsay to detect the different types of outliers (additive, innovational, level shifts...) using regARIMA models with dummy variables for festivals, trends and seasonalities (I hope I will have enough data for that). I have only free software (R) at my disposal. Which would be the best approach to adopt ? I would be vey grateful for any help.
