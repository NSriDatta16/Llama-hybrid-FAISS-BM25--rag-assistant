I had exactly the same question and asked one of NHibernate development team members directly, here is the answer I got: with the Criteria API, the only thing you could do is to use a projection list and include all of the properties of the root entity... then you would need to use the AliasToBeanResultTransformer. Far from an optimal solution obviously if you don't mind rewriting the query with hql, then you can do it very easily. an hql query that says "from MyEntity e join e.Association" will select both the entity columns as well as the association's columns (just like the problem you're having with criteria). But an hql query that says "select e from MyEntity e join e.Association" will only select the columns of e.
