Do you have any plugins installed, or are you filtering the_content elsewhere? By default, the content passed through the filter the_content is pretty much what's in the database, minus a bit of parsing (handling !-- more --> teasers etc.). Are you sure that the post content does actually contain HTML? Don't forget WordPress will add paragraphs on-the-fly, and won't necessarily store them in the DB.
