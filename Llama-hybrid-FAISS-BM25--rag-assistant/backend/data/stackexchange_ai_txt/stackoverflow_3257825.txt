LESS and SASS are the two major contenders for 'the language CSS should have been'; right now, only LESS has a .NET port. Before you go and integrate a new component into your web application, you might want to ask yourself what you want to achieve. Are you spending more time than you'd like finding existing CSS rules to change them? Are you introducing bugs as fast as you fix them, because of rule interactions? The answers to those questions will help you decide what kind of cleanup/refactoring/reorganization you really want. Also, you should consider whether some of your CSS problems come from your markup; simpler, saner markup might go a long way toward making your CSS easier to understand.
