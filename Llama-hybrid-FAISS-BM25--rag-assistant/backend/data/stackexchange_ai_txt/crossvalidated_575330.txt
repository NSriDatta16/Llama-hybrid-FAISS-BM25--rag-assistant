The reason that you get high a high amount of significant coefficients does not have to do with lasso but with the regression with time series. Time series often tend to correlate (more likely than two random Gaussian white noise vectors tend to correlate). See also this question: Why do these time series appear to be dependent? and this article written by Yule in 1926 "Why do we Sometimes get Nonsense-Correlations between Time-Series?--A Study in Sampling and the Nature of Time-Series" The reasons are because your linear model is not a correct model for the error distribution. What you have here are time series with autocorrelation. The consequence is that if a particular vector $x_i(t)$ has at some time $t$ a value close to $y(t)$ then it will also have values close at times nearby $t$ . Effectively the degrees of freedom is not nobs . The reason that it 'works' when you base $Y$ on a variable $X_1$ in the regressor matrix, is because now the autocorrelated part is fully explained by $X_1$ and the other variables are only used to explain the remainder which is Gaussian white noise instead of correlated noise. Sidenote: You have 'spurious relation' and 'spurious correlation'. The latter term is a bit unclear or at least less common. You might want to explain this when you use it. See also Misunderstandings of "spurious correlation"?
