Instead of random forest, you can also use tree-boosting for the fixed effects part in a model with random effects. The GPBoost library with Python and R packages builds on LightGBM and allows for combining tree-boosting and mixed effects models. Simply speaking it is an extension of linear mixed effects models where the fixed-effects are learned using tree-boosting. See this blog post and Sigrist (2020) for further information.
