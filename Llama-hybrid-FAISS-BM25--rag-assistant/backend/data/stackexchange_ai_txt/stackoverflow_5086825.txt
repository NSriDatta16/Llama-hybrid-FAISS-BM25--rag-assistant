Well there are two options. You could do the simple fix by having a designated view model object which stores the preformated date time values as a string. This is generally what i do. I can then tryparse for the date value for validation. The other option would be to implement a custom data binding. You can look at doing that here . This would be the more elegant approach. The nice thing about this apporach, you can then create you UI generation code on binding allowing you to add date picker to the ui in the process.
