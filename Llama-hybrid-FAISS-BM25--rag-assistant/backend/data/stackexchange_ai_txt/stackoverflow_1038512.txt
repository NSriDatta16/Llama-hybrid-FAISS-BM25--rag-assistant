How to flash web browser's window using JS

In a web app that I am writing there is web page (dashboard) which gets refreshed every 10 seconds. On refresh if there is any new data then I have to draw users attention. According to me the only possible solution for this is to draw users attention by flashing browser's window. So if browser's window is not the active window then the user will see the blinking icon on Windows task bar. How can I do this in Java Script? Currently we have implemented Google's way by changing title bar contents. But our clients want to blink browser's window because he has see something like this on a web ( Maersk ) with live support (chat).
