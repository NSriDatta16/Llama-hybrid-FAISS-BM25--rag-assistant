The closer thing I know of would be llvm::SmallVector however it's slightly more complicated since it uses dynamically allocated storage when the size grows beyond N (it also copies the existing items, since the storage is guaranteed to be contiguous). I don't think it would be difficult to realize such a container though, especially using boost::array as a backend. A simple wrapper to maintain the size and move the items around (taking inspiration from the code of vector for example) should be sufficient.
