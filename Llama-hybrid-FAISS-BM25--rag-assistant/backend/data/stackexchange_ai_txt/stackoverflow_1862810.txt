how can I write correct code in the first place If this question had a trivial answer, we wouldn't have day jobs. While there is some academic work on the "proveability" of software programs, there's no substitute for a logical thinking and attention to detail -- particularly if all you have is a whiteboard and a marker. As others have mentioned interviewers generally give some leeway for syntax errors but gross logical mistakes are less likely to be ignored.
