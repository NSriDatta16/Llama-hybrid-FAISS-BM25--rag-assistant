In Ruby / Rails, why "gem server" says haml depends on maruku and yard but "gem list" doesn't show these gems?

If I run gem server and go to localhost:8808 , one of the entry is haml and it says it depends on maruku and yard haml 3.0.22 [rdoc] [www] - depends on maruku, yard. An elegant, structured XHTML/XML templating engine. Comes with Sass, a similar CSS templating engine. Executables are css2sass, haml, html2haml, sass, sass-convert. but when I gem list on the command line, there is no maruku and no yard ? I thought if haml depends on them, then the installation would have installed them?
