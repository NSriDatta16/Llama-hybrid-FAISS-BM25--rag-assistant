Outgoing load balancer

I have a big threaded feed retrieval script in python. My question is, how can I load balance outgoing requests so that I don't hit any one host too often? This is a big problem for feedburner, since a large percentage of sites proxy their RSS through feedburner and to further complicate matters many sites will alias a subdomain on their domain to feedburner to obscure the fact that they're using it (e.g. "mysite" sets its RSS url to feeds.mysite.com/mysite, where feeds.mysite.com bounces to feedburner). Sometimes it blocks me for awhile and redirects to their "automated requests" error page .
