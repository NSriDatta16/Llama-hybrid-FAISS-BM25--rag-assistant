Making sense of a accuracy plot for a 5 fold training using random forest

I'm using sklearn.model_selection.learning_curve for 5 fold training of data. The code is as given below. train_sizes = [1, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 3879] train_sizes,train_scores, validation_scores = learning_curve(estimator = ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(), X = X_res, y = y_res, train_sizes = train_sizes, cv = 5, scoring = 'accuracy') train_scores_mean = train_scores.mean(axis = 1) validation_scores_mean = validation_scores.mean(axis =1) plt.style.use('seaborn') plt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores_mean, label = 'Training acc') plt.plot(train_sizes, validation_scores_mean, label = 'Validation acc') plt.ylabel('Accuracy', fontsize = 14) plt.xlabel('Training set size', fontsize = 14) plt.title('Learning curves for a linear RF model', fontsize = 18, y = 1.03) plt.legend() Also, I'm using the random forest classifier model for a multiclass classification problem. When I plot the accuracy graph, it appears like the below. How's it possible that the mean training accuracy for all training sizes is 100%? Any help is appreciated.
