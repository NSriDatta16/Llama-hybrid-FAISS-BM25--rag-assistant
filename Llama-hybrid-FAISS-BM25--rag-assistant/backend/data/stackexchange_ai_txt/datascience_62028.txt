http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf - Link above no longer works, please see way back machine here: https://web.archive.org/web/20200122034155/http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf I'm a complete and utter newbie when it comes to neural networks so please take this answer with many grains of salt, but the provided link shows error surface for a single neuron on page 2 and the third to last page discusses rmprop. Maybe setting epochs higher would allow your models to converge after starting on different slices of test data? Adding description: Slide 2: error surface for linear neuron Slide 29: discussion of rprop vs rmsprop
