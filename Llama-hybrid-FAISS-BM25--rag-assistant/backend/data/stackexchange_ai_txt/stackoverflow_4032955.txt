cl_out_of_resources error in atom_inc/atomic_inc

i am using atom_inc in one of my kernels. More or less like this: kernel exampleKernel( global volatile int * x, global const int maxX, global const int * buf1, global const int * buf2 ) { if(x But it gives me an CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES error when i call it. Replacing atom_inc(x) with 0 resolves this problem ... but makes the kernel useless. Any ideas what can cause that error? Edit: i have included these extensions in the program: #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_global_int32_base_atomics : enable #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics : enable Edit2: actually i initialize x with: kernel.setArgs(0,0); Do i have to use a memory object in this place? Kind Regards, Florian
