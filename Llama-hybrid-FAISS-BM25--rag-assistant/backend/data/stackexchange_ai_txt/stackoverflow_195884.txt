I'd disagree that code coverage isn't a useful metric. If you don't have 100% code coverage, that at least indicates areas that need more tests. In general, though - once you get adequate statement coverage, the next logical place to go is in writing tests that are either designed to directly verify the requirements that the code was written to meet, or that are intended to stress the edge-cases. Neither of these will fall naturally out of anything you can easily measure directly.
