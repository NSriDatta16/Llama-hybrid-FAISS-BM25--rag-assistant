No, that is not correct. If that were true, then eventually I would become old enough that the probability I leave university would be less than 0. The correct interpretation is that the odds of the outcome are reduced by 5.5%. If $p(x)$ is the risk of the outcome conditioned on covariates $x$ , then logistic regression makes the assumption that $$ \log\Big( \dfrac{p}{1-p} \Big) = x^T\beta $$ The LHS of this equation is called the "log odds" because the argument to $\log$ is the odds. Hence a unit increase in covariate $x_j$ means the log odds will change by $\beta_j$ or alternatively that the odds will change by a factor of $\exp(\beta_j)$ . In order to know what the change in probability is, you need to transform the odds onto the probability scale by solving for $p$ , yielding $$ p = \dfrac{1}{1 + \exp(-x^T \beta)}$$ and taking the difference between estimated risks. Note, a change of $\exp(\beta_j)$ in the odds will result in bigger/smaller changes depending on what the baseline risk is. A doubling of the odds results in a smaller change in probability when the baseline risk is small/large as compared to when the baseline risk is near 0.5. We can plot this very easily to see the change in risk.
