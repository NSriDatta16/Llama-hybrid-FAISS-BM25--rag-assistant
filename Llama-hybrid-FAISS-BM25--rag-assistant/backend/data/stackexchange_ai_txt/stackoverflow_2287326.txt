I've worked on this on a coldfire system (no mmu, small memory, i.e. size is of importance). As the entire GUI consisted of custom widgets, we stripped out all classes except QWidget using qconfig. We also took the liberty of removing all resources from the projects files (i.e. stock icons, etc). The result was, if I recall correctly, a library size of ~960kB. That was rather unusable though, resulting in us having to reimplementing quite a few widgets. However, we did not have touch nor a proper keyboard so we could write small, compact widgets. As we did this, we hardcoded the styling into the widgets, reducing the need for having QStyle's, etc.
