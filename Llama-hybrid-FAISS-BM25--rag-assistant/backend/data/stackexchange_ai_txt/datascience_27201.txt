You more than likely do not have enough training data for a neural network. Your class imbalance problem is probably an issue. Instead of using accuracy as a measurement trying some type of F-score. Batch normalization should be applied between the convolution layer and the activation function. If you think you have a vanishing or dying activation problem, plot the gradients or the sum of gradients. It'll give you an idea if you're right or not.
