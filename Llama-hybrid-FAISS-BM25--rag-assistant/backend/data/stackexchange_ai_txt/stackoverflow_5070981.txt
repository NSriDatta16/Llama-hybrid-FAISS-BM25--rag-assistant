I would recommend checkout testflightapp.com for this. It's much easier. However, if you have to do this, you have to add the device ids in itunesconnect to the provisioning profile, then re-download that profile and build/sign the app with that profile. You can then build and archive and then use the Organizer to save the archive to an IPA. But really, use testflight.
