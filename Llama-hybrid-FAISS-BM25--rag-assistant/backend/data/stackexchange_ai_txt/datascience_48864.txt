I was doing very similar exercise. I've generated the synthetic dataset: y = 10 * x + noise and fitted one Random Forest model with full trees and one with pruned: # ranadom forest with full trees rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50) # random forest with pruned trees rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50, min_samples_leaf=25) I got following predictions on test data: As you can see the Random Forest with full trees clearly overfit while Random Forest with pruned trees generalize much better. Here is a link for my full experiment.
