Random forests resample the data for each of the trees that are built, using sampling with replacement from the full set of observations. Thus, with very high probability, every tree is based on a different set of observations. Given that, we would expect that, even if the same variable is chosen to make the split at the top of the tree, the split values themselves would change.
