If your priority goal is to compare species composition between sites, I recommend using multivariate statistics for community analysis. For this you would need to set up your count data as below. | Continent | Species 1 | Species 2 | Species 3 | |!---------!|!---------!|!---------!|!---------!| | Africa | 0 | 3 | 1 | | Europe | 1 | 1 | 0 | Then you can analyze the similarity of the continents using PERMANOVA or ANOSIM in the Vegan Package and visualize the pre-defined groups (continents) using ordination such as NMDS.
