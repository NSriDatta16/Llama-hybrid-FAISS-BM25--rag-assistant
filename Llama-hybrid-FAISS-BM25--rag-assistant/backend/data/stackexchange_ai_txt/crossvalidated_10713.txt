If you define 'well-roundedness' as 'contributing to many different Stack Exchange Sites,' I would compute some metric of contribution per site. You could use total posts, or average posts per day, or perhaps reputation. Then look at the distribution of this metric across all sites, and compute its skewness in some way that makes sense. In other words, a 'well-rounded' person would be one who contributes to many different sites, while a 'not well-rounded' person would be one who primarily contributes to one site. You could further improve this by scaling your metric with a user's total across all sites. i.e. someone who's contributed a lot to many different sites should be considered more well-rounded than someone who's contributed nothing to any of the sites. A person who's never used SE isn't very well rounded!
