Feature Selection: Having a large number of features select those features that classify the target class best

I have time series data and I'm using the cesium package to extract several features . Now the thing is, the number of extracted features is pretty significant. I have tried various visualizations to make sense of what features classify my labels the best but it is too cumbersome for so many features. Are there any algorithms or packages available that I can use for feature selection?
