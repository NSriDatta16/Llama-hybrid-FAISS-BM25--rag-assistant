Area Under Curve ROC penalizes somehow models with too many explanatory variables?

I'm using Area Under Curve ROC as a performance measure of my classification algorithms (logistic regressions). Since I'm going to choose the model that maximize the Area Under Curve ROC, I would like to know if AUC penalizes somehow models with too many regressors (for example, like BIC information criterion).
