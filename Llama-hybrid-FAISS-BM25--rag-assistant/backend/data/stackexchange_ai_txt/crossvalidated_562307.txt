How the SVM algorithm works with one label in range?

I have a dataset where the features are configurations (numeric values) that describe the situation and the label (only one) is the ranking of the situation (natural value between $[1,5]$ ). If label is $1$ then the configurations are bad and if the label is $5$ then the configurations are great. I'm trying to use the SVM algorithm. As I understand, the SVM algorithm is designed for binary classifiers and my problem requires a multi-class classifier. I'm trying to understand how the one-vs-one and one-vs-rest can help here. Is it possible to explain how the SVM algorithm works with those two approaches in the case of one label in range [1,5] ? Does my dataset considered as multiclass dataset? What If I have five labels (ranking $[1,5]$ ) and each one has a binary output ( $0$ or $1$ )? I'm a bit confused about it.
