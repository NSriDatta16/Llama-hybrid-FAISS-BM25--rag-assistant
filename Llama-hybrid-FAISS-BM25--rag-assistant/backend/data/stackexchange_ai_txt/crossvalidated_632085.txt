This is a direct consequence of the orthogonal decomposition theorem for Hilbert spaces which says that for any Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and any closed subspace $A$ we have $$\mathcal{H} = A \oplus A^\perp$$ where $A^\perp$ is the orthogonal complement of $A$ , ie $$A^\perp = \{h \in \mathcal{H}: \langle x, h\rangle = 0 \; \forall x \in A\}$$ By taking $A = \text{span}\{K(\cdot,x_i): i=1,\dots, N\}$ and noting that it is closed ( every finite-dimensional subspace of a normed space is closed ) the result follows. Both these results are very well known and can be found in most functional analysis textbooks.
