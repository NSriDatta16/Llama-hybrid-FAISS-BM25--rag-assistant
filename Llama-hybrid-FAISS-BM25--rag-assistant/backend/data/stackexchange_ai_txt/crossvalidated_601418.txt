Correct test to use for disease occurrence in different anatomical locations

Considering the following hypothetical dataset of lesion occurrence in kidney for ~200 patients with disease X: location of kidney left right location 1 112 101 location 2 54 39 location 3 37 33 location 4 112 95 location 5 24 18 ** patients can have the lesions in multiple locations within the kidney ** Location is where the surgeon found the lesion within the kidney (like renal cortex,renal medulla...). What test should I use to show that lesion occurrence has a right/left preference with disease X? At this stage, we don't consider the difference among the locations within the kidney. I was told to use the multinomial logistic regression analysis, but I can't figure out why and how to interpret the results.
