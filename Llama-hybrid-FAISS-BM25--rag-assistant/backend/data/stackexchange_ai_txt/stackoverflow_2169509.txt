Escaping loop whilst adding to dynamic array - C

Currently my program allows the user to enter 5 integers which are used to create an average number. This is set to five as after the fifth number is entered the loop is broken. I am trying to implement a method which will let the user continue to add as many numbers as they like to an array from which i can then use to create an average without a limit on the amount of numbers that can be entered. I have come across a few problems, firstly i cannot create an array which is dyamic as i have no idea how many numbers the user may wish to enter which means i can't give it a definitive size. Secondly the way my program currently creates the average is by looping through the elements in the array and adding the consecutively to an integer, from which the the average is made. I cannot specify the limit for the loop to continue running if i cannot determine the array. Hopefully my example explains this better. #include #include void main() { int i = 0; int arrayNum[5]; int temp = 1; int anotherTemp = 0; int answer = 0; printf("Enter as many numbers as you like, when finished enter a negative number\n"); for(i = 0; i Although this may not be the best way to implement it, it does work when the amount of numbers are specified beforehand. What would be the best way to get around this and allow the user to enter as many number as necessary? Edit: Although i needed to use an array I have decided that it is not necessary as the solution is much simpler without being restricted to it.
