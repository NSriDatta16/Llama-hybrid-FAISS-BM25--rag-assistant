As explained here (and in many other places), if you take the average of $n$ different variables each with a variance of $\sigma^2$ , and so a standard deviation of $\sigma$ , the average has a variance of $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ , or a standard deviation of $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ . However, this is about averaging together variables , not averaging individual data points (e.g. different specific shapes), so it's not clear it applies to your situation.
