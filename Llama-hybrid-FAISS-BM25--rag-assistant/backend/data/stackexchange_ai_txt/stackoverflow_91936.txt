I guess if such a feature exist it's browser-specific. from w3's website: User agents may support MAILTO URL extensions that are not yet Internet standards (e.g., appending subject information to a URL with the syntax "?Subject=my%20subject" where any space characters are replaced by "%20"). Some user agents also support "?Cc=email-address".
