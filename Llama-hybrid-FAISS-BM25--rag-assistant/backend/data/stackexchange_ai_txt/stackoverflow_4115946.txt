Library for querying installed (Debian) packages in C?

I need to check whether certain Debian packages are installed on a system in my C program. I could use external shell scripts which do grep magic of apt-cache output with system(), but it seems a bit inelegant and hackish, as well as the fact that it won't work if the user's installed language is different. Is there a C library I can hook into to query package installations?
