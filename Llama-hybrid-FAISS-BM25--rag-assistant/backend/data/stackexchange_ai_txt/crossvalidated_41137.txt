Depending on the kind of application, you don't necessarily need a lot of math as a ML practitioner. As a self-taught programmer (~15 years) and frequent college dropout without much background in math (Calculus III) or statistics, I started with machine learning / data mining with a few resources: The book "Mastering Data Mining: The Art and Science of Customer Relationship Management" by Berry and Linoff The book "Data Mining Techniques" by the same authors R, in particular and the packages party and nnet I work at a non-profit supporting marketing and operations. Especially in the beginning, I used data mining primarily for direct mail appeals. Later I took Linear Algebra, Andrew Ng's Machine Learning, Introduction to Statistical Methods (STAT 301) at CSU, etc. For you I recommend starting with the two books, Andrew Ng's course, and, depending on your application, decision trees (the party package in R).
