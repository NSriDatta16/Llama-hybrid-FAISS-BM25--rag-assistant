Flex 3 scroll bars not added/enabled when they should be

I'm currently learning Flex, and am having the hardest time getting scroll bars to work. In short, I'm making a giant form for users to fill out, contained within a viewstack component. The user will type up information in one view, and it will be displayed in the other. But right now in the first canvas I have components that run off the screen and flex doesn't automatically add a scroll bar, so I added 'verticalScrollPolicy="on"' to my canvas. Now, while it gives me a scroll bar, it gives me an empty scroll bar. I still cannot move it up or down, meaning components are still trapped off the bottom of my screen. Am I missing something simple? Edit - I'm using Adobe Flex Builder 3, and the components it lets you drag in. http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/218/problem1f.jpg This is a picture of the problem, and i guess relavent code would be.
