Problem with file drag-and-drop in Cocoa

I'm experiencing some difficulties here. I have a drop zone (custom view) with it's own class. Everything works great so far with it. The problem is that I can't get the result from the drop operation outside the class of the drop zone. I read everything I found in the net. For instance, I would like my drop zone to count the lenght of the Array with the objects (files) dropped and set this number to a NSTextField. I know how to count the array, I don't know how to get this value and set it to the text field.
