You can use robots.txt to block bots that take notice of it (but still let through other known instances such as google, etc) - but that won't stop those that ignore it. You may be able to get the user agent from your web server logs, or you could update your code to record it somewhere. If you then wanted you could block particular user agents from accessing your website, just be returning either a empty/default screen and/or a particular server code.
