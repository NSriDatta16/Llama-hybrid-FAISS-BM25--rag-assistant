It's possible to accomplish this without a grid search, as I believe easy.py does. Look at this paper from Trevor Hastie, et al: The Entire Regularization Path for the Support Vector Machine (PDF). One "SVM run" will calculate the loss for all values of "C" in one shot, so you can see how it effects your SVM performance. They have an implementation of this algorithm that you can use in R through the svmpath package. I believe the core of the algorithm is written in fortran, but is wrapped in R.
