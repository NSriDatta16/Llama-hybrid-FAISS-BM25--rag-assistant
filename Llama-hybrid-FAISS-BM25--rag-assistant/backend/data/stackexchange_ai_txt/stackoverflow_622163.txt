A good place to store application data outside of the registry is the application data folder. If you create this directory on first run then you would just need to test for it on subsequent loads. Also if your application requires it you then have a good storage location for data. string data = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData); string name = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name; string path = Path.Combine(data, name); if (Directory.Exists(path)) { // application has been run } else { // create the directory on first run DirectoryInfo di = Directory.CreateDirectory(path); }
