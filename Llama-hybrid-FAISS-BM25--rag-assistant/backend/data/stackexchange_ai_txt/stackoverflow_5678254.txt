SQL Azure is a large subset of SQL Server. From a programming perspectivem they are essentially equivalent (e.g. SP, tables, indexes, triggers, etc). There are a few things which are ot enabled today or are different (e.g. no CLR, no Sql Broker, size limitations). You can write an app that minimizes or eliminates the dependency to those unsupported features and your app wil be more "portable". Windows Azure Tables (and the other storage components) are Windows Azure specific. You will need to encapsulate components that use them and provide a compatible interface to other pieces of your app that depend on them. A classic example is the data access components. Or queue access for asynch communication. IoC/DI can help but they are not mandatory.
