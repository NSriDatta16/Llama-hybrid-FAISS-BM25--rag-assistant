Welcome to the site. How many months of data do you have? I am guessing you have quite a lot. If so, you probably want some sort of time-series analysis. The absence rate would be just the number absent divided by the total of the number active and absent. A good first step is to figure that for each month and then graph it over time. That graph could have "Month" on the x-axis and "absence rate" on the y-axis, and then a line. However, the time series aspects can get involved: There are likely seasonal effects, for example. You could explore those if you have data for a long enough period. Others here are more expert on time-series than I am, so I will stop here and add the "time-series" tag to attract them.
