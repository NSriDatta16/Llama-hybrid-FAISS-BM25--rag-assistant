What to do with my monolithic model?

My user model is about 2k lines of code. I'm sure this is the case for lots of apps. However, readability and even maintainability starts to degrade in models beyond 400 lines of code, in my opinion. So I started to take related code in the user model and organize it in modules in lib. For example, if I had code related to the user's friends, then I created a module called UserFriend and included it in the user model. Doing this helped solve the original problem. However, the downside is every time I modify code in the module in my dev environment, I gotta restart the server to load it. So: Is my original approach to handling the monolithic model correct? What can I do to avoid having to restart my server to load code changes in user modules?
