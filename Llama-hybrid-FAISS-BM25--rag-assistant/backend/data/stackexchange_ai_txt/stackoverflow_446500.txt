DataGridViewComboBoxColumn

I have two DataGridViewComboBoxColumn that I add at run time. I need the items of the first DataGridViewComboBoxColumn to stay the same in all the rows of the GridView but I want the items of the second DataGridViewComboBoxColumn to be different from row to another depending on the selected item of the first DataGridViewComboBoxColumn . If we say the first DataGridViewComboBoxColumn represents the locations and the second DataGridViewComboBoxColumn represents the sublocations. So, I want the second DataGridViewComboBoxColumn items to be the sublocations of the selected location from the first DataGridViewComboBoxColumn . Like this if Canada is selected Country(comboBoxItems) | State/Province(ComboBox Items) USA Quebec CANADA(selected) Ontario ENGLAND Manitoba Alberta Then if you select USA Country(comboBoxItems) | State/Province(ComboBox Items) USA (Selected) California CANADA New York ENGLAND Montana Ohio
