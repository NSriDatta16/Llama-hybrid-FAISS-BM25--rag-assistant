It sounds like you are looking for a way to organise the different tasks that each page needs to carry out. In this case, take a look at the MVC pattern . It provides a simple way to seperate your data access (models) and how you render/present information (views). You can map pages to functions with ease. If you store the information in an array of mapped values, and then use a function to compare the requested URL with each of the URLs in the array. Such an array could look like this: $urls = array( '/' => 'index', '/aboutus/' => 'aboutUs', ); There are several articles that discuss how to implement it in PHP in a couple of hours. This article is a very simple guide. I am not a fan of their use of the registry pattern but reading through should provide you with enough information as to how you can implement it yourself.
