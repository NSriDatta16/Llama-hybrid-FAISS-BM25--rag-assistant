Can a virtual machine be implemented as a neural network?

Disclaimer: I'm not a mathematical genius, nor do I have any experience with writing neural networks. So, please, forgive whatever idiotic things I happen to say here. ;) I've always read about neural networks being used for machine learning, but while experimenting with writing simple virtual machines, I began to wonder if they could be applied in another way. Specifically, can a virtual machine be created as a neural network? If so, how would it work (feel free to use an abstract description here, if you have to)? I've heard of the Joycean Machine, but I can't find any information other than very, very vague explanations. EDIT: What I'm looking for here is an explanation of exactly how a neural network-based VM would interpret assembly. How would inputs be handled, etc? Would each individual input be a memory address? Let's brainstorm!
