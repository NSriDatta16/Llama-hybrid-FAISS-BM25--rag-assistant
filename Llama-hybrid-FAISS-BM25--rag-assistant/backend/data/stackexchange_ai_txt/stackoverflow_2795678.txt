Fill array with binary numbers

First of all this is not homework! My question is from the book: Algorithms in C++ third edition by Robert Sedgewick. There is given an array of size n by 2^n (two dimensional) and we should fill it with binary numbers of bits size exactly n. For example for n=5 the result will be: 00001 00010 00011 00100 00101 00110 00111 And so on. We should put this sequence of bits into arrays.
