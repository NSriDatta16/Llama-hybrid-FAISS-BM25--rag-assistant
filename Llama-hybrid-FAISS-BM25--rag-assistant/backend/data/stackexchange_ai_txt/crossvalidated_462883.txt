I had said mental breakthrough when I read Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial by Sivia and Skilling. It is a fantastic book that first introduces us to the Bayesian philosophy, then the theorem and then, by way of example, shows many well-known statistical methods by deriving them from Bayes Theorem. The book is incredible to read. The authors brief without oversimplifying, also entertaining and highly informative. I heartily recommend it to anyone who wonders what (Bayesian) probability theory is all about.
