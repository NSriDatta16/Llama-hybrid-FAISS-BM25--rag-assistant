You can also do it by specifying the rpar arguments exactly as they appear when you run the regular mlogit() command. So for your example: rpar = list("A:scan.id"="n", "C:scan.id"="n", ...) where they named list must be quoted because of the " : " (I think, it may just be for " ( ", but it works with quotes either way). This is explained in footnote 20 p. 24 of Viton, PA. "Discrete-Choice Logit Models with R" ( pdf ): The specification of random parameters for the alternative-specific constants has changed from mlogit version 0.1-8. The old version had rpar=c(altair='n',altbus='n',alttrain='n') . If you get an error here, try estimating model without random parameters (like model res4 above), and note how the mode-specific dummys are reported; then use that syntax in the rpar argument. Also see the 1st paragraph of p.26 of the documentation ( pdf ) about having to list the entire name of individual specific coefficients. I had a similar problem when trying to just use scan.id but it stated working when I started putting the A:scan.id = argument instead. I believe you can do this with your data, as long as you set panel=F which I think is the only time the id.var=scan.id is invoked for multiple observation on the same person. If you do in fact have a panel, then don't use that variable and use the other variables you want to simulate as normal or another distribution. I'd also recommend using halton=NA argument if you have a large dataset as it speeds up the simulation significantly. * Philip A. Viton (2014) Discrete Choice Logit Models with R .
