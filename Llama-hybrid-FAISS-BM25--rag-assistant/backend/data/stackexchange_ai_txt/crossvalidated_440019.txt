PLS regression (Partial Least Squares or Projection to Latent structures - both mean the same thing and underlying process), as suggested by user257566 is a very useful way to go for this type of query. Unlike PCA it uses external information to guide the act of data reduction, meaning that underlying data processes related to that external information are boosted compared to those that are not related (as compared to PCA). For determining each latent variable PLS works by alternating between least squares optimisation of the X matrix and the Y matrix over several iterations, leading to components that attempt to simultaneously described the X and Y matrices as efficicently as they can. PLS theory You mention in the comments to one question 'I've been looking into pls, but there are many different models (plsr, pcr, ...) and it's hard for me to see which one is the one'. PCR is nothing to do with PLS - PCR is principle components regression, where the data reduction is a plain PCA without reference to the Y data. For PLS, originally a distinction between Y vectors and matrices was made (PLS-1 and PLS-2) but the distinction was arbitrary and is now largely ignored. As with PCA many tweaks have been proposed over the years to create new versions of PLS, whether those are relevant depends on the assumptions associated with them and whether they apply to your data. Variable selection can be worked into the same data workflow if it would be useful to trim out less useful variables. Within PLS itself it is possible to use jack-knifing/ uncertainty testing (essentially throwing out variables that are poor predictors). Its possible to use a crude correlation or significance test between each variable and the response (if you are at an exploratory phase of analysis it would be better to use a lenient threshold so you don't throw out variables that are insignificant on their won but which combine with the other well to help the model) Some regression methods explicitly use variable restriction as an alterantive way to avoid instability due to multiple collinearity. Ridge regression, LASSO and elastic net are popular. There is lots of info on these on CV and the assumptions underlying them that should help to determine if they are relevant.
