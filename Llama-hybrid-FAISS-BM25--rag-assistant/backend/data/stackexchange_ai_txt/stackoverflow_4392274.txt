Is it possible to use multiple tooltips with this jQuery plugin?

I was looking at the plugin that shows tooltips: http://www.pierrebertet.net/projects/jquery_simpletooltip/ However, I am still not clear whether is it possible to have multiple times different tool tips on the page. For example, I have the following: $("#tip").simpletooltip({ click: true }); and then some text hidden layer something here I've tried adding additional links and tooltips and it does not seem to be working. Is it a bug? some text 2 some text 3 something here something here
