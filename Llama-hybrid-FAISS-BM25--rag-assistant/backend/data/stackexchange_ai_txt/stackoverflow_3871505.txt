C# Allow user to enter conditional rules

I write code in isolation, that is I work for myself. I need some advice on how you might implement the following functionality or if there are some tools that already exist to help make this task easier to accomplish. I have a scenario (C# application) in which I would like the user to be able to enter conditional rules which will then be used elsewhere in the program for various calculations. As a simple example let's say we have a TimeRequiredForJob property and we need to calculate this in the program based upon the users rules. A simple rule might be TimeRequiredForJob = 200 Balloons multiplied by 5 min each, or TimeRequiredForJob = 20% of HoursInAfternoon I am guessing its pretty hard to see what I am looking for so maybe the following image will help: This is from DevExpress XtraGrid and it allows a user to filter data displayed in the grid based upon the users custom filter rules. I would like to implement something similar but be able to save the rules to a database and use those rules later in the application. Any suggestions or tips welcome. [Late Edit] Actually I am getting some good information from this question but any additional information will be appreciated.
