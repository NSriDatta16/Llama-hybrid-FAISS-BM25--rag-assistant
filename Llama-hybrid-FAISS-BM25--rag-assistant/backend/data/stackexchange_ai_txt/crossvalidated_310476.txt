Data Preprocessing before using PCA for unsupervised learning (clustering)

I'm wondering whether to use OneHotEncoding before using PCA. I did some googling and it seems the answer is no, because PCA doesn't work well on binary data (This is the source ) I just want to make sure my current understanding, that : Numerical features should be standardized (by StandardScaler ) before applying PCA Categorical and ordinal features should be encoded to Integers (by LabelEncoder ) Related to the 2nd point : Categorical features shouldn't use OneHotEncoding (by get_dummies ) Please kindly enlighten me Thanks for the help
