TSQL Group-By Over Two Columns

Hi Thanks in advance for helping. I have the following table: create table temp_vol (symbol nchar(10), dseqkey int, volume float) here are some values in the table: symbol dseqkey volume (no commas in the actual values) C 20672 422,764,512 F 20672 47,144,600 F 20671 51,695,000 C 20671 371,950,496 F 20670 48,680,600 C 20670 654,208,512 C 20669 626,121,600 F 20669 93,489,504 C 20668 712,674,304 The output I am seeking is a 2-day simple moving average ((volume dseqkey + volume dseqkey-1) / 2) for each symbol, for each dseqkey. I can get the moving average working for all symbols across one dseqkey. I can get the moving average working for all dseqkeys across 1 symbol. I cannot seem to get both working together.
