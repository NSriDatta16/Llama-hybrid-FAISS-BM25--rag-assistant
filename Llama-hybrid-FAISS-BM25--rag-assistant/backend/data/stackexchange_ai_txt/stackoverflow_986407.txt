Each window needs to be a separate "subscriber", and the server needs to send the message to each subscriber. So instead of one "read" flag you need a "read" flag for each subscriber. Unfortunately this means making a subscriber manager with a queue for each subscriber and a way of knowing when a subscriber disappears -- perhaps when the subscriber stops polling for one minute. Look up the "Observer" pattern (also known as "Publish-Subscribe") in the Gang of Four book ("Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides", ISBN 0-201-633610-2) or online.
