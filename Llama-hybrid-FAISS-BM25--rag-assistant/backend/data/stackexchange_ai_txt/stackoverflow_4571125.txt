There is nothing is the spec about how exactly browsers have to display the value in title attributes. Is simply says: Values of the title attribute may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways. For instance, visual browsers frequently display the title as a "tool tip" (Emphasis mine) So, not only is there nothing about line breaks, but the actual behavior of "tool tip" is not mandatory.
