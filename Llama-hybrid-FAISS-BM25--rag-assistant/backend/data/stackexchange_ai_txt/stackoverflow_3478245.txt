Any design patterns/coding methods for complex logic?

I had to clean up code for an online college application. There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but it was complicated. Different degree programs had different prequisites, fees, required documentation, and questions. On top of that, students coming from the military get different fees, and previous students pay no fees and skip steps. Obviously all this logic can get pretty complex - and cause bugs. I'm wondering if there's a design pattern or coding method that would help with organizing the logic. I'm using PHP, not that it matters. The strategy pattern seems to have the most potential, but it seems to me I'd need strategies on top of strategies for this. I imagine the field of "Business Logic" might cover this at least partially, but searches haven't turned up indications of any elegant coding methods to use.
