Thanks. I have looked at many ORMs and I don't like them for one reason or another, so I decided to call plain stored procedures to get data. Can you advice something powerful yet simple? You're right about to use field names, it is safer, even if a little bit slower. I had just arrived to the same conclusion with the method, but what I still don't like is the type conversion: Public Shared Function IfNull(Of T)(ByVal dr As MySqlDataReader, ByVal index As Integer, ByVal _default As T) As T If dr.IsDBNull(index) Then Return _default Else Return CType(dr.GetValue(index), T) End If End Function I would like to do something more elegant to get the "real" data type from the reader.
