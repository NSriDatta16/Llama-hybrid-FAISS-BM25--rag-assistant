I was having the same problem. See this thread . I didn't get a solution but a hint from Fabio. Use Set instead of bag. And it worked. So my suggestion is try to use set. You don't have to use Iesi collection use IDictonary and NH is happy public override IEnumerable GetAll() { var baselines = Session.CreateQuery(@" from Baseline b left join fetch b.BaselineMilestones bm left join fetch bm.BaselineMilestonePrevious ") .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.DistinctRootEntity) .List (); return baselines; }
