Conditions for cyclic behaviour of ARIMA model

I'm trying to model and forecast a time series that is cyclic rather than seasonal (i.e. there are seasonal-like patterns, but not with a fixed period). This should be possible to do using an ARIMA model, as mentioned in Section 8.5 of Forecasting: principles and practice : The value of $p$ is important if the data show cycles. To obtain cyclic forecasts, it is necessary to have $p\geq 2$ along with some additional conditions on the parameters. For an AR(2) model, cyclic behaviour occurs if $\phi^2_1+4\phi_2 What are these additional conditions on the parameters in the general ARIMA(p,d,q) case? I haven't been able to find them anywhere.
