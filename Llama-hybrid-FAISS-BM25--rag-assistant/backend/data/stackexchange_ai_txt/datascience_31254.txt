I am reading Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, its a great book (1/2 way thru). However it uses Scikit as per the title and some of the mechanics inside Sckit are a black box (not explained in depth). The general concepts however are still quite well written. The 2nd half of the book is about TensorFlow so again, perhaps not what you want if you're focused on PyTorch ?
