There's nothing magical in the view-based template. The most likely reasons for failure to respond to touches are: You've messed with touchesBegan:withEvent: , userInteractionEnabled , exclusiveTouch or something else, thinking you need to mess with these (generally you don't; the defaults are generally correct) You created a second UIWindow You put something over the view (even if it's transparent) Simplify your code down to just creating a view programatically that responds to a touch and nothing else. It should be just a few lines of code. If you can't get that working, post the code and we'll look at what's going on.
