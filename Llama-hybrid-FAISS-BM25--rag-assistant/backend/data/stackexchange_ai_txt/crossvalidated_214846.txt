Rouder (2014) has a nice paper on this (written for psychologists), explaining why sequential testing (so-called data peeking ) is fine from a Bayesian perspective. (Paper is freely available online if you do a search for it.) Schoenbrodt et al. (in press) present nice analyses showing how to use sequential analysis with Bayes factors to determine when to stop data collection. From a Bayesian parameter estimation procedure, John Kruschke has a very nice blog post that compares different Bayesian methods during sequential testing. Hope you find them of help.
