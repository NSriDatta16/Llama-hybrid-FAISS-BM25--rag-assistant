usdm package: RDocumentation . vif() is a function to test for multicollinearity. vifcor() and vifstep() are two functions which work to minimize overall collinearity through stepwise exclusion. They are not particularly efficient, so be patient while they run, but it should be what you are looking for. You may also want to consider the phenomenon of autocorrelation in your analysis. Since you are looking at time series data (most likely) you will want to not only search for multicollinearity (covariate interaction) but also autocorrelation (self-correlation through time).
