When it was posted, I missed this question, but it relates strongly to the current literature on scalable Monte Carlo algorithms. And in particular to the Bayesian processing of tall datasets, aiming at simulating posteriors that are the product of many functions that can each be turned into densities. Among many links of interest wrt this question, let me sample A NIPS 2015 workshop on that theme Some blog posts of mine on that topic A workshop I organised at BIRS, Banff, on that topic A video of David Dunson, Duke U, on that problem A paper by Minsker on the median posterior A paper on the Weiestrass sampler by Wang and Dunson The ParallelMCMCcombine R package A paper on the consensus MCMC by Steve Scott and co-authors While this is a link-only answer, it should give you a comfortable entry into the very active research in this area at the moment.
