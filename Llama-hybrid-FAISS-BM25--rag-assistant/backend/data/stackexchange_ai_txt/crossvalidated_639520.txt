Multiple regression model and correlation between predictors

I am reading the Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python ( ISLP ) book. I am reading the below paragraph: Now suppose that the multiple regression is correct and newspaper advertising is not associated with sales, but radio advertising is associated with sales. Then in markets where we spend more on radio our sales will tend to be higher, and as our correlation matrix shows, we also tend to spend more on newspaper advertising in those same markets. Hence, in a simple linear regression which only examines sales versus newspaper, we will observe that higher values of newspaper tend to be associated with higher values of sales, even though newspaper advertising is not directly associated with sales. My question here is this: how does a multiple regression model know that the coefficient for news paper ads is $0$ and not the coefficient for radio? The correlation between radio and news ad can be in any direction.
