Can you `break` from multiple loops like PHP can by passing a number?

If you are in a 3rd nested loop in PHP, you can do break 3; and break all loops up 3 levels. break seems to work in C. But if I do break 3 I get a syntax error. I guess it doesn't support it. What is the best way to break multiple loops? Should I set a flag which is checked up the loops - and breaks if it is set? Is there anything more elegant?
