Practically speaking, if you want to make a dynamic array you should use std::vector, as in: #include #include #include int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { int size; std::cin>>size; std::vector array(size); // do stuff with array ... return 0; } If you are just curious about the syntax, then what you are looking for is: //... int* array = new int[size]; // Do stuff with array ... delete [] array; //... Neither of these are allocated with local storage. A dynamically sized array that is automatically allocated using local storage is not currently supported in standard C++, but is supported in the current C standard.
