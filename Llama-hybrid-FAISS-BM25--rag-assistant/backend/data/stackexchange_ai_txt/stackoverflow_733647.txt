Can I still use the App Store with a development iPod Touch?

I can't seem to find any help when I search via Google, so I guess it's time to ask the experts directly! I've got an iPod Touch which I'm using as a development device for an application that I'm producing. The first thing I did with my iPod Touch was connect it up and install my app. But when I try and install downloaded apps from the App Store, iTunes won't let me drag them onto the device. The first time I tried a popup did appear but I accidentally closed it before I read it, and I can't get it to reappear, as I'm sure it had some useful info. Does anyone know the deal? Are development devices exclusive to your own signed apps? Many thanks, Andy
