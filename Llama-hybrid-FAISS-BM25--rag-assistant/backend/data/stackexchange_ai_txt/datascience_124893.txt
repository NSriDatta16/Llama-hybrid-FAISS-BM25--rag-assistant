I haven't found any research about cheese hole counting, but this problem resembles counting people in a crowd or blood cells to me. There is a plethora of scientific papers about that and a few approaches you can use.: You can use the YOLO approach to identify holes first, and then count them. A well-cited example for blood cell counting: Alam, M. M., & Islam, M. T. (2019). Machine learning approach of automatic identification and counting of blood cells. Healthcare technology letters, 6(4), 103-108. Regression - you can attempt to use CNN to predict an exact number of holes. A friend of mine used it for counting people in the crowd, but let's grab a piece of literature you can read about it: Patwal, A., Diwakar, M., Tripathi, V., & Singh, P. (2023). Crowd counting analysis using deep learning: A critical review. Procedia Computer Science, 218, 2448-2458. Density estimation - something interesting I hadn't known and stumbled across in the second article - you can try to predict a map of the density of holes upon the image. I hope you find there a method suitable for your project :)
