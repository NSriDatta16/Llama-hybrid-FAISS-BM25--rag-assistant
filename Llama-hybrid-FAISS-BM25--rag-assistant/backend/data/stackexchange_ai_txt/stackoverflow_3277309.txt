IronRuby download file using the WebClient "Not enough storage is available to process this command"

Entering the following two lines into an interactive window in IronRuby interactive console. wc = System::Net::WebClient.new doc = wc.DownloadString("http://yahoo.com") I get the following error. => mscorlib:0:in `WinIOError': Not enough storage is available to process this command.\r\n (IOError) from mscorlib:0:in `Write' from (ir):1 Edit: looks like it's related to strings in general. The following produces the same error x = "String" * 40000 Edit: looks like my problems are related to interactive console. http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=23485&group_id=4359&atid=16798 if I use this wc = System::Net::WebClient.new doc = wc.DownloadString("http://yahoo.com"); nil it works...
