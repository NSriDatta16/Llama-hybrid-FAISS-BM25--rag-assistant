Explanation of spectral residual algorithm for outlier detection

I've been reading the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03821.pdf for spectral residual outlier detection, but I don't quite understand it. Specifically, in the implementation there are three variables that determine how to algorithm will find outliers: # less than period amp_window_size # (maybe) as same as period series_window_size # a number enough larger than period score_window_size Also, the only documentation that I could find on the algorithm was this . Can anybody familiar with the paper, or with time series, explain how the algorithm works, and how these 3 variables determine how outliers are detected?
