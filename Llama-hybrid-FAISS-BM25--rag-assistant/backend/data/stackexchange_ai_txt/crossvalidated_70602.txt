Neural networks: $tanh$ activativation function in output layer

In multi-class classification problem, if the output neurons are activated by $tanh$ function, how do we determine the class assignment for the pattern? In case of sigmoid all output neurons would have value in $[0,1]$ and, using 1-of-C encoding of the response variable, the error is well-defined and the class determined by the neuron with maximum value. In case of using hyperbolic tangent, the neurons values would be in $[-1,1]$ and if we use 1-of-C encoding, the errors would be huge and it's not clear how do we classify the pattern based on the network's output? Maybe, we should encode the response with $\{-1,+1\}$ with $+1$ for the correct class and $-1$ for the rest?
