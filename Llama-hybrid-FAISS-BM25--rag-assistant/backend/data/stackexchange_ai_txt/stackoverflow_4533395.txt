You can use the famous Bag of Words techniques tan help group texts by using a sparse matrix representing in each row the text (generally the text is stemmed with the porter stemmer for better results) After computing the bag of words, where you need to count the number of times each word appears in each piece of text and then calculating the totals of the matrix by rows and columns you calculate the tf-idf for each cell, in order to pay attention to the angular distance on the texts that is the one that best works. After doing all of this you can perform a clustering algorithm that groups the related pieces of texts, you can even extract from here the main keywords of the text. there is a program that does all this automatically that is called cluto , I strongly recommend it.
