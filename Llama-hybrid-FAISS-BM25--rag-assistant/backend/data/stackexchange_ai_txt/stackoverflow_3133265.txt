SSAS 2005, Excel 2007, Ragged Hierarchy

I am trying to update a SSAS 2005 cube adding a ragged hierarchy (it has a few levels that contain members that should be hidden if the member name is the same as the parent). From various sources I have read that I need to use MDX Comparability=2 within the connection string to see the HideMemberIf property. I have read so many opinions on this bug / problem that I have confused myself. Does anyone have a solution for ragged hierarchies that has worked in a production environment with excel 2007?
