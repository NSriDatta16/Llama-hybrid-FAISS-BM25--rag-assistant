Customizing orchard theme parts

I am trying to write a custom theme for orchard and am not having much success so far. I have read Bertrand Le Roy's article on part alternates but I can't seem to get it to work. I am displaying a list of recent blog posts on the front page, pretty standard. I wish to change the markup produced by the meta data part i.e the time format. I have written a IShapeTableProvider to create blog specific alternates for the metadata summary part. public class MetaDataShapeProvider : IShapeTableProvider { private readonly IWorkContextAccessor workContextAccessor; public MetaDataShapeProvider(IWorkContextAccessor workContextAccessor) { this.workContextAccessor = workContextAccessor; } public void Discover(ShapeTableBuilder builder) { builder .Describe("Parts_Common_Metadata_Summary") .OnDisplaying(displaying => { ContentItem contentItem = displaying.Shape.ContentItem; if (contentItem != null) displaying.ShapeMetadata.Alternates.Add("Metadata__" + contentItem.ContentType); }); } } This is being caught correctly but the contentItem is null. Should I just create an alternate with a fixed name like "Metadata-BlogPost" and use that, to make this general purpose it should really be a dynamic name so I can use another alternate template elsewhere. Thanks, Ian
