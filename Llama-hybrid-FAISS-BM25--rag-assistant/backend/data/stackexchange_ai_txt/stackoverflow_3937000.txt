Chrome extension: accessing localStorage in content script

I have an options page where the user can define certain options and it saves it in localStorage: options.html Now, I also have a content script that needs to get the options that were defined in the options.html page, but when I try to access localStorage from the content script, it doesn't return the value from the options page. How do I make my content script get values from localStorage, from the options page or even the background page?
