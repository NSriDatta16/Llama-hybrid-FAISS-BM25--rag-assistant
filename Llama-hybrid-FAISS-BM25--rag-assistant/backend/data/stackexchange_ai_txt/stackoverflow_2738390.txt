ASP.Net MVC elegant UI and ModelBinder authorization

We know that authorization's stuff is a cross cutting concern, and we do anything we could to avoid merge business logic in our views. But I still not find an elegant way to filter UI components (e.g. widgets, form elements, tables, etc) using the current user roles without contaminate the view with business logic. same applies for model binding. Example Form: Product Creation Fields: Name Price Discount Roles: Role Administrator Is allowed to see and modify the Name field Is allowed to see and modify the Price field Is allowed to see and modify the Discount Role Administrator assistant Is allowed to see and modify the Name Is allowed to see and modify the Price Fields shown in each role are different, also model binding needs to ignore the discount field for 'Administrator assistant' role. How would you do it?
