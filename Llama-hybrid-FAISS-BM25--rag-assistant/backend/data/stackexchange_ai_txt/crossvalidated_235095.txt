Q: How can there be several ways to compute a CI? A: Because there are several different ways to estimate the value of a parameter and your choice of estimation technique has limitations that will reflect the size of the corresponding CI. The choice of modeling determines what you can say about the estimated parameters. If you check out the Wikipedia article on confidence intervals you'll see that the way you calculate a confidence interval from likelihood modeling is different from how you calculate CIs when you're using a general linear model. Likelihood methods usually employ two different ways of calculating a CI; one method looks like you're used to from general linear modeling with the estimated value and a $\pm$ some percentage of a distribution above and below the estimated value. In order to do that the likelihood function needs to be regular. In case the likelihood function is not regular you'll have to use likelihood ratios and relate the cutoff value to a $\chi^2$ distribution. (roughly speaking, I'm trying to illustrate the different limitations of the technique). In other words: the way you analyze your data, determines what you can say about your estimates. Your ability to say something about your estimates, depend on how you actually estimate your parameters. Notice that the data itself does not determine the size of your CI, but the proper model for that data type has particular properties that determine what the CI will look like. Some methods have analytical expressions for how to calculate CIs, many methods do not. What that in mind, consider why bootstrapping is so nice. So to refer to the last paragraph in your question: Are there other ways to calculate the 95% confidence interval besides $[x−1.96σ,x+1.96σ]$ in that scenario as well? Yes. By using other models on the same data set. To give a visual explanation (and to link to an interesting video) Check out the youtube channel Veritasium and the video: Is Most Published Research Wrong? . I've linked to 8:12 into the video. Just pause it and take a look at the graph. 29 ways to analyze the same data set comes up with vastly different confidence intervals. All this to say: A confidence interval says something about your model as well as saying something about your parameters estimates.
