It looks like a Bayesian problem. The probabilities of each event are not independent of one another, so logistic regression is unlikely to work since its underlying assumption is violated. You can build a Bayesian network where each event A, B, C, D and y are nodes and use Expectation Maximization algorithm to estimate the probabilities of each event given the other ones. Have a look to this blog post for a nice introduction of Bayesian Belief Network
