You can iterate through ALL of the images you have & perform regex on them, like this: $('.slide img', data).each(function(index){ src = $(this).attr('src'); stringarray = src.split('/'); last_piece = stringarray[stringarray.length-1] regexpatt = /thread_/ if ( regexpatt.test(last_piece) ) { alert('we have a winner!'); } else { alert('that was disappointing'); } }); I am sure there is probably a more elegant way - you should probably search through the jquery docs for it, but this works... :)
