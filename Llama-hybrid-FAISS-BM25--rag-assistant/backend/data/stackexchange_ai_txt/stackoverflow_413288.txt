How long did it take OOP to get understood by the average corporate programmer...? I was taught functional programming at Utrecht University in - I think - 1994 and only see it start to catch on "in the real world" in the last couple of years. There is no such thing as a "simple application". ;-) I think that (approaching) side effect-free programming for some key parts of software will be essential when we start to get more and more cores in our hardware. Give functional programming a bit more time. And the functional sprinkling in current and future versions of C# will go a long way in preparing those corporate programmers for functional programming without them even realising it...
