Ok Roger - I found this because I was facing the same EXACT issue. Here is how I solved it for the time being. I do hope the plugin gets fixed in the future. My sense is that you don't need the issue resolved at this point, but it may help out other folks. Obviously, it relies on structure of the DOM elements, hence not a very elegant solution. //RYAN OBEROI: A big hack, since the cancel callback does not have the appropriate information name = $(this).parent().next().attr('name') // click callback, as requested here: http://plugins.jquery.com/node/1655 if(control.callback) control.callback.apply(input[0], [input.val(), $('a', control.current)[0], name]);// callback event
