I would really urge you not to do this. As you said, whatever you do will be broken, and you may actually cause more copies of your software to be pirated by including this barrier. Asking your users nicely not to steal may do better... That said, implementing this in a way that discourages the most casual piracy is easy: just have the program send a serial number encrypted with the server's public key to your validation script, and have the server return a version of the number encrypted using its private key. Instant validation. Yes, this server could be written in Python easily.
