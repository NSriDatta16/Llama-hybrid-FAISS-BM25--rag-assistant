Building a content-based recommendation system using products' metadata as features?

I am currently working on an apparel recommendation system, where I have tabulated data containing a list of products with their respective metadata (brand, category, color etc.) I have an additional column of client id s to denote which client has bought which product. I want this content-based recommendation system to recommend a client a bunch of products, based on the metadata of the products they have purchased in the past. I am trying to find a way to learn user profile based on the past purchases. Could any machine learning algorithm be used for this purpose? A lot of content-based approaches that I have seen so far take cosine similarities of tfidf representation of the textual description of the product to calculate scores. But, I believe the metadata are too rich to concatenate and then take cosine similarities. I tried training a classifier for each client (there are 129 clients), but that doesn't seem like a deployment-friendly approach. Are there any suggestion how I can achieve this? Many thanks in advance!
