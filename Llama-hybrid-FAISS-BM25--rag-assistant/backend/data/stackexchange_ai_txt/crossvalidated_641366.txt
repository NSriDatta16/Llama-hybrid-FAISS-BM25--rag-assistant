I happened to come across this interesting question, and wanted to provide my 2 cents, expanding on the answer already given. I will assume that the provided data meet the requirement for the chi2 test. What I would like to point out is that Cramer's V, as well as other coefficients such as Phi, C, and even Goodman-Kruskal's lambda, is sensitive to both the magnitude of the association AND to the marginal distribution. In the dataset provided by the user, the marginals are pretty unbalanced (skewed). It is not by chance, in fact, that V proves pretty small (0.006383) while the OR is indeed not "tiny" (4.44). The imbalance in the marginal sums, which does not affect the OR, would indeed account for the small value of V. Some scholarly sources suggest to control for the imbalance by computing the coefficient on the standardised table. As matter of fact, V (computed on the standardised version of the user's table) turns out to be 0.356. For a 2x2 table, it could be interpreted as an association of medium strength (according to the Cohen's thresholds), and is more "in line" with the magnitude of the association as measured by the OR. What do I mean by "standardised table"? A standardised table is a table where we re-express the counts so to achieve predetermined sets of marginal sums. This is done via Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF). For instance, the row and column marginals can be equal to fractions out of 100. Or, one can retain the table's grand total and set the row (and column) marginals to the grand total divided by the number of rows (and columns). Using this last approach, the standardised version of the table provided by the user would be: Note that we are "re-expressing" the counts, keeping the association structure is unaltered (OR 4.44). The marginals are not unbalanced. Essentially, the way I see the issue is: given the observed V, is it what it is (e.g., "small", like in the example provided by the user) because the association is indeed "tiny" or also because the imbalance in the marginal distribution is "getting in the way"? For one thing, the discrepancy between V and the OR should ring as a warning bell. One might wonder whether in such contexts (i.e., in a table with such a marginal imbalance) measures that are sensitive to imbalances in the marginal sums should not be used, and more "resistant" measures should be preferred instead. Or, on the other hand, we could still stick to V "but" controlling for the marginal skewed distribution. The issue becomes even more cogent when comparing Vs across tables, for example. There is a nice section on the effect of marginal distribution on nominal association coefficients, and on table's standardisation, in the following book: Reynolds, H. T. (1977). The Analysis of Cross-Classifications . The Free Press. ISBN 0029263905. Also, the seminal Agresti's book on Categorical Data Analysis features a paragraph on tables standardisation via IPF.
