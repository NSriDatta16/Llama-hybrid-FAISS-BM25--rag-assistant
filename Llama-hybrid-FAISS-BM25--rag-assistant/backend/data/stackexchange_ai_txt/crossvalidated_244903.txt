Limiting Distribution of Average of iid Gamma Variables

It can be shown that if $X \sim Gamma(\alpha, \theta)$, then $\overline{X_{n}} \sim Gamma(\alpha n, \theta/n)$. where $X_{1}, X_{2} \dots X_{n}$ are all iid and follow the distribution of $X$. The proof of this argues that the MGF of $X$ is $M_{X}(t) = \frac{1}{(1-\theta t)^{\alpha}}$ and the MGF of an average is just $M_{X}(\frac{t}{n})^{n}$. I was playing around and wondered that if we took the limit of $M_{\overline{X_{n}}}(t)$, then we would have $$lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{\theta t}{n})^{\alpha n}}$$ which can be show to $ = e^{\theta \alpha t}$. By a theorem in probability theory: $M_{X_{n}}(t) \rightarrow M_{X}(t) \implies X_{n} \rightarrow X$ in distribution. Thus, $\overline{X_{n}}$ converges to the constant random variable, $Q = \alpha \theta$. What does this mean? That, in the limit, the average of $n$ trials of a gamma distribution will have at least $\alpha n \approx \infty$ occurences with waiting time $\theta/n \approx 0$?
