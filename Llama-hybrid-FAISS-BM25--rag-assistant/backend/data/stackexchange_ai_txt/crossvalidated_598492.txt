I know this is a very old post, but I came across the very same question reading the book now. Unfortunately, it seems that many of those posting replies above did not have the book available for reference. I believe this example is effectively the one mistake in an otherwise perfect book. MSIS above states "Regression to the mean happens only when difference is fully explained by random factors". I think it would be more accurate to say that regression to the mean will always happen when random factors are present, yet only a difference that is excluively the result of random factors can be used to predict the direction, and possibly even the magnitude, of a regression to the mean. Insofar as in the example in the book the differences are the result of "location, competition and random factors", and we have no way to discern between them, the observed differences between the stores seem to me to have no predictive value. Contrary to what the book holds, we can only ignore them. In other words, time series information does not matter only if the deviation from the mean is purely random. Please correct me if I'm wrong. (The store with the highest sales, possibly located at the town's central station, may have had the worst result in x years, while the one with the lowest, possibly located right next to the town's dumpster, had its best performance ever; there is no way to know)
