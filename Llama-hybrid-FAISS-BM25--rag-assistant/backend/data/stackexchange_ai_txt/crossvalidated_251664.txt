If you don't have a closed form solution (try computing overlap of polygons and time - this should be fairly easy to do) you can always do sampling . But sampling from polygons is probably harder than the analytical approach... The idea of sampling is as follows: you draw a random sample satisfying the conditions of A and then check if it also satisfies the conditions of B. Repeat this a million times and you get a naive estimate of similarity. You can do the same with distances: draw a sample from each, compute their distances, repeat until you get an average of the desired precision.
