If you are not interested in making any cross-site comparison of magnitude of trends or in computing an overall trend across all sites, then you don't really need to have a common time record across sites. However, if you have many sites, you may still want to group sites according to whether they have (approximately) common support for reporting purposes. Then you can present trends together for all sites where the time record spans a common period like, say, 2001-2005 (5 years worth of data), 2001-2010 (10 years worth of data), etc. This would make it easier for people to digest your results than if you report trends for ungrouped sites. In particular, if you choose a time span like 2001-2010 for your 10-year time series, you can group together trends which cover incomplete time records such as 2003-2009, 2002-2008, etc., by allowing a small fraction of data missingness in the incomplete time series relative to the complete record 2001-2010.
