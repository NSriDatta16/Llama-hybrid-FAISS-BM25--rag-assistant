There are so many it's crazy. Crazy good, I guess. For the conservative types (me), NUnit is still available and still more than capable. For the Microsoft-types, MSTest is adequate, but it is slow and clunky compared to NUnit. It also lacks code coverage without paying the big bucks for the pricey versions of Visual Studio. There's also MbUnit . It's like NUnit, but it has nifty features like RowTest (run the same test with different parameters) and Rollback (put the database back like you found it after a test). And finally, xUnit.net is the trendy option with some attitude. Oh, and TestDriven.NET will give you IDE integration for both NUnit and MbUnit. I'm sure they're all just fine. I'd steer away from MSTest though, unless you just enjoy the convenience of having everything in one IDE out of the box. Scott Hanselman has a podcast on this very topic.
