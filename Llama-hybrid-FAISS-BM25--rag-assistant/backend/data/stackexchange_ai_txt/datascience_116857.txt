Multivariate outlier detection could be done thanks to several algorithms: Isolation Forest (as mentioned in the link you've shared), DBSCAN , Z-Score , and PCA . The most universal one is PCA, as you can detect and understand correlations between features. Nevertheless, UMAP being non-linear could detect outliers in a more accurate way. I recommend starting with PCA to understand features' dependencies and then using UMAP for better results.
