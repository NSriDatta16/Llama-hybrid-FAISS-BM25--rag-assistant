Children are rendering below container and reposition when clicked

I've implemented the layout and drag/drop functionality from the Adobe Flex Dashboard example application in my application: http://examples.adobe.com/flex3/devnet/dashboard/main.html But in my app the pods initially render below the container to which they are added. When you click them they move to where they should be in the container. Does anyone have any idea why the children initially render perfectly, but outside the container that actually contains them. Thanks in advance!
