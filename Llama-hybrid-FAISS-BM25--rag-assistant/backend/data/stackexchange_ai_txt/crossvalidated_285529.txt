T-test for model selection

How to use t-test for comparing two different models (or same model with different feature input)? EXPLANATION: I have a Logistic Regression model with huge amount of parameters. I want to compare it with LR, but on smaller set of parameters USING t-tests. I am not looking for another solutions, cause I want to understand is it possible and to find background of this statistical approach.
