Recall how SVM works, it applies the kernel to each pair of the inputs , and this scales badly . SVM has time complexity of $O(dn^2)$ or $O(dn^3)$ for libsvm used by e1071. Random forest uses independent decision trees. Fitting each tree is computationally cheap (that's one of the reasons we ensemble trees), it would be slower with larger number of trees, but they can be fitted in parallel. The time complexity is $O(n\log(n)dk)$ . SVM would scale worse than random forest and is generally not recommended for larger datasets.
