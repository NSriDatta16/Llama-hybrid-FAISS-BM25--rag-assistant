Is it possible somehow "rescue" segmentation fault on Ruby

I have a Ruby script, which uses one external lib. Sometimes script exits with segmentation fault, when uses this lib and I must to rerun it. Is it possible to somehow rescue this error by extracting fragment, which has dangerous code to separate process or something like that? Thanks
