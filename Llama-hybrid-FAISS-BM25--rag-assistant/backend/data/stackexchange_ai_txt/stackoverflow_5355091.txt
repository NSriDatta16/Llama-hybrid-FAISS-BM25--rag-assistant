Simplest solution: Set the element to visibility:hidden . Clone the element, set the clone to position:absolute , perform dragging. Once dragging stops (i.e. the user has released the left mouse button), replace the clone with the original element. This allows you to keep the element in flow for the duration of the draggable operation. That way if the element cannot be dropped in location y (for example), you can have the helper snap back to the original location.
