What do you mean by compact/shrink? Make an existing database smaller? Or do you want to compress the database? One of roles for this is defragmentation . This frees up unused space in the database. When you delete objects, the database doesn't shrink. Instead the space is marked as free for new objects. However overtime with a the manipulation of the database the file get fragmented. So defragmentation brings back unused space in the database. When you store a lot of strings, you should consider using UTF8 encoding instead of default full unicode. This saves a lot of space, because a now a character uses only one byte. EmbeddedConfiguration config = Db4oEmbedded.newConfiguration(); config.common().stringEncoding(StringEncodings.utf8()); ObjectContainer database = Db4oEmbedded.openFile(config,"database.db4o"); Note that you cannot change this setting for existing databases! You need to defragment the database in order to change the string encoding. To compress the database you could use a compressing storage-implementation . However I don't know any available implementation which does this.
