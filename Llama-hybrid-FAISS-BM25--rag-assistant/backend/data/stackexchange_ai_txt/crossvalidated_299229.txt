Test repeated (within-subjects) observations of multinomial categorical data?

Over the course of 30 days I have asked 47 people (24 from group A and 23 from group B) which of four foods they prefer, making up a total of 1410 observations : choice group apple orange pizza beer A 340 63 216 101 B 424 65 125 76 Because I have asked the same person multiple times, the observations (within each group) are not independent and I cannot use a chi-squared test to compare the distributions. What I want to know is: Which foods are chosen significantly more often by one group than the other? My hypothesis is that group A prefers pizza and beer, while group B prefers fruits. I assume that the preference does not change over (such a short) time and am not interested in the longitudinal aspect of the survey. What test can I use? Attempt at a solution: Basically, the repeated measures (of the same person) are something like repeatedly measuring the length of a stick to obtain a more accurate measurement and average out measurement errors. I therefore thought that for each person I might calculate the percentage of each answer category. Thus, 100% of answers of one person would then divide into, for example, 40% apple answers, 30% orange, 20% pizza, and 10% beer. Represented as probabilities (that sum up to 1 for each person), I would then have data like this:: person group apple orange pizza beer 1 A 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 2 B ... In this way I would have "deleted" the within-person interdependence and would then perform a t-test on the resulting two numeric vectors. But I am unable to judge whether this is a valid procedure for the kind of data I have. Also, I would prefer to use a published and reviewed test, if such a one exists. Sample data: food
