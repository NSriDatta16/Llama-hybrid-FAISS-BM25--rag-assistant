If $x_1, \ldots x_n$ are n observations, we can think of $X = (x_1, \ldots x_n) \in R^n $ and assuming the mean of X is zero, then $Var(x) = ||x||$ . That is the Euclidean distance, || ||, ' is variance. If $x_1$ is another variable, the $||x - x_1|| $ is 'the variance of x not explained by $x_1$ and $\frac{||x - x_1||}{||x||} $ is the percentage of the variance of x not explained by $x_1$. If one has m variables, $ 1 \leq i \leq m$ then the same remains true for $x^i $. The the observations and the approximate observations are points in some Euclidean space with norm (distance) || || and the numerator of the equation is the average distance from x to the $x^i$ , that is the average variance of x not explained by the $x^i$ and similarly for the denominator.
