I have had good experience with the remote control of NTRSupport . Quite easy to use with no installation required. I also used and/or use the following software that does not cover all your requirements: Timbuktu Pro - Bad performance, few features, can't recommend it nowadays. UltraVNC - Works, but I remember some problems with clipboard and file transfer support. PCAnywhere - Works, but the performance was never satisfying, Awkward clipboard handling. RDP - Great for Windows machines but can be problematic when it is not clear whether you have to use the console session or not. Sometimes, you disconnect a server session just by accident.
