If called from command line, the server variable HTTP_USER_AGENT is not set. I use this constant to define, whether the script is called from command line or not: define("CLI", !isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])); UPDATE: Since this answer is still marked as the 'correct' one, I'd like to revise my statement - relying on the "User-Agent" header can be problematic, since it's a user-defined value. Please use php_sapi_name() == 'cli' or PHP_SAPI == 'cli' , as suggested by Eugene/cam8001 in the comments. Thanks for pointing this out!
