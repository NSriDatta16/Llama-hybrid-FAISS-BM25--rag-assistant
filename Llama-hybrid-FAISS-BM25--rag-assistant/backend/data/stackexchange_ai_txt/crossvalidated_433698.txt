How to measure the difference between two random forest models?

Suppose that I have training data defined as a set of N records (or samples) defined by its attributes (or descriptors, features, as you prefer), and I trained two random forest models with two parts of the data. I was thinking... How to measure the difference (or distance) between such models (or internal parameters/weights)?
