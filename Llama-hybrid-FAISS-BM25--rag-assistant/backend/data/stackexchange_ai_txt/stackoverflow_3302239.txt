Creating database views with NHibernate

Does any one know how to create a view from hibernate with the results of a criteria query? We've got some legacy parts of our application that use views generated by the app for data retrieval and I like to tie the new NHibernate stuff into those for minimal friction. I'd turn it into an extension method so I could eventually do stuff like this: session.CreateCriteria ().CreateReportView().List(); Any ideas? The existing process is like this: SQLString = _bstr_t("SELECT name FROM User WHERE Retired = false"); ...run the query process the results, then... SQLStringView = _bstr_t(" \ BEGIN EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ") + ViewName + _bstr_t(" AS ") + SQLString; So whenever we run this query we get a view that has the same data in it. I can't work out how to replicate this is hibernate though.
