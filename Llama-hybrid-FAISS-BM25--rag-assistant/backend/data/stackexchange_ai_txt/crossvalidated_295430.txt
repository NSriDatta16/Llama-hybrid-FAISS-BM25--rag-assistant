Something that has not been mentioned is to look at the problem from a Bayesian point of view. In a Bayesian setting, a natural approach to this problem would be to use a Beta-Binomial distribution. You can assume that the probability of someone preferring oranges over apples is $p$, which Beta distributed, and that the observations are binomially distributed with parameter $p$: $$ p \sim \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)\\ n_o|p \sim \mathrm{Bin}(n,p). $$ Let's assume that you have no a-priori reason to believe that more people prefer oranges over apples or vice-versa ($\beta=\alpha$) but also that you have no strong opinion about this (weak prior: $\beta=\alpha=1$). The prior distribution of $p$ is therefore uniform $\mathrm{U}(0,1)$. After collecting answers from $n$ questionnaires about people's preferences, you note that $n_o$ respondents prefer oranges and $n_a=n-n_o$ of them prefer apples. The posterior distribution of $p$ is: $$ p|n_o,n_a \sim \mathrm{Beta}(n_o+1, n_a+1). $$ While the mode of the posterior of $p$ (i.e. the maximum-a-posteriori) is $n_o/(n_o+n_a)$ regardless of the number of respondents, the distribution itself is very different: it is much more peaked for large $n$ than for small ones. To give you an idea, this is the posterior with $n_o=6$ and $n_a=4$: While this is the posterior with $n_o=600$ and $n_a=400$: How do you read these plots? You can reason as follows: "I observe that 6 out of 10 people (randomly chosen from the population) prefer oranges over apples but could the true underlying probability (for the whole population) be 0.4 or 0.8 instead? Well, according to the first plot this is quite possible." If you do the same for the second plot (i.e. with 1000 respondents), you get that $p=0.4$ or $p=0.8$ are very very unlikely (again, I am assuming the 1000 are IID samples from the population). Please note that although these plots look similar to david25272's, they represent something very different . His plots ask the question: "assuming a given value of $p$ known, what is the probability of observing $n_o$ people responding that they prefer oranges over apples?" My plots answer the question: "assuming that I observe $n_o$ people responding that they prefer oranges over apples, what is the probability distribution of $p$, the probability of people preferring oranges over apples?"
