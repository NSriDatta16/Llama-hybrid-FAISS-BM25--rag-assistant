Mirth is a J2EE application running on a plain old JVM; you have options for debugging it. You could follow the instructions here for running Mirth Connect via Eclipse. You could then see the JVM classpath, you could set breakpoints and use the debugger. Mirth is based on the Mule ESB. Mule has its own way of class-loading. You could research it. If Mirth is really using an old version of your JAR, maybe it's got a cached version around somewhere. Or maybe you made some configuration changes you've forgotten about - perhaps you added a new directory for jars. (Not sure how you do that.) Mule pays attention to an environment variable named MULE_LIB; maybe that's relevant. It looks like Mirth Connect 1.8 and Mirth Connect 2.0 have different places for jars (lib/custom and custom-lib, respectively). Which version are you using?
