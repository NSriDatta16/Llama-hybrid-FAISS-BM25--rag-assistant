Confused while studying stationarity and autocovariance

I started to study Time Series Analysis and have stumbled on a roadblock. When introducing the autocovariance function, the instructor mentions that we assume stationarity in the data that we are working with. That's fine; this should mean No systematic changes in either mean or variance No seasonality But suppose if the autocovariance of $X_t$ and $X_{t-3}$ is pretty high, then that means that the $t$ th data point depends strongly on the $(t-3)$ th data point. MY QUESTION: shouldn't this set up some kind of seasonality in the data, thus contradicting our assumption of stationarity? I'll explain: Say the autocovariance of $X_t$ and $X_{t-3}$ is pretty high. Then, taking a time series, we will have the following dependences: say the value for December is high. Then so will be values for September, June and March. Similarly, suppose that values for January are low: so will be those for October, July, and April. Thus when we plot the data out, we should see a clear increase from Jan $\rightarrow$ March, then a drop to April, then increases and subsequently drops in the regions April $\rightarrow$ June, July $\rightarrow$ September and October $\rightarrow$ December. Isn't this a seasonal pattern? Thus, if our data is stationary, should the autocovariance function always be zero?
