Understanding proportion of variance in PCA

One of my exam question was as follows: Assume the covariance matrix of your dataset $X $ is $\Sigma$ and while doing Principal Component Analysis, you found $\Sigma = CDC^T $. Here $D $ is the following diagonal matrix: $$\begin{bmatrix}3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 2.1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1.4 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & .9 \\\end{bmatrix}$$ Then the proportion of variance (POV) is explained by the first 2 principal components would be (accurate until 2 decimal places): A) .85 B) .68 C) .31 D) 1 E) None of the above answer are correct I know for a fact that E) is the correct answer. However, in my calculations i seem to get B) as the correct answer, calculating it as $(3 + 2.1) / (3 + 2.1 + 1.4 + 0.9) = 0.689... $ What am I missing?
