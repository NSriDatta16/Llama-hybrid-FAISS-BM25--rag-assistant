Understanding the output of the Random Forest method for classification

I'm using a Random Forest method to predict the behavior of failures at Period_12. My dataset has information about the eleven periods before, considering 112 subperiods (rows). Each one of these subperiods is classified according to two classes, "Normal" or "Failure". However, the events "Failure" occur much less than the event "Normal". When using the k-fold crossvalidation (named MODEL 1 at the script), I have a Kappa metric equal to zero, while when using the Stratified k-fold crossvalidation (MODEL 2), I have a Kappa metric of 0,325 for mtry=11. My questions: a) Why is the Kappa metric so low? It is related with the occurrences of events "Failure" in my dataset? Is there a way to improve this value? b) When I set folds at the MODEL 2, I have an even lower value for Kappa metric. Someone could help me to understand the output of my model or can suggest a way to improve it? The script: library(caret) data_failures The output: Random Forest 112 samples 11 predictor 2 classes: 'Failure', 'Normal' No pre-processing Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold) Summary of sample sizes: 100, 102, 102, 100, 100, 101, ...

The final value used for the model was mtry = 2.
