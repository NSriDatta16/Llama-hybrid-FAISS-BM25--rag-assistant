Buildbot is definetly one tool to look at - http://buildbot.net/trac . Central server which monitors all the projects and notifies agents of new tasks so you can build on any environment you really need without setting up cross compilation environment. You could also look at Cruise Control @ http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net . While it looks like its more geared towards java building, you can do quite a lot with it. I have a setup that builds linux arm & i386 binaries and packages those into debs and maintains a debian repository from build results - run unittests and all kinds of stuff on the code.. But what i really wanted to say is that basicly, allmost all ci server software that i've used are mainly just "task schedulers" and you still need to build/configure the build environment yourself which is - in multiplatform scenarios atleast - bigger tasks that configuring a software that executes the builds and produces nice reports from them..
