As frank writes , predicting last year's data point is exactly what an I(1) model is all about, so there is no reason for concern here. ARIMA modeling is quite non-trivial, and the old Box-Jenkins method of reading entrails (oops, ACF/PACF plots) to decide on ARIMA orders has really been superseded by the more modern method of using information criteria. I would very strongly recommend using an established and trustworthy software package to model and forecast your series, like the fable package for R, or the somewhat older forecast package (which I personally prefer). You may want to take a look at the free online forecasting textbook Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2nd ed. using forecast or 3rd ed. using fable . Here is a model using forecast : alcohol As you see, forecast::auto.arima() fits an ARIMA(0,0,0) model with a nonzero mean, as Richard Hardy suggests : a flat line at the overall historical average. This is very often better than a more complex ARIMA model , and especially so for such a short time series as you have here. More generally, if there are no detectable dynamics in your time series, a flat line forecast, whether the overall mean from an ARIMA(0,0,0)+c or the last observation from an I(1), is quite probably the best possible forecast. We have a number of previous threads asking about flat forecasts in ARIMA models. Incidentally, the ADF test in the tseries R package does not even want to return a result, probably simply because the series is so short: > library(tseries) > adf.test(alcohol) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: alcohol Dickey-Fuller = NaN, Lag order = 1, p-value = NA alternative hypothesis: stationary I would trust this implementation of the test more than many others.
