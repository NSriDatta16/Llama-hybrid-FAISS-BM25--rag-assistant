The appropriate notion of random in your null hypothesis should depend on your model of prediction. If your model always predicts a fixed number of growth defective genes, then your first proposal is reasonable. However, if the number varies, you may want to model that variance and try to replicate that in your null hypothesis. If it is some complicated stochastic process, then you could for instance estimate the average number of predicted growth defective genes, its variance and then choose the notion of randomness in the null hypothesis to correspond to these first and second moments. In particular, since the number of growth defective genes is discrete and non-negative, you want to look into using the geometric distribution . If all the genes have an identical probability $p$ of being defective, then you could think of looking at a gene, flipping a biased coin that is heads with probability $p$ and then labeling it as growth defective only if the result of the coin flip was heads. Alternatively, if the genes are not identical, then you can have a geometric distribution with unique parameter for each defective gene (for a related problem, see the coupon collector problem ). EDIT: Since the geometric distribution only gives you one degree of freedom, the hypergeometric distribution might be more appropriate.
