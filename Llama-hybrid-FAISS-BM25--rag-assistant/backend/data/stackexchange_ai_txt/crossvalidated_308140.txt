These are very loose terms, and from different disciplines. According to Wikipedia - which does not make it so - statistical noise is what can't be explained by a statistical model. Suppose you try to predict household natural gas consumption as a function of temperature for houses with natural gas heating. As described in Wikipedia, if you build that model witg regression and get an R-squared of 92%, the 'statistical noise' is the 8% you can't explain with your model. Random noise, as you are using it, is a slightly more precise and meaningful idea. Suppose you are measuring the voltage from the signal from a satellite receiver. That signal may be a pure sine wave when sent from the satellite, but 'noise' makes it look fuzzier on receipt. That noise can come from anywhere: atmospheric things, interference from a microwave oven, etc. That noise can have a 'shape'. White noise is equal energy per unit of frequency; pink noise is equal energy per octave; etc. I have never heard the term statistical noise before. But I think you are right: it is an informal term. It seems to be this idea...suppose you try to measure the average height of people coming off planes from Japan. The average height might be real and constant. But, every flight will have a slightly different number. This is not 'noise' in the way one thinks of it in information theory.
