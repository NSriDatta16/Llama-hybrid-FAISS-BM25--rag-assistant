Let me address the "what is its practical importance" part of the question. There are many situations in which we have the ability to compute matrix vector products $Ax$ efficiently even if we don't have a stored copy of the matrix $A$ or don't have enough storage to save a copy of $A$. For example, $A$ might be of size 100,000 by 100,000 and fully dense- it would require 80 gigabytes of RAM to store such a matrix in double preciison floating point format. Randomized algorithms like this can be used to estimate the trace of $A$ or (using a related algorithm) individual diagonal entries of $A$. Some applications of this technique to large scale geophysical inversion problems are discussed in J. K. MacCarthy, B. Borchers, and R. C. Aster. Efficient stochastic estimation of the model resolution matrix diagonal a nd generalized cross validation for large geophysical inverse problems. Journal of Geophysical Research, 116, B10304, 2011.
