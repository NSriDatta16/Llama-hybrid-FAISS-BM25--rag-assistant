SQL query return True/False

I am working with an existing architecture which populates fields on a form with things from the database. The form is entirely database driven and is done in PHP and MySQL. The problem is that the database table that holds the form elements has a field for the query that will return a result set that will be used to populate the select dropdown form element. This works great for fields like States, countries, and other such fields which are particular to our organization. I am implementing a new field and want to put a query in that returns a simple resultset {True, False} but I don't want to create a new database table that simply has those two as options, but need to keep it within the framework, so I need a SQL query to return the resultset which will be used to populate the form element. Is there some kind of a SQL query that will just return the resultset {True, False} so that I can avoid making a table just to house those two options?
