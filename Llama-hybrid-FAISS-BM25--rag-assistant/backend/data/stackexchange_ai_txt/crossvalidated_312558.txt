which residual vs fitted plot is looking better here?

This is a data analysis project we have at school where we try different ways to correct a simple linear regression model. My first attempt is just trying to transform the response variable by taking the square root of it. The second attempt is a weighted least square where the square is 1/fitted^2 where fitted is the previous model fitted value. And I got 2 new residual vs fitted plots. What I want to know is which one look the best? Simple linear regression weighted least square Y transform Finally, I also want to ask if I were to found some leverage and influential points what should I do with it.
