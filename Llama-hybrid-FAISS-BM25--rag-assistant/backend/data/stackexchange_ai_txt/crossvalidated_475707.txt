Choosing the best fitting model with AIC and p-value

I have a financial time series, exchange rates. Between ARCH(10) and GARCH(1,1) I would like to see which model fits best my TS. For ARCH I have a p-value smaller than 0.05 and for GARCH p-value is bigger than 0.05. I know what to do with the null hypothesis but my question is: for ARCH I have a smaller AIC value. Shoul I choose the ARCH model, despite the fact that I reject my null hypothesis?
