Reordering UITableView without reorder control

I need the user to be able to reorder a UITableView by this way: he touches a cell for a predetermined period (e.g. 1 second), then he can drag and drop it over the other cells. I know how to implement the 'long touch' detection using a gesture recognizer, but what is the best way to implement the drag and drop ability without using a reorder control (the user should drag the cell from anywhere in the cell, not only from the reorder control)?
