There are some JCE providers where keys are treated more securely than byte arrays in that keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data, but are themselves never present in memory in the clear. For example, Smart Card and HSM-backed providers work like that. When you create a byte array and then construct the key out of it, you're explicitly loading it into memory. When you use a KeyGenerator, the key might be created in a secure storage and not present in memory, eliminating one attack vector.
