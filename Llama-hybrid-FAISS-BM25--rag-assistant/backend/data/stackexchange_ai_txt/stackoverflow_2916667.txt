Display frame around an expression in LyX (/LaTeX)

Is it possible to draw a frame around an expression? For example if I presented a calculation, I want to draw attention to the result by drawing a "box" around it. I've seen it done in some articles in LaTeX. Is it possible to do in LyX without ERT? Otherwise, how is it done in LaTeX?
