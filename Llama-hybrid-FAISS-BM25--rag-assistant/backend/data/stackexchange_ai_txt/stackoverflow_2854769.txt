has anyone produced an in-memory GIT repository?

I would like to be able to take advantage of the benefits of GIT (and its workflows), but without the cost of disk access - I just would like to leverage the distributed revision control capabilities of GIT to produce something like a hybrid of memcached and GIT. (preferably in .NET) Is there such a beast out there?
