Logistic regression : incoherent coefficient values from z tests?

I am working on a customer purchase problem. I have 150 campaigns sent by email, that I denote C0 , C1 ... C149 . Moreover, for each user i : Cj = 0 if campaign j is NOT received by customer i , Cj = 1 if campaign j is received by customer i nb_campaigns = the number of campaigns received by client i sucess = 0 or 1 if a customer ordered something thanks to the campaigns he received I performed a logistic regression to explain the variable sucess with nb_campaigns , I got the following results (with statsmodels) : When I perform a logistic regression to explain sucess with ALL campaigns AND nb_campaigns , I got different coefficients for the intercept and for nb_campaigns and on the top of that, I got the following graph : It seems abnormal to me that the probability decreases if the number of campaigns increases. And moreover, it is not coherent with the first graph... Is it a code mistake ? I thought maybe it is because I increased the variable nb_campaign in the loop, but in fact if this variable increases by one, then one campaign needs to increase by 1 too. Do you know what tests are performed in the previous tab and why the coef are not the same ? If I want to describe the effect of nb_campaign on sucess , is it a mistake to consider all other variables ? Is it better to test sucess vs nb_campaigns and sucess vs all campaigns independently ? Thank you for your help ! William
