Basic Drag and Drop in iOS

I want to have a view in which there are vehicles driving around that the user can also drag and drop. What do you think is the best large-scale strategy for doing this? Is it best to get touch events from the views representing the vehicles, or from the larger view? Is there a simple paradigm you've used for drag and drop that you're satisfied with? What are the drawbacks of different strategies?
