NVIDIA stuff is usually good: http://developer.nvidia.com/object/6800_leagues_deferred_shading.html Here's a reasonable XNA tutorial as well: http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=155 In terms of blogs: Wolfgang Engel 's is a good start, and Christer Ericson recently posted a bunch of links (in the Graphics section of his "Catching Up Part 2" post). Oh, and the G-Buffer paper is required reading too. Less practical, but a good review of the process and rationale.
