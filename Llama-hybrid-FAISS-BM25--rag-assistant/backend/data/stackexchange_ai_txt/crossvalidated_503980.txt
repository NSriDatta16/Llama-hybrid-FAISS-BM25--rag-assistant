i think the missing part is: "It’s a measure of how much “predictive power” or “evidence” each sample will on average bring when you’re trying to distinguish p(x) from q(x), if you’re sampling from p(x). " Since $x$ is sampled from $p(x)$ distribution, then following will be true in average/expectation: $p(x)>=q(x)$ . Also resource at https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/ece830/ece830_fall11_lecture7.pdf explains how to derive $D_{KL}(p(x)||q(x))$ by using Jenking's Inequality and $D_{KL}(p(x)||q(x))=-E_{p}[log(\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}]$
