Contingency Table: Proportions between two Choices differ, p-Value of 1?

I have survey data, where participants where asked to choose two times between yes and no For this example let's say (although I am note quite sure if this is a good example). Choice1: Do you want to take to be acknowledge by your coworkers? Choice2: Do you want to be responsible if something goes wrong? So now we found considerable differences in the amount of yes and no to the two questions. pacman::p_load(tidyverse) # MRE Data > df Choice2 Choice1 No Yes No 6 1 Yes 22 6 # dput structure(c(6L, 22L, 1L, 6L), .Dim = c(2L, 2L), .Dimnames = list( Choice1 = c("No", "Yes"), Choice2 = c("No", "Yes")), class = "table") I am interested if these diferences are significant. So if e.g. substantially more participants chose yes for Choice1 then for Choice2. I thought I could analyze this with a $\chi^2$ Test? However due to the small sample (and the small expected cell count) I got a warning, from chisq.test , so instead I conducted a Fisher's exact test. # ChiÂ² Test of Independence chi What strikes me about the result is a p value of 1. Looking at the proportions for Choice 1 80% voted no, for Choice 2 20%. This appears to be reasonable differences. # Print proportions df %>% rbind("Prop" =(prop.table(df) %>% colSums() *100)) %>% cbind("Prop" = c((prop.table(df) %>% rowSums() *100),100)) # Choice 1: No = 80%, Choice 2: No = 20% how is p = 1 No Yes Prop No 6 1 20 Yes 22 6 80 Prop 80 20 100 No I am wondering if I am even using the right test? I know that the $\chi^2$ is a test of independence. So the H1 would be that Choice1 and Choice2 are dependent. However I am rather interested in knowing if the propotions between Choice1 and Choice2 are meaningful different. And how does it come that I get a p = 1 Edit Created the differ Variable > df # A tibble: 35 x 3 Choice1 Choice2 differ 1 Yes No 1 2 Yes No 1 3 Yes No 1 4 No No 0 5 No No 0 6 Yes No 1 7 Yes Yes 0 8 Yes No 1 9 Yes Yes 0 10 Yes No 1 # ... with 25 more rows > df %>% dput() structure(list(Choice1 = structure(c(2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L), .Label = c("No", "Yes"), class = "factor"), Choice2 = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L ), .Label = c("No", "Yes"), class = "factor"), differ = c(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0)), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"), row.names = c(NA, -35L)) Solution Edit: In addition to the provided answer, I would like to point attention to the very helpful question that @Scortchi linked in the comments (see here). The answer provided by Gung really improved my understanding and helped me navigate. The correct test for my question would be either the binominal test (as mentioned in the accepted answer) or the McNemmar $\chi^2$ test. Please refer to the link for more details on the reasoning behind.
