To detect an anomaly, you need a model which provides an expectation. Intervention Detection yields the answer to the question " What is the probability of observing what I observed before I observed it ? I suggest that you focus on shorter time series and use an automatic modeling algorithm that forms an ARIMA model based upon separating signal and noise. This ARIMA model can then used to identify the "unusual". Time Series Methods can be used to alert users that the underlying activity has significantly changed. The problem is that you can't catch an outlier without a model (at least a mild one) for your data. Else how would you know that a point violated that model? In fact, the process of growing understanding and finding and examining outliers must be iterative. This isn't a new thought. Bacon, writing in Novum Organum about 400 years ago said: "Errors of Nature, Sports and Monsters correct the understanding in regard to ordinary things,and reveal general forms. For whoever knows the ways of Nature will more easily notice her deviations; and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately understand Nature.
