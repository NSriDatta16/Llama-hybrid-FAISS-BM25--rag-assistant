What problem do these trace plots indicate?

The following plots are trace plots of 3 variables for MCMC results of a hierarchical Bayes probit model. The plots are fairly linear and seem to grow (or decline) without bound. This looks like a problem that needs to be fixed. But I am unsure of what the issue is. What sort of problem does a linear trace plot usually indicate?
