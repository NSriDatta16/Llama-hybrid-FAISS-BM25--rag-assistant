Transforming mean-absolutes to mean differences for meta-analysis

For a meta-analysis project, I have been tasked to submit data in Reviewmanager software. However, often I come across papers that report on average pain or disability scores, with respective SD. or S.E., from baseline and multiple time points post-treatment. However, I need to transform this data, to a mean change over time with an SD. Is there any possible way to transform this data as such? For example; Treatment group: Pain score: Baseline average: 51.47 SD: 15.62 N:29, at 4 weeks: average: 43.25 SD: 16.68, n:27 How can I calculate the mean change with respective SD between these two-time-points; if possible at all?
