The @ symbol in C# allows you to use a keyword as a variable name. For instance: //this will throw an exception, in C# class is a keyword string class = "CSS class name"; //this won't string @class = "CSS class name"; Usually it's best to avoid using keywords as variable names, but sometimes it's more elegant than having awkward variable names. You tend to most often see them when serialising stuff for the web and in anon types. Your error is probably due to applying the @ before a variable name that isn't a keyword. Update: In T-SQL @ is always used before parameter names, for instance: select * from [mytable] where [mytable].[recId] = @id You would then specify the @id parameter when you called the query.
