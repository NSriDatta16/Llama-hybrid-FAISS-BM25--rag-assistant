Can't create a folder with mkdir

Environment info: *Windows Vista *PHP 5.2.9-2 I'm working on a project. Let's say it's name simply "project". My php files meant for user-interaction will be found at project/file.php Now, I have a database behind this and some maps, which contain classes and configuration files in general. There is also a map for the users, in which I store images they might upload. For instance: project/files/Users/0/profilePic.jpg The number corresponds with the user_id in the database. My register.php file contains this line of code: mkdir('/files/Users/'.$id) The $id variable is the biggest id number in the database, plus 1. But it won't work. I checked the folders, I have both read and write permissions(I am admin on my machine). What am I doing wrong? Note: the right to tell me there's a better way to organize this reserved to those who can give me a helpful answer. :P
