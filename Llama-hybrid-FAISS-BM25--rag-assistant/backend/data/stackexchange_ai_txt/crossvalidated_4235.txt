Yes. I like the article SÃ¸ren shared very much, and together with the references in that article I would recommend Muckenheim, W. et al. (1986). A Review of Extended Probabilities . Phys. Rep. 133 (6) 337-401. It's a physics paper for sure, but the applications there are not all related to quantum physics. My personal favorite application relates to de Finetti's Theorem (also Bayesian in flavor): if we don't mind negative probabilities then it turns out that all exchangeable sequences (even finite, perhaps negatively correlated ones) are a (signed) mixture of IID sequences. Of course, this itself has applications in quantum mechanics, in particular, that Fermi-Dirac statistics yield the same type of (signed) mixture representation that Bose-Einstein statistics do. My second personal favorite application (outside of physics proper) relates to infinite divisible (ID) distributions, which classically includes normal, gamma, poisson, ... the list continues. It isn't too hard to show that ID distributions must have unbounded support, which immediately kills distributions like the binomial or uniform (discrete+continuous) distributions. But if we permit negative probabilities then these problems disappear and the binomial, uniform (discrete+continuous), and a whole bunch of other distributions then become infinitely divisible - in this extended sense, please bear in mind. ID distributions relate to statistics in that they are limiting distributions in generalized central limit theorems. By the way, the first application is whispered folklore among probabilists and the infinite divisibility stuff is proved here , an informal electronic copy being here . Presumably there is a bunch of material on arXiv , too, though I haven't checked there in quite some time. As a final remark, whuber is absolutely right that it isn't really legal to call anything a probability that doesn't lie in $[0,1]$ , at the very least, not for the time being. Given that "negative probabilities" have been around for so long I don't see this changing in the near future, not without some kind of colossal breakthrough.
