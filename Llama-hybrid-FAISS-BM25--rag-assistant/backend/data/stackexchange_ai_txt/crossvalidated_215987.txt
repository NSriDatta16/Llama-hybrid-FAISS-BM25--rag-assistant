Using deep neural networks to see how similar an image is to something

Does it make sense to use a deep neural network as some sort of comparison method (distance function) that tells us how much some image is similar to something? For example, let's say we have a super great Genetic Algorithm program that tries to draw faces. Does it make sense to feed results into an already trained neural network and ask it how much it believes the input is a face? Or how good of a face it is? Any hints on how to do something like this (if it's even right) would be greatly appreciated.
