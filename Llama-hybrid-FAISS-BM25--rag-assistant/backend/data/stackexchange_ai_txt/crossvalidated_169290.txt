To see the full source code you need to download the arm package source from CRAN (it's a tarball). A quick look at the sim function makes me think that arm is an approximate Bayes method as it seems to assume multivariate normality of the maximum likelihood estimates. In models with a very non-quadratic log likelihood, such as the binary logistic model, this may be unlikely to be accurate enough. I'd like to get some comments from others about this. I have used MCMCpack with success; it provides an exact Bayesian solution for many models, given enough posterior draws and convergence of MCMC.
