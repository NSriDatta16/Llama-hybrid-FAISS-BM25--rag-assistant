Evaluating results of VAR (Vector Autoregression) using R

I am trying to evaluate the results of a prediction obtained with the R function VAR . I have reproduced an example with two time series so that others can also implement it (the data set is read from a url). After seeing the code, I have a question regarding how to plot the prediction and I would appreciate if someone helps me understand how the predict function works as well. 1) In my case, the granger test is passed for "views granger cause unemployment." When I use predict, are the values of the "views" used in the prediction of the unemployment (in this case 5 months)? How can I make a plot where the predicted values are plotted and the real values are plotted as well? On top of that, how can I plot the results of VAR (with the real values and predicted values) and compare them with the results of only AR for unemployment (with predicted and real values as well)?. In the prediction of the VAR for unemployment, are the values of "views" considered in the 5 predicted months? Thanks. rm(list=ls()) library(vars) library(forecast) library(lubridate) library(fUnitRoots) library(urca) library(vars) library(aod) library(zoo) library(tseries) paired.ds 0 ns.unemp 0) { print(sprintf("Found seasonality in unemployment of %s", ns.unemp)) s.unemployment 0 ns.views 0) { print(sprintf("Found seasonality in viewst of %s", ns.views)) s.views 0 if (lag.unemployment >0){ print(sprintf("Found integration in unemployment of %s", lag.unemployment)) d.unemployment = diff(d.unemployment, lag=lag.unemployment) } #### Integraate of ndiffs > 0 lag.views = ndiffs(s.views, alpha = 0.05, test = c("adf")) d.views = s.views if (lag.views >0){ print(sprintf("Found integration in views of %s", lag.views)) d.views = diff(d.views, lag=lag.views) } #Model 2 #### Make it stationary model2.ts 0.05 if(p.value$serial$p.value > 0.05) { ### Test for Granger causality ### It is is a statistical concept of causality that is based on prediction. According to Granger causality, ### if a signal X1 "Granger-causes" (or "G-causes") a signal X2, then past values of X1 should contain information that helps predict #### X2 above and beyond the information contained in past values of X2 alone ### does unemployment causes views? ---> NO result F)`[2] YES result F)`[2]
