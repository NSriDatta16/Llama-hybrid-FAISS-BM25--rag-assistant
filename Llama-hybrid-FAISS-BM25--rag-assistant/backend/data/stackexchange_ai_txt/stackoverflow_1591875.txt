How do I go about setting up a TDD development process with Google App Engine?

I'm primarily a Ruby guy, but lately I've been working on a lot of Python stuff, in particular, App Engine code. In Ruby, I'd use automated continuous integration ( autotest ), code coverage tools ( rcov ), static analysis ( reek ), and mutation testing ( heckle ) in my development process, but I'm not sure how best to set up a similar development process for an App Engine environment. I'd also be interested in analogs to RSpec and Cucumber for Python that could work in App Engine.
