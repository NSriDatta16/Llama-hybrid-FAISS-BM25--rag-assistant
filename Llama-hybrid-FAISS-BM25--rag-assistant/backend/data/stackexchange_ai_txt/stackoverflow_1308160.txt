Web Services is the elegant solution. But in many cases I found much practical to go for a quick-and-dirty solution: start a Java server that communicates using a lightweight communication protocol (none of the heavyweight stuff like XML from Web Services) - example: Apache Thrift . The write a very light client, that takes parameters from command line and writes the output to the console. The client can be in Java or even in other languages, like C++ (Apache Thrift supports that). Then you call the client with system() or with exec() from PHP. This is not a solution I would ever recommend for production, but it's great for prototyping. Quick and dirty and flexible and extremely modest learning curve (if you already use light-weight communication between your Java processes).
