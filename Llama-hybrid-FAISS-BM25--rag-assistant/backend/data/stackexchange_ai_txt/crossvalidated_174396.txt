How to use custom measure metrics in glmnet [R]?

Hi I'm doing some logistic regression, currently using glmnet package in R. glmnet provides a few measure metrics for cross validation. For classification, we can use type.measure = 'auc' (area under ROC curve) or type.measure = 'class' (misclassification rate). I'm working with some insurance data with a low rate of positive examples (y = 0 for 95% data, and = 1 for 5% of them. OR 95% people did't buy insurance). library(ISLR) data(Caravan) y = dta$Purchase x = as.matrix( dta[ , -which(colnames(dta)=='Purchase') ] ) And I want to predict who are likely to buy insurance. I think I need to use F1 score or some custom metrics. For example, if I can make 200 by selling an insurance, and the cost to contact one person is 20, then I want to maximize metric = 200 * N(true positive) - 20 * N(predicted positive) Is there a way I can do this with glmnet or something else more suitable? Or is AUC a similar metric as F1 score? Any help or discussion's appreciated. Thanks
