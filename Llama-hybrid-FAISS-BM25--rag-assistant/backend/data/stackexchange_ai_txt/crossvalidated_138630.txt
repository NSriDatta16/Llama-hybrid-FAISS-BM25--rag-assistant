If I use Neural Networks based classification (in Matlab), does it automatically do the dimension reduction for me? Answer: if you are using more than one layer for classification and the number of neuron in hidden layer are less than input neurons so you have a kind of dimensional reduction neural network. m you have a dimension reduction network"> but it might not be a PCA.
