Understanding the wikipedia entry on Dragon Curves

I'm playing around with Project Euler's Problem 220 , and I'm a little confused about the Wikipedia article on the topic, Dragon Curve . On the topic of calculating the direction of the nth turn without having to draw the entire curve, it says: First, express n in the form k * 2^m where k is an odd number. The direction of the nth turn is determined by k mod 4 i.e. the remainder left when k is divided by 4. If k mod 4 is 1 then the nth turn is R; if k mod 4 is 3 then the nth turn is L. For example, to determine the direction of turn 76376: 76376 = 9547 x 8. 9547 = 2386x4 + 3 so 9547 mod 4 = 3 so turn 76376 is L Is there a clever way to figure out if n can be expressed as k2^m, apart from checking divisibility by successive powers of 2? What does it mean if n cannot be expressed in such a way? (The problem involves calculating the position of a point on a Dragon curve with length 2^50, so actually drawing the curve is out of the question.)
