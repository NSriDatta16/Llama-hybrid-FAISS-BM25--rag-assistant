After using PSM to select a sample of treated and control subjects from a larger population: would I be estimating the ATE or ATT?

Suppose I use propensity score matching to select a sample of treatment and control subjects from a larger population for a follow-up survey. Assuming I matched subjects using the full range of p-scores, and assuming I matched on all observables and that unobservables were not a problem: would my estimates of impact be equivalent to an Average Treatment Effect or an Average Treatment Effect on the Treated?
