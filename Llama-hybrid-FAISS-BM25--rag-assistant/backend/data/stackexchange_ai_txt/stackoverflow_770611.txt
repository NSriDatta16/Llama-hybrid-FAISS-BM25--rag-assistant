What do you want to actually do with your cluster kind of decides what software you will need. Do you need job scheduling? Monitoring tools? Do you need to deploy software across all nodes at once seamlessly? One file system across all nodes (recommended). You could just as easily install a linux or *BSD on the boards and just use ssh to manage and run jobs across all the nodes. No other software really required. Software you might find useful: PBS (mostly job scheduling, google) Kerrighed (Single System Image based, Linux distro) Rocks (cluster based distribution) Mosix ( cluster Management, openMosix also ) Ganglia (Monitoring, probably over kill for you) Lustre (Super fast, opensource cluster filesytem from Sun)
