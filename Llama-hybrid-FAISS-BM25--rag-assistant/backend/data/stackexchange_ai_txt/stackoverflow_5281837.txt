How to make Mac app archive signed?

I want to publish my Mac app to Mac App Store. So I've tried to sign my app and archive with Xcode 4. I got the process to sign the app - build settings. However, I don't know how to sign archive(package). In Organizer, when I tried to submit with archive, identity drop box shows that "No valid signing identities found" and others aren't showed.
