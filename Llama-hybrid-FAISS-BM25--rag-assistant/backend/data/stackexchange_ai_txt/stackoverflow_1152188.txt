If I were you, I would do the following: subclass UIView and implement whichever of the UIResponder touch methods are useful to you: – touchesBegan:withEvent: – touchesMoved:withEvent: – touchesEnded:withEvent: – touchesCancelled:withEvent: Or you could implement these methods in a UIViewController subclass.
