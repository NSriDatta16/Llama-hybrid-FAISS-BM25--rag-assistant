You represent the data with a model to fulfill a certain task, e.g. to describe the data or to forecast or predict values which are not in the dataset. For some tasks some models are more appropriate than other. Therefore you should think of the problem you have and then you should look for a model/way/method to solve this problem. Generally if all of you models tell you the same, e.g. the oil price affects the stock market negatively, than you can be relatively sure that this is really the case. If the models tell you different inferences you should think about the models: Does on models detect for autocorrelation? What about unit roots, structural changes and stationarity? Are there unobserved effects or is there endogeneity? etc. Your models are always only a representation of your data. Some models are more appropriate for some data and some models are more appropriate for other data. - VAR is a model for multiple time-series. If you only have a univariate time series VAR is not appropriate. ARIMA ARIMA and its variante seasonal ARIMA usually perform suboptimal when you data has multiple seasonalities or complex seasonality patterns, e.g. daily seasonalities with 365 periods a year. ARDL Might be a reasonable choice. You can use it even when your data is non-stationary. GARCH Might also be a reasonable choice- especially when there is volatility clustering.
