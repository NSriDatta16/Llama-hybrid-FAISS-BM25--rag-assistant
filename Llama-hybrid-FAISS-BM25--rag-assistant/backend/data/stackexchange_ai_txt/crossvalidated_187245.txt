This is a classic example of the harm caused by the use of a discontinuous improper scoring rule. A simpler example is shown in the Information Loss chapter in Biostatistics for Biomedical Research, available from http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/ClinStat . Not only can classification "accuracy" do this it can sometimes tell you that using predictors is worse than just using the overall average risk to predict every subject's outcome. Sensitivity and specificity are also improper accuracy scores and are discussed at length in the Diagnosis chapter of the same notes. Logistic regression was never intended to be used for the crude and arbitrary task of classification. It is a direct probability model .
