Making sense of Yes/ No Type survey

I have a survey with 1 single question: Do you wish to join our club? Yes/ No Apart from the usual % and count of yes/ no respondents, is there any other measure I can derive from this? For example, can I derive an average out of the survey and will it make sense? Sorry if the question sounds a bit silly, but I have no statistical background and I'm really stumped. Cheers
