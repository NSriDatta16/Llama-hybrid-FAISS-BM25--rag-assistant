NetLogo vs. Repast Simphony?

I would like to simulate some scenarios using the multiagent paradigm, and it seems NetLogo and Repast are the most popular tools for that. I'd like to know if anyone has had any experience with either one and could tell me more about them? For example, I've noticed that there is a fluxogram-like modeling option for Repast, but I believe it is rather limited. I've looked around the tutorials and documentation in the official site, and the documentation seems to be lacking. While there are some examples with it, I'd say extending it to simulate an ambient which it has not been specifically prepared to seems like an unreachable goal at the moment, despite Repast obviously being very robust and apparently able to handle it, given enough familiarity with it. On the other hand, NetLogo has more examples and overall I've liked it more for its simplicity, but it seems to be more focused on the simulating propagation of diseases or similar models. I've found a programming book teaching Logo , so I figure it'd be easier to get started with it too. Currently, I am thinking of simulating botnets and IDS es as multiagents. The problem, however, is that I would have to abstract the network and transport layers to an extent to be able to do it, as well as generate traffic between the nodes. Repast is apparently more fitting for this, but given its complexity and lack of documentation I'm thinking of using NetLogo. While there are some examples of NetLogo with traditional applications (ex: Tetris or Pac-Man ), I'm not sure about how appropriate it'd be for that.
