I also find this fragment of the book challenging to follow, and the above answer by itdxer deserves quite some time to understand as well for someone who's not properly fluent with probabilities and maths thinking. I made it however by reading the answer backwards, so start with the sigmoid of z \begin{align} P(y=1) = \frac{e ^ z}{1 + e ^ z} = \frac{1}{1 + e ^ {-z}} \end{align} and try to follow back to. \begin{align} \log\tilde P(y) &= yz \end{align} Then it makes sense why they started the explanation with yz - it's by design, same as the final \begin{align} \sigma((2y-1)z) \end{align} by construction allows to get -1 for y=0 and 1 for y=1, which are the only possible values of y under the Bernoulli.
