It sounds like a nice project! You should be able to borrow from three related disciplines in order to complete your modeling process: Physics (thermal dynamics), machine learning, and time series. The final mechanics of your model (pun intended), therefore, can vary considerably based on the approach you take at each step, which should be determined by what data streams you have, what you feel is the correct structure in terms of causality or inter-dependence, and how much you deem each data stream reliable and accurate relative to the physical quantity it represents. Specifically to your question, my hunch is that the easiest way is not to model the temperature directly, the readings of which are expected to be highly auto-correlated during a normal motor usage session, due to the thermal mass. I would opt for modeling the innovation component in the temperature time series, which (as a hunch/ as a thumb-rule) is the first difference of the temperature time series. For a more specific answer, I feel I'd need a more detailed description of both your input features and the target variable. For example, you did not mention whether your data includes direct and reliable measurements of your target variable, namely the temperature of the rotor inside the engine.
