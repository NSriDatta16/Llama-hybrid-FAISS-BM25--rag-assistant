If I was unfamiliar with time series I would run exponential smoothing models, there are many and I would run more than one against a hold out data set to see which works best. They are a lot simpler to do than ARIMA, have a good track record of predicting, and are robust to violations of assumptions. Nothing is perfect, they are a good starting point.
