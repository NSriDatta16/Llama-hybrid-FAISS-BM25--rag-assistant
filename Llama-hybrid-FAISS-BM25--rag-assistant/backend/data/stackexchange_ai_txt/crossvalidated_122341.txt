I would actually say the opposite, that more commonly occurring events are easier to predict, if by that you mean something like constructing a regression model. Assuming that the events you're talking about can be broken down into binary 'yes/no' or 'event/no event', I would think of this like a logistic regression. Since tests of binary outcomes are based on number of events observed rather than number of participants, a higher number of events is desirable and permits detecting smaller effects. The challenge faced by RCT drug trials in detecting adverse events is an example of the problems posed by modelling rare events. For an example of calculating sample sizes for binary outcomes see: http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/5/1388.long http://rds.epi-ucsf.org/ticr/syllabus/courses/26/2009/02/03/Other/readings/Wittes_02.pdf
