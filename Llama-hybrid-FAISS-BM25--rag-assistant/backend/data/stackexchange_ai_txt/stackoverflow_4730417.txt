Check out the Loki small objects allocator. Quick-googling that didn’t yield any direct human-oriented docs. There is DOxygen-generated documentation but not especially grokkable. However, the design and implementation is documented in Andrei Alexandrescu’s "Modern C++ Design". If you just want efficient recycling for objects of a given class, then consider a simple free-list – possibly a free-list of raw storage chunks. Cheers & hth.,
