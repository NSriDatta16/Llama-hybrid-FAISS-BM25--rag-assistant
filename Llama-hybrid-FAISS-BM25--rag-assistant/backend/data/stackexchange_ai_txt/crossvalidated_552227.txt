I don't think I would use the averages. I would use the individual data. Having different number of individuals per hospitals might not be problematic. ... But --- if I understand the question correctly --- with only three hospitals, you might as well use anova or something of a similar spirit. EDIT: I just added a plot and some R code for a visual. Here, the hospitals have 10, 20, and 30 observations. Their means are 4, 5, and 9. And the Individual scores are centered on 5, 6, and 7, with equal standard deviations. So I did doctor the data both to be correlated (r ~ 0.5), and to be homoscedastic. In this case, either the correlation analysis or the anova analysis should work fine, but they do ask different questions. set.seed(sum(utf8ToInt("Sal"))) A = c(rnorm(10 ,5, 1)) B = c(rnorm(20 ,6, 1)) C = c(rnorm(30 ,7, 1)) Y = c(A, B, C) X = c(rep(4, length(A)), rep(5, length(B)), rep(9, length(C))) cor.test(~ X + Y) ### data: X and Y ### t = 4.3634, df = 58, p-value = 5.332e-05 ### sample estimates: ### cor ### 0.4971262 Data = data.frame(Hospital=X, Individual=Y) library(ggplot2) ggplot(Data, aes(x=Hospital, y=Individual)) + geom_point()
