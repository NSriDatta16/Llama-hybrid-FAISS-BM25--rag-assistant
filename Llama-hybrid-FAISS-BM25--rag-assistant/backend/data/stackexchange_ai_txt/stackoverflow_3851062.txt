You could try looking into the many other cluster algorithms out there. You have probabilistic clustering (EM), partitional clustering (KMeans), hierarchical clustering, and many others... Of course each requires a different kind of configuration Also make sure to try Weka , an open source tool containing lots and lots of machine learning algorithms (classification, clustering, pre-processing, ...). I believe it has an implementation (Java) for all those algorithms mentioned. Edit : The question of determining which clustering is best is very domain-dependent. And it all comes down to how the clusters are put to use in the context of your application that determines how useful they are (Besides there could be more than one natural clustering of your data).
