Infragistics Clickable PieChart

I am attempting to create a clickable piechart in ASP.NET 2.0 with C# using version 7.1 of Infragistics' software. The chart appears as it should, but the function marked in the OnChartDataClicked event is not called. From the .aspx: And in the .aspx.cs: protected void DataRegionClicked(object sender, Infragistics.UltraChart.Shared.Events.ChartDataEventArgs e) { Session["BLOCK"] = "some nearly random text"; }
