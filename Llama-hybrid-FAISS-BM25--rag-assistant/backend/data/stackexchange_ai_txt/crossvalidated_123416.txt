My naive method for this task would be: Create a set S. For each journal article in your collection: Tokenise author names. Add to S. Tokenise title. Add to S. Tokenise abstract. Add to S. Porter stem everything in S. Make a great big binary matrix, X, with one row for each article and a column for each feature in S. Regress your binary column vector of like/dislike, Y, on X, using some general method like SVM or random forests. Method two, cheat and use Sparrho .
