What are the deep learning books covering stochastic differential equations only?

I want to solve a simple Stochastic Differential Equation say $$dY=Y^2 dt+\sigma Y^2 dW$$ and then make future predictions. I am conversant with MATLAB and LSTMs in python. Is there a book that can help me find a machine learning code that can assist me to make such prediction?
