You’re right. No one can have 1.5 children. Your observation leads to an important point: the mean value does not have to be a possible value. You could then use that to segue into a discussion of the sampling distribution of the mean, possibly even leading to a discussion of the central limit theorem. I like the response above for multiple reasons. It is compassionate. Instead of dismissing the student, you mention that the observation is not only correct but leads to an important point that you have not explicitly taught. Instead of the student being a troublemaker or ignorant, the student is insightful. It leads to an important point that the mean does not have to be a possible value, leading to more advanced topics that you probably want to cover at some point during the semester and can allude to at that moment. Finally, if this comes up because you made a comment like, “The average person has 1.5 children,” you can clarify what this slang terminology means, as the literal interpretation, as your students point out, is ridiculous.
