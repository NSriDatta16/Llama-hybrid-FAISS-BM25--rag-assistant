How can I test whether a string contains only hex characters in C#?

I have a long string (8000 characters) that should contain only hexadecimal and newline characters. What is the best way to validate / verify that the string does not contain invalid characters? Valid characters are: 0 through 9 and A through F. Newlines should be acceptable. I began with this code, but it does not work properly (i.e. fails to return false when a "G" is the first character): public static bool VerifyHex(string _hex) { Regex r = new Regex(@"^[0-9A-F]+$", RegexOptions.Multiline); return r.Match(_hex).Success; }
