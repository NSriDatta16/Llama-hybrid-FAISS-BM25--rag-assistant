One approach could be to take the first time differences of your 12 variables to ensure stationarity. Then calculate the $12\times12$ covariance matrix and perform PCA on it. This will be some sort of average PCA over the whole time span, and will not say anything about how the different timelags affect each other. But it could be a good starting point. If you are interested in decomposing the time domain as well I would check out SSA as suggested in the comments. When you series are (assumed) stationary a single covariance matrix is meaningful. If your data is integrated of an order of 1 or higher, as I suspect they might be, the estimation of a single covariance matrix will not yield consistent results. A random walk is for example integrated of order 1, and the estimated covariance of two random walks does not say anything about their co-movement, here co-integration analysis is required. As suggested in the comments PCA in itself doesn't care about stationarity so you can feed PCA any positive semi-definite matrix and the PC decomposition will be fine in a PCA-sense. But if your estimated covariance matrix does not represent anything meaningful about the data, then PCA will, of course, not either.
