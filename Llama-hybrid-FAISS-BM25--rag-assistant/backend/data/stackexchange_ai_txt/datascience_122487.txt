What is the NLP problem I am solving called and how should i go about solving it?

I am working on a POC where I am required to write a NLP code after web scraping. The prompt to my code is How good is the online Data Science degree offered by MIT? I am required to do web scrapping and other information resources and generate a chatGPT type output. I am new to data science and understand that this is not a regression of classification task. I want to know what is this problem called so that I can do the relevant study and solve this problem. Also, how should I go about solving this problem, like a block diagram is highly appreciated.
