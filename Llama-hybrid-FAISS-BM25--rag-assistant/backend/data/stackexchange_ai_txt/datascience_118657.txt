Time series forecast where variable depends on another variable which is time dependent

I am currently making a weather forecast prediction using time series and have that temperature depends on the time of the year and can make models using this, however it also has dependence on longitude and latitude and these variables are not time dependent, how can I include these variables in a model to forecast future temperatures. I also have multiple temp recordings for each date and don't know how to use these.
