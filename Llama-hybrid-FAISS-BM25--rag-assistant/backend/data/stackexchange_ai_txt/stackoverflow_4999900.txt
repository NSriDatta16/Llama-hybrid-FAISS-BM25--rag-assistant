One thing to mention here is when you said it worked okay on 2.1, 2.2 emulators.. what was the density of the emulators used. Density has a huge impact on how images are displayed. Another point, according to how android handles images, the attributes of small/normal/large/xlarge screens and ldpi/mdpi/hdpi/xdpi are applied to assets in res and thus drawable folders. It doesnt apply to assets folder. What I am trying to say is to read up on how Android displays assets and play around with playing your icon in res folder instead of assets folder. You will find the solution, and also increase your Android knowledge.
