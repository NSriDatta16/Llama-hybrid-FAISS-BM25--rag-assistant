Managing routes with rails

I want to be able to better understand rails routes file, but I can't figure it out by myself since it's too complex. Basically I have 3 controllers. They are: Admin, ManageProduct and ManageProductCategory (I have 2 models: Product, ProductCategory and model ProductCategory has_many/belongs_to products relationship) Admin controller actions: index (redirects to login) login logout attempt ManageProduct controller actions: index CRUD (delete, edit, show, list) for model product ManageProductCategory index CRUD (delete, edit, show, list) for model product_category I want to be able to manage my application routes so that if I type in the browser: mywebsite/admin mywebsite/admin/login mywebsite/admin/logout mywebsite/admin/manage_product mywebsite/admin/manage_product_category/1 mywebsite/admin/manage_product/delete mywebsite/admin/manage_product/10 And so on... The problem is I can't figure out how to setup my route files so that rails understand that admin/manage_product is not a admin controller action... NOTICE: Everything is already working (CRUD for 2 models and links to action via standard not recommended route match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))' Really appreciate your help and attention Regards
