Correct, $rating is input and $tscore is the normalized output. Ideally, everyone would assign points for their achievements on an identical scale. One point for stupid or trivial achievements, ten points for modest achievements, 50 points for truly epic achievements, or whatever. But people have very different behavior when it comes to assigning scores. Some will be very generous, and make every achievement worth the max. Others will be strict and accurate, adhering carefully to the scale as it relates to the difficulty of the achievement. Others may think it's dumb that people worry about points, and assign the minimum value for all the achievements they create. Normalization attempts to handle these individual abnormalities and fit everyone's ratings to the same scale. It's like what they do with the judges' scores in the Olympics. You don't "blindly trust" the value a user assigned to an achievement, but it's something you want to account for if it's part of the system. Otherwise you could presumably just hard-code the point value of achievements, limit how often they can be created, and it sounds like that would curb the worst abuse. But the score is useful because, after normalization, you can figure out what the achievement's value would be worth if it was created by a stereotypically average user. That makes it difficult for people to "game" the system because the further they get from the average value and distribution for achievements, the more their own values get normalized back towards the baseline. I should mention that I am not a professionally trained programmer, and I have never taken a statistics class or any higher math. Due to my own limitations of understanding, perhaps I'm not the best person to be explaining this. But I have been struggling with a similar problem on my own site (user-to-user ratings), and after trying numerous approaches this one seems like the most promising. Most of the inspiration for the implementation came from http://www.ericdigests.org/2003-4/score-normilization.html so you might like to read that as well.
