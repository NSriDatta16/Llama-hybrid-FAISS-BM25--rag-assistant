How to implement an artificial neural network in Delphi?

I want to have an artificial neural network: 42 input neurons 168 hidden neurons 7 output neurons This network is to play the game of "Connect Four". At the end of each game, the network gets feedback (game result / win?). Learning should be done with Temporal Difference Learning. My questions: What values should be in my reward array? And finally: How can I apply it to my game now? Thank you so much in advance!
