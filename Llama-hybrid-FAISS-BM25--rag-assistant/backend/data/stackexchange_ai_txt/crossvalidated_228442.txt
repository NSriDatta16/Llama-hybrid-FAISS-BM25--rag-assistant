First, there are more Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers aside from the Metropolis-Hastings (MH), but I will focus on MH. It is not that a Markov chain is needed, it is that using an MH algorithm the samples obtained themselves form a Markov chain that converge to the stationary distribution indicated in the accept-reject criterion. There are a couple of differences between rejection sampling and MH. Lets say your distribution from which you desire samples is $\pi$. In MH if your current sample is $x$, you draw a sample $y$ from a proposal distribution $q$, and find the following accept reject ratio $$\min \left( 1,\dfrac{\pi(y) \,q(x \mid y)}{\pi(x) \, q(y \mid x) } \right). $$ Notice that the accept-reject ratio itself is a function of the current step $x$. Even if your proposal is not dependent on your current step (like in Independent MH), your ratio will still be $$\min \left( 1,\dfrac{\pi(y) \,q(x)}{\pi(x) \, q(y) } \right), $$ which again depends on the current step. Thus the probability with which you accept or reject depends on the current step, making the samples that you obtain a Markov chain. If the proposed step is rejected in MH, then the next step is the same as the current step. So again, the next step depends on the previous step, and thus we have a Markov chain. The stationary distribution that the MH algorithm will converge to is the one that takes $\pi$s position in the ratio. If you replace it with any other distribution, the samples you get will converge to that distribution. Whether the Markov chain converges or not is something practioners don't have to worry about because this has already been proven for the MH algorithm. Finally, there is no need to calculate the transition matrix because there is a clear path of updating the Markov chain without a transition matrix. Also, for when the state space infinite (like the real line), then we can no longer deal with the transition matrix and have to study the transition "kernel". But this is not required since the way the Markov chain updates itself is only theMH-ratio algorithm, and no other information is needed.
