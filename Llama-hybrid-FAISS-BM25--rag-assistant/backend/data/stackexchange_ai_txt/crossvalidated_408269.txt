No, there is no standard way. In some cases, we pick two or three nodes because it is easier to visualise the resulting representation. Aside that there is little formal work especially when auto-encoder generated representation are use in other applications (classification, denoising, etc.) In general, the bottleneck layer constrains the amount of information that goes through our auto-encoder, this forces the bottleneck to learn a "good but compressed" representation of our original input data. There has been some work on how bottleneck size affects the overall quality of the embedding which focused in particular application domains: Gupta et al. (2016) " Squeezing bottlenecks: exploring the limits of auto-encoder semantic representation capabilities " focused their attention to text reconstruction. We can potentially recreate scree-like plots for various metrics (e.g. SPI - Structure Preservation Index or SAI - Similarity Accumulation Index) the ones shown in the paper for our particular application.
