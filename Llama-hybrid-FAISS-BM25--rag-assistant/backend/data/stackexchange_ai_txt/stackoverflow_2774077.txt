There just plain isn't an elegant way to return two values in C#. Although I definitely think using out parameters is better than returning a List , that's not very maintainable or readable. C# developers expect out , it's supported directly by the language, and it's well understood what it's doing. Starting in 4.0, you can use a Tuple instead.
