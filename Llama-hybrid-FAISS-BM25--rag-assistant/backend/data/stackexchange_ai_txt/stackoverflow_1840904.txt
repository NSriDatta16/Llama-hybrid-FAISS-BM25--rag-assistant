Remotely pass messages to c# console app

I need to be able to send a string message and receive a string response from a console app running within our organization. I want to pass simple strings back and forth from a remote IP address. What's the best way to do this? My first thought is to listen on a socket, but that seems like overkill. I've looked a little into becoming a WMI producer/consumer, but that's pretty involved too. Also there's System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.Tcp to register for messages. It seems like any of these methods would work, but what's the easiest way to get an event to fire when a string arrives and how to pass a string back from a c# console app?
