Change attribute ordering in Magento's advanced search page

I have a few custom attributes on my products in Magento and they are searchable in Magento's search page; problem is that the fields are listed in the wrong order on the search page; For example: Title _____ Author _____ SKU _____ ISBN _____ Should be: Author _____ Title _____ ISBN _____ SKU _____ I've taken a look at the template file and it seems to be outputting an array (or object) from it's internal ordering. I would like to know how to change this ordering :). Any (relatively straight-forward) ideas?
