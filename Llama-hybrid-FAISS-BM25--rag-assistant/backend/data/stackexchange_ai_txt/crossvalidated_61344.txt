Getting the bootstrap-validated AUC in R

In a paper by Faraklas et al , the researchers create a Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infection Mortality Risk Calculator. They use logistic regression to create a model with mortality from necrotizing soft-tissue infection as the main outcome and then calculate the area under the curve (AUC). They use the bootstrap method to find the "bootstrap optimism-corrected ROC area." If I were to do this in R , how would it look like? The code I have been toying with looks something like below: library(boot) library(ROCR) auc_calc Is this correct? Or am I doing something wrong - namely should I be passing in a glm model rather than recalculating it each time? As always thanks for the help.
