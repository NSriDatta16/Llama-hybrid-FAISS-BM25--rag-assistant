Interpretation of coefficients in fractional response (probit) model

I am learning about the estimation of fractional response models (those with a lower and upper bound, say 0 to 1), using Stata. I came across this example on the Stata page , which I'm copy-pasting below for simplicity. I have 3 questions regarding the interpretation of coefficients, and any help is much appreciated. "We are going to analyze an air-pollution index that is scaled 0 to 1, inclusive (...) We model pollution as determined by the number of older, pollution-producing cars per capita; percentage of output due to industry; and annual rainfall. We use probit. We type:" . fracreg probit pollution oldcars rainfall industrial Iteration 0: log pseudolikelihood = -1001.8481 Iteration 1: log pseudolikelihood = -806.74595 Iteration 2: log pseudolikelihood = -806.55309 Iteration 3: log pseudolikelihood = -806.55309 Fractional probit regression Number of obs = 1,234 Wald chi2(3) = 116.91 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log pseudolikelihood = -806.55309 Pseudo R2 = 0.0060 Robust pollution Coefficient std. err. z P>|z| [95% conf. interval] oldcars .7689171 .1748695 4.40 0.000 .4261791 1.111655 rainfall -.3165829 .0350128 -9.04 0.000 -.3852067 -.2479592 industrial .2295972 .053877 4.26 0.000 .1240002 .3351942 _cons -.3840791 .0393275 -9.77 0.000 -.4611596 -.3069986 "(...) margins will make interpreting our results easier. We can ask margins to report elasticities, which is to say, the percentage change in pollution for a 1% change in the covariate:" . margins, dyex(_all) Average marginal effects Number of obs = 1,234 Model VCE: Robust Expression: Conditional mean of pollution, predict() dy/ex wrt: oldcars rainfall industrial Delta-method dy/ex std. err. z P>|z| [95% conf. interval] oldcars .0411578 .0093973 4.38 0.000 .0227393 .0595763 rainfall -.0581577 .0062469 -9.31 0.000 -.0704014 -.0459139 industrial .0347474 .0081857 4.24 0.000 .0187037 .050791 Question 1: The page explains that we can state that "a 1% increase of older cars per capita increases pollution by 0.041" . But can we also say that a 10% increase of older cars per capita increases pollution by $10 \times 0.041=0.41$ ? Or more generally, can I multiply the elasticity by any number X (say, X = the standard deviation of the variable older cars per capita) and claim that this is the effect on pollution of an increase of X% in older cars per capita? Question 2: I am also confused by the comment in that page regarding the use of dyex vs eyex : "we typed dyex(), not eyex(). The dependent variable is already a proportion and so is already on a percentage scale. We just need its change, not its percentage change." Wouldn't it be more appropriate to talk about percentage points instead of percentages, if we are using dyex ? Question 3: Would the answer to question 1 change depending on whether dyex or eyex was used? Thanks!
