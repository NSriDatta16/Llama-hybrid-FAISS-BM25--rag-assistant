Sorting on nullable child property in CoolStorage

Lets says we have Films and HeaderItems. Sometimes a Film has a HeaderItem linked to it OneToOne but not always. Now I want to sort all the Films on their title BUT I would like the films with a HeaderItem linked to them to sort on HeaderItem.Position (if HeaderItem is not null). I've tried to implement a OneToMany on Films and a OneToOne but I can get the sorting to work. He can't convert the QueryExpression to String or vice versa. Any ideas on how to do this?
