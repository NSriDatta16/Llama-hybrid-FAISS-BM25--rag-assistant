I am not sure there is anyway within the framework to create this type of button. You could fairly easily simulate it using your own custom images. What you want in this case is a stretchable image that does not distort as you resize the buttons. Take a look at the following method on the UIImage class: - (UIImage *)stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:(NSInteger)leftCapWidth topCapHeight:(NSInteger)topCapHeight
