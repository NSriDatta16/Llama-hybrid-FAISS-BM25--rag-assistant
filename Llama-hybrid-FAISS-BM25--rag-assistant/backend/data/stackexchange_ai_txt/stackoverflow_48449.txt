Since Agile development is about transparency and accountability it sounds like the testers should have assigned tasks that account for their velocity. Even if that means they have a task for surfing the web waiting for testing (though I would think they would be better served developing test plans for the dev team's tasks). This will show the inefficiencies in your organization which isn't popular but that is what Agile is all about. The bad part of that is that your testers may be penalized for something that is a organizational issue. The company I worked for had two separate (dev and qa) teams with two different iteration cycles. The qa cycle was offset by a week. That unfortunatey led to complexity when it came to task acceptance, since a product wasn't really ready for release until the end of the qa's iteration. That isn't a properly integrated team but neither is yours from the sound of it. Unfortunately the qa team never really followed scrum practices (No real planning, stand up, or retrospective) so I can't really tell if that is a good solution or not.
