Jquery - Designing a report builder web tool

I am looking to develop a report builder tool and thought if I could use JQuery for this. Basically, what I am looking for is to have a screen that shows a list of field in the left hand side (something like a tree view). I can select a field and then drag it to a panel in the right hand side and drop it there. As I add more fields, the fields are all lines up side by side to each other. This is the basic starting point I am looking for and will build further features on this. Any suggestion on how to do this using jquery. Can anyone point of to any available resource that I could use or refer to? Appreciate any help on this. Thanks, A.
