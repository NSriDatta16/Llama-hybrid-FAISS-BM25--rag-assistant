Easiest way to rearrange methods in Eclipse

I am trying to keep functions related to each other close together. What would be the easiest way to rearrange methods within a class in Eclipse? ALT+UP / ALT+DOWN works for code within methods, but moving the whole function around is a bit hard since it does not respect function boundaries. Copy/Paste works, but I was hoping for something more elegant.
