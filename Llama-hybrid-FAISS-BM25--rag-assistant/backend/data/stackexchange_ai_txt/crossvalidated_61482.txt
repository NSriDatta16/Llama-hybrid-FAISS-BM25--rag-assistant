An example of your syntax would be helpful. GLMs require both a family (or what I call a variance family) and a link function to define the Fisher Scoring algorithm that solves for your parameter estimates. With Poisson variance and log link, this is Poisson regression or regression, attained with the argument family=poisson to glm . However, use the following argument family=binomial(link="log") and you get relative risk regression. Most families in the R GLM function allow you to specify link="log" as an optional argument to the family object (e.g. gaussian , gamma , poisson ). Irregular GLMs, especially ones for which the range of the link function is bigger than that of the fitted mean in the variance, have bizarre constrictions imposed on the parameter space which Fisher Scoring cannot accommodate. Using the traceback() function is always useful with errors like these. You can also find the iteration where the algorithm diverges by specifying glm.control=list(maxit=1) for a 1 step estimator, glm.control=list(maxit=2) for a 2 step, and so on and so forth. Plotting your $\beta^{(i)}$ estimates for the (i)-th iteration will help you see what's happening before the Hessian becomes singular, Fisher Scoring diverges, and R explodes. Your problem with starting values may be because you're supplying the means of the response variables when the variables are contrasts between the logs of the means. Hence ratios of logs of averages would be a better starting place. Personally, if this were such an issue, I'd fit a regular GLM to make sure the algorithm isn't universally divergent and use the parameter estimates for that model to start another. For instance: Feeding forward logistic regression estimates (ORs) to obtain risk ratios (RRs) ## retrospective incidence of something nasty data
