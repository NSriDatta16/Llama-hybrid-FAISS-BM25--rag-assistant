Deterministic Decoder for Variational Bayes Autoencoder or RNN

I was wondering if it is possible to use just deterministic function in the output layer of a variational Bayes autoencoder or RNN? Most of papers that I have read are using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) in the output layers but how about using just a MLP with TANH activation function in the output layer? I am talking about math not performance, is there any problem with that?
