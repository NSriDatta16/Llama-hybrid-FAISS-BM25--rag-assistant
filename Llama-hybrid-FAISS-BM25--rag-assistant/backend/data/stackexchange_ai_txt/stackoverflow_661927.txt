How to access the id of draggable element which is dropped into sortable

I am using the JQuery libs to implement drag and drop. How do I get at the element that is being dragged when it is dropped into sortable list? I want to get the id of the div being dragged. The following element is dragged: I have the standard dragging function from their example $(".control").draggable({ connectToSortable: '#sortable', helper: 'clone' }); function stop in dragging section with next code return proper value stop: function(event, ui) { alert(ui.helper.attr('id')); } And this is sortable element: test and his function: $("#sortable").sortable({ revert: true, accept: '.control', receive: function(event, ui) { // here i need to get draggable element id } }); I have tried various ui.id etc which doesn't seem to work. receive: function(event, ui) { $(ui.draggable).attr("id") } throws undefined . Update : Sorry, my fault :) As my mother used to tell - "Read API before coding". ui.item.attr('id') works fine.
