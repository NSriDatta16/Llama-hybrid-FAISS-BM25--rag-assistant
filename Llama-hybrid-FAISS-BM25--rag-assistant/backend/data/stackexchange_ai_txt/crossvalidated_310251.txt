Tuning density in Gelfand-Dey estimator (Reciprocal Importance Sampling) of Marginal Likelihood

If y denotes the data and (t,L) denotes set of parameters, then the marginal likelihood is Here, is a proper prior, f(y|t,L) denotes the (conditional) likelihood, m(y) is used to denote the marginal likelihood of data y and g(t,L) is a proper tuning density for the parameter t and L . The Gelfand-Dey estimator of marginal likelihood is expressed as , where is set of MCMC draws from posterior distribution . [Reference : Gelfand and Dey (1994)] Now t has a support on and L has support over the permutation space of {1,2,..., M }. Here M is a positive integer (e.g., M = 200, 300 etc). Tuning density g(t,L) can be assumed as and prior can be assumed as . Question: I am struggling to fix a tuning density for L . Can anybody please help me in this ? I have assumed a discrete uniform prior for L over the permutation space of {1,2,..., M }. Is there any better alternative ? If possible, can you suggest me some other method of marginal likelihood estimation to tackle this problem ?
