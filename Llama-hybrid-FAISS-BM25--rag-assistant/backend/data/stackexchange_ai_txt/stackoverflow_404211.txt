You could try applying a style that sets the display to something other than none, for example: .drop { display: block; // or inline } This sounds like its being caused by IE's need for the element to "have layout" in order to do certain operations on it, hiding being one of them. Elements given a display type of block should have layout, that is, it occupies space and forces the browser to reorganize sibling elements around it.
