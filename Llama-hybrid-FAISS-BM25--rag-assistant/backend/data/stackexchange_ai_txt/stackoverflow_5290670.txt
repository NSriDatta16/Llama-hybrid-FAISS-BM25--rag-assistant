The error appears to be appDelegate.dayList . It is telling you that it can't find a property called dayList in your application delegate. Did you add a property for it, or is it just an instance variable? Did this show up as a warning when you built? The compiler should have caught this for you. It's always a good idea to pay attention (and fix!) compiler warnings. Just because Xcode lets you ignore them and run your app anyway, doesn't mean you should. :)
