Thanks to the update question it's a simple as: preg_match('/(\(\w+\)) (\w+)H?/', $str, $matches); Usage: $str = "The Bet with the Tote 525 (A6) 525y"; print_r($matches); outputs: Array ( [0] => (A6) 525y [1] => (A6) [2] => 525y ) or: $str = "The Bet with the Tote (Starter race) Some more info (A6) 525y"; print_r($matches); outputs: Array ( [0] => (A6) 525y [1] => (A6) [2] => 525y ) Although I personally prefer the elegance if the explode method, it then would require and extra condition and possible operation to remove the trailing H.
