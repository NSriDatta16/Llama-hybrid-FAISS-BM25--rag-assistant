In regular expressions, the values you get returned are those in parentheses: /([a-z]+)-#(\d+)/.exec("abc-#123") // ["abc-#123", "abc", "123"] You can just make the groups non-matching by adding ?: at the start of it: /(?:[a-z]+)-#(\d+)/.exec("abc-#123") // ["abc-#123", "123"] Edit after re-reading your question. The return from the regex will contain (as shown in my examples above) the entire matched string, then the matched groups. If you want just the matched groups, just slice off the first value: myRegex.exec(userAgent).slice(1); // ["webkit", "525.13"]
