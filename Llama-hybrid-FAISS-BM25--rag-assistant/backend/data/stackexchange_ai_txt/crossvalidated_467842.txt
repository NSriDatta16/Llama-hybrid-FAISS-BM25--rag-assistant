In Bayesian statistics does posterior probability become prior probability when new observation is made?

First you have prior probability say 50% . When observation is made we use that to update our prior probability = posterior probability 66%. If another observation is made our prior probability 66% which we would update with new observation right? and we continue this process? I just want to clarify if my understanding it correct.
