Global data across MVC controller

I have number of action methods in my controller that retrieve data from web services or database. Along them there are other action methods in the same controller that use that data. As I would love to prevent unnecessary data retrieval I'd like to know what would be the best practice to share that data with the other methods without using cookies or sessions? Is it acceptable to use global properties in the controller?
