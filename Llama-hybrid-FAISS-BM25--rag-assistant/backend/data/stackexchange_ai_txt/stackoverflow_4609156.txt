C# Multi Replace Idea

I know the want for a "multi replace" in C# is no new concept, there are tons of solutions out there. However, I haven't came across any elegant solution that jives well with Linq to Sql. My proposal is to create an extension method (called, you guessed it, MultiReplace) that returns a lambda expression which chains multiple calls of Replace together. So in effect you would have the following: x => x.SomeMember.MultiReplace("ABC", "-") // Which would return a compiled expression equivalent to: x => x.SomeMember.Replace("A", "-").Replace("B", "-").Replace("C", "-") I'd like your thoughts/input/suggestions on this. Even if it turns out to be a bad idea, it still seems like a wicked opportunity to dive into expression trees. Your feedback is most appreciated. -Eric
