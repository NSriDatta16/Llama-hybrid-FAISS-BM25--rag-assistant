I wouldn't really try altering the algorithm itself, it's probably moot for this application anyway. From what I see there are two options: Just re-shuffle until you get an even permutation. This would probably throw away half a permutation on average (well, maybe a little more), but the extra work is very likely negligible. Shuffle the board by using the game's moves itself. That is, just do a few hundred random moves. Since you're not taking all pieces out and re-assembling them you can't generate a state that's impossible to solve.
