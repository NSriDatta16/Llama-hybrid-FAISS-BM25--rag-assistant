I fear that there exist some notational differences across different sub-disciplines of statistics. Let me stick to a pragmatic, non-technical notation quite commonly used in Econometrics. Further, in my answer let me add point 5. to the list above, denoting semi-parametric regression models. As an illustrative example consider the case of an additive regression model with response $Y$, regression function $g(X)$ and error process $U$, \begin{equation} Y=g(X)+U \end{equation} Usually we distinguish between 1. linear and 2. non-linear regression functions , where "linearity" refers to linearity-in-parameters. Common examples used in Econometrics are $g(X)=\beta_0+\beta_1 X$ $g(X)=\beta_0X^{\beta_1}$ Now both cases 1. and 2., respectively, can be present in 3. parametric and 5. semi-parametric regression models . A prominent example of 3. is $U \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, while case 5. is present if we do not wish to impose a parametric assumption about the distribution of $U$. Finally, the regression function $g(X)$ may not contain parameters. If in addition we do not wish to impose a parametric assumption about the distribution of $U$ we have a 4. non-parametric regression model. Remarks . As noted above there are different perceptions on how to define a non- or a semi-parametric model. Further, in case of non-additive regressions notational distinction becomes even more complicated. A now classical text trying to clarify the discussion is "Econometric Foundations" by Mittelhammer, Judge and Miller (2000, Cambridge Univ. Press).
