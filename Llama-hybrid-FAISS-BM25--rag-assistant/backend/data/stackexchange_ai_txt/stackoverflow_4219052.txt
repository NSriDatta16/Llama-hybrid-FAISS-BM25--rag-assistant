I recommend FullCalendar jQuery plugin. It gives you very nice JavaScript calendar with drag&drop support. You can use your own CSS style. On the server side create symfony actions that will return data to FullCalendar API. Just serialize the data to JSON Event Object . Of course you should use symfony security component to restrict read/write access. Show only those events that users should be able to see. And don't let them access write actions if they don't have write permission. To manage event data you can either create backend admin module or display your own form when user click on calendar (like Google Calendar does). If you like the second approach then you have to handle it in JavaScript.
