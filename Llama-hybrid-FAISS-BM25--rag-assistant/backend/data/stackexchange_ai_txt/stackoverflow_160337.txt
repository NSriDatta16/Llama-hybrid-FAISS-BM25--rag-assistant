I recently saw a variation on ternary operators (well, sort of) that make the standard "() ? :" variant seem to be a paragon of clarity: var Result = [CaseIfFalse, CaseIfTrue][(boolean expression)] or, to give a more tangible example: var Name = ['Jane', 'John'][Gender == 'm']; Mind you, this is JavaScript, so things like that might not be possible in other languages (thankfully).
