nnUNet is a successful procedure for automatic hyperparameter tuning and optimization of UNets (neural segmentation models), which applies the suggested method, https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10486 : "For the test cases we use the five networks obtained from our training set cross-validation as an ensemble to further increase the robustness of our models." I don't believe they claim it's optimal, but maybe the approach has more merit for deep neural nets than for random forest models?
