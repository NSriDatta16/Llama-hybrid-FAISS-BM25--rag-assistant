Best general-purpose digest function?

When writing an average new app in 2009, what's the most reasonable digest function to use, in terms of security and performance? (And how can I determine this in the future, as conditions change?) When similar questions were asked previously, answers have included SHA1, SHA2, SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5, bCrypt, and Blowfish. I realize that to a great extent, any one of these could work, if used intelligently, but I'd rather not roll a dice and pick one randomly. Thanks.
