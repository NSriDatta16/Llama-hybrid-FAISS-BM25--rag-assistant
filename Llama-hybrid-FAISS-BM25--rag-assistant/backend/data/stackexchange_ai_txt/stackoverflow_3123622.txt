How would you structure, or the best way to structure the code in PHP?

i want to know the best way (faster and better) to structure the code in PHP. Some people save a Master Class with functions, sub-classes and var's into an unique global variable, like $modx CMS case. What are your structure techniques? And how do you connect to your DB? Do you all prefer PHP Frameworks like PHPCake? How do you structure Plubic vars (configuration) and Private vars (temporary or program running vars)? The reason for my questions is that i wan't start programming staticly, with a strong base. Currently i'm programming with ModX framework/CMS. NOTE: Please justify each time you vote -1 on a answer! Thanks in Advance (Sorry for my poor English)
