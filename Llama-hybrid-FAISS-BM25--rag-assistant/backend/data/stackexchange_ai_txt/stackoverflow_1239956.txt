Dougle thanks a lot, that was really helpful! Fede in Magento CMS you can make static pages that you can only access using its IDENTIFIER; what I wanted is somehow make a menu that will automatically display the ACTIVE (enabled) static pages; and if you set status to Disable it should not be in the menu; here is the code i used, note there is IF $PageData['identifier']!='no-route'; no-rute is the 404 page, so i don't need it in the menu, but it must be enabled so Magento redirects 404 errors to this page; getCollection()->addStoreFilter(Mage::app()->getStore()->getId());?> getSelect() ->where('is_active = 1'); ?> getData(); ?> ">
