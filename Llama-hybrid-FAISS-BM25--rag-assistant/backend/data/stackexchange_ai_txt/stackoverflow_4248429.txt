Applescript - drag/drop file attachment to open new email

Anyone know the Applescript snip that will open a new email with the file attachment that has been dragged/dropped on the Applescript script? (Google hasn't been a help.) I've found commands that open a new email and prompt for the file attachment, set theAttachment to (choose file without invisibles) and snips that allow hardcoding the path to the attachment, set theAttachment to (((path to desktop) as string) & "myFile.jpg) as alias but none that allow dragging and dropping of the file attachment on the Applescript script icon. Edit 11/28/10: Found and answer MacScripter / AppleScript | OS X and added it below.
