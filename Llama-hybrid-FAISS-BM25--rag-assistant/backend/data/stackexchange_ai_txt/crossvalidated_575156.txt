Which statistics test should I use?

Group High is a year in which there was a high temperature change and group Low is a year in which there was a low temperature change. The classes represent an the percentage of coverage for a species on a plate. E.g. class 0 = 0% growth, class 4 = 50-75% growth, class 6 = >75% growth. (I will not compare an amount of temperature change to an amount of growth) I need to know if there is a significant difference between group High and group Low. Which statistical test can I use? Both of my variables are categorical, right? I use R studio and Excel.
