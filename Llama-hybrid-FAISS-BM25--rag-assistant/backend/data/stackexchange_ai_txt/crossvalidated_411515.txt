Logistic Regression in R with different results when I want interaction effect

My dependent variable is Accuracy (that takes 1 or 0 for right and wrong). My IVs are Emotion (Sad, Happy; coded as 1,2 respectively), Load (high or low coded as 1,2 respectively) and Group (Group A and Group B; coded as 1,2 respectively). I'm running a logistic regression in R using the following formula: model1 summary(model1) gives me a result that I can interpret. However, I notice that the Emotion and Group variables are followed by a number: I'm new to logistic regression, but I'm not sure why its giving a specific result for an emotion. Why does it say emotion2 instead of emotion ? Usually, in ANOVA, I get a simple effect of IVs and then I look inside to know the sub-factors affecting the DV. Why is this different? Moreover, I'm interested in knowing the interaction effect. So, I executed another command: model11 summary(model11) gives me something completely different. I had expected that the main effect will be the same for the two models ( model1 and model11 ), but this is not the case. Can anyone explain why this is the case?
