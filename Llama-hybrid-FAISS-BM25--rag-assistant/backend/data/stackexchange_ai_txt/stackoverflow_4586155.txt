The best results I know of are achieved with ImageOptim , which I use myself for PNGs that are not deployed via Xcode. It uses pngcrush and some other PNG optimization tools to achieve best compression. As far as I know, it doesn't employ alpha premultiplication and byte swapping though. ImageOptim also has a nice GUI with drag-and-drop support and can crush multiple files simultaneously.
