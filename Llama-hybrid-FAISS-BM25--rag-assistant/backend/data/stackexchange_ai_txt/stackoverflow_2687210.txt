gcc memory alignment pragma

Does gcc have memory alignment pragma, akin #pragma vector aligned in Intel compiler? I would like to tell compiler to optimize particular loop using aligned loads/store instructions. to avoid possible confusion, this is not about struct packing. e.g: #if defined (__INTEL_COMPILER) #pragma vector aligned #endif for (int a = 0; a Thanks
