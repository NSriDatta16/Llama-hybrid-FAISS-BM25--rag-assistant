It is possible to have what you're now stuck with in Excel exported as the appropriate .resx files. There are many ways to do this, depending on your version of Excel. If you're up for (more) manual labor, you can just create the required .resx files in Visual Studio and do some copy and pasting. Having .resx files automatically generated from a view requires some kind of tooling. There are Visual Studio add-ins that will do this for you; Resource Refactoring Tool is one of them (I think ReSharper has similar capabilities too). Extracting texts to resources automatically would be a bit impractical and would lead to resource keys that are automatically generated and not very intelligible. Doing this manually will yield the best result. When you're extracting text fragments to resources, I can recommend that you put all .resx files into a separate assembly so the resource texts can be used across several assemblies, in error messages, exceptions, etc. This requires them to be global, of course.
