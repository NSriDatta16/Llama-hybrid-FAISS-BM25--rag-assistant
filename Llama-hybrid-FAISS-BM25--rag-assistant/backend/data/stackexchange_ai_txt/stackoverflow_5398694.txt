First off, one of my rules of thumb when building UI panels is to never set directly any location or size. Then, a second rule is to never set any preferred, minimum or maximum size directly in pixels (thus will bite you when you change from one monitor to another one, with higher or lower DPI resolution). Take a look at this post on my blog, quite old but still useful today. Thirdly, I try to avoid embedding panels into panels because it leads to components alignment problems and inconsistent component sizes. Finally, I try to use DesignGridLayout for most of my forms, and sometimes revert to GridBagLayout if the UI layout is too complex (but a complex UI layout may also be a sign of poor UI design). As a general comment about how to build UI applications (with any UI toolkit in general, but with Swing in particular), there are several recommendations that exist out there, but it is hard to find concrete implementations, you have to read a lot about these, and then try to find the way that works best for you.
