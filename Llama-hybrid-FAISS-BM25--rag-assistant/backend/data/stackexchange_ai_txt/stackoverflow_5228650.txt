How can I use sub attribute (or) nested attribute

I am building a site using Magento. I have to use nested / sub attributes. Is it possible in magento? My requirement: I have an attribute set as "Art Style‚Äù. Under this there are 4 attributes. 1. Fine Art, 2. Decorative art, 3. Vintage Art, 4. Photography. Again in Fine art I have these categories: a. Era, b. Movement, c. Nationality. How can I achieve this.I already have categories and subcategories (Abstract, Animals, Architecture etc.) for my products.
