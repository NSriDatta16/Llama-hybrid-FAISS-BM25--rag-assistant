Weighted Least Squares Estimate

Here is a problem from a practice test. Suppose that $$X_i = \mu + \epsilon_i,\quad i=1,\ldots,n\quad \epsilon_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2_1)$$ $$Y_i = \mu + \delta_i,\quad i=1,\ldots,m\quad \delta_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2_2)$$ All $\epsilon_i$'s and $\delta_i$'s are independent. The paramters $\mu, \sigma_1^2, $ and $\sigma_2^2$ are unknown. Let $\theta=m/n$, $\rho=\sigma_2^2/\sigma_1^2$. Suppose $\rho$ is known. Show that the least squares (weighted) estimator of $\mu$ is $$ \hat{\mu} = \dfrac{\rho\bar{X} + \theta\bar{Y}}{\rho+\theta}$$ MY ATTEMPT: I can't figure out how to use the fact that $\rho$ is known. I tried $$\hat{\mu} = \text{argmin}\left\{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\mu)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^m (Y_i-\mu)^2\right\}$$ and arrived that the weighted averaged $$ \hat{\mu} = \dfrac{n\bar{X} + m\bar{Y}}{n+m}$$ But again this does not use the fact that we know what the ratio $\sigma_2^2/\sigma_1^2$ is. Any ideas?
