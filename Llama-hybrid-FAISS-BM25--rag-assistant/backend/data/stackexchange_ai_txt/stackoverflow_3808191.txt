Fixed, it was quite simple actually. I just needed to use the appendTo option on the draggable so that the helper is appended to element where I want it to drag around (e.g. #page, a div that encompasses my page). This removes it from the dialog (which has an "overflow: auto" property, which adds scrollbars to extend the canvas so that the drag element is always within) and appends it to the #page element. The only problem was my dialog had a pretty high zIndex, so I just incremented the zIndex option to be higher. var draggableArguments={ revert: 'invalid', helper:'clone', appendTo: '#page', containment: 'DOM', zIndex: 1500, addClasses: false } theObject.draggable(draggableArguments);
