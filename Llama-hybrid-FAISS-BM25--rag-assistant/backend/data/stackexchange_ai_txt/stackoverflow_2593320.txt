Why does Coded UI Test Builder show MSAA for WPF controls instead of UIA

Question When I select a WPF control with the crossline of the Visual Studio 2010 Coded UI Test Builder ( screenshots ), it shows that the used accessibility technology was MSAA. Why is it not UIA? Additional information I am trying out the new Coded UI Test feature shipped with VS2010 and TFS2010. I know that there are basically two UI accessibility technology from Microsoft: Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) : Older technology, COM Microsoft UI Automation (UIA) : Newer technology, part of .NET 3.0, object model based When I create a Coded UI Test and have a look at the generated code, I see that controls are clicked on based on pixel positions, instead of --what I would boldly expect-- handles to real objects. I assume that kind of access makes the tests more fragile to relocation of UI elements. Whereas the tests would be more stable if UIA would be at work; as long as I don't change the UI tree, nothing should break. What did I get wrong?
