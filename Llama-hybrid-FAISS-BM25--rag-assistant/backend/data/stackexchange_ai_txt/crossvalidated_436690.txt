How to determine statistical significance of physics dataset?

I am working on a physics paper, which looks at the dependence of resistivity on physical temperature. I obtained data showing a linear trend of the form $$\rho(T)=\rho_0[1+\alpha(T-T_0)]$$ Based on my data, I can calculate an average value for $\alpha$ , as well as uncertainty, but I do not know how to obtain a p-value for the data. At the high end, the correlation is positive, but I hypothesized a negative correlation. How do I determine if my results for $\alpha$ are statistically significant? Here is the full paper if that helps.
