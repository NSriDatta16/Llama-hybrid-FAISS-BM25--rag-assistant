What's embedding the data in the page? Either it should read it as text (in UTF-8) and then write it out again in the web page's encoding (Win-1255) or you should change the Java program to create the files (or whatever) in Win-1255 to start with. If you can give more details about how the system works (what's generating the web page? How does it interact with the Java program?) then it will make things a lot clearer.
