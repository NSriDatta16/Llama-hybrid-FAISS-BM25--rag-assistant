In general, you have a correct setup: myApp-servlet.xml should contain directly webapp-related beans myApp-context.xml should contain the business logic beans (e.g. DAOs, entitlements utilities) As for the reason, why your webapp-related beans are loaded twice - dunno. They should not be loaded twice . Maybe you are reading the log wrong ? Maybe there is some configuration mistake that is not obvious from the configuration snippets you provided (full web.xml , myApp-servlet.xml and myApp-context.xml would be useful)?
