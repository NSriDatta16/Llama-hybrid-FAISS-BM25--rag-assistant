Most of the time, choice of language won't affect a product, but there are a hand full of well-known case studies where language choice decides whether a project sinks or swims. For example: 1) Paul Graham's article Beating the Averages credits the choice of Lisp as the reason why he could consistently out-compete competitors developing their similar apps in C++. 2) This very well-known comparison of two web servers, Apache written in C and Yaws written in Erlang , comparing how they handle many concurrent connections. Apache dies after 4000 concurrent connections, but Erlang keeps chugging along with no degredation in response time with 80000 concurrent connections. Yaws performs so well because Erlang was designed from the ground up with high availability, concurrency, and scalability in mind. Due to its high scalability, telecommunications companies like Nortel and Verizon choose to write their call routing software in Erlang rather than C. 3) MUMPS in just about anything. 4) A wonderful Google Tech talk by Rob Pike explains how he designed a language from the ground up to make it easy to write windowing systems for early generation operating systems.
