Auto-generate detail fields in ASP.NET

Is there anyway to auto-generate ASP.NET controls based on fields in a SQLDataSource? It is really easy to create a form in WinForms by dragging the fields onto the form. You can even determine which control will be used (like a dropdown). Is there anyway to do this in ASP.NET? I don't want a DetailsView since I need to have separate controls that are created.
