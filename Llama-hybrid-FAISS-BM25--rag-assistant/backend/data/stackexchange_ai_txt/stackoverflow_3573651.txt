1) I don't know ASP or IIS, so I can't help you here. I store images on Amazon S3, but I don't know if that's relevant to your case. 2) Try to organize photos based on their model, then ID. So if images are user avatar images, your path would look like avatars/ID/image. 3) If you create multiple images of different sizes, try assigning a name to each size. For instance, you have "original" image, "thumbnail" image (90x90), and "preview" image (400*300). This way you can store the different sizes either like avatars/ID/image_SIZE or avatars/ID/SIZE/image. 4) If you are following the way I mentioned, then you only need to store information for the original image in your DB, and from that you can derive all other images at runtime. All those points are from the amazing PaperClip plugin for Ruby on Rails. Take a look at it for further guidance on how they store files and attachments.
