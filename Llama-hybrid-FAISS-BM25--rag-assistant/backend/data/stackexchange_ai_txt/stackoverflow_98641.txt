Benefits of learning scheme?

I've just started one of my courses, as classes just began 2 weeks ago, and we are learning Scheme right now in one for I assume some reason later on, but so far from what he is teaching is basically how to write in scheme. As I sit here trying to stay awake I'm just trying to grasp why I would want to know this, and why anyone uses it. What does it excel at? Next week I plan to ask him, whats the goal to learn here other than just how to write stuff in scheme.
