It took me a little while to figure this out because I hadn't done it with a formula before, but I found that if toggle the field code for your page numbers in your footer, you'll see the actual formula it is using to show your page numbers, and it should look something like {PAGE}. If you pay close attention, you'll notice that the {} are in bold. What I did to manipulate these page numbers via a formula, I hit CTRL+F9 to get the bold curly brackets, then =, then CTRL+F9 to get another set of curly brackets and typed PAGE inside of those, then after it I typed * 2, then I surrounded {PAGE} * 2 in parenthesis. It resulted in something that looks like this: {=({PAGE}*2)}. The final document has only even page numbers that follow that forumla: 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. Hopefully that helps you in your quest.
