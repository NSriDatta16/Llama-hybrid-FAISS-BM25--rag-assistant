Regression With Mean Rates?

Today, I was looking at the National Census data in my country. In my country, we have something very similar to "States" (Divisions) and "ZIP Codes" (Subdivisions). During the Census, data is collected from each Subdivision and - for example, based on a 20% random sample in each Subdivision, information is collected such income, employment rate, age, etc. However, when this data is published, we can only see the average and median value for each of these variables within each Subdivision. We also know the number of people within each Subdivision. The data would look something like this: Division Subdivision Average_Income Median_Income Average_Age Median_Age Subdivision_Population 1 A 1 51265.41 48585.45 52 42 10698 2 A 2 51067.56 49606.41 46 62 9781 3 A 3 48662.40 49297.64 34 37 10217 4 B 1 50097.79 49819.19 53 40 10257 5 B 2 50855.28 49005.76 70 53 9912 6 C 1 51002.73 49697.60 67 50 10225 7 C 2 48742.88 50573.90 49 52 9871 8 C 3 50831.21 50410.04 38 40 9945 9 C 4 50649.13 46939.21 71 63 11214 I was interested in learning about if Regression Models can still be applied in such a context (i.e. when individual subject-level data is not provided and only the aggregate level data is provided). As an example, study the impact of income on age. Initially, I had thought that perhaps I could just "get away with" using a standard Linear Regression Model as if I had access to the individual subject-level data. However, when reading more about this topic, I learned of a new topic called "Ecological Statistics" (the name was a bit misleading - I thought "Ecological Statistics" was about Statistics applied in the Environment). I found some interesting references which show why a standard Linear Regression Model can NOT be used in such a context: http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/courses/508/old/2012/L24.pdf http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ecological.pdf In general, I was interested in learning more about what types of Statistical and Regression Models can be used for problems such as mine. For example, in the problem I described, I do NOT have access to the Standard Errors - is it still possible to create a Regression Model for this problem and generate meaningful estimates for the beta-coefficients? Or could I still fit a regression model to the entire data and find the mean effect of income on age?
