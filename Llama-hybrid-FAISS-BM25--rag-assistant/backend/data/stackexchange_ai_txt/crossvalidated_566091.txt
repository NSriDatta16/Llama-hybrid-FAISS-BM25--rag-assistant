Do you train on dev sets before obtaining test performance for academic papers?

For hackathons or some shared task events, people train their models on dev sets as well to obtain the highest test performance possible. However, I am unclear if this practice is the norm for test performances reported on academic papers as well. Specifically, for BERT's paper, they report test set results on the GLUE benchmark. I want to know if BERT was trained on train + dev or train only.
