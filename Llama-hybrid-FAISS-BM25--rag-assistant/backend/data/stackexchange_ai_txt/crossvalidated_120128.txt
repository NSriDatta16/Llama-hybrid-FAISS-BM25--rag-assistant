Note that this is different from regression, since there is NO additive error term, i.e. f and g are both deterministic functions of X. On the other hand it seems to differ from (plain vanilla) function approximation, since I have an underlying probability space and need to do some sort of statistical estimation. Actually there is always an additive error term. By definition it's the difference between $f$ and $g$ at some value of $X$. Perhaps you mean that it's not distributed according to some convenient function, or not constant across $X$, or something like that. All those may be true, but none of them stop you using a regression framework - that is, thinking of $g$ as a model of the expected value of $f$, i.e. a model of $E[f(X)]$. This has a lot of optimality properties even without assuming a convenient distribution for the errors, as any econometrics textbook will expound at length. Which regression framework you use is a further, more interesting question. For your purposes the linear additive approach of basic textbooks is probably not going to do so well unless your $X$'s are very carefully chosen. The non-linear extensions of this approach e.g. Gaussian Processes, splines, GAMs etc. assume that $E[f(X)]$ changes smoothly (if not necessarily linearly) with changes in X. This might work for you, but I'd also guess not. A potentially interesting alternative would be to use some kind of decision tree approach e.g. CART, which recursively partitions X on the assumption that discontinuities in $E[f(X)]$ occur over boundaries in elements of X. The limiting case of both of these approaches is a saturated dummy variable regression model that is, on the one hand linear again, but on the other, requires more data than you have got to fit. The best advice is to try a bunch and maybe average their predictions. Performance will depend on how well the bias of the methods you use e.g. X-aligned discontinuities, vs. smoothness, fit the actual $X\rightarrow E[f(X)]$ function. But there's nothing in principle problematic in thinking of this as a regression problem.
