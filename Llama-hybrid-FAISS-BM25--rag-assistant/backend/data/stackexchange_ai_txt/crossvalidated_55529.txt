(All credit goes to Robert Shriver , I'm just posting this for him!) This is not an analytic solution, but I think that out of all the iterative solutions this ones' the nicest: Take the mean regression parameters (intercept and slope) for both regressions (f1 and f2) along with the variance-covariance matrix of the intercept and slope parameters for each regression and plug them into a Multivariate normal distribution to simulate some new intercepts and slopes. nn This will be 10,000 random draws of the slope and intercept parameters for each regression. Use each one of these to determine the mean value of z across the range of x values you are interest in. f1a Then you can find the lower and upper CI of z as well as its mean by finding the .025 and .975 quantile of z at each x value. setquantile That's it. Please let me know if you find something better. Hope this helped someone!
