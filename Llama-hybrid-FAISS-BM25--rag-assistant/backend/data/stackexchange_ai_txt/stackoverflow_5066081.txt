eCommerce apps in iPhone

I have seen the in-app purchrasing programming guide for apple. But it is mandatory to pay a 30% for any e-commerce? e-commerce is different than "in-app content" -it is not an additional feature for the application- For example, if I want to sell potatoes, this is not an app feature, it is a physical product... if I have to give a 30% of that sell to Apple... those potatoes will be VERY expensive to the consumer... By the other way, I've seen apps that do not use apple's system, like: unicef zara magento amazon amazon kindle So do they have a special contract with apple or there are other ways to do so, isn't it? Thanks and best regards
