Embedding Sitemap Meta Tag on Free Wordpress Blog

I have a free wordpress blogging account and I have a domain from GoDaddy which is forwarding to my wordpress blog. I want to use Google's sitemap which requires me to add the meta tag in my wordpress page. In Google Webmaster tools or Yahoo's, if I use mysite.wordpress.com and get the meta tag in the blog, it works, but if I use my domain name like mysite.com, then it doesn't get verified. How come?
