On Haiku Village , we have the technology to easily do this in a variety of ways. One idea is to simply read the global twitter feed, and detect unintentional haikus. Since the back-end also has a dictionary, it would be possible to produce questionable haikus, but I think the quality would be lacking. I think if we had a star rating system, then I suppose machine learning could be used to decide what is 'good'.
