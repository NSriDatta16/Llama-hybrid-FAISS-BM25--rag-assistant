Problems when deploying small .NET 3.5 apps

I wrote some small apps using .NET 3.5 but now I am stuck with deployment problems. My customer will likely to be pissed off when he learns that he will have to download a 231megs dependency ( .NET framework 3.5 ) which installs for 30 minutes (!!!) on an average machine. All, just to run my tiny apps. Offline distribution is also problematic, since the customer wants the program to fit on a Mini CD (185 mega bytes maximum) What can I do? I really like .NET, but now I feel hopeless. With almost any other choice (c,c++,python) I would have saved this headache. update : this is small data processing software and mostly deployed in offline situations on nettops. I can't host is from the net.
