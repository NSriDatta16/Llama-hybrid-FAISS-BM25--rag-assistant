PerformancePoint, SharePoint 2010 and JQuery

Are there any events that PerformancePoint Dashboards emit after loading data that can be leveraged by JQuery. The document.ready fires before the performancepoint dashboard has rendered so that doesn't help. I need for the performancepoint dashboard to render so I can then use JQuery to manipulate the dashboard.
