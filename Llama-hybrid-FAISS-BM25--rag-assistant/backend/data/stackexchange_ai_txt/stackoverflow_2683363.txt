From everything I've ever heard, it is no kind of "best practice" to make website calls from anywhere "within" the database, and making a web call from within a trigger makes me flinch [latency, delays, blocking, deadlocks... oog]. Databases make great back-ends, but very poor front-ends. You're probably much, much better off having a dedicated application do your web-and-database coordination. Wiring something into a SQL Agent call might work, but note that there is no "native" way to call a website from within a job step. They probably designed it that way on purpose.
