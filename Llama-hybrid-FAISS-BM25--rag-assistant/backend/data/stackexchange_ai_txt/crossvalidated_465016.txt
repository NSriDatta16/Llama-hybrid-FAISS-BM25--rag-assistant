If you use the arima function in R and set d = 2 that will be the same as differencing the original time series twice. From R documentation you can see in the arima specification d is the degree of differencing of the non-seasonal part. It means how many times you need to differentiate the ARIMA series for making the series stationary. By d = 2 you're telling the arima function to take the difference of the original data twice. "order A specification of the non-seasonal part of the ARIMA model: the three integer components (p, d, q) are the AR order, the degree of differencing, and the MA order."
