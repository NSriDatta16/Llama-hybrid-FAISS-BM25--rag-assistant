Deep Neural Network Model in sklearn Pipeline

Is it possible to add a deep neural network model as the estimator/model in an sklearn Pipeline ? or is it only possible for ML models as the estimator. For example, can I have a transformation pipeline (that consists of some Imputers or Encoders) then followed by an LSTM or CNN model as the final estimator. If so, can someone guide me as to how to go about creating something like that. (using either resources or examples)
