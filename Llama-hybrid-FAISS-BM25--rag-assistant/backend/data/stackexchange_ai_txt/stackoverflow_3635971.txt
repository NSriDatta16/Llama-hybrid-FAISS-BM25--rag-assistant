What are ISO languages?

It's in fact 3 questions : What is required for a programming language to be certified "ISO" ? What does ISO certification guarantee about the language? Does other language can be the same? A list of ISO languages? (made community wiki - not sure about the organisation, maybe the first answer should be edited to have the full ISO languages list?)
