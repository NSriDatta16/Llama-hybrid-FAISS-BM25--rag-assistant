time series Diebold-Mariano Test n-ahead forecast in R

I have a question about "h" in dm.test & DM.test from package forecast & multDM, assume I set a ARIMA model to forecast n-ahead = 20 (using dynamic regression not one step forecast), so taht when I use DM.test which "h" should I define? I have read this article , seems when the n-step forecast should choose h = n^1/3 + 1 (I'm not understand about this), where n is sample = 20 ; h = 4. Then want to Know in DM.test why can't choose h = 20 ? (the output is "NA") I copy the data from this article Actual statistic = 1.0302, forecast horizon = 4, p-value = 0.3029 (very close) It's close to the article anwser, but when I using h = 20, the output return "NA" statistic = NaN, forecast horizon = 20, p-value = NA even h = 13 statistic = NaN, forecast horizon = 13, p-value = NA What does the "h" mean? I have confused about example dm.test. The example uses 80% as the training model, 20% as the test model with one-step-forecast, sets "h" = 1; however, if I use it in prediction n.step-forecast , what kind of "h" should I select? one-step-forecast f1 n-step-forecast f1 $mean , WWWusage[81:100]-f2.out$ mean , h= 20) DM = 0, Forecast horizon = 20, Loss function power = 2, p-value = 1 what is rule to select h when the example "forecast(f2,h=20)"?
