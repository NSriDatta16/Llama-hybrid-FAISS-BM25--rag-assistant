Select all DIV text with single mouse click

How to highlight/select the contents of a DIV tag when the user clicks on the DIV...the idea is that all of the text is highlighted/selected so the user doesn't need to manually highlight the text with the mouse and potentially miss a bit of the text? For example, say we've got a DIV as below: http://example.com/page.htm ...and when the user clicks on any of that URL the whole URL text is highlighted so they can easily drag the selected text around in the browser, or copy the complete URL with a right click. Thanks!
