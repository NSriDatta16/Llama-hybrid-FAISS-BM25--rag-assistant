In general, if you really mean to allow any kind of file to be uploaded, I'd recommend: A minimal type check using mime magic numbers that the extension of the file corresponds to the given one (though this doesn't solve much if you are not going to limit the kinds of files that can be uploaded). Better yet, have an antivirus (free clamav for example) check the file after uploading. On storage, I always prefer to use the filesystem for what it was created: storing files. I would not recommend storing files in the database (suposing a relational database). You can store the metadata of the file on the database and a pointer to the file on the file system. Generate a unique id for the file and you can use a 2-level directory structure to store the data: E.g: Id=123456 => /path/to/store/12/34/123456.data Said that, this can vary depending on what you want to store and how do you want to manage it. It's not the same to service a document repository, a image gallery or a simple "shared directory"
