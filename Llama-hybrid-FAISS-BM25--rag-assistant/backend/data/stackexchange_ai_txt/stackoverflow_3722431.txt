Is this possible? Can the SOAP calls be run from a Maven Plugin or does it require a container or something else? Yes, that's possible, you do not require any kind of container to run a SOAP client. If so, what tools should I use to do this? I've read about Apache Axis and have seen that it's capable of building a lot of things from the WSDL itself. Is this the sort of tool I should use? Do Mojos have a built in SOAP executor? I would consider using a JAX-WS stack like JAX-WS RI which is included in Java 6. Much easier and much more elegant. Here are some tutorials to get started: Introducing JAX-WS 2.0 With the Java SE 6 Platform, Part 1 Creating a Simple Web Service and Client with JAX-WS Getting Started with JAX-WS Web Services Developing JAX-WS Web Service Clients In short, use wsimport to generate and compile the web service artifacts needed to connect to the service and use them from the Mojo.
