Detecting the interdependence of autocorrelated sequences

It is easy enough to detect interdependence of two discrete-time white noise sequences - one just takes cross-covariance and compares it with variance. But what if both time series are "non-white", that is, there's long-range autocorrelation (like two Brownian random walks)? I assume one resorts to some kind of whitening, where one can read more about this?
