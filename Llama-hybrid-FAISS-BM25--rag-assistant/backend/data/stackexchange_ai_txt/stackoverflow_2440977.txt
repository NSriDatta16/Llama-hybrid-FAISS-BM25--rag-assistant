In order to display the images, you'll need to have the images on the device (or emulator) - otherwise it wouldn't have the data to know what to display. There are a few ways you can get the images to the device or emulator. The easiest is if you add the images to your Visual Studio project and mark the image files as content that should be copied to the destination folder. Then Visual Studio will copy the image files along with the application file when you go to debug it, which is probably what you want. You'll need to change the path your application is looking for the files in (since they won't be in "/Storage Card" anymore). To get the images on a target (non-emulator) device, you'll probably want to create a Visual Studio Install project, and have it include your exe and the image files (and specify which folder to put the images in when the app is installed). The above is what I've done, and would recommend. But there are other options. One might be to download the images from the web, which might work for both an emulator and devices (but will require you to have the images available on the web, and the emulator and devices to be connected).
