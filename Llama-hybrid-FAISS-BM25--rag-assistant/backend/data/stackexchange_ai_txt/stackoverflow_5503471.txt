R zoo aggregate truncate to: aggregate time series to select last element in specific time interval

I have been reading a few posts here on how I can select the last data point in a specified time interval. My data is 1 minute city moisture readings. The data is extracted from mySQL and saved in a zoo object without a time object. So R has no way of knowing the time interval. But given that I know that the data is 1 minute data can I in any way aggregate the data to select the last data point every 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes etc. I have been reading ?aggregate and ?trunc but I think my situation is a little different because I don't have a date/time-interval column associated with the moisture data. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
