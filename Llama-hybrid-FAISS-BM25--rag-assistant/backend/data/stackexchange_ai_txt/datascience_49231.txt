There could be a number of ways of handling categorical data but what I have seen so far is to create a numeral mapping of the categorical data and then one-hot-encode the mappings to feed into the neural network. If you are working with Keras , you can use the to_categorical function to transform your mappings accordingly. >>> from keras.utils import to_categorical >>> y = [0,1,0,1,1] >>> oh_y = to_categorial(y, num_classes=2) >>> print(oh_y) [[1,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[0,1]] ```
