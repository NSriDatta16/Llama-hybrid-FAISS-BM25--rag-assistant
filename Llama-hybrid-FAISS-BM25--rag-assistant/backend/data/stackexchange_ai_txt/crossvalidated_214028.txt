If the process that generates labels for your data is not random we may assume that there exist an algorithm that (given data) can separate the data better than random guessing. The case may be that the data you have may not be sufficient to explain your independent variable - predict your class labels. As you have mention, some machine learning algorithms (especially when you have lots of data) can benefit from doing feature extraction. What I would do, assuming that you have data labels available prior modelling, is applying an machine learning algorithm (such as random forest) to see if it can be used to fit the data.
