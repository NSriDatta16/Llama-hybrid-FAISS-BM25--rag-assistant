My understanding with one-to-one is that they share identity. That is, when you create a ClasseA, the ClasseB inside of ClasseA will have the same id. There is no explicit reference between the two tables. For sanity, I often use many-to-one, even in the one-to-one scenario, because this creates the foreign key column in the database like you are expecting. I'm not sure about the retrieval issue you are having without a little more information about the code being used to save and load.
