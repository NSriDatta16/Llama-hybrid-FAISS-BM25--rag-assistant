Time serie analysis is easier on stationary data. (more tools) When a time serie is non stationary, you can try to find another time series, linked to the initial one, and which is stationary. In many cases taking the difference will be enough. (Time series integrated with order 1) Sometimes you'll have to take the logarithm before (for instance for financial time series) The reason is that investment returns are in percentage! Just don't forget before doing that, there are also some tools for non stationary data. Sometimes taking the diff or the log return may lead to spurious regressions! Fred
