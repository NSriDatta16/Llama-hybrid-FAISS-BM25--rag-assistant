I think this is a good way to explain the details. I got it from Counterfactuals and Causal Inference by Morgan and Winship, which is a wonderful book. Let's say we are interested in the effect on wages from attending college ( $D$ ). I am not a huge fan of distance, so imagine we had an instrumental variable $Z$ that is a lottery where winners get a voucher worth 25K. Let's assume that 10% of students win and everyone is auto-enrolled in the lottery to simplify things. The LATE estimated by the Wald estimator is the ATE for folks who go to school when they win 25K and don't go to school when they lose (the compliers). There's an intuitive derivation of this here , along with the familiar formula. So far this is pretty standard. Now suppose we have a fancier lottery. Instead of 10% getting an identical 25K voucher, the winners get something random that is uniformly distributed between \$1 and tuition at Harvey Mudd College. $^*$ Now $Z$ is continuous, and let's assume it still satisfies (relevance, monotonicity, and random assignment). An LIV is the limiting case of a component binary IV drawn from $Z$ in which $z′′$ approaches $z′$ for any two values of $Z$ such that $z′′ > z′$ . Each LIV then defines a marginal treatment effect, which is the limiting form of a LATE, in which the IV is an LIV. What does this mean? You could make some LIVs from $Z$ by stratifying the data by the values of $Z$ and then doing the Wald on adjacent strata (zero to one, one to two, etc). Assuming enough data, LIVs could be constructed for each dollar increase in the voucher. Each LIV could then be used to estimate its own LATE, and these LIV-identified LATEs are the MTEs. LATEs and many other average treatment effects can be seen as weighted averages of the fundamental marginal treatment effects. $^*$ I did this in dollar increments, but you could also imagine doing this in pennies or something even more infinitesimal instead. Harvey Mudd was the most expensive college in the US last year in terms of sticker price.
