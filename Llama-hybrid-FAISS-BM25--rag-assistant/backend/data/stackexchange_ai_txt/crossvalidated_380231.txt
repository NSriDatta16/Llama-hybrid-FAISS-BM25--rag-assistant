You might find some results in "OPTIMAL APPROXIMATION WITH SPARSELY CONNECTED DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS" by BÃ¶lcskei et al. ( download ) They have a general approximation theoretic approach to modern networks and show results in approximation quality, also using ReLU etc... From their abstract: "Our central result elucidates a remarkable universality property of neural networks and shows that they achieve the optimum approximation properties of all affine systems combined"
