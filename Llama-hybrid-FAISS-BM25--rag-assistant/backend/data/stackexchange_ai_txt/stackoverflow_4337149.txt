Looking at answers to a similar question , the prospects don't look encouraging. However I did find something despite the relative dearth of activity around JSAPI implementations. Take a look at the Java Wrapper for Cepstral TTS project on Sourceforge . It relies upon the Cepstral TTS engine which is available for several languages and speakers as well versions targeting desktop, mobile and telephony server deployments. Disclosure: I have no relationship to Cepstral nor have I used their products.
