Which is more efficient in mysql, a big join or multiple queries of single table?

I have a mysql database like this Post – 500,000 rows (Postid,Userid) Photo – 200,000 rows (Photoid,Postid) About 50,000 posts have photos, average 4 each, most posts do not have photos. I need to get a feed of all posts with photos for a userid, average 50 posts each. Which approach would be more efficient? 1: Big Join select * from post left join photo on post.postid=photo.postid where post.userid=123 2: Multiple queries select * from post where userid=123 while (loop through rows) { select * from photo where postid=row[postid] }
