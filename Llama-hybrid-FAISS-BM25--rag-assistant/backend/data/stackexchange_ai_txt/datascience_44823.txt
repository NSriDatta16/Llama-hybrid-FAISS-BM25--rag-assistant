How are weights calculated in a feed-forward neural network before they are summed up with bias?

I have read a lot of papers and watched different videos, it seems like they explain how they are summed up with bias before entering the activation function. What I am trying to understand is the whole flow process of data from the matrix all the way through to the output layer. What I am struggling with is how do they gain their initial weight? I have drawn a diagram hoping to explain what I understand so far. Please let me know if I am on the right track and help me understand how weights are calculated.
