What type of regression to use when outcome is integers from 0 to 10

I have an outcome variable that measures "community perception," with responses ranging from $0$ to $10$ . For instance, the outcome variable might represent answers to the question: "In your neighborhood, out of every $10$ people, how many own a car?" I also have three independent variables, which are binary and can take values of $0$ or $1$ . I'm uncertain about the appropriate regression analysis for this scenario. I was considering Poisson regression, as the distribution of the outcome variable doesn't appear to be "bunched up" in either $0$ near $10$ . I've also thought about using Ordinal Logistic Regression, but I'm not sure if it's suitable. Do you have any suggestions about which regression to use?
