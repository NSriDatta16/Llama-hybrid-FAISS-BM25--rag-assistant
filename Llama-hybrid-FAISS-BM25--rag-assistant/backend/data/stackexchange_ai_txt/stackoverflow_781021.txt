It depends on the context and target audience: you're aiming to minimise the thought processes required to answer it. If it's a questionnaire, for instance, you'll probably want to ask in full sentences. An options screen would be targetted to scan-reading (so allow/deny instead of yes/no), while a toolbar (something frequently set/unset) will use a toggle. In any case, I'd err on the side of consistency. For permissions, it's normal to use a heading of Permissions, with a checkbox for Edit users . You could even highlight the permission if it's enabled. This helps keyboard users by only requiring one press of tab instead of two. Just make sure that the click area for the checkbox is large enough. In either case, a two column form is not recommended because it puts the target too far from the description. It also encourages questions like "Allow full control or only some (yes/no)". How about using rows that change from green to red, and show a tick/cross? That can be done in a web-friendly way.
