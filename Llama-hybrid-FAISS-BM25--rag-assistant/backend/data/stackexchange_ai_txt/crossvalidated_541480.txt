Smoothing sensor signals with response times - how to

I have a Sensor (e. g. for temperature) that has a response time ( $t_{99}$ -> this is the time that the sensor needs to give an output of 99 % of the actual value) of let's say 10 seconds. This sensor gives me a value each second (1 Hz). The signal is noisy, but also has peaks which should not be smoothed too much. How would you approach this problem? Is it correct to use the response time as the window size in e. g. simple moving averaging? Is it better to use a Savitzky-Golay filter for preserving the peak sizes? I would probably center the window(?) because it's all done in post processing and is not needed in realtime. How (or is it even reasonable) can I connect the response time to my window size?
