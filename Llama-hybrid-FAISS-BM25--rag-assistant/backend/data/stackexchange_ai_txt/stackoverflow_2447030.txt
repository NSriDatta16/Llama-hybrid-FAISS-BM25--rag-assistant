Finding temporary file storage in Java

So I'm writing a Java application that uses Simple to store data as xml file, but it is hellishly slow with big files when it stores on a network drive compared to on a local hard drive. So I'd like to store it locally before copying it over to the desired destination. Is there some smart way to find a temporary local file storage in Java in a system independent way? E.g. something that returns something such as c:/temp in windows, /tmp in linux, and likewise for other platforms (such as mac). I could use application path but the problem is that the Java application is run from the network drive as well.
