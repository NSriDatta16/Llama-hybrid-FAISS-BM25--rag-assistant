C++ doesn't have and doesn't need an official style. Many organisations impose style guides on their contributors to try to maintain some kind of corporate look and feel; some of these contain snippets of good advice, but many just force you to add strange decorations that seemed like a good idea to someone writing a completely different language in the 1980s. The only really useful advice you'll find amongst the waffle is: Define a consistent way to distinguish types, objects, and some kinds of function (such as accessors and factories), so you'll know to write (for example) Thing thing = GetThing(); without looking the names up. Don't start names with underscores. This is forbidden in some circumstances, and it's simpler and more readable to not do it at all than to worry about exactly when you can. Spare a thought for the poor chap (perhaps you) who has to read and maintain the code in a few years' time. Keep it simple. Use your brain.
