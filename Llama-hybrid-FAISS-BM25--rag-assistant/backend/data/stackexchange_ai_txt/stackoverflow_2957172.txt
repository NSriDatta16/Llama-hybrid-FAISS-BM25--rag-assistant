How to implement scrollbar with thumb for fast scrolling

I need to implement a screen having around 1000 thumbnails. This screen should support gesture based scrolling as well as fast scrolling using a scrollbar with thumb. So if user want to move from page 1 to page 100 he can just drag the thumb and reach there. But there is no such control in Android. There is seek bar but its look and feel is not similar to what I want. I also want to flick and swipe functionality which can be inherited using horizontalscrollbar. So i want to add functionality of horizontal scroolbar as well as of seekbar in my application. But I am facing some issue to sync thumb position with swipe or flick event and also the seekbar thumb look and feel need to be modified. Please suggest some clue.
