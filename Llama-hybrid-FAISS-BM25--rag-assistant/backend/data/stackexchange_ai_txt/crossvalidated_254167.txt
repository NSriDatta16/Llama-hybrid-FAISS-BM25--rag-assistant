Parameter optimization Neural network with small dataset

I have a dataset with 30000 data points. I will use a neural network with resilient backpropagation to train it. I have two parameters to set for the resilient backprogation algorithm. I wanted to use a subset of the dataset (use about 1500 data points) to tune the parameters. A validation dataset is included in the 1500 data points. The reason for this is that, tuning paramters with 30000 data points takes about 1 hour and to avoid local mimimum, I have to train it 10 time using different initialization weights. Therefore it will take too much time. Can I use the small part of the dataset to tune the parameters as described above? Is it a good practice?
