Organizing, Storing, and Keeping Track of code for reuse

Many moons ago I started storing my music as MP3’s. I downloaded like mad and just dumped them all into a folder. After collecting thousands of songs I had a big mess. After two years of organizing all music in my free time I have made it to “D” section of my library. I am starting to write code on a daily basis and I would like to keep a lot of what I do for reuse and future reference. I use Visual Studio a lot, and Eclipse sometimes, but I also do web development. Right now I am just have a folder on an external drive called Projects and inside that folder I have code I want to save broken down by its respective IDE and then the language it was developed in. This is working ok right now, but I fear after a few years it might get hard to navigate, and I don’t want another mess like my music library. What are some good ways to keep track of code and programming projects while also promoting easy navigation and future reuse?
