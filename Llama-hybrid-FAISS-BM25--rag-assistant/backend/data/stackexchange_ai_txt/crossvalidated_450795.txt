Using direction of motion as a variable: What do do with undefined/infinite slopes?

I have a list of x,y coordinates representing an object's motion through 2d space. I need to do statistics where I use the direction of motion (slope) as a covariate to my variable of interest. However, in some observation intervals, the object only moves on one axis, or doesn't move at all, resulting in either an undefined or infinite slope. How should I deal with this for getting basic stats like average direction? Is it OK to simply replace the (infinite/-infinite) slopes where there was no motion on the x-axis with 1 or -1? Can the periods where there is no motion (resulting in NaN/undefined) be replaced with zero? Could I add the smallest number possible to all the zero values? Or would it be better to just drop the rows where the slope is zero/undefined? Are "circular statistics" what I want to be reading about? Any tutorials dealing with this specific situation would be helpful.
