This is not a question about statistics, but a good question about R coding. I will give the answer here, but maybe the mods could migrate it to stackoverflow? OP has the right model and knows hows to fit a logistic regression given individual level data. The trick is to convert the data from a contingency table to a dataframe with one row per individual. Essentially you want to have 53 rows with outcome 0 and covariates age=25, education=low, wantsMore=yes, then 6 rows with same covariate values and outcome 1,... and so on for every different covariate combination. Here is a good snippet of code for the start, from http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Converting_between_data_frames_and_contingency_tables/ : # Convert from data frame of counts to data frame of cases. # `countcol` is the name of the column containing the counts countsToCases note that you will need to run it twice, because using and notUsing are different columns in your table.
