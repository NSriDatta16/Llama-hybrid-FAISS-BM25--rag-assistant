Let's call the bounds $u_1$ and $u_2$, let's further assumed your distributions have pdf $f(x)$ and cdf $F(x)$. Except for one thing, the easiest thing would seem to be to use maximum likelihood with contribution $f(x_i)$ for observations with $x_i \leq u_1$, $F(u_2)-F(u_1)$ for observations between the two bounds and $1-F(u_2)$ for observations beyond the upper bound. The one thing that does not fit perfectly into this framework is that you know the mean of the values falling between $u_1$ and $u_2$. It sort of feels wrong to throw away the available information in the average, so one alternative possibility is to use approximate Bayesian computation. What is the process for having that situation (with knowing the average)? The only type of data where this tends to happen is, if the data is really available (someone must have calculated the average), but somehow you cannot get it all (e.g. anonymized tax data). Perhaps looking into the literature of how other people deal with this type of data would be helpful.
