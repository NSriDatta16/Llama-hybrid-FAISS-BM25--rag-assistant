Pure win32 cross-process child windows

I need to create a transparent overlay window, that goes above another window. The other window is from another vendor. And when the user drags that window mine needs to follow. WS-CHILD seems like a nice idea but it cannot be combined with WS-EX-LAYERED, which I really need (for transparency). But I still can set a parent without using WS-CHILD. Parenting does give my winproc notifications (WM-WINDOWPOSCHANGING), but only after dragging is complete, on mouse-up. To give a nice feeling i need to get those notifications (or for example WM-MOVE) continuosly while dragging. I guess my problem is similar to docking, but the fine docking solution seen fx at CodeProjet uses WS-CHILD. ( http://www.codeproject.com/KB/toolbars/dockwnd.aspx ) I guess I could use polling but that is not what I am looking for. Also I could use ::SetWindowsHook(). But that is my final resort. I am hoping I have missed something trivial and that somebody can point me in a good direction. Thanx
