This is difficult to answer because the within-cell variance is unknown. The variances of the popvalue and samplevalue will give you only between-cell variance. With two-way ANOVA, you could model the average difference between popvalue and samplevalue by row and by column. This doesn't tell you that much. As @whuber mentioned, you may be interested in a different parameter. Moreover, you may be interested at cell-level variation rather than just row- or column- level variation. Another thing to consider: If you convert it to that sort of row-column listing and treat each cell as independent, you'll lose information about spatial correlations. If these are aggregated data, I think you'll want to run some sort of chi-square test on the un-aggregated data. But more information about your situation would help.
