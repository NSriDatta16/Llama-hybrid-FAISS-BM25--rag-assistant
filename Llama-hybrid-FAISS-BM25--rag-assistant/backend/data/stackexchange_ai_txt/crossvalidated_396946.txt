estimate precision matrix with given spatial sparsity pattern

I have a set of $n$ measurements of $p$ variables $\xi_i$ . I am interested in the inverse covariance or precision matrix $P$ of the variables, but because $p \gg n$ and because of limited storage ( $p$ can be on the order of several 100,000), I would like to constrain the precision matrix to a given sparsity pattern. In particular, the variables are associated with positions $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ , and I would like the precision matrix to have non-zero entries only for pairs of variables $(i, j)$ with $$ \sqrt{ (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 + (z_i - z_j)^2 } Is there a method to estimate such a precision matrix with a given sparsity pattern? I'm aware of the graphical lasso and other methods of sparse precision estimation, but as far as I know they infer the sparsity pattern from the data. As a second part of the question, would it be possible to apply the same sparsity constraint instead to a matrix $W$ of the same size as $P$ , such that $P = W' W$ ? This matrix would be used to "whiten" or decorrelate the variables.
