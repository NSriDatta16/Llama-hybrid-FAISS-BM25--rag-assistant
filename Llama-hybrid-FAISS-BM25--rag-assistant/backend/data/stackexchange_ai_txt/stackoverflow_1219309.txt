You'll need to do the hidden form field method. Even if you could attach the entire querystring to the end of the URL in the action attribute of the tag, browsers don't pay attention to this when doing GET form submissions. Your method isn't too difficult; you'd want to do something like this: public static string QueryStringAsHidden(this HtmlHelper helper) { var sb = new StringBuilder(); foreach (var key in HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString.AllKeys) { if (! key.StartsWith("ProductSearch")) sb.Append(helper.Hidden(key, HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString[key])); } return sb.ToString(); } I put the .StartsWith() in there because you don't want to be on a search page and submit the search string twice (and now you can prepend paging and other search-specific variables with ProductSearch. Edit: PS: To get the form to post to the current page, you don't have to explicitly provide action and controller -- you can also send nulls. Edit2: Why even bother with a helper method? :) !k.StartsWith("ProductSearch")).ToList().ForEach(k => Response.Write(Html.Hidden(k, HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString[k]))); %> James
