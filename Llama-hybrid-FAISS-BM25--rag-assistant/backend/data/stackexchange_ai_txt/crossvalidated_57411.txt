You might think of it this way. the maximum complexity (i.e., entropy) of an object obeys some form of the Bekenstein bound : $$ I \le \frac{2\pi RE}{\hbar c\ln 2} $$ where $E$ is the total rest energy including mass, and $R$ is the radius of a sphere that encloses the object. That's a big number, in most cases: The Bekenstein bound for an average human brain would be $2.58991·10^{42}$ bit and represents an upper bound on the information needed to perfectly recreate the average human brain down to the quantum level. This implies that the number of different states ($Ω=2^I$) of the human brain (and of the mind if the physicalism is true) is at most $107.79640·10^{41}$. So do you want to use "the best map", i.e. the territory itself, with all of the wave equations for all the particles in every cell? Absolutely not. Not only would it be a computational disaster, but you would be modeling things that may have essentially nothing to do with what you care about. If all you want to do is, say, identify whether or not I'm awake, you don't need to know what electron #32458 is doing in neuron #844030 ribosome #2305 molecule #2. If you don't model that, your model is indeed "wrong," but if you can identify whether or not I'm awake, your model is definitely useful.
