It's inherent in the nature of using a centred moving average; the window is truncated to what is available. You're seeing the same behaviour at the start. With the exception of the last point, all your last few points are quite a bit lower than the average, so you see a dip. Your options are to change the size of the window, discard the last few points of the moving average (because they can't be calculated in the same way as other points), or use a different type of smoothing function. Alternately you could create some extra data points, say by duplicating the last point a few times, but the average won't reflect the true value then
