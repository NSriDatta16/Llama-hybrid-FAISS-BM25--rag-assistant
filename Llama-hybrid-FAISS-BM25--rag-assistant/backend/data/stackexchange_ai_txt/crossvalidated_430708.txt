Conceptually all forecasting boils down to extracting the constant. Once you reduce your observations to a set of constant, you're done, because constant don't change, no need to forecast them. For instance, suppose, you think that your data is a perfect sine wave. In this case you need to know three constants: amplitude, phase and a frequency. Another example is "stationarity." Time series people like to talk about. Why? Because stationary time series have useful constants such as mean and variance. Once you determined them, you don't need to forecast them, they'll stay the same, right? What about trend stationary? The same thing: you find the trend, which is a constant rate of growth over time such as $\alpha t$ , where $\alpha$ is a constant! The you add the stationary part, maybe: $y=c+\alpha t+\varepsilon_t$ , where $\varepsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,\sigma^2)$ You got three constants $c,\alpha,\sigma$ - you keep them... constant and it's your forecast, just plug different $t$ to get $\hat y$
