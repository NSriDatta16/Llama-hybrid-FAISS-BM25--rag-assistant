The primary difference between a span and a div is that a span is an inline element whereas a div is a block element, like a p or paragraph element. So, in essence span { display: block; } Is essentially turning all spans into divs. You use a span for just a line of text, like to apply effects or padding or something. Divs are generally for dividing up your web page, so if you had to position a piece of text somewhere I would recommend using a div.
