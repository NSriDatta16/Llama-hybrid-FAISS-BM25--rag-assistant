Silverlight page not displaying on server

I had a working web page with Silverlight 4.0 insert in it. After making some changes to the code (adding mvvm light, reorganising code, adding new pages, ...), the silverlight doesn't show anymore. The html shows correctly, but no silverlight will show, even pages that where not modified. I get the silverlight context menu on right click, and a white area, that all. The Web.config files are the same, only the code has changed. The new code is working fin on a local machine. Any idea what might be causing this? Thanks
