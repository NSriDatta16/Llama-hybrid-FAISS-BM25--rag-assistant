ASP.NET + C# -- Deploying a multi-project solution

I have a multi-project ASP.NET + C# solution. I was planning on writing a quick (separate) VB app that yanks out all DLLs, ASPX, Config, etc files and slaps them into a 7zip file for deployment to the test server. Is there a more elegant solution than this? My development environment is VWD2008Express.
