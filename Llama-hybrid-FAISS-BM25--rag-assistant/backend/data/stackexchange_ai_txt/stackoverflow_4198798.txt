Iphone Textview does not invoke TouchesBegan

I have a Textfield which hides the keyboard when I touch somewhere else on the screen (through my TouchesBegan function and resign...blah). But when I touch a Textview the TouchesBegan does not get invoked and the keyboard doesn't hide! Is there any way to invoke TouchesBegan in order to hide the keyboard?
