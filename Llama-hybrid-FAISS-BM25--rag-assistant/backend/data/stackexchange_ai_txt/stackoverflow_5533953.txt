From the third paragraph of fscanf(3) manpage: The scanf() function reads input from the standard input stream stdin, fscanf() reads input from the stream pointer stream, and sscanf() reads its input from the character string pointed to by str. You might have been able to guess that from the SYNOPSIS : int scanf(const char *format, ...); int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...); :)
