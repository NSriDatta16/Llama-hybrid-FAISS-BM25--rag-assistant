The unfortunate short answer is you are going to have to significantly reduce your estimation costs. The only way to do that is to reduce the number of people to one and use a formula approach. Take a best guess. Put reasonable assumptions in the contract. If you do a decent job, some will be a little high, some will be a little low and it will average out in the end. If you are off by too much, track changes within the project and charge for them. The key will be in the assumptions placed in the contract, usually in the form of a statement of work. This is normal business, from small projects to enterprise projects. Just a matter of scale. It doesn't have to be done this way, but it often is.
