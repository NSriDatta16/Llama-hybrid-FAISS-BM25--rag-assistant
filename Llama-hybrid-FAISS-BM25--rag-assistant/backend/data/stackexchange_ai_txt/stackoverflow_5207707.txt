You aren't providing any the evidence arguments. Have you tried the following overloads instead of GetStore : GetUserStoreForApplication GetUserStoreForUser GetUserStoreForDomain GetMachineStoreForApplication GetMachineStoreForUser GetMachineStoreForDomain What operating system are you using? What version of .NET are you using? What file system type are you executing this on? Are you the administrator of the machine? What is the IsolatedStorage policy on the machine? Is it enabled? How much space does each user have? Can you observe the app_started.txt file being created in the appropriate directory? If not then you might also have a permissions issue... NTFS ACL etc... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ak841sy(v=vs.80).aspx Just some suggestions. HTH
