There really are no good answers. I'd be very surprised if you could recreate a non-trivial business application in a new format (web) in any 'short' amount of time (unless you measure 'short' to be 6 months). ASP.NET MVC provides (hands down) the most convention available with any beginning web project. ASP.NET lets you drag-and-drop to get things working, but it breaks maintenance horribly for non-trivial applications. If it were me, I'd do three things: Ask my boss if he wants me to recreate an entire business application across a completely different platform. Tell him he can either have it more quickly now (ASP.NET), or more quickly later (ASP.NET MVC). Let him make the call. Personal Addendum : I've used both ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC for web applications. MVC is just better. Not faster, but better. It made web development 'fun' again for me.
