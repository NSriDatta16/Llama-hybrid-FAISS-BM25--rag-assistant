I would recommend the use of htmlize in this case. Pygments is nice, but if you have Emacs set up with color themes and have a mode that already knows how to syntax highlight your code, htmlize will leverage that and take give you HTML that looks just like your Emacs buffer. If you have a light background in your blog, try color-theme-high-contrast or color-theme-blipp-blopp . If it is dark, try color-theme-taming-mr-arneson or color-theme-comidia . Those are my personal favorites.
