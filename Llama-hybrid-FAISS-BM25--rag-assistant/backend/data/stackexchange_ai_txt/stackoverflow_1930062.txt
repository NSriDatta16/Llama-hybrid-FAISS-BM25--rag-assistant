Best Practice Method of Adding Help to Large Visual Studio Solution

I'm working on a large solution containing dozens of projects. I am approaching the point where I will need to add help. I expect to use RoboHelp to create the html help file(s), but this is the first time in .NET so I am looking for advice on how to do this. I know how to create a help file and do not need any advice on that. I need help with the best way to integrate the help into my solution. Do I create multiple help files, say a separate help file for each project, or do I create a single help file for the entire solution, and do I add a Help folder for organization?
