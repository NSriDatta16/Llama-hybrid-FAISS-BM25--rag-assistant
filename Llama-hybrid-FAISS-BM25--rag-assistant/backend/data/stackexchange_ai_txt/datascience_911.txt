Basically an independent t-test or a 2 sample t-test is used to check if the averages of the two samples are significantly different. Or, to put in another words, if there is a significant difference between the means of the two samples. Now, the means of those 2 samples are two statistics, which according with CLT, have a normal distribution, if provided enough samples. Note that CLT works no matter of the distribution from which the mean statistic is built. Normally one can use a z-test, but if the variances are estimated from the sample (because it is unknown), some additional uncertainty is introduced, which is incorporated in t distribution. That's why 2-sample t-test applies here.
