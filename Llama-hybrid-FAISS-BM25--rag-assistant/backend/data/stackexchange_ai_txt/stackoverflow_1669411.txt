"Peeking Ahead" while looping through Dictionary Items

This seems like it should be something very easy to do, but every time I approach this issue, I end up w/ solutions that feel "less than elegant" Here is my basic question: If I am looping through a dictionary that I have ordered in a particular way, within any given point in the loop how can I "peek" or get reference to a dictionary item 'x' places ahead of the current item without changing the current enumerator? For instance: Dim tempDictionary = New Dictionary(Of String, String) tempDictionary.Add("TestName1", "TestValue1") tempDictionary.Add("TestName2", "TestValue2") tempDictionary.Add("TestName3", "TestValue3") '... and so on ... ' For Each Item In tempDictionary DoStuff(Item) 'Here is the point in which I want to see what the value of the' 'dictionary item that is 1, 2, 3, [x] places in front of the current' 'item without interfering w/ the current loop.' 'CODE' Next Thanks in advance!
