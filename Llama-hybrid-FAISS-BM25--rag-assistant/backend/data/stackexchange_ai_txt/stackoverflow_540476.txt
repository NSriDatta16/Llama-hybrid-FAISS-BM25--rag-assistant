Patterns are the problem if they aren't a solution. By that I mean: if a pattern is introduced for the pattern's sake and not to solve a real, existing design problem in the application, it's likely to cause issues rather than solve or prevent them. I keep telling people here at work that the Gang of Four book (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software) is a reference, not a handbook for good design.
