J2t_Ajaxcheckout installation

Question has to do with the well known to the magento community, J2T Ajax cart , which can be found here . Although the installation seems straightforward, you are assumed to copy the files to appropriate directories and modify from the administrator panel. After a "successful" installation cart's behaviour remains the same. I used the term "successful" since the JavaScript files are loading along with the css. Are there any additional steps missing from the installation procedure? (note: development magento's version is 1.4.0.1 ).
