We hired a team this year and decided to use Clojure as our weapon of choice. The team's background was primarily Java-based but also a wide variety of other languages for hobby work. The criteria we considered were: Can we leverage the Java/JVM background of the team and integrate with an existing Java-based product? Can we achieve performance on par with Java? Can we build thread-safe concurrent maintainable programs? Can we leverage a higher level of abstraction Can we hire/train people to work in the language? Can we maintain a large codebase in the language? Are sufficient tools available to work effectively in the language? Is there an active community of people growing the language and libs? We seriously considered Groovy, Scala, and Clojure. I really enjoy Groovy for lightweight apps but I had serious questions about performance. Scala and Clojure both have lots to offer on all of the points above. In the end, our problem domain involves a lot of symbolic manipulation and we felt that Clojure would be a better match but I suspect Scala also would work well.
