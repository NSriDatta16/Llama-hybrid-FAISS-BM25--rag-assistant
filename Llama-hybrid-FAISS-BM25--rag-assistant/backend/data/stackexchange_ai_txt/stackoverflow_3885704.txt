GWT RPC and persistent Java objects

First of all, many thanks to Craig for the excellent answer below which I found very useful when searching my original issue... ref: GWT Simple RPC use case problem : Code included Building on this solution, how does one overcome the (seemingly GWT limitation) where if i leave my persistable object in /shared folder as Craig suggests... and annotate it as GWT tutorials suggest... @PersistenceCapable public class Employee { @PrimaryKey @Persistent(valueStrategy = IdGeneratorStrategy.IDENTITY) private Key key; GWT is seemingly unable to deal with / import the com.google.appengine.datastore.key on the client side? I have seen a few ugly hacks...but nothing elegant. Any suggestions welcome, Thanks
