When developing models for effect estimation, is it advisable to perform internal validation and calibration using resampling methods? #rms

In predictive modelling, it is useful to perform resampling methods to assess performance e.g. validate() and calibrate() in the rms package in R. Is it useful / advisable to perform such methods when the primary purpose is estimating effects e.g. hazard ratios from a Cox model, odds ratios from logistic regression etc.?
