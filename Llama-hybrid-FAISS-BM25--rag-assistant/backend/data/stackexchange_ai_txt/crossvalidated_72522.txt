Edit 1 : didn't pay attention to the question. Will edit answer later today. Edit 2 : I've attempted to provide an answer below, however I might be mistaken. Feel free to correct me if I am in error. $P(1 defective|A) \approx 0.270 \wedge P(1 defective|B) \approx 0.377 \\ P(A) = 0.7 \wedge P(B) = 0.3 \\ P(1D) = 0.7*0.270+0.3*0.377 = 0.189+0.113 = 0.302 \\ P(A|1D) = P(1D|A)*P(A)/P(1D)=0.270*0.7/0.302 \approx 0.626$
