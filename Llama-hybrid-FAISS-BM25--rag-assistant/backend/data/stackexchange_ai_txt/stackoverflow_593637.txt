iPhone SDK: disabling cllipping for UIScrollView

I'm working on an iPhone game, and trying to use a UIScrollView to display some icons, which I then want to enable the user to drag off the bar being scrolled, onto another view (basically, dragging them from their hand into play on the game board). The problem is that the UIScrollView clips everything outside it's own bounds. Here is a picture of what I'm trying to do: Functionally, it actually works, in that you can drag the icons up to the white board fine...but you can't see them as you are dragging...which is not acceptable. Does anyone know if you can temporarily disable the clipping that a scroll view does, or is there some way to get around it? Hacky or not, I would really like to make it happen. Does anyone have any other possible solutions for this? Or maybe any alternate approaches? I've considered if maybe a page view might work, but haven't tried it yet...and it's not at all as good of a solution as the scroll view. Worst case I can just go back to not having the bar scrollable, but that really puts a damper on some of my game mechanics, and I'm really not too excited about that.
