Asp.net MVC is still Asp.net Asp.net MVC is not really open source. It's developed inhouse at Microsoft by their stuff. The code is public, but that's all. And it's built on top of Asp.net. But since I've been an Asp.net WebForm developer since version 1.0 and then switched to MVC since version 1 I would suggest you rather learn MVC. Others may protest, but apart from the very simple applications where you can really just drag/drop controls on the page I rather use MVC. Asp.net MVC is much better suited to the stateless HTTP protocol hence web applications. Asp.net WebForms on the other hand were made to make desktop developers' lifes easier to switch to web applications. They use the same event control even models etc. But there's a whole abstraction layer between HTTP and the UI that makes things much more complicated. Especially when developing modern complex web application.
