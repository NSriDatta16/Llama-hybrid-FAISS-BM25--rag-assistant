About seq2seq networks

I have read that seq2seq is a network, similar to other networks types (CNN, RNN, ...). However, in my opinion it is actually an architecture for RNNs. Isn't that? For example, when input and output lengths are not equal, LSTM is not applicable. LSTM is an architecture for RNNs. Instead another architecture is used consisting two units: encoder and decoder and they are built with RNNs. So, is seq2seq a subset of RNN? a sibling of LSTM? Or it is a sibling of RNN and CNN?
