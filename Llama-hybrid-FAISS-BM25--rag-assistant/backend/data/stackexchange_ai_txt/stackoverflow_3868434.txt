Automatically sharding MySQL?

Right now, I'm dealing with a TON (trust me) of data that needs to be available in real-time for fast reads and writes to customers. The backend storage system that we're using is Oracle, but we'd like to replace our big, beefy machines with a leaner system. For various reasons, we can't use Cassandra, and we're testing (but I'm scared of) MongoDB (it's really young and is missing some critical features), so I was thinking about sharding a bunch of MySQL instances. Is there a good system to manage this, or do I have to roll my own? I've found a few projects but it's unclear to me if they support adding/removing shards on the fly.
