The magic doesn't work when you have a time series with anomalies but that's in the small print which you will never read because it was ignored in order to sell a simple solution to all data sets ... hardly a good idea ! . If you difference a random series you inject structure ... see the Slutsky-Yule effect on the web http://ri.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0LEV71SI.9V_EcAEg4PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByNXM5bzY5BGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMzBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1441764307/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fmathworld.wolfram.com%2fSlutzky-YuleEffect.html/RK=0/RS=fvgfNbAzcn7CLUk47ki5Vrw0o.A- or equivalently a counter balancing / caancelling AR and MA structure . Your series is a (0,0,0) series with a few outliers . See the actual/fit and forecast. The model is with a plot of the errors here and the acf of the errors here
