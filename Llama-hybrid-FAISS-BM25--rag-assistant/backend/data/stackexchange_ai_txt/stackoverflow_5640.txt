I found a fairly elegant solution with Telerik's RadAjaxManager . It works quite nicely. Essentially you register each control which might invoke a postback, and then register each control which should be re-drawn after that postback is performed asynchronously. The RadAjaxManager will update the DOM after the async postback and rewrite the ViewState and all affected controls. After taking a peek in Reflector , it looks a little kludgy under the hood, but it suits my purposes.
