AlexNet (and also VGG, RestNET and other RNNs) are supervised learning approaches, so you need a labelled dataset to proceed. In your case looks like you do not have the labels, so I do not think you can make use of such approaches. You might want to look into unsupervised learning techniques instead. The other option is, of course, to find a labelled dataset which given your task, I would recommend.
