Javascript Object Function Scoping

Let's say I have a class: var asdf = new Class({ myFunction: function () { //some stuff here }, anotherFunction: function() { globalObject.dosomethingandusecallback( function() { // this is the callback //how do I call myFunction() here? I can't seem to get it to work? } ); } }); I seem to have some scoping problems in trying to call myFunction within the definition of my callback function. What am I missing here? I thought it should have access to myFunction in this context? Thanks!
