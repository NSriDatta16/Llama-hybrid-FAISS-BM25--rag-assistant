In the R randomForest package for random forest feature selection, how is the dataset split for training and testing?

I'm using the randomForest R package to perform a random forest feature selection. I undestand that, after the execution of the randomForest function, I have to check the importance field, and study the importance measured throudh mean square error accuracy reduction and Gini purity reduction. For example, by using this R code: data(iris) library("randomForest") set.seed(71) iris.rf It will print out: MeanDecreaseAccuracy MeanDecreaseGini Sepal.Width 0.007962441 2.625413 Sepal.Length 0.031901722 10.714741 Petal.Length 0.304760304 42.104241 Petal.Width 0.300907912 43.767952 Then, I see that I can rank these features by the MeanDecreaseAccuracy or MeanDecreaseGini field to understand what are the most important ones. Even if I understand the output of the method, I cannot understand how the method obtains its results. The questions are: How does the method compute the accuracy? How does the method split the dataset into training set and test set to compute the accuracy?
