It isn't immediately clear to me why you would convert an already measured composite test into an arbitrarily defined three-level factor (hint: you shouldn't). It seems implied by your wording that you already have an IV of sexual assertiveness and a DV of relationship satisfaction. So I would model that with the given measures you already have rather than arbitrarily binning people into groups (this comes at an unnecessary amount of information loss, see reference below). If you are using the composite scores of SAQ and RAS , then any of your typical regression modeling techniques would work here (though attention would need to be paid to how the residuals are defined depending on how people respond to this composite in the literature). Of course, because of the inherent imprecision of Likert-scale tests, you would need to account for inter-item reliability to define any uncertainty in the estimated composites (using measures like Cronbach's alpha or McDonald's omega).
