How are you meant to do this so that it works? SVN tree conflicts, etc

We have a trunk that we've branched. In the branch we moved files using TortoiseSVN into new folders to re-organise the structure. Those files were also worked on in the trunk. So let's call the file /trunk/file1.cs and /branch/folder1/file1.cs We're now trying to merge the trunk changes into the branch and svn is screaming about tree conflicts? How are you meant to do this scenario. btw we're using svn 1.6.6 on both server and client although upgrade was done after the branch was created (not sure if that makes a difference?)
