Perl: parse hex-encoded string into array with regex

I'm quite new to Perl development, and I'd like to perform a following task: My script receives hex-encoded string as command-line param. Then I must decode this string and write it to output file like a C++ array with initialization from data given. For example: perl myscript.pl DEADBABEDEADBEEF and the output something like const boost::array MyArray = { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBA, 0xBE, 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF }; What is the right way to do this with Perl regex? Of course, I could perform it in loop with substrings, but I believe that there should be more elegant way. EDIT: the input string is of fixed length.
