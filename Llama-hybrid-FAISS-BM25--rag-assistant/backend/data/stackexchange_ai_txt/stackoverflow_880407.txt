There was a google Summer Of Code project last year that built a drag and drop form editor using the Dojo JavaScript toolkit. It's not 100% complete in terms of the functionality I'm guessing you would want. It does dump a javascript object representing the form which you can convert to JSON to send over the wire. Depending on your JavaScript skill set it should give you a head start on the problem. The demo is here: http://jbalogh.dojotoolkit.org/dojo-svn/release/dojo/soc/test.html Blog posts by the person working on it: http://www.dojotoolkit.org/blog/jbalogh
