I have heard the argument for using the number on the end as the unique identifier for individuals because the other information (name, organization, etc) are the bits of information that can realistically change over time as opposed to the number. However, I have not seen an official document or any other piece of authoritative information that actually states this as a fact. Just curious, is there a document that speaks to the step-by-step process of enabling Apache and DOD CAC? That's what actually brought me to this question in the first place :)
