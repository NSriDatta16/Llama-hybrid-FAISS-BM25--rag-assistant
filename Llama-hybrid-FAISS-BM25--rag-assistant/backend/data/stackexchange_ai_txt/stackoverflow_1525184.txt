I think the problem here is that you just call DOM.appendChild - this doesn't cause the TitledPanel to adopt the Widget . The normal course of action is that you extend Composite and then call initWidget(Widget widget) - inside the hood it calls widget.setParent(this); , which in turn makes the parent adopt this widget and attach it to the browser's document. However com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Widget.setParent(Widget) is only package-visible so you can't call it from your code (after, for example, DOM.appendChild ). I'd recommend reading Widget Best Practices / Widget Building , especially the Clean up after yourself and/or look at the source code for some GWT Widgets, to get the idea how the GWT sees custom widget creation. And, as Robert suggested , CaptionPanel is the safer route :)
