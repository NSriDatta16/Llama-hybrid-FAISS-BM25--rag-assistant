ORM is a tool. Ponder that sentence deeply. It is usually believed that if a piece technology, Hibernate in this case, becomes popular enough in a specific domain, it is the silver bullet and that you have to use it, otherwise you're a loser. This is plainly and utterly wrong. Hibernate is a tool that should be used appropriately. Hibernate's authors say that Hibernate is best suited for new projects, where mappings are defined in xml or using annotations, and then Hibernate generates the DLL for your database and creates all tables and relationships. The reverse can be very tricky, especially when you've got non normalized tables and composite primary keys. That's why Hibernate strongly encourages use of primary surrogate keys that are autoincrementing. Doing proper JPA reverse mapping is a challenge with many corner cases awaiting you in the wild, so you're doing the right thing by report all these bugs so they can be fixed. With some more persistence, I'm sure you'll be able to do your mappings perfectly and then everything after that should be much easier, since that first part is always the hardest.
