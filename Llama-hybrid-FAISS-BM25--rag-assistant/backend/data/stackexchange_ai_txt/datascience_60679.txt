Machine learning method to predict event date

Let's say I have a big dataset consisting of variables including but not limited to the start/end date of loans, their notional amount, a loan prepayment indicator etc. My goal is to create a model that will be trained on past data in order to predict the prepayment date of current loans and I was wondering which ML method would be most suitable for this case. My first thought was to handle this as a classification problem, using interval dates to predict a prepayment date interval, but I believe that there should be a more robust & sophisticated approach to this.
