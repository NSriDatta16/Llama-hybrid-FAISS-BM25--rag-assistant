(Taking these out of order.) The first category, Agecod1 , is represented by the intercept. That is called the "reference level" of your factor variable. The Estimate for (Intercept) is the mean of the response for that level. The Estimate s for the rest are the differences between the indicated level and the reference level. The associated p-values are for the tests of the indicated level vs. the reference level in isolation. They probably don't answer the question you actually have; they may best be ignored. It makes no sense to say that "only the 4th age category associated with death". No such thing is logically possible. You cannot tell from your output if Age is associated with death. You need to fit a nested model that does not have Age , but is otherwise identical. Then you can perform a nested model test ( anova(nested_model, mylogit, test="LRT") ). Updated to respond to additional information. The anova() you ran tests Age as a whole. The p-value is listed as 0.003531 , so that is significant unless your chosen alpha is less than that (which would be very unusual). Since your model is a logistic regression, there are several ways that such a test can be run, and therefor several p-values are possible. It is possible that SPSS is using a different method, and that both p-values are valid according to their own assumptions. To understand the different possibilities, it may help you to read my answer here: Why do my p-values differ between logistic regression output, chi-squared test, and the confidence interval for the OR?
