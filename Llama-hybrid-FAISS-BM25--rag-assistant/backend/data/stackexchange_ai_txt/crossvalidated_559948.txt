Estimating transition probabilities of a Markov chain with bayesian approach

I am trying to model heteroskedasticity in time series data,and the volatility $\left(\sigma_{t}\right)$ is taken as a Markov chain with two values $\sigma_{h}>\sigma_{l}>0$ with transition given by $p\left(\sigma_{t+1} \mid \sigma_{t}\right)$ . How can I estimate these transition probabilities with Bayesian approach?
