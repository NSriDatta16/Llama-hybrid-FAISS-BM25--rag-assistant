How do I see what build is running on TFS 2010 Build Agents

We are seeing a lot of queuing on our build agents and I am looking for a way to see guilty builds. Anyone know of an out of the box way to do this? I would imagine that I can write a report that looks at this or that I could use the TFS API to get this information, but this feels like something that should be available out of the box. Anyone know of a way to get this information?
