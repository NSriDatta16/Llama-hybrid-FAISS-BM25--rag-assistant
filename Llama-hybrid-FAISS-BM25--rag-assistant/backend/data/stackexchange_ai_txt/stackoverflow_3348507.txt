That's because the bookmarklet runs within the sandbox (the environment) of the current web page. Since you're not allowed to access (the DOM of) another page which doesn't have the same protocol, domain name and port, you're not able to access the document property of newWindow when protocols, domains and ports don't match. BTW, the same is true for accessing iframe s on a page. As you're talking about an “external form”, I guess you don't stay on the same domain. The other examples retrieve or manipulate data on the current page (at that moment) and won't error out. Also see Same origin policy . Update: About the Delicious (et al.) bookmarklet: its code actually reads: (function () { f = 'http://delicious.com/save?url=' + encodeURIComponent(window.location.href) + '&title=' + encodeURIComponent(document.title) + '&v=5&'; a = function () { if (!window.open(f + 'noui=1&jump=doclose', 'deliciousuiv5', 'location=yes,links=no,scrollbars=no,toolbar=no,width=550,height=550')) location.href = f + 'jump=yes' }; if (/Firefox/.test(navigator.userAgent)) { setTimeout(a, 0) } else { a() } })() So, yes, the parameters are only transferred using a GET request.
