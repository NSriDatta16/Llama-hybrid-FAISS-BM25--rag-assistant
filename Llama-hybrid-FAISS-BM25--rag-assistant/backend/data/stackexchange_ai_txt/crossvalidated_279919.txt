You have your time series $(y_t)$. That time series has certain ACF and PACF . You don't know how the random variables that make up your time series look like, so you can't calculate the ACF and PACF from them. You do know however, some data sampled from those random variables. From that sample you can calculate the sample ACF and sample PACF. There are results from distribution theory that tell you that the sample ACF and sample PACF will be an approximation for the ACF and PACF of the time series. These results are valid under the assumption that the time series has the property of being stationary . Be aware that there are varying definitions of stationarity. You will have to figure out which one the author is referring to.
