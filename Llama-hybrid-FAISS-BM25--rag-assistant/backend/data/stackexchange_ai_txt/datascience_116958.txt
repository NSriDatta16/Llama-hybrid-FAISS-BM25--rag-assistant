Predicting 100 days is probably impossible with SARIMA and 1 station. Even current supercomputers can forecast 7 days with good accuracy and up to 15 days with average accuracy (depending on regions): They cannot forecast 100 days. https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/01/02/forecast-models-keep-hinting-at-subzero-air-ahead Having one station, I recommend starting to predict 1 or 2 days. If you want to predict longer, you will probably need more data to cross information, complex models, and a lot of computing power.
