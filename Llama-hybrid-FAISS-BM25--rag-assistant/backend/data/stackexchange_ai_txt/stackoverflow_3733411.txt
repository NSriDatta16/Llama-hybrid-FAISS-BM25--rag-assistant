XSLT: convert carriage returns to paragraphs in mixed node while preserving HTML

I'm trying to wrap new lines in paragraphs without eliminating the HTML in the mixed node. I can get one or the other to work, but not both. XML: line 1 line 2 line 3 desired output: line 1 line 2 line 3 these templates match the HTML: these templates convert new lines to paragraphs: --> Is this possible? I realize the nl2p template runs string functions on the nodeset -- does this destroy the HTML? Can I preserve it or use a specific order of operations to achieve this result? Thanks in advance. Edit: I'm using XSLT 1.0
