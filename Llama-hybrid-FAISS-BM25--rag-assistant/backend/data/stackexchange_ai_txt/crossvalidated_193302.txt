hard to say from just two examples. is the amplitude important? If so, try the area under the curves as a feature. if not, you need to z-normalize the data. This paper lists many many possible time series features http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3531.pdf I could help you more, if you showed many more examples. eamonn keogh
