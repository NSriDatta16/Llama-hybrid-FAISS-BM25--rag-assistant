Feature extraction with TSFEL giving inconsistent sizes

Looks like this is TSFEL's first appearance on Stack Overflow. Time Series Feature Extraction Library (TSFEL for short) is a Python package for feature extraction on time series data. Here goes. I'm following this example . I input my data into time_series_features_extractor where X and y have respectively shapes (5244, 19) (5244,) . The output gives me an X_train of shape (1, 7410) which I cannot input into any classifier because my y_train is still (5244,) . The example does this without blinking in the Feature Extraction segment, so there is something I'm misunderstanding. If there is anyone here that has experience with TSFEL or other Time Series Feature extractors, any tips or help is well thought of.
