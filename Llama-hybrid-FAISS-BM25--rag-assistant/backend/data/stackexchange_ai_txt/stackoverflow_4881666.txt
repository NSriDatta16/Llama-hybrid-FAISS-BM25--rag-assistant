jQuery â€” Using .delay() to postpone a .load()?

I've just run into an issue with using jQuery's .delay() method (v 1.4.2) to try to delay a following .load() method. Like so: $('myElement').delay(500).load('myPage.php'); It seems to just ignore the .delay(). I've evenutally figured out a work-around like so: setTimeout(function(){ $('myElement').load('myPage.php'); }, 500); But, that's not as elegant. Anyone else run into this and found a better solution? Thanks.
