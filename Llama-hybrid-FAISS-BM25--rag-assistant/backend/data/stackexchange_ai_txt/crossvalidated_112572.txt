The rule for outlier detection you defined before training your model should be applied to all new data you will use, otherwise your model will be confronted with data points it has not be trained to handle. When you apply this rule it should be the exact same rule, i.e. it should use the mean and std from the previous year. However if you expect significant difference between the means of two successive years this might result in flagging too many data points as outliers. You can check that quickly by looking at the moving average. Regarding the outlier detection, using one feature at the time might not be optimal, especially if you use multivariate methods afterwards. Some interesting tools re available here in different implementations (MATLAB, R ...).
