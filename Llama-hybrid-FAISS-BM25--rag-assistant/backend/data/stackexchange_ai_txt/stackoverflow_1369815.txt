Please file a bug via http://bugreport.apple.com (and append the bug number here). I could see how Foundation might cause that to happen. That your range is (0,0) seems a bit odd. Are you trying to insert a string at the beginning of the text storage? If so, use -insertAttributedString:atIndex: instead. If that fixes the Oops, please do still file a bug. The Foundation should definitely be more helpful than "Oops"!
