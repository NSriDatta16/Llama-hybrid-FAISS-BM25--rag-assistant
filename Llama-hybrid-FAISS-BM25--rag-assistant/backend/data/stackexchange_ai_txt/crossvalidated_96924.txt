My original best guesses came up short (at least for the articles I had quick access to). Friendly's The Golden Age of Statistical Graphics mentions a derivative of the periodic table is Moseley's discovery of the concept of an atomic number - but doesn't mention the table itself. I quickly checked the work of Michael Friendly and Howard Wainer to see if they had any general pieces on the work - but I found none (quickly). I don't have quick access to Tufte's book(s) - but he is pretty comprehensive in historical review. It is possible he mentions the periodic table in brief (but I think is unlikely to have a review of the table over time like you envision). Some perusing on Google Scholar though brought up a Journal of Chemical Education that has a few articles of interest. See: Diffusion cartograms for the display of periodic table data (Winter, 2011) From Periodic Properties to a Periodic Table Arrangement (BesaluÃÅ, 2013) Periodic Table of the Elements in the Perspective of Artificial Neural Networks (Lemes and Dal Pino, 2011) From there I got lucky and found Periodicity, visualization, and design by Francis T. Marchese - which appears to fit your bill perfectly for a historical narrative (although doesn't cite the other more recent articles I mention).
