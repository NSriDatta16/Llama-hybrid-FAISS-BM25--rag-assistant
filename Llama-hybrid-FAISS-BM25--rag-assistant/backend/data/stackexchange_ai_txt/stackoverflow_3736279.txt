Using XPath/XQuery to create child nodes in a SQL column

I have a sql table with an xml column named CasingRules, which would contain data such as: ^Mc[A-Z,a-z]* ULU ^Mac[A-Z,a-z]* ULLU I'm trying to use MS SQL's modify method to add a new node 'ApplyTo' into each item, to create something like: ^Mc[A-Z,a-z]* ULU NameAndAddress ^Mac[A-Z,a-z]* ULLU NameAndAddress .. but I'm very much a newbie to XPath, and not even sure if its possible to update multiple nodes in one query? Is there an elegant way to achieve this? I'm expecting the syntax is something like this, but its not working: UPDATE TableName SET CasingRules.modify('insert NameAndAddress as last into (/root//Item[1])')
