Since (around) PHP 5.2, PHP has had a built in class/object for dealing with Dates and Times, called DateTime . In a void, it's always better to use a built-in than to wrangle with the messy details yourself. The DateTime constructor (or the date_create function) accepts a date in any format understood by strToTime. All you need to know about strToTime is it's magic voodoo that will correctly recognize a date in almost any string format. When I first encountered strToTime I had the same internal reaction you're having now ("that's bullshit/seems unreliable"). It's not. It Just Works in a way that your own fragile understanding of dates never will (and if you think you understand dates, you don't. Trust Me.) So, pull the information from MySQL as a Date/Time string, and immediately create a PHP date Object. Use the date_format method (with some handy constants ) when/if you need the date again as a string.
