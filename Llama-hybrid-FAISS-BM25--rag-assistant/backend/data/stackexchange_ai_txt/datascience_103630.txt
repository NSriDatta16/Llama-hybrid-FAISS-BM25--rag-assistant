what tool or theory should I use to analyse Baccarat roadmap?

I am going to write a program to analyze the result of the Baccarat game. In Baccarat, there will be two results, banker win, and player win. People use a roadmap to record the results, it's like this: The red circles represent banker win and blue circles represent player win. I want to model the data structure and then try to analyze is there some pattern or rule that the results will follow. I want to ask in data science are there some existing theories for me to use to analyze this kind of map?
