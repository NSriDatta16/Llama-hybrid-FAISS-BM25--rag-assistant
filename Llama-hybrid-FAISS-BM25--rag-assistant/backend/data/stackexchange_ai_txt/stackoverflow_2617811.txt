That #fragment anchor tag is a client side (browser) component of the URL. It doesn't get sent to the WebServer as far as I know so the server-side has no clue about it as part the redirect. EDIT Can you check your IIS logs and confirm that because I'm 99% sure that that's not the case. From a quick test on my local machine. Attempt to browse to http://localhost/formstest/private.aspx#test Get Redirected http://localhost/formstest/login.aspx?redirect=http%3a%2f%2flocahost%2fformstest%2fprivate.aspx#test (Notice the # is not escaped as part of the redirect url.
