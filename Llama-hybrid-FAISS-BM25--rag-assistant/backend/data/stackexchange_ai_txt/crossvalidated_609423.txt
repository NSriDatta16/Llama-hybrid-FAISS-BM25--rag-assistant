My take: neither you, nor ChatGPT, nor a-c are correct. You write: According to the values of $K$ , our adjust to the data is clearly not satisfatory, in the sense that the values for $K$ are pretty small. That logic is incorrect. Suppose your task is to predict the flip of a fair coin, and $K$ is given by the accuracy of your prediction over many trials, but squared . (We disregard the fact that accuracy is a horrible KPI. ) Since accuracy lies between 0 and 1, squared accuracy also lies between 0 and 1, so $K$ is as in your question. However, since this is a fair coin, our accuracy cannot be expected to be above 0.5, so $K$ cannot reasonably be expected to exceed $0.5^2=0.25$ . So just because we got a "small" value for $K$ does not mean it is "not satisfactory", or that it can be improved. Thus, the pure fact that $K$ has a certain value does not tell you anything. Rather, what we should be doing (and this is IMO the correct answer) is to assess in what circumstances our model does a bad job, and try to address these situations. See How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? What the question or your professor probably wanted you to argue is: "Since test and validation loss are similar, there is no clear evidence of overfitting. Therefore, we can safely retrain the model with less regularization, i.e., lower values of $\lambda$ ." Yes, that reasoning makes sense... but I find my take above more helpful, if only because your software (like GLMNet) will probably optimize the regularization parameters automatically, so thinking about a particular value of $\lambda$ is usually not very useful.
