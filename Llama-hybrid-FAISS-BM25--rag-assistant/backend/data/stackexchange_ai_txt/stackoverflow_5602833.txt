Is the any way to allow mismatched tags in XSLT No . An XSLT stylesheet must be a well-formed XML document . Also, if the value of the method attribute of is specified as "xml", then the output will always be a well-formed XML fragment (or document). ... or is there another way to achieve the same desired effect? If you define the problem you want to solve, many people will be able to show you a solution, that doesn't require malformed XSLT.
