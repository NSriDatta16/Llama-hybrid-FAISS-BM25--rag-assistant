To elaborate on the discussion in the comments, your described situation can be viewed as a hierarchical model, like so: $$X \sim Exp(a)$$ $$Y \sim Exp(\frac{c}{x})$$ There are certainly Bayesian models that provide analytic solutions, e.g. treating the $p$ parameter of a binomial distribution as a beta-distributed random variable. (These are also attractive for the interpretability of their parameters.) But, when the relationships among variables get complicated, these methods tend to fall short. Where analytical methods are impossible, one can use a MCMC trace of any given parameter as an approximation of its posterior distribution. (Assuming one has properly assessed the chain for convergence.) Because the conjugate prior models that produce analytic solutions tend to be simple ones, their assumptions may be unrealistic for more elaborate processes. Even a conjugate normal model assumes mean depends on precision (p. 5). MCMC allows us to work around the absence of analytic solutions. This is a commonly cited reason for the growth in popularity of Bayesian methods: Cheap computing power made them possible.
