If you want to preserve and utilize the 2D structure, use something like a Convolutional Neural Network. Feature selection can be done using L1 regularization. Otherwise you will have to do feature engineering outside the classifier. This 2D structure with one axis being time is quite similar to spectrograms used in audio, where CNNs are frequently applied. So check out literature on Acoustic Event Recognition and Acoustic Scene Classification for more details.
