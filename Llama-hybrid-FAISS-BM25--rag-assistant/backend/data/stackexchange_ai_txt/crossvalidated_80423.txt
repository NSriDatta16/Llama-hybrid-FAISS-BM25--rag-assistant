Roughly speaking, $\Omega_{t-1}$ is all the information available up to time $t-1$. For example, it can be considered as the observed values of your time series i.e. $Y_0, Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_{t-1}$. If I want to be more precise, it is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by all these random variables i.e. $\Omega_{t-1}=\sigma\{Y_0, Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_{t-1}\}$.
