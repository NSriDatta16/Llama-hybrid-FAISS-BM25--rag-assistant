Meaning of "identically distributed" when there's only one variable

From page 8 of Rasmussen's book Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning : This is all pretty basic...but what do they mean by "identically distributed" in the last sentence? I understand if we have a collection of random variables, we refer to them as identically distributed to mean they all have the same distribution. But here $\epsilon$ is just one random variable. So what does "identically distributed" mean?
