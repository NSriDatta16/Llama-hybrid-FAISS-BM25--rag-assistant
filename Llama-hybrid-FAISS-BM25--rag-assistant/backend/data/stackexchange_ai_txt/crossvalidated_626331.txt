For ordinal target variables you should resort to ordinal regression. If you are not familiar with it at all I suggest to follow DevD reference to wiki. If you are looking into readily available implementations for ordinal regression, I recommend to take a look at https://github.com/ck37/coral-ordinal and the 2 references therein with excellent exposition of ordinal probabilistic predictions and inference.
