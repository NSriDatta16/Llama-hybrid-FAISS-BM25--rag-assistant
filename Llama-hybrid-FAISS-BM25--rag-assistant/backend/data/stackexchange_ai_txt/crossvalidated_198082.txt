Optimal scaling or optimal quantification is an algorithmic approach to transform categorical variables into scale (interval) ones which would be "optimal" in some statistical sense (for example, their linear correlations will be maximized). There exist nonlinear "optimal scaling versions" of many classic linear kinds of analysis, including regression, PCA, etc.
