Quantile regression visualization and evaluation

I'm trying to perform quantile regression in R on a multivariate data set, where I want to visualize the 10% and 90% bounds. I also intend to calculate PICP - Prediction interval coverage probability according to Where LPI i and UPI i are respectively lower and upper bounds of the prediction interval constructed for ith sample. t i is the ith target value. I make predictions with another model - in the example I use a linear model, but my intention is also to include other models such as a GP. Currently, I'm a bit stuck on the visualization part, as I'm not sure how to visualize the lines for the upper and lower bound, when I have multiple covariates. I've tried to create a reproducible example below which highlights what I want to do. I'm using the quantreg package: # Create a covariate set.seed(123456) x1 $y y $y), xlim = c(0, 1000)) points(QR_fit_1$ fitted.values, col=2) points(QR_fit_9$fitted.values, col=4) abline(QR_fit_1, col=2) abline(QR_fit_9, col=4) axis(1, xlim = c(0, 1100)) # Make predictions with another model, i.e linear model fit_mod Any suggestions on how I could do this would be greatly appreciated. As the ??? indicates, I'm a bit unsure of how to calculate the PICP, as I'm not sure how to obtain the lower and upper bounds.
