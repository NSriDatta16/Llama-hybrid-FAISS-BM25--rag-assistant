I looked at the write up of CSS on Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets ) and a few other comments about CSS and became discouraged about the lack of full support for CSS in the different Layout engines, so I am just curious if there is an alternative or I must learn to also use CSS filters. CSS is the standard. There is no alternative. All browsers support the basic CSS features. Each new version of each of the (four?) main browser lines comes with increased support for the standard, but websites that use these features will be broken to any users in an earlier version. There are two answers to this: "Graceful degredation" (or its twin, "Progressive enhancement" - google it), in which the page takes advantage of advanced features if they're available, while still continuing to work if they're not. Who are your audience? If you're lucky enough to know that 99.8% of visitors to your website will be using at least IE7, then you don't need to worry about the CSS features that are broken in IE6. This will depend on your own business though, so check the facts first. The worst thing you can do is code to the quirks of a single specific browser, because that leads to a page that's broken not only on other browsers, but even on later versions of the same browser.
