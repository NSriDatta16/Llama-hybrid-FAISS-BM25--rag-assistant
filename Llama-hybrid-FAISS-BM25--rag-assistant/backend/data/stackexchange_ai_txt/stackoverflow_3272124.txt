My idea after a brainstorming minute: Dropbot Create a messaging account anywhere and add this account as a contact to your messenger. This contact is your Dropbot. Change your interpreter UI so it does not display a conversation but a log. In this way you can just drop things to the contact like interesting links. There could be a Dropbot for a read later queue, your favorite citations or for a list of funny findings. You could then extend your UI to a little mashup. It could follow the links and grap the title of the page and a content preview just as Facebook does it when posting a link to your wall. You could further extend your app by adding post-drop behavior to the Dropbot. Dropbot could post your link (probably with a message) on Twitter or Facebook. Dropbot could automatically distribute the link to the other contacts of it (like your friends) Ok, that sounds fine... but you could do that without a message bot inbetween. What's the deal? For me the advantage would be that my IM is always open and it would be fairly easy to drop a link. You could do the link dropping with Delicious or post stuff to a Google Wave, yeah. But I don't like to go to a web page, log in and organize stuff in the UI. Actually I stumble upon those links when I should do more important stuff instead. So just dropping it to my IM Dropbot contact would be cool.
