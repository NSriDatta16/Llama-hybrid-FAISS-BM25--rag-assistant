When you bind a new datasource to the grid control you need to call Rebind to have the grid show the new data. Alternatively you could use NeedDataSource event (more elegant solution in my opinion) For your second problem try this (assuming you're using ASP.NET Calendar and not Telerik DatePicker: if(Calendar1.SelectedDate.Date == DateTime.MinValue) { //no date selected } else { //date is selected }
