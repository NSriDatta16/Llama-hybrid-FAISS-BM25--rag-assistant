"Load average" may not be very useful. We find it to be of limited use, as it doesn't actually tell you how much CPU is being used, only the average number of tasks "ready to run". "Ready to run" is somewhat subjective, but not very helpful as it often includes processes waiting for IO. On busy systems, we see load average of 20+ on machines with only 8 cores, and still the CPUs are relatively idle. If you want to see what CPU is in use, have a look at the various files in /proc
