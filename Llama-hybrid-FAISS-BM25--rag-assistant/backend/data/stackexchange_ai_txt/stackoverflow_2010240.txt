Check the setting on the Wildcard ISAPI mapping for the SIteMinder agent. There is a check box for “Verify that file exists”, remove the check and it should start to work. The Flash Gateway is requesting a URL that is not part of the file system, it is a servlet mapping path. Since there is no file and the SiteMinder agent is checking for its existence you get a 404 error causing the Flash Gateway to fail.
