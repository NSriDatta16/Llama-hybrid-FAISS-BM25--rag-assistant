When you say > (cons 'a 'b) in common lisp you dont get a list but a dotted pair: (a . b) , whereas the result of > (cons 'a (cons 'b nil)) is the dotted pair (a . ( b . nil)) . In the first list the cdr() of that is not a list, since it is here b and not nil , making it an improper list. Proper lists must be terminated by nil . Therefore higher order functions like mapcar() and friends won't work, but we save a cons-cell. I guess the designers of Clojure removed this feature because of the confusion it could cause.
