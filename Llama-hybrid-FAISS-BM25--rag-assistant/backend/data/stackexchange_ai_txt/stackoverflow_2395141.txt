I had an OutOfMemoryException-problem as well: Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Reducing number of loaded dlls The reason was fragmentation of 2GB GB virtual address space and poster nobugz suggested Sysinternal's Vmmap utility which has been very helpful for diagnostics. You can use it to check if your free memory areas become more fragmented over time. (First sort by size then by type -> refresh repeat sorting and you can see if contiguous free memory blocks become smaller)
