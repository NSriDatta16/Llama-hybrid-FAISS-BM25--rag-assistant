As you figured out yourself, the article you were originally looking for is called Design Guidelines for Developing Class Libraries on the MSDN. Note that it also exists a great complete book on the very same topic, named Framework Design Guidelines . Actually, the MSDN page encourages you to have a look at this book if you want to go deeper: For more information on design guidelines, see the "Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries" book by Krzysztof Cwalina and Brad Abrams, published by Addison-Wesley, 2005.
