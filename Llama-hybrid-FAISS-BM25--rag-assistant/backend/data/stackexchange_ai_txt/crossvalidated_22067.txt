Probably the most effective (but also timeconsuming) approach will be to hand pick a set of examples that you know are postive, negative, and neutral. You can then train a classifier (Naive Bayes, SVM, Fisher Discriminant or whatever) on these examples (since you are using 3 classes, you will need to do multi-class classification, although to begin with it might simplify your problem to only look at +ve/-ve and introduce the neutral class later). You should ensure that you have enough examples so that you can perform k-fold cross-validation of the classifier hyperparameters effetively. The more training examples you have, the better the estimation of your threshold will be. Without any training examples, you will have to resort to ad-hoc rules which are unlikely to be robust.
