A member variable is a member of a type and belongs to that type's state. A local variable is not a member of a type and represents local storage rather than the state of an instance of a given type. This is all very abstract, however. Here is a C# example: class Program { static void Main() { // This is a local variable. Its lifespan // is determined by lexical scope. Foo foo; } } class Foo { // This is a member variable - a new instance // of this variable will be created for each // new instance of Foo. The lifespan of this // variable is equal to the lifespan of "this" // instance of Foo. int bar; }
