How to best assign object relationships in LinqToSql

Lets assume the simple case, a simple relationship between table A and table B, where B has an A_Id field in it. Now, assume I have an object of type A (currentA), and am creating a brand new B object. B newB = new B() { A_id = currentA.Id }; Is this the correct way to set that relationship? Or should I do: B newB = new B() { A = currentA }; In the second case, does B.A_Id get set automatically? Perhaps I need to explicitly set both? B newB = new B() { A = currentA, A_Id = currentA.Id }; I am looking for the most elegant way to set this new relationship such that I can correctly save it to the database later, and can exploit it immediately... for example I might want to do: MessageBox(String.Format("B's parent is now {0}", B.A.Name));
