Calculating maximum and minimum values in an array

I have an array of integers and need to find the position in the array of the maximum number along with the minimum. I have it working but it doesn't seem to be a very good way to do it. Can anyone suggest a better way to achieve what I have? Here's my code: int[] usageHours = { 3, 3, 5, 4, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 25, 158, 320, 212, 356, 401, 460, 480, 403, 298, 213, 102, 87, 34, 45 }; double myAverage = usageHours.Average(); int runningTotal = 0; int runningMaxPosition = 0; for (int i = 0; i runningTotal) { runningMaxPosition = i; runningTotal = usageHours[i]; } } txtmax.Text = Convert.ToString(runningMaxPosition)+" With: "+Convert.ToString(runningTotal)+" Users"; txtAv.Text = Convert.ToString(myAverage);
