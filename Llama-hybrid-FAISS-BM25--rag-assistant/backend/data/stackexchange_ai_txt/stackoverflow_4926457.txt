the problem was actually with the Dialog objects. the conditional is fine. at the beginning of the onClick method, i added a call to: removeDialog(DIALOG_FAIL); this forces Android to rebuild the Dialog the next time it is called. EDIT: for future reference, there is a more elegant way to do this using onPrepareDialog(), but this solution was easier for me.
