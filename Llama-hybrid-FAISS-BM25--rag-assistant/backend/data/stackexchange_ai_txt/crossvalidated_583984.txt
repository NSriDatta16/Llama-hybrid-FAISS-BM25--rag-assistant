How to group/cluster this information about consumers?

I have several millions of rows similar to those below, describing consumers(data has been modified): city road house_number postcode state fort worth sycamore school rd 5421 76123 texas fort worth sycamore school road 4750 76133 tx I want to group/cluster this data, so that people who live closer stay in the same group/cluster. My idea was to join in cell by row, creating a string, e.g. for row 1 we would have "fort worth sycamore school rd 5421 76123 texas" and then use a similarity deep learning similarity model to vectorize each sentence/row, and then apply a clustering method to those vectors. However, I found that deep learning similarity models usually use high-dimensional embeddings of 300 dim or more, and that for a clustering method seems to be highly prohibitive... Also, the similarity models that I found weren't capable of understanding that "tx" is "texas". What would you advise me to do?
