Are you using the autoencoder for classification or reconstruction? if you are pre-training the autoencoder for classification then you use the usual logloss to determine the accuracy of your classifier. If on the otherhand, if you are using the autoencoder for reconstruction, then there is no classification, and you can use something like KL divergence ( described in detail here ) to measure and track your reconstruction and compression performance.
