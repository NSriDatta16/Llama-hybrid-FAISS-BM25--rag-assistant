Grouped/Nested data in logistic regression

Update: Added more meaningful example data Setting: In my study, each of three randomly chosen readers ( A , B , C ) applies three different qualitative scores ( score1 , score2 , score3 , each an ordinal scale) to the same set of 95 cases. score1 for example is a score how the reader rates the severity of a case (1 = not severe, 10 = extremely severe). Example: Reader A rates case 1 with score1=1 , score2=7 and score3=8 , Reader B rates case 1 with score1=.. , score2=.. and score3=.. ASO For some of the cases (in the example data case 92-95) they apply the score multiple times (i.e., at different time points without a special event between the time points). Example data: library("lme4") library("tidyverse") # example data set.seed(1) df % rowwise() %>% mutate( score1=case_when(class==1 ~ sample(5:10, 1), TRUE ~ sample(1:6, 1)), score2=case_when(class==1 ~ sample(1:7, 1), TRUE ~ sample(4:10, 1)), score3=sample(1:10, 1)) -> df df 'data.frame': 300 obs. of 6 variables: #> $ reader: chr "A" "A" "A" "A" ... #> $ case : num 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... #> $ class : int 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 ... #> $ score1: int 1 1 6 10 3 9 9 1 5 4 ... #> $ score2: int 7 9 4 7 4 1 4 8 6 9 ... #> $ score3: int 8 2 1 3 2 7 10 4 1 7 ... Created on 2022-03-12 by the reprex package (v2.0.1) Created on 2022-03-12 by the reprex package (v2.0.1) Aim: Now I would like to investigate the association between the scores1-3 (independent variables) and a class (dependent variable, 1 or 0). Class could change for cases that are scored repeated times (i.e., case 92-95). I could do this with a simple logistic regression in R : glm(class ~ score1 + score2 + score3, family="binomial", data = df) However, since the data is groped/nested, I think I get too low p-values for the independent variables. Question: What analysis is most appropriate to meet the level of groping/nesting of my data? My solutions: Averaging Average each score1-3 among the readers and among the cases with multiple measurements and perform a simple logistic regression as mentioned above. Use a mixed-effects model I found some advice for nested data: Mixed Effects Model with Nesting and What is the difference between fixed effect, random effect and mixed effect models? However, since I am new to mixed-effects models I am sure which variable should be considered as fixed and random: Only reader as random effect mod1 boundary (singular) fit: # seehelp('isSingular') Reader and case as random effect mod2 boundary (singular) fit: see # help('isSingular') I think I get the warning boundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular') because the effects are very small in the test data.
