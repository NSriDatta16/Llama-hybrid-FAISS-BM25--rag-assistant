jQuery - get relative position and attribute of dropped elements

I have draggable elements which can be dropped in droppable areas. If an element is dropped, the drop function is called: $('#droppable').droppable({ scope: "items", drop: function (event, ui) { // this one is called if an element is dropped in this droppable area } }); My draggable element: Drag me ... $('.drag').draggable({ revert: "invalid", scope: "items" }); What I need to know if the element is dropped is the value of data-noteid and the relative position of the droppable area. So, if the element is dropped on the upper left corner, the x/y coordinates must be 0/0. I created a full working example here: http://jsbin.com/utivo5/2/ So normally I can access the attributes like this: alert($(this).data("noteid")); alert($(this).position().top); alert($(this).position().left); but all I get in this case is undefined . Do anyone know how I can access them? I think it must be possible with event or ui which is a parameter of the called drop function?! Thank you in advance & Best Regards, Tim.
