What is the difference between multiple regression WITH interaction, and WITHOUT interaction? (* vs + vs " vs : in lm)

I am attempting to set up a multiple regression model using "lm", but I am unsure whether to use :, + or * to indicate the interaction between multiple predictor variables. ?lm shows the following paragraph: A terms specification of the form first + second indicates all the terms in first together with all the terms in second with duplicates removed. A specification of the form first:second indicates the set of terms obtained by taking the interactions of all terms in first with all terms in second. The specification first*second indicates the cross of first and second. This is the same as first + second + first:second However, I'm not exactly sure which one to use when I what a predicted value for a specific set of predictor values. For an example from mtcars, let's say qsec is the predicted variable, with cyl, vs and gear as the predictor variables. In order to find the qsec where cyl = 4 AND vs = 0 AND gear = 3, what operator should I use in lm? (* vs + vs " vs :) Each operator, of course, yield different results using predict(). Example below: # + operator model1
