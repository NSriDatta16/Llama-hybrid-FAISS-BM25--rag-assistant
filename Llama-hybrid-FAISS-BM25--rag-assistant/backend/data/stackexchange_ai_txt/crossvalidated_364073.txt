Do discriminative models model conditional expectation?

In Machine Learning classic models like MLP, Logistic Regression or Linear Regression are called discriminative models. I frequently read that those models estimate the conditional probability distribution P(y|x) . However, if they would really represent this distribution they should be able to return multiple likely outcomes but in reality they usually return only a single y . Doesn't this mean what they actually model is not the conditional distribution, P(y|x) but the conditional expectation E[y|x] ?
