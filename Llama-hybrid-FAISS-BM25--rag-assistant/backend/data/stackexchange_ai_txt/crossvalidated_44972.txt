What is the difference between 'Laplace approximation' and 'Modified harmonic mean'?

this question is about Bayesian and computational statistics. I am learning them right now, I have two very common output from my software, one is Laplace approximation and the other is Modified harmonic mean . Both of them are used for approximation of log marginal likelihood, usually they have very close value. What are their differences? And could anyone provide me some background knowledge no these methods?
