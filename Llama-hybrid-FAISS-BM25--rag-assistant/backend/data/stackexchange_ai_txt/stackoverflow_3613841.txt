Official Google's position is that developers must use Java as a main development platform, and use C++/NDK for time- and performance-sensitive operations. Also, the only supported APIs are Java ones. I.e. Google gives you only Java API and supports only Java API. Whatever you can find on the device in native world (any shared libraries, libc etc), can and may be changed by Google or device vendors at any time without notice and so you are discouraged to use your findings. Practically standard libc functions work and probably will work all the time, but you should not rely on any device-specific libraries or lesser-known native libraries.
