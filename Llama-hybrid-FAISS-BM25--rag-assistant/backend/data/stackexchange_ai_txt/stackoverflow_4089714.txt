Sort Forum by Last Post Date

I'm working on a custom forum and I notice I was doing something wrong. I was sorting threads based on the thread date. I need to organize the threads based on the date of the last post made in the thread. I tried the following but it has issues. It lists entries multiple times. $thread_sql = "SELECT forum_threads.thread_id AS thread_id, forum_threads.thread_title AS thread_title, forum_threads.thread_description AS thread_description, forum_threads.forum_id AS forum_id, forum_threads.thread_postdate AS thread_date, forum_threads.thread_icon AS thread_icon, forum_threads.thread_views AS thread_views, forum_threads.user_id AS user_id, users.user_firstname AS user_firstname, users.user_lastname AS user_lastname FROM forum_threads INNER JOIN users ON forum_threads.user_id = users.user_id INNER JOIN forum_posts ON forum_threads.thread_id = forum_posts.thread_id WHERE forum_threads.forum_id='$_GET[f]' ORDER BY forum_posts.post_date DESC "; Any ides as to how I would order the threads based on the date of the last reply to the threads?
