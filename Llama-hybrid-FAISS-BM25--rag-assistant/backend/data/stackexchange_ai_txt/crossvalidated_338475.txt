Hirerchical Clustering

I have a time series data of weights for 5 different objects. I am attempting to do a segmentation analysis with the help of hierarchical clustering algorithm. I took daily average weights and using 30 such values as 30 input variables for distance matrix calculation and clustering. Hence I have an input matrix with 5 rows (5 objects) and 30 weight columns for 30 days (as 30 input variables) My doubt here is, is it a good practice to use the values measuring the same basic input (weights) as 30 different inputs, while using the clustering analysis.
