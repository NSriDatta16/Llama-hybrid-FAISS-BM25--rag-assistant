If you are interested in doing large-scale machine learning, at some point you will probably have to deal with large optimisation problems. In this case, the standard optimisation routines in the optimisation toolbox of matlab ( linprog , quadprog etc) will probably not suffice). In this case a commercial optimisation package solver such as CPLEX would be worth a look. Other than that, for most other ML/NLP/DM tasks the open source community pretty much has it covered.
