The jQuery documentation is very good: jQuery animate docs However, if you are trying to achieve very complex effects you will almost certainly benefit from using a different framework. jQuery is a fantastic tool - particularly with the DOM, but animation isn't its strongpoint. MooTools has a particularly good animation library (MooTools began life as a JavaScript animation framework) with a number of core modules that give you flexible tools to create complex animation chains yourself as well as a number of official and community-provided plugins. My recommendation would be to at least have a look at that first. You can certainly achieve this in jQuery but you will be making it more difficult for yourself!
