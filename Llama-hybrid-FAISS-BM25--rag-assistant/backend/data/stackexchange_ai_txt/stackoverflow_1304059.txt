IE supports inline-block, but only for elements that are natively inline. So, if you really want to use inline-block, you’re restricted to spans and strongs and ems, when a list or paragraph would perhaps make more semantic sense (and also degrade more nicely for non-CSS users.) However, if you trigger hasLayout(set hasLayout=true in that element) on a block element, and then set it to display:inline, it magically becomes an inline-block in IE! By using the property hack (which I love so well), you can hide the display:inline from all non-IE browsers effortlessly. Here’s the code, in all its brief loveliness: display:-moz-inline-stack; display:inline-block; zoom:1; *display:inline;
