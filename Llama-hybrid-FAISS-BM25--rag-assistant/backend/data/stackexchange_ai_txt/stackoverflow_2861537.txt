PCM merely means that the value of the original signal is sampled at equidistant points in time. For stereo, there are two sequences of these values. To convert them to mono, you merely take piecewise average of the two sequences. Resampling the signal at lower sampling rate is a little bit more tricky -- you have to filter out high frequencies from the signal so as to prevent alias (spurious low-frequency signal) from being created.
