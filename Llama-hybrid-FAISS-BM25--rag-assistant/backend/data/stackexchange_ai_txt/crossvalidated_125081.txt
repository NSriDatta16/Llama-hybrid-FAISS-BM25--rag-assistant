Linear SVM works well for text classification (and is very fast). The reason linear methods work well is because text classification typically has a high dimensional input space. SVM classifiers are implicitly binary. You can do multiclass classification by making several classifiers, the most common approach being one-vs-all (e.g. pick one class as positive and all others as negative and do this 7 times). Most implementations provide multiclass formulations so you don't have to worry about what it does under the hood. You can find implementations in many different packages. Not sure what software you are using at the moment, but linear SVM is available in many environments: liblinear (C++, Java) scikit-learn (Python) kernlab (R) You can probably find an SVM implementation in any language.
