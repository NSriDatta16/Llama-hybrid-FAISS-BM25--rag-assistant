Sum of squared error and point process data

One standard distance measure applied in continuous data analysis is average sum of squared error. However, this method cannot be applied for point process data. And there is an alternative solution to this problem such as applying the time-rescaling theorem. Could someone please explain to me why average sum of squared error cannot be used for the point process data?
