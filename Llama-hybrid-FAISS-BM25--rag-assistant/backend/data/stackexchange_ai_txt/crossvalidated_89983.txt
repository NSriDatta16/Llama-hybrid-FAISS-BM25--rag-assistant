Dimension of weight vectors in SVMs

For a given set of features (say with dimension a) and for a given set of labels (say m labels), how to relate the given features with the weight vector of the SVM in general? Will it be equal to product of the two dimensions always, or is it required to find the dimensions of the both the feature space and the label space and then find the resultant dimension of the weight vector?
