You can read this Using WMI, it looks to me like you're after the Win32_OperatingSystem class and the Organization element of that class holds the company name. The code below is a console app that shows the registered user and organization. To get it to run you'll need to add a reference to System.Management.dll to the project. There should only be one management object so the foreach is probably redundant, not quite sure what best practice for that would be: using System; using System.Management; namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { ManagementClass c = new ManagementClass("Win32_OperatingSystem"); foreach (ManagementObject o in c.GetInstances()) { Console.WriteLine("Registered User: {0}, Organization: {1}", o["RegisteredUser"], o["Organization"]); } Console.WriteLine("Finis!"); Console.ReadKey(); } } }
