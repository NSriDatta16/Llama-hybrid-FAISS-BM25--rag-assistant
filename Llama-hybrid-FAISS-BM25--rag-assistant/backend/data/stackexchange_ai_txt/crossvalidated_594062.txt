Assign Numbers to N-sided Die to Make the Expectation Close to the Fair Mean

I got the following question in one interview: suppose we have an N-sided die and given the probability of landing on each side, how to assign values from 1 to N, to make the expected value close to $(1+N)/2$ . For example, if we have a two-sided die and the probability of face is 1/4 and the probability of tail is 3/4, we should assign "2" to the one with 1/4 and "1" to the other to make the average 1.25. I think it may not have an analytical answer so a numeric solution suffices.
