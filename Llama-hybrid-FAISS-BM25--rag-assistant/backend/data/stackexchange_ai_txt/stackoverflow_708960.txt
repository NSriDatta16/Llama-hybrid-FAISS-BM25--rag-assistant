I see in your comments to another answer that you also want to search within the block for a string like 'QUALIFIED_CLOCK'. In that case, if your data blocks are separated by a blank line you can use Perl's paragraph mode to read it in blocks and print out the ones you are interested in. For example: perl -00 -ne 'print if /^block_name/ and /QUALIFIED_CLOCK/' file.txt This is also possible in awk by setting RS.
