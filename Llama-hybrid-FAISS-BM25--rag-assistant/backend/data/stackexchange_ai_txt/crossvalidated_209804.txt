I suggest starting with Bayesian Networks and Influence Diagrams as it contains a lot of great examples. Koller's book is the bible on this but it is quite difficult to start with. The Koller's book goes into great detail about all parts of PGMs including mathematical derivations. It contains everything one would need to know about the subject but it is very easy to get overwhelmed (it contains about 1200 pages but very few examples). The book that I mention does not go into so much details but gives you a very good overview of the subject and many worked out examples.
