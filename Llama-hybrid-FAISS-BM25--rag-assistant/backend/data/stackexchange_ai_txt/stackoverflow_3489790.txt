As far as I can see, if you use two integer parameters, all you really need to do is average the two numbers, and that's the midpoint (intersection, I guess?) int intersect(int a, int b) { return ((a + b) / 2); } Otherwise, if you are looking for bitwise intersection, you would used the bitwise-AND operator - &. Here's an example: int intersect(int a, int b) { return (a & b); }
