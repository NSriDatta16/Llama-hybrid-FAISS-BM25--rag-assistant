I would agree that roughly speaking you are right. Priors noninformative or not will lead to different solutions. The solutions will converge when the data dominates the prior. Also Jeffreys needed improper priors in some cases to match Bayesian results with frequentist results. The real difference and the controversy is philosophical. Frequentists want objectivity. The prior brings in subjective opinion. Bayesians following the teachings of Di Finetti believe that probability is subjective. For a true Bayesian priors should be informative. The other point also related to the differing concepts of probability is that probability can be assigned to an unknown parameter according to Bayesians while frequentist think strictly in term of probability spaces as given in the theory developed by Kolmogorov and von Mises. For frequentists it is only the random avriables that you can define on the probaility space that have probabilities associated with their outcomes. So the probability of getting a head on a coin toss is 1/2 because repeated flipping leads to a relative frequence of heads that converges to 1/2 as the sample size approaches infinity. For frequentists Bayes' theorem applies to events which are measureable sets in a probabilty space. The Bayesians apply it to parameters as if the parameter was a random variable. That is the frequentists objection to Bayesian methods. The Bayesians object to the frequenttist approach because it lacks a property called coherence. I will not go into that here but you can look up the definiton on the internet or read Dennis Lindley's books.
