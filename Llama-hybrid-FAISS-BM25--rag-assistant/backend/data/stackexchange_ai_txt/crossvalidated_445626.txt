How to find the values of array indices which most strongly correlate with a variable?

Say I have a list of arrays like this: A: [0, 3, 5, 3], B: [1, 3, 2, 5], ... I want to find the values in B (1, 2, or 3) that most strongly correlates with the value 0 in A (whose value is a boolean). I know I can use a correlation matrix to find correlations between pairs of indices, but I want to find correlations between one index and 3 others simultaneously. I'm looking for a search term really, not an R script because I intend to solve this in Node, but I doubt anyone here uses Node that this stuff. Update! I tried what @mzunhammer suggested, but my B is (1, 2, 3, ... 256) using his method (due to having 4 "slots" each with 4 possible values, zero to one). And my sample is only 3,000, which gives me an average of only 12 samples for each possible value of B . So I can't really decide on any winner with any real confidence. Is there some sort of statistical magic I can do to get around this problem?
