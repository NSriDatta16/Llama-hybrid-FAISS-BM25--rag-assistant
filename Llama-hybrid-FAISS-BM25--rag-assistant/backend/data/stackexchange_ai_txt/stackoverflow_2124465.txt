I ended up going the manual route, using sizeThatFits: and layoutSubviews to explicitly control how everything was redrawn and organized. I found that setAutoresizesSubviews: and setAutoresizingMask: helped for simple layouts, but that it was hard to debug if I tried anything even slightly atypical. My advice: the first time you're experimenting with programmatic layouts define sizeThatFits for all of your (sub) views and define layoutSubviews for each. Use debugging statements to log the placement of everything. Once you're happy, consider incorporating autoresizing to simply your code (if possible).
