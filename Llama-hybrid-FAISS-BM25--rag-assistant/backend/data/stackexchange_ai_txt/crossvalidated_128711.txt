There are cases when some of the original variables that were used in a PCA are no longer available (e.g. a follow-up of an old experiment or published sources not disclosing raw data). Leaving aside the question whether you should trust such (essentially unreproducible) data, letâ€™s imagine you need to use a certain PC as a predictor of a newly collected response variable, alongside a couple of raw predictor variables, which may have been used in the original PCA. In this case, you could check for correlations between individual variables and principal components you intend to use. If you had many, many raw variables, chances are that correlation of any one of them with a single PC is not very strong. But if you already had strong cross-correlations for variables going into PCA, you are likely to be overestimating them thrice. As indicated by amoeba above and below, since PCs are linear combinations of the original variables, using all the PCs alongside all raw variables that went into a PC is a meaningless exercise. And if you still have all the original variables used in PCA, it makes much more sense to do what amoeba suggested in the comment above.
