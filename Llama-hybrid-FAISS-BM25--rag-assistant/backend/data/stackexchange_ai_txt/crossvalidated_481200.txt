Time series prediction for a chaotic multivariate data

I am trying to forecast a chaotic multivariate time series, and any architecture I use ( LSTM, MLP or tried to implement Autoregression architectures from few papers like https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02971.pdf / https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07015.pdf ) I get straight line as predictions with some noise. On using a simple LSTM with LBFGS optimizer, I am able to train the data but my predictions are bad. One thing I notice is my input values are of order e-05 so I scale it up by multiplying it with 10^2 ( otherwise the loss is too low) . I tried pre-processing like MinMax and Standard Scaling which seemed to worsen my performance. Training with LBFGS and LSTM : Testing with LBFGS : Any help is appreciated. Thank you
