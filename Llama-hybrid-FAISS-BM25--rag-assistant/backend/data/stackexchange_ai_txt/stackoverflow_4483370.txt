Qt and gcov, coverage files are not generated

I am trying to obtain code coverage for a component I am writing for the Arora browser, that is written using C++ and Qt framework. I am not able to use the gcov program, neither under Gnu/Linux nor Mac Os X. I tried everything I was able to find on the Internet, also by forcing things automatically editing the Makefile generated by the .pro file. Can somebody help me please? This is my very simple pro file: TEMPLATE = app TARGET = DEPENDPATH += . INCLUDEPATH += . LIBS += -lgcov QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -g -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -O0 QMAKE_LDFLAGS += -g -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -O0 include(../autotests.pri) # Input SOURCES += tst_quickview.cpp HEADERS += The Makefile does correctly contain the flags. I also tried the --coverage option. But nothing happens. When I run the executable, no gcov files are generated. There are no errors and no warnings. I am using the QTestLib framework. Thank you
