One of the assumptions of the Huff model (which we call multinomial logit in economics) is Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives. IIA says that the ratio of red store to green store sales is independent of the existence and characteristics of all other alternatives --- it only depends on red and green store characteristics. Your intuition is that this assumption should be violated in this application. What you want is one of the alternatives to multinomial logit which relaxes the IIA assumption. There are a number of these, including multinomial probit, nested logit, and logit models using the generalized extreme value distribution, sometimes called generalized logit. There are large literatures in this in both Industrial Organization and in Marketing. Though these models are all defined at the individual level, they can be estimated with data at the market level (like total sales at each store in your example). There is a nice free online book by Kenneth Train . Actually, there are two .
