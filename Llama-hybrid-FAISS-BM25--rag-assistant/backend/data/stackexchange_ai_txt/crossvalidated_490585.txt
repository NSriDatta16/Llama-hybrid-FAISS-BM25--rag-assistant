Analyzing Relationship across Categorical Variables

I am working on some corpus data related to semantic tagging and syntactic constructions. Finally, I prepared a table of results yet I am unable to go on further due to lack of statistical knowledge. I have the table as follows; What I am trying to do is to assess relationship/correlation across columns, the ratio of if Agent = inanimate/nonpronoun then the ratio of recipient = animate/pronoun and theme = inanimate/nonpronoun etc. Can you guide me to the right way to explore the relationship among variables? I would like to create a correlation matrix table when Agent X then Recipient Y and Theme Z (strength among them?) Regards.
