Okay, thanks, I didn't pay enough attention when reading about the PropertyChangedEventArgs arguments. It seems like brittle design to rely on a string for the property name, but apparently other people think so too (from the link at the bottom of the user comments on that MSDN page you linked to). However, my second question is still unanswered: how could I debug this and find out what I did wrong? For example, doesn't WPF log its actions in some form? It should notice that I do not have a property called "Changed" on this object, why doesn't it raise an exception or at least write something to the debug console?
