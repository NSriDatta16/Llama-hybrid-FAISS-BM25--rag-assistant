Interaction visuals in logistic regression

I am running a logistic model and am looking specifically at a 3 way interaction. Here is some descriptives on my data: Outcome: mortality (y/n) Var 1: gender (M/F) Var 2: dichotomous lab value (above/ below certain critical cutoff- y/n) Var 3: second dichotomous lab value (above/ below certain critical cutoff- y/n) I am looking to see who is more at risk for the mortality outcome and have included an interaction for these terms in the model. My interaction p-value is not significant, but I want to report directions. Since I have 3 dichotomous variables, what would be the best way to present this (preferably graphically) in regards to who is more likely to experience mortality?
