Is it possible to do some form of clustering? I am actually trying to do this as well (turning a single label data to a multi-label data except my data is in the form of time series). Therefore, in my case, the time series can be transformed into a pairwise distance matrix. Then using some form of clustering method (k-means) the time series of similar shapes/patterns can be group together. Finally, each sample in each cluster can have all the labels that are currently in the same group. I am not sure will this be the correct approach as I am looking into it as well. Hopefully, there are other experts who are able to provide some insight
