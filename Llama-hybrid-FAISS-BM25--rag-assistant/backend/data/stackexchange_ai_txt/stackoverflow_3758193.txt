The short answer to your question is that there is no elegant way to do what you are trying to achieve. Word heavily separates the content of a document from its layout. As far as Word is concerned, a document doesn't have pages; rather, pages are something derived from a document by viewing it in a certain way (e.g. print view). The Pages collection belongs to the Pane interface (accessed, for example, by Application.ActiveWindow.ActivePane ), which controls layout. Consequently, there are no methods on Page that allow you to change (or delete) the content that leads to the existence of the page. If you have control over the document(s) that you are processing in your code, I suggest that you define sections within the document that represent the parts you want to programmatically delete. Sections are a better construct because they represent content, not layout (a section may, in turn, contain page breaks). If you were to do this, you could use the following code to remove a specific section: object missing = Type.Missing; foreach (Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Section section in doc.Sections) { if (/* some criteria */) { section.Range.Delete(ref missing, ref missing); break; } }
