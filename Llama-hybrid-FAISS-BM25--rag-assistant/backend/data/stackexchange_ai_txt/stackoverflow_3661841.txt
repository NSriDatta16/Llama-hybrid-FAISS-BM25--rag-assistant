The Bang operator (!) is the logical not operator found commonly in C, C++ and C#, so !0 == 1 !1 == 0 This is based on the language characteristic of what is interpreted to be either true or false... in more modern languages it would be like this !false == true !true == false See DeMorgan Law concerning truth tables...
