Effect of duplicate/redundant labels on performance of model

I am training a CNN to predict age,mass and tone from images. The structure of my dateset is as follows Person 1 20 images belonging to one person.The person's age,mass and tone remains the same in these images,with only difference being that in each image,the person has been translated by a certain amount. Person 2 Similar structure to person 1 but with different age,mass and tone . . . . Person 500 In all there are 10,000 images and 10,000 json files(that contain information about the age,mass and tone). While training the model and then testing it via R2 score,I observed that for new samples sometimes the R2 score would come out to be negative. I have tried the standard approaches to dealing with over fitting such as dropout,regularization reducing number of epochs,reducing the model.But there has been no improvement. This leads me to conclude that the presence of the extra 19 annotation files which all contain the same age,mass and tone might be responsible for over fitting,and prevents the network from learning the full distribution of the age,mass and tone parameters. As such ,I wanted to know if my approach of thinking is correct here.Does the presence of redundant training samples cause over fitting and prevent model from generalizing. Any help will be appreciated.
