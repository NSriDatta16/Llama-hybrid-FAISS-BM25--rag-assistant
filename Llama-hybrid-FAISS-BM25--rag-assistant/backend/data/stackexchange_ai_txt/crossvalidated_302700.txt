1) I suggest to NOT use threshold features as is the default in the recent version. I discourage product features, too. -- unless all potential interactions would make sense biologically/ecologically. 2) I suggest to leave the regularization as it is. Not much to gain and how to ecologically interpret any such changes? 3) I suggest NOT to rely on AUC only. Use a number of metrics such as AUC (train or test?), TSS, ORSS ( Stephenson 2000 ), and others. Also think carefully about what thresholds you use to discriminate yes/no. 4) I suggest using a large number of bootstraps or a small k cross-validation.
