Show same stored proc verbose output in a .NET that you would see in the Query Analyzer tool

The DBA displays a lot of info in his stored proc as it executes. From a Visual Studio 2003 CSharp Windows Form, when you launch a SQL Server 2000 stored procedure that returns records as well as an OUTPUT param, is it possible to display the same verbose output as you would see in the Query Analyzer tool? This is on top of showing the returned data in the datagrid. Thanks, Bert
