LINQ to SQL Classes

Is it better to have one fat data context class with all the tables in it or break them into smaller classes and potentially having "single table" classes? From organizational standpoint I feel like I shouldn't split relations over several data contexts (I don't even think it's doable). But on the other hand I think that creating a whole new instance of that fat class just to query a single, unrelated table is an overkill. What do you think?
