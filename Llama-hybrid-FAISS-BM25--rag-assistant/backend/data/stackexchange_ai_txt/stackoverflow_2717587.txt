Android App Support Options

I've got a free app I'm planning on submitting to the marketplace. Looking over the submission form I see they expect a web site or email for support. Users?! I've got to worry about users if I submit an app? I suppose I would like to get some abuse from users, but I don't want to go broke doing it. So what are my options? I have a web site--I suppose I could install forum software on it--that sounds like a lot of work though. Some apps reference a blogspot page--or I could use my Word Press site. They seems a bit disorganized for getting user feedback though.
