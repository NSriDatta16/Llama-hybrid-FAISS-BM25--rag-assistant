Regression or time series?

I need to predict the sales of a product P2. I have access to: 7 months of sales history 26 months of sales history of another product P1 I assume the sales trends are similar because the products are similar. The problems are: The sales are really impacted by the christmas period. The products are not launched in the same month of the year Question : what is the best way to predict the sales of P2 (orange curve) ? A regression (learnt from P1 and applied on P2) : log(sales) = bo +b1*Aging of the product +b2*DecemberFlag ? Problem: after the Christmas effect, sales never recover the previous trend, i.e the sales stay higher. This is why maybe time series fit more with this problem. A time series (learnt from P1 and applied on P2) : How will it manage the seasonality since I don't have a full period for P2? i.e. how can the model predict the sales of P2 in December 2015 since it can't recover the sales in December 2014
