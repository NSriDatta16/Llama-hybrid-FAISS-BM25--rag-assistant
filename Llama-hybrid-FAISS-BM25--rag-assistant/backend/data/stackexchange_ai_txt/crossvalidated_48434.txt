Limits to tree-based ensemble methods in small n, large p problems?

Tree-based ensemble methods such as Random Forest, and subsequent derivatives (e.g., conditional forest), all purport to be useful in so-called "small n , large p " problems, for identifying relative variable importance. Indeed, this appears to be the case, but my question is how far can this ability be taken? Can one have, say 30 observations and 100 variables? What is the breaking point to such an approach, and are there any decent rules of thumb that exist? I'd prefer and will accept answers backed by links to actual evidence (not conjecture), using either simulated or real data sets. I haven't found much on the latter ( here and here ), so your thoughts/advice/(on topic) reference suggestions are most welcome!
