Here are some ways to test whether your understanding of the calculations is correct: Take a few of the training cases and calculate the prediction as you think. Then compare with the fitted values from the help page. If you use the full PCA model (all loadings), the PCA performs only a rotation of the data. The predictions based on all scores should match the predictions by least squares regression on the original data. You can do the PCR in one or two steps: to find out whether your one-step prediction directly from original data to the fitted value is correct, compare it with the two step procedure of first calculating scores for the new data followed by predicting y from the scores. Note that if the PCA fitting routine centers (and possibly scales) the data, you need to do that with your new cases as well. And yes, if the regression is set up to predict y - mean (y) , then the predicted values will be centered by the mean of the y s. You then need to center and possibly scale X by the center and scaling calculated on the training X , the same applies to y .
