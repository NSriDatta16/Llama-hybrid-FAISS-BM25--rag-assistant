What is the best way to display a hierarchy of choices in an ASP.net Forms Application?

I am working on an ASP.net Forms Application that keeps track of information about different offices in an organization. The offices are organized into a hierarchy. Some users of the program will have access to certain information about all offices in the hierarchy. Some users of the program will have access to only a small part of the hierarchy. When a user browses for information they are authorized to see, I would like to present the user with a prompt to choose which office in the hierarchy they wish to see information from. I want to accomplish the following: A) I want the user to be able to easily navigate the hierarchy of the organization to locate a specific office. B) I want the user to be able to navigate the hierarchy without refreshing the page. C) I want my interface to be able to handle a hierarchy at least four layers deep with less than 100 nodes. I see that Microsoft includes a TreeView control in the standard collection of ASP web controls. Would Treeview be the most appropriate tool for what I want to do, or is there a better way?
