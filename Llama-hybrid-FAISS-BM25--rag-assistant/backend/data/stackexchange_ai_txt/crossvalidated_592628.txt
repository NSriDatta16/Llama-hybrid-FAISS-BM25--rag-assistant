How to calculate the MLE for Gilbert's Sine Distribution?

$$ f(x) = \frac{\pi}{2b}\sin\left(\pi\frac{x-a}{b}\right),~~x\in[a,a+b]$$ So it's a pretty simple distribution, which is just a scaled sine wave. As an experiment, I was trying to find the MLE estimates of $a$ and $b$ but I can't find it for $b$ and the result for $a$ doesn't seem to work. Intuitively, you want to move $a$ and $b$ closer to the point $x. $ $$\frac{\partial\textrm{ MLE}}{\partial a}=-\frac{\pi^2\cos\left(\pi\frac{x-a}{b}\right)}{2b^2};$$ root/zero found at $a = \frac{2x+b}2.$ $$\frac{\partial\textrm{ MLE}}{\partial b}=-\frac{\pi\cdot \left(\sin\left(\pi\frac{x-a}{b}\right)b+ (\pi x-\pi a) \cos\left(\pi\frac{x-a}{b}\right)\right)}{2b^3}.$$
