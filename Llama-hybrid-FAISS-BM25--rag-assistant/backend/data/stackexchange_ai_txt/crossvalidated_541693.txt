Here's one place where KDE is more convenient than ECDF: inverse CDF technique for PRNG . Yes, you can in principle use ECDF too, but since ECDF is step function, its inverse is not continuous either, so you have to do some sort of interpolation between the observations. It's not as elegant as KDE.
