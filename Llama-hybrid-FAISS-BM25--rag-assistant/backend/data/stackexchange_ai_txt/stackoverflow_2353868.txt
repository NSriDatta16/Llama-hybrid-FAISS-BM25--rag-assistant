Suggestions for first-time sourceforge project contributer?

Hey all. I'm a professional software developer here in Seattle, WA USA. I program for/work in a Windows shop, but I've recently began considering contributing to an Open Source project, specifically one under the Python License (CNRI Python License). I realize that contacting a human resources representative where I work is the first step, but could any existing source forge contributors give me any advice?
