DateJS will parse all sorts of different strings, but you probably don't need it if you're just doing something small time. A split/parse/rebuild IMO is more elegant than attaching another script to your page: var dStr = '2010-05-11'.split('-'); var d = new Date(dStr[0], dStr[1] - 1, dStr[2]); Just remember the month parameter for Date() is zero-based, whereas the date parameter isn't. Weird, I know.
