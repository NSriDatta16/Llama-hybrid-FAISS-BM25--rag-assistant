treeinterpreter / feature selection with multidimensional data

In python i have been using treeinterpreter on 2d data. It has worked well and enabled me to look into the blackbox to understand what is going on. I am interested in the why than the predicted output. However, a new set of data is given to me daily. It is the same categorised data every day but some of it is dynamic. This however has added a new dimension of time. It is not as important as the features / categories but still has an effect. What is the best way of dealing with this so i can still look into the tree / svm / etc....i am not too fussed which one. It may be i need to stack the models in order to get the insight - but i am unsure. example of the data on one day below - the price change and rating can changes daily. Wine Country Area Grape Class Year Price Rating A France Burgundy Pinot Noir Grand 2014 +6% 94 B France Burgundy Chardonnay 1er 2014 -1% 91 C France Burgundy Pinot Noir 1er 2014 +4% 96 D USA California Pinot Noir 2013 +1% 92 E USA California Blend 2014 +0.5% 88 F USA California Chardonnay 2014 -4% 81 G USA California Chardonnay 2013 -5% 91
