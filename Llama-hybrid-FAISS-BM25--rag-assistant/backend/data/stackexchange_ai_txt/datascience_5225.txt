Data science is a new somewhat vague terminology. You will find much more information by using keywords such as: epidemiology, population health, public health surveillance, public health, statistics, evidence based medicine, biostatistics, statistical epidemiology, clinical decision making, interventions etc. The question as posted is overly broad. On the other hand you're in luck since there is a substantial amount of information on this topic. Many of the R/Data Science courses on Coursera from John Hopkins have a public health flavor. Also, R and S-PLUS before it were primarily used in health settings.
