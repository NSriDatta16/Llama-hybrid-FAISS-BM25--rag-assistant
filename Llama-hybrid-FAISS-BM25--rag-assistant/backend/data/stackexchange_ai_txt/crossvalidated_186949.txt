How can the Poisson GLM be used instead of logistic regression for the Titanic survival data?

I have a professor who made a very good point about the data titanic analysis during a lecture this week. I am still however trying to better understand. He argued that it is also possible to have a model of titanic data (GLM) using Poisson rather than the typical Binomial approach. I am curious to know what other people views are. His focus was on the Research Question: What characteristic of passengers survived more than others. (i) The examination of how survival of the passengers relates to their age, sex and passenger requires the use rate=Survived/passenger. I initially thought that this would be binomial rather than poisson. Each event either does or does not happen. There are no multiple events. However, the lecturer argued about the count data structure. I would really appreciate whether someone could explain why Poisson would work as well.
