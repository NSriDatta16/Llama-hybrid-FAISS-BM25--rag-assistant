C# Piccolo ZUI - Squiggles only when CTRL wiggles?

I am using the Piccolo 2D ZUI library in a C# Winform application. One of the examples that the library shows is adding a squiggle (line drawing) handler to the canvas. The problem is that if you enable the squiggle handler and allow canvas dragging then both events occur at the same time. What I would like to do is inherit the PDragEventhandler so that it only runs when the CTRL is not pressed down. Then when the CTRL key is pressed down the squiggler will run (I got this figured out). The code used for the drag handler is: InitializeComponent(); //add input event listener pCanvas1.AddInputEventListener(new PDragEventHandler()); Can I inherit the PDragEventhandler and then say only run when CTRL not pressed? Or do I need to recompile the Piccolo library to enable this feature?
