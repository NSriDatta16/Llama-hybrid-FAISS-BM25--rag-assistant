Trained CNN individually on multiple images to classify them, how can I now classify a related "set" of these images that correspond to one object?

I have a N object classification examples, each example consisting of a set M individual images of the object at different angles. I've trained M CNNs with the dataset of one particular image angle each and their corresponding label. (Thus I have M sets of model parameters I've discovered for each angle) Now given this information, what is a good approach to classifying a new single object based on it's set of M individual image angles? (i.e I can classify with some decent accuracy what each individual image is in the set, but is there a method I can use the feature-dependency of images that belong to the same unique example set to make an overall "better" prediction than just taking the average of all the individual probabilities?)
