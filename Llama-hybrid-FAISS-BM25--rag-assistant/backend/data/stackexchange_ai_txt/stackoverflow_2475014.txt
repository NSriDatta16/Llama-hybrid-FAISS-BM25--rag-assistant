Is there a significant problem? It depends on how you program. If you comment liberally, and organize your code well, then no - you won't have problems. It depends on the debugging capabilities of your development environment. If it is not easy to use, you will have problems tracking down bugs. If I'm not mistaken, arm-uclibc is a C compiler?
