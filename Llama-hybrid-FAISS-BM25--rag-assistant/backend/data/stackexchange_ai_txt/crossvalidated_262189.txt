Actions have different operation time in reinforcement learning

I would like to apply reinforcement learning method to a complicated problem which has a lot of action. And each action also has a different operating time. It means the time to switch to the next state is different for each action. I don't know how to design this experiment. Do I need to regard operation time as the part of state? Or I don't need to consider this?
