Actually, you was correct for h264 stream, if the NAL value (first byte) is 0x7C it means that the I-Frame is fragmented. No other frames (P and B) can be fragmented, so if there is packetization-mode=1 in SDP , then it means that the I-Frames are fragmented, and therefore if you read 0x7C as first byte, then it is I-Frame.
