Make a question if you change a page

i'm new to starckoverflow. I'm trying to stop to change the current page. I have an order page, with a lot of field that are updated on line. I would like to make a question if your move to previous page, or if you click any other url, so i can show something like : Attention !!! if you continue you will lost all data already inserted. So i can erase all data already inserted in db. Is possible to do this ? I'm working with aspx page in VB Thanks to all Alex
