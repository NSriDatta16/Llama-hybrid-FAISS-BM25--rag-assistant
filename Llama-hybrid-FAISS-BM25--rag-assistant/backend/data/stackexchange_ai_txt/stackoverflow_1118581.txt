Redirect mobile devices to alternate version of my site

We've got an alternate version of out website ready for mobile devices. The content we serve is different and it works well. What is the best way to detect which version to serve. We don't have a list of all mobile devices so to use the user-agent header is tricky as we may miss something. We thought about useing device screen width - but what happens if the mobile device doesnt support javascript. How do we sniff this ?
