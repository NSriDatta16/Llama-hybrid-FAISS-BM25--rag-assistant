Hypothesis vs Hyperplane in Machine Learning

I am finding it hard to understand the clear difference between Hypothesis and Hyperplane. I know that Hypothesis is a candidate model that maps inputs to outputs after training. And, Hyperplane is the decision boundary in a classification algorithm. But, I can't seem to understand how the two are differentiated in equations. Can someone help me understand their differences in equations with some visualizations?
