You can only make saving content from your site more difficult - not impossible. You can also make traditional download managers mostly useless. If your computer can play it, however, there will be a way to capture it, even if it involves plugging the speaker output to a separate audio recording device. A few approaches that you can use either alone or even together: Use single-use or time-restricted URLs - this will mostly guard against hot-linking from external sites Use session cookies so that download managers without access to the browser cookies cannot be used. Use CAPTCHAs to filter out any automated bots. Use a custom streaming protocol and associated player. Use encryption - and watch your server CPU load. Whatever you do, you'd better think very carefully about a few things: Whether employing such measures will make your site harder to use, inconveniencing your users. Whether you will create compatibility issues that will enrage your (potentially paying) users. Whether proprietary streaming protocols are worth the development and maintenance cost, in relation to the abuse that you are seeing. It all depends on the kind of abuse that you are seeing (or suspect that is happening) and the benefit-to-cost ratio of each approach.
