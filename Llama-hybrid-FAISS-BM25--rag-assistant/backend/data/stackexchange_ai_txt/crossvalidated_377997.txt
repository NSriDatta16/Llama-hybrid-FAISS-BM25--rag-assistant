NA coefficients produced by clogit model

I am trying to run a conditional logistic regression using clogit() from the survival package. The binary response variable is subject disease status and the main predictor of interest is a score between 1 and 5. However, when I add extra co-variates that are factors to the model, their coefficients are always NA . This problem does not occur with co-variates that are continuous and numeric and the model runs properly. Other answers I have found suggest that the reason for this is singularity (the linear dependence of the co-variate upon another variable). However, I only have the binary response, the predictor of interest and the case-control match in strata() , none of which seem related to the problematic factors. Also, other answers relate to other functions such as lm and glm . I can't find any mention of this problem with clogit . Here is the output when I include participant sex (factor) in the model. Call: coxph(formula = Surv(rep(1, 959L), ST) ~ WCR + Sex + strata(Pair), data = dat, method = "exact") n= 959, number of events= 480 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(>|z|) WCR -0.23490 0.79065 0.07411 -3.17 0.00153 ** Sex2 NA NA 0.00000 NA NA --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 WCR 0.7906 1.265 0.6838 0.9142 Sex2 NA NA NA NA Rsquare= 0.011 (max possible= 0.489 ) Likelihood ratio test= 10.35 on 1 df, p=0.001 Wald test = 10.05 on 1 df, p=0.002 Score (logrank) test = 10.25 on 1 df, p=0.001 Apologies if I'm missing something obvious.
