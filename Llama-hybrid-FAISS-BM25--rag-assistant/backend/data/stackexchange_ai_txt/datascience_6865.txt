Logistic Regression in R models for 1 or 0?

According to this link , it says SAS models for 0, To model 1s rather than 0s, we use the descending option. We do this because by default, proc logistic models 0s rather than 1s What happens in case of R's glm function? Does it model for 1 or 0? Is there a way to change it? Does it matter?
