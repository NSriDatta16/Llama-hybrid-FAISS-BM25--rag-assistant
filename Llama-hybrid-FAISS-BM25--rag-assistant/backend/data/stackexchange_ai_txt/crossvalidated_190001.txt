You might want to consider forecastable component analysis (ForeCA) , which is a dimension reduction technique for time series, specifically designed to obtaina lower dimensional space that is easier to forecast than the original time series. Let's look at an example of monthly sunspot numbers and for computational efficiency let's just look at the 20th century. yy Sunspot numbers are only a univariate time series $y_t = (y_1, \ldots, y_T)$, but we can turn this into a multivariate time series by embedding it its lagged $(p+1)$-dimensional feature space $X_t = \left(y_t, y_{t-1}, \ldots, y_{t-p}\right)$. This is a common technique in non-linear time series analysis. XX In R you can use the ForeCA package to do the estimation. Note that this requires the multivariate spectrum of a $K$-dimensional time series with $T$ observations, which is stored in a $T \times K \times K$ array (one can use symmetry/Hermitian property to half the size). Hence it takes considerably longer to compute than iid dimension reduction techniques (such as PCA or ICA). So here we take the 24-dimensional time series of embedded sunspot numbers and try to find a 6-dimensional subspace that has interesting patterns that can be easily forecasted. library(ForeCA) # this can take several seconds mod.foreca The biplot shows that the first component all points in the same direction, which is telling us that this component will be the overall/average pattern. The barplots on the right show how the forecastable components (ForeCs) have indeed decreasing forecastability, and the first component is more forecastable than the original series. In this example, all original series have the same forecastability, as we used the embedding. For general multivariate time series, this is not the case. Now what do these series look like? mod.foreca$scores Indeed, the first component is more forecastable than the original series, since it is less noisy. The remaining series also show very interesting patterns, that are not visible in the original series. Note that all ForeCs are orthogonal to each other, i.e., they are uncorrelated. round(cor(mod.foreca$scores), 3) ## ForeC1 ForeC2 ForeC3 ForeC4 ## ForeC1 1 0 0 0 ## ForeC2 0 1 0 0 ## ForeC3 0 0 1 0 ## ForeC4 0 0 0 1 The spectrum of each series also gives a good idea of the different ForeCs [sic!] in sunspot activity. spec
