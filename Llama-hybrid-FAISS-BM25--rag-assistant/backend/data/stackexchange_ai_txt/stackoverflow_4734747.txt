Just to add another dimension to the answers, this is a classic build vs buy decision :-) If you want to build, by all means do it yourself. However if you would rather just focus on your game, there are plenty of libraries out there that you could leverage for this functionality: Farseer Physics ( http://farseerphysics.codeplex.com/ ), focused on 2D, perfect IMO for what you describe above Physics2D ( http://sites.google.com/site/physics2d/ ) JigLibX ( http://jiglibx.codeplex.com/ ) There's a really good list of other engines which will likely be more comprehensive than what I could provide in an SO answer on XNA Wiki: http://www.xnawiki.com/index.php?title=Physics_Engine
