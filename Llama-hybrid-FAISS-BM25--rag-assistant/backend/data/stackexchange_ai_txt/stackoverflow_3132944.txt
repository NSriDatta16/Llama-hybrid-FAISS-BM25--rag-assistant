JavaEE6+REST: How do I get all REST resources at runtime?

Is there a possibility to get a list of all registered REST resources at runtime? With REST resources I mean: either classes which have annotations such as @Path(...) and are considered by the server at runtime (so traversing all classes using reflection would not do), or URIs of all paths (REST class can have multiple paths). NOTE 1: I am using automatic configuration (that new feature of JavaEE 6) and Netbeans just generates an empty ApplicationConfig class. NOTE 2: Using Netbeans 6.9, JavaEE 6, Glassfish 3. Is more information on my ecosystem needed?
