Use lookaheads to do the "at least one" stuff. Trust me, it's much easier. Here's an example that would require 1-10 characters, containing at least one digit and one letter: ^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[A-Za-z])[A-Za-z0-9]{1,10}$ Note : I could have used \w , but then ECMA/Unicode considerations come into play, increasing the character coverage of the \w "word character".
