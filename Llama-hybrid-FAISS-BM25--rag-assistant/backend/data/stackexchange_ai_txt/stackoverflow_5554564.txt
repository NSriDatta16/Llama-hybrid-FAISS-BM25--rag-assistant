As far as I know there is no alternative (yet) so you are stuck with DOMAttrModified which is only supported in Firefox and Opera. In IE you have the onpropertychanged event but there is no way to get similar functionality in Chrome/Safari. There are a number of things you could do depending on what you are trying to accomplish and the browsers you are targetting: define getters and setters to the attributes you want to monitor override methods like document.createAttribute , attributes.setNamedItem , ... I've been working on a cross-browser solution myself but without much success. You should stay away from mutation events all together since they are not cross-browser and very slow. There are good reasons why they are deprecated.
