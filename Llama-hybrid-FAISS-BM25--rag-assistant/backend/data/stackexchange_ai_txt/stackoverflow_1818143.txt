Flex embed dynamically

In one project, I have several similar applications, they just differ slightly here and there. Like some of the contained icons/images. To help organizing, I see myself [Embed]ing icons in a style like below, however the use of variables in the [Embed] metatag doesn't work. The below code is contained in a custom component, so I easily should be able to set different icons per application including the component. How do I get around this problem? public var iconBase:String = "/icons/red/"; [Embed(iconBase + "play.png")] [Bindable] public var icon_play:Class; [Embed(iconBase + "stop.png")] [Bindable] public var icon_stop:Class;
