mixed standard deviation

I have a high school student I am tutoring who has this question. boys age 3 mean weight 35.0, standard error 0.4 girls age 3 mean weight 33.4 standard error 0.5 the class of 3 year olds has 5 boys and 3 girls, what is the mean weight and standard deviation of the class. I have looked at the other similar questions in solving the standard deviation but those give answers far more advanced than a high school student would be required to know. I attempted to answer this question with the following methodology: standard deviation boys = standard error X sqrt (5) = 0.4 X 2.24 = .896 standard deviation of girls = standard error x sqrt (3) = 0.5 x 1.73 = .865 Here is where I am tempted to use a weighted average of = 5/8 x .896 + 3/8 x .865 Im almost positive this cant be the way to find the combined standard deviation but this is a high school AP question so it cant require rigorous algebra above the high school level.
