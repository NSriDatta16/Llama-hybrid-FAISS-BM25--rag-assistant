How to cluster when samples are independent and/or dimensions are not independent for each sample?

In machine learning, one can use Euclidean distance to measure a cluster $$ \mu\in R^k, $$ over data points $$ \{x_i\}^N_{i=1}\in R^{k\times N}, $$ with the measure $$ \text{error}_i = ||\mu-x_i||^2_2 $$ The total error can be calculated as $$ \text{error} = \sum^N_{i=1}error_i $$ To estimate the parameters, one formulates the optimization problem $$ \min_{\mu_{new}} \big{(}\text{error}\big{)} $$ This has two underlying assumptions: first, that samples are independent, and, second, that the dimensions are independent for each sample. Can anyone explain how I should analyze when either or both assumptions are not satisfied?
