A cross-correlation will be a better approach than your average absolute difference although there are some obvious problems to be wary of - if the current year has exactly twice the snow every day of some reference year it is perfectly correlated for example (this could still be useful info of course). Your general approach is not a common one for forecasting in this situation, although it will not deliver insane results. Better ways would use the information in all 50 years efficiently, rather than just finding the "best" year and using that as a model. You may wish to do some more reading on forecast methods - there is plenty of Matlab-specific material on this on the web - although it quickly gets very complex.
