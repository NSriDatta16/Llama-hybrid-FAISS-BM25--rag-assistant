How to make a WPF Window to blink on the taskbar?

A given moment my WPF app needs user attention. I know it is possible to make the Windows 7 taskbar icon to flash with a yellow color. I tried so far: Window.Activate Attempts to bring the window to the foreground and activates it. Window.Focus Attempts to set focus to this element. Any suggestions?
