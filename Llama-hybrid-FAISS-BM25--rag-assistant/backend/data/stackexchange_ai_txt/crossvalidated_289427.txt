Dealing with extreme shocks like global recession in time series

I'm following Rob Hyndman's forecasting otext to practice on some financial data for fun and I am having difficulties in trying to properly deal with large shocks similar to the 2008 recession. My data is as follows: library(forecast) stock I can somewhat make out a cycle that occurs every 6 years with no observable seasonality, but this damped exponential smoothing method is forecasting a flatted trend line. My issue is that the prediction intervals seem to be too large, mainly due to the drop in 1999, and need a way to curb that influence. One simple method I was pondering was to impute the data during this large climb and drop by using a moving average and run the model that way. I'd really appreciate any thoughts or guidance! Thanks
