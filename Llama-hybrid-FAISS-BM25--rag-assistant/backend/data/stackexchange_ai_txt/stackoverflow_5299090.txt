Do you understand that what you are doing violates several best practices? If you do, or you don't care, then take a look at the Session object. Session Object Session.Property("MYPROP" ) Get; Set; If you didn't know and/or you do care, then realize that 1) Script custom actions are fragile and 2) MSI is declarative not imperative. You shouldn't reinvent the wheel with a custom action soemthing that can be done natively using the Registry table .
