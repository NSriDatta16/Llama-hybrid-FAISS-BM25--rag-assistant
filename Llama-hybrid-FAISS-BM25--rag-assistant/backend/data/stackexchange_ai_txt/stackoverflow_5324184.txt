Try to understand how the Linux Serial Driver Layers are working and organized . Determine which serial chip (driver) your device is using. Hack the bit-banging GPIO into the low-lever driver. OR: Maybe you can abuse another signal line instead of a GPIO. If you operate your UART in RS485 mode, mostly the RTS behaves like you want -> high during transmission. I'm not sure if the rest of the communication would be rs232-compliant, but why not just try.
