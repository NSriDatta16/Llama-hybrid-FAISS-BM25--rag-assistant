Bayesian updating with multiple priors and multiple likelihood functions

$\Omega$ (finite) state space, $S$ (finite) signal space. Suppose we have a closed and convex set of priors $\mathcal{M}\subseteq \Delta(\Omega)$ such that each of them has full support. Let $\mathcal{L}\subseteq \{l:\Omega\to \Delta(S)\}$ be a closed and convex set of likelihood functions. Fix $s\in S$ and let $Pos(s)=\{\mu'\in \Delta(\Omega)|\mu'$ is the posterior generated by bayesian updating of some prior $\mu\in \mathcal{M}$ , and $l\in \mathcal{L}$ conditional on $s\}$ . My question is: is $Pos(s)$ convex?
