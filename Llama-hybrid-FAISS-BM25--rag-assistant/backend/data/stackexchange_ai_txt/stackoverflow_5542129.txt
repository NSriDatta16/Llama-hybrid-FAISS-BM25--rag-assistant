Using Fiddler, I was able to see that when items are being added to a Marketing List, it's done as a POST, not a GET request. The URL format was: /{organizationName}/_grid/cmds/dlg_addtolist.aspx?iObjType={entityTypeCodeOfItemToBeAdded} &iTotal=1&iIndex=2&itemObjectId={guidOfTheList}&itemObjectTypeCode=4300 &iId={guidOfTheItemToBeAdded} Each item to be added to the list had a separate POST created.
