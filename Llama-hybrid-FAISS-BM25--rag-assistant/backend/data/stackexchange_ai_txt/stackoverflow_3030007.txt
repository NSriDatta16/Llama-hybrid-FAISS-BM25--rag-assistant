As AraK points out, the string storage might not be contiguous, though this is unlikely. You could also consider using a vector: if (SUCCEEDED(pInterface->GetSize(&size)) { std::vector vtmp( size ); if (SUCCEEDED(pInterface->GetValue( & vtmp[0], size))) { std::wstring str = & vtmp[0]; // or maybe don't bother with the string - just use the vector } } which is more likely to be exception safe.
