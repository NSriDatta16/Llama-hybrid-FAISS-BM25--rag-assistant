Discrete time Markov Chain - Long-term frequency

Let's say I have the following scenario: A mouse is put into a maze that's constructed as below: There are 9 rooms with connections between the rooms as indicated with a "gap" in the "walls". Assume the mouse moves through the rooms at random and that self-transitions are allowed. That is, if there are $k$ ways to leave a room (or stay in the same room), it chooses each of these with equal probability. Question: What is the long-term expected fraction of time the mouse spends in each room?
