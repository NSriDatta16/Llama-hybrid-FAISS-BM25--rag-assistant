Data Science Interview Question - Build a model to Predict the Class of the Output

I recently attended an Interview and I was asked this question by the Interviewer. Question : There are 100 books, 90 of the books belong to category A and 10 of the books belong to category B. Build a model to make sure that the output is more than 90 percent. Explain Which model would you select and how would you evaluate the model output. My answer was based on Na√Øve-Bayes as I believed it has got an unbalanced classifier and it is more related to the SPAM identifier technique. Kindly share your thoughts.
