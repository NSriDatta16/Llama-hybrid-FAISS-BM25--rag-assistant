Why are my chi squared results and logistic regression so much different?

Ok, backstory: Per my understanding, based on stuff like this , chi squared tests and logistic regressions can often be used for fairly similar purposes. That's not to say they should have the same results, I could see p-values and stuff being different, but if its a 2x2 table, they can both be used, and it really just depends on the question you want to answer . Well.... based on that understanding, allow me to introduce my data and my question: We collected information on a group of people, including whether they spoke spanish as their primary language, and whether they were given instructions in that primary language. Here's that data (and the chi-squared test my R package automatically applies. I blacked out some of the unnecessary data): Given it was 71% vs 100%, the significant chi squared makes sense to me, and I would expect a logistic regression to see SOMETHING there. Well given this R code: reg I get these results: Not even close to significant. What am I misunderstanding? Edit based on comment Added a screenshot of the structure of my data, couldn't post the whole thing here:
