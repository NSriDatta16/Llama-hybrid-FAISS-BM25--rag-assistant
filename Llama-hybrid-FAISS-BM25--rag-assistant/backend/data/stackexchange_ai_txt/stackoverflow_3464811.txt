If given the task to write hello world in C#... using reflection, what are some clever ways to use reflection?

I've been given a "for fun" challenge to write a "hello world" application. The only condition is that I use reflection, there is no specified way this condition must be met, but clever or elegant or "cool" uses are fun. Aside from injecting an external library or doing some sort of IHelloWorldMessageProvider composition container mojo, I don't see a lot of options. Someone care to enlighten me?
