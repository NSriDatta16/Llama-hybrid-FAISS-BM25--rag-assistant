feature embedding for categorical features

I'm training a model and among the features, I have the language of the users. Right now I have done one-hot encoding on the language feature. But I think it would make more sense to have the language as an embedding since some of the languages are close to each other (e.g. Portuguese and Spanish) and should be taken into account in my recommendations. I'm wondering how I can do that?
