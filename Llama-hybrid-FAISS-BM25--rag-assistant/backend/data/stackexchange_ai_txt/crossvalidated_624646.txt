I don't think the analysis is doable based on the description. But the simplest statistical point can be addressed. You say you do a "count" analysis, but you actually do a $t$ -test based on 0/1 counts of individual annual incidence of crime (1=crime victim that year, 0 =not a crime victim that year). In that case, if in 2020 there were 10 violent crimes among 10,000 people whereas in 2021 there were 20 violent crimes among 10,000 people, you seem to desire to estimate that crime has doubled. However, the t-test would show the proportion was 0.001 in 2020 and 0.002 in 2021 for an absolute risk difference of 0.001 or a 0.1% absolute change. $t$ -tests model means and the mean is going to be small. Modeling changes in rare and untoward circumstances usually requires that we measure the result on a log scale so that the effect estimate is a relative risk difference . You could use a logistic regression model since the odds ratio is approximately the relative risk ratio. In this case; $$ OR = (20 / (10000 - 20)) / (10 / (10000 - 10) \approx 2$$ I think a far superior model would be a quasipoisson regression model, a generalization of the log linear model which is conservative with standard error calculation since the analysis sets are not truly independent between separate years (there are a lot of subjects who are just not going to be victims of crime, and so we model the variance as proportional to the mean and get valid inference).
