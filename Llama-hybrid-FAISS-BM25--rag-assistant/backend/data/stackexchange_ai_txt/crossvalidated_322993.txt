Comparing feature contribution in supervised classification

I’m doing supervised classification (SVM and KNN) with Scikit learn and I would like to compare how well each of my 30 features contribute to make the classification succeed. I use the SelectKBest class to get the respective scores of all my features (although I don’t want to reduce the number of features as SelectKBest is intended to be used for). Here is how I get the feature scores : selectkbest=SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif,k="all") selectkbest.fit(X,y) scores=selectkbest.scores_ I don't understand how these scores are computed. The scikit documentation only says that the function f_classif returns ANOVA f-values but I was not able to understand what it corresponds to. Is there other ways I could compare the efficiency of my features ?
