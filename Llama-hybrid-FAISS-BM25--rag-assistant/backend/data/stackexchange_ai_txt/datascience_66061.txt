Feeding large dataset to neural network using tf

I have a csv file of size ~11GB contains 2 million rows located in my local disk as my training data. What's the best way to feed the data to a neural network model? I use tf.keras to build the neural network and my RAM doesn't allow me to import as a single np array. Thank you.
