Time Series Theorem

Consider the following theorem: Theorem. For any sequence of autocovariances $\{ \lambda_k \}$ generated by a stationary process, there exists a function $F$ such that $$\lambda_k = \int_{(-\pi, \pi]} e^{ik \lambda} dF(\lambda)$$ where $F$ is the unique function on $[-\pi, \pi]$ satisfying $F(-\pi) = 0$ $F$ is non-decreasing and right continuous For any $0 \leq a \leq b \leq \pi$ we have $F(b)-F(a) = F(-a)-F(-b)$. Then $F$ is called the spectral distribution function. So basically, given a set of autocovariances (e.g. $\{E(X_{t}X_{t+1}), E(X_{t}X_{t+2}), \dots, E(X_{t}X_{t+10}) \}$), we can express each of these autocovariances in terms of the spectral distribution function? Added. What is the purpose of the this theorem?
