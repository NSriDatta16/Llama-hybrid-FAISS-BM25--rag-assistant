Which version of CalendarDateSelect are you using? I have version 1.15. I found something similar in the bug tracker . Maybe you have an old version and if you update it will be fixed? I have tried in my app using CalendarDateSelect in a form builder with embedding and it works. true %> I get this on the page // Make sure you put the includes at the top of your page/layout
