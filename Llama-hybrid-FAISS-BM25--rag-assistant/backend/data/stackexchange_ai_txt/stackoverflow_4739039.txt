Got an answer from the wix-users mailing list. Rob Mensching: "Adding custom actions in patches doesn't work out so well. Patches essentially apply transform to the existing MSI then repair the MSI. In the case of uninstalling a patch, the transform is removed and the MSI is repaired. Obviously, if the custom action is removed with the transform then it has no chance to run. The Windows Installer does special magic to keep track of the state of the MSI before and after the transform so they can properly remove data." They also talked about how there was a feature in MSI 4.5 that may let you do it but WIX needed to stay compatible with earlier versions and there were still some data storage problems around it. So in short, custom actions on patch uninstall don't work in WIX.
