jQuery History Plugin Error: $.history is undefined

I'm not exactly a novice, but I can't for the life of me figure out why something so simple isn't working. I'm getting an error $.history is undefined when trying to run this jQuery plugin... http://www.mikage.to/jquery/jquery_history.html here is my page... http://hupcapstudios.com/includeTest/getit.php can anyone tell me what I'm missing? EDIT: (BTW. Using FF 3.5 on Mac and reading the error in Error Console)
