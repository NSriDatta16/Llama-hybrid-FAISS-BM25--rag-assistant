Yes, you can use a Logistic Regression model with L1 penalization as your ensemble classifier. We will call that your Level 1 Model. This will give a final predicted class probability for each sample. The features of this ensemble learner (Level 1) are essentially the predicted probabilities for every sample from each of your Level 0 models. In other words, each feature of the Level 1 learner is a model from Level 0. While performing CV training/test maintain the same fold assignments for each level to try and prevent overfitting. In addition, it is imperative while testing an ensemble learner to keep a validation set, or a hold out set, that the Level 0 and Level 1 models have never seen. Not sure if there is an out of the box solution included with scikit-learn, but easy enough to write your own.
