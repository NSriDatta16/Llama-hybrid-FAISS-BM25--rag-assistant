I will just use the mvn dependency:tree plugin to generate a text file with the dependency tree. Then I will parse that in and create the dependency tree/graph from that. I will get the scope of the artifact, groupId, artifactId, version, and its parent. I successfully implemented this type of lookup, it simply takes the dependency output, parses it and organizes dependencies simply using the indentation, nothing fancy. The artifact, group, version, and scope are easily parsed since the separator is a :. Walter
