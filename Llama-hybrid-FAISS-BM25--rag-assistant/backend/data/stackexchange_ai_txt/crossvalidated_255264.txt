Formula for a differenced time series is $Y'_{t} = Y_{t}-Y_{t-1}$. For a stationary time series $Y'_{t}$ should be random noise so $\epsilon_{t}$. So the differenced time series becomes $\epsilon_{t}$ =$ Y_{t}-Y_{t-1}$. Rearranging this we get: $Y_{t}=Y_{t-1}+$ $\epsilon_{t}$ AR(1) is defined as $Y_{t}=\theta_{1}$$Y_{t-1}$+$\epsilon_{t}$ So as $\theta_{1}$ approaches 1 (highly correlated) applying an AR(1) becomes like a differenced time series.
