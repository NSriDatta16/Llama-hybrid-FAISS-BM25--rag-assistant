Which criteria to use to determine cluster centroids?

I have 3-dimensional datapoints I want to cluster. The idea is to do this in an unsupervised fashion with neural networks for a research project. To see how the system performs I'm trying with datasets whose original classes I already know. At first, I train a Kohonen network (SOM) to find potential cluster centroids. Then I do some calculations regarding the datapoints density in the positions where the potential centroids are located. Thus, I can discriminate some of them, and go from 40 candidates to around 10. This is when I don't know how to proceed. I have to use some criteria to determine which centroids correspond to the same cluster, and how many clusters are there. I'm posting two examples of 2-dimensional projections of the datasets I'm using to try the program: The small colored dots represent datapoints of different clusters, and the big black dots are the potential centroids I've found using the SOM and the density discrimination. Although I would prefer an approach that doesn't require to set the number of clusters a priori, I'll take a solution of that kind as well. Any ideas?
