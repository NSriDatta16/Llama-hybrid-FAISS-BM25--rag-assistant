In my opinion, scikit-learn raises an error because updated_df is composed of 2 features (columns) with list formats. Therefore, for a given observation x_i : x_i = [arg1_i, predicate_i] = [[vector_arg1_i], [vector_predicate_i]]. Scikit-learn can't handle this format of input features. There are mutiple ways to train a suprevised machine learning model after Word2Vec text processing. A common one is to sum or to average columns arg1 and predicate in order to have following observation x_i structure : x_i = [(arg1_i + predicate_i) / 2] = [(vector_arg_i + vector_predicate_i) / 2] More explanations and a gentle comparison between Word2Vec and CountVectorizer features engineering approaches for text classification : http://nadbordrozd.github.io/blog/2016/05/20/text-classification-with-word2vec/
