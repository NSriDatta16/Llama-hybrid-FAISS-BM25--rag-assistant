$\newcommand{\one}{\mathbf 1}$ This is not a proof (and +1 to @whuber's answer), but it's a geometric way to build some intuition as to why $E(X_1 | T) = T/n$ is a sensible answer. Let $X = (X_1,\dots,X_n)^T$ and $\one = (1,\dots,1)^T$ so $T = \one^TX$ . We're then conditioning on the event that $\one^TX = t$ for some $t \in \mathbb R$ , so this is like drawing multivariate Gaussians supported on $\mathbb R^n$ but only looking at the ones that end up in the affine space $\{x \in \mathbb R^n : \one^Tx = t\}$ . Then we want to know the average of the $x_1$ coordinates of the points that land in this affine space (never mind that it's a measure zero subset). We know $$ X \sim \mathcal N(\mu \one, I) $$ so we've got a spherical Gaussian with a constant mean vector, and the mean vector $\mu\one$ is on the same line as the normal vector of the hyperplane $x^T\one = 0$ . This gives us a situation like the picture below: The key idea: first imagine the density over the affine subspace $H_t := \{x : x^T\one = t\}$ . The density of $X$ is symmetric around $x_1 = x_2$ since $E(X) \in \text{span } \one$ . The density will also be symmetric on $H_t$ as $H_t$ is also symmetric over the same line, and the point around which it is symmetric is the intersection of the lines $x_1 + x_2 = t$ and $x_1 = x_2$ . This happens for $x = (t/2, t/2)$ . To picture $E(X_1 | T)$ we can imagine sampling over and over, and then whenever we get a point in $H_t$ we take just the $x_1$ coordinate and save that. From the symmetry of the density on $H_t$ the distribution of the $x_1$ coordinates will also be symmetric, and it'll have the same center point of $t/2$ . The mean of a symmetric distribution is the central point of symmetry so this means $E(X_1 | T) = T/2$ , and that $E(X_1| T) = E(X_2 | T)$ since $X_1$ and $X_2$ can be excahnged without affecting anything. In higher dimensions this gets hard (or impossible) to exactly visualize, but the same idea applies: we've got a spherical Gaussian with a mean in the span of $\one$ , and we're looking at an affine subspace that's perpendicular to that. The balance point of the distribution on the subspace will still be the intersection of $\text{span }\one$ and $\{x : x^T\one = t\}$ which is at $x=(t/n, \dots, t/n)$ , and the density is still symmetric so this balance point is again the mean. Again, that's not a proof, but I think it gives a decent idea of why you'd expect this behavior in the first place. Beyond this, as some such as @StubbornAtom have noted, this doesn't actually require $X$ to be Gaussian. In 2-D, note that if $X$ is exchangeable then $f(x_1, x_2) = f(x_2, x_1)$ (more generally, $f(x) = f(x^\sigma)$ ) so $f$ must be symmetric over the line $x_1 = x_2$ . We also have $E(X) \in \text{span }\one$ so everything I said regarding the "key idea" in the first picture still exactly holds. Here's an example where the $X_i$ are iid from a Gaussian mixture model. All the lines have the same meaning as before.
