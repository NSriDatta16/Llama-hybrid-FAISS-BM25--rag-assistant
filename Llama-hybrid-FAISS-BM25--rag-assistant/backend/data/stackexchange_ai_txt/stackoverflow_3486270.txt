Unfortunately, that specific scenario is something that is difficult to guard against. With a function like IsSpecial, it's unrealistic to test all four billion negative test cases, so, no, you're not doing something grossly wrong. Here's what comes to me off the top of my head. Many repositories have hooks that allow you to run some process on each check-in, such as running the unit tests. It's possible to set a criterion that newly checked in code must reach some threshold of code coverage under unit tests. If the commit does not meet certain metrics, it is rejected. I've never had to set one of these systems up, so I don't know what is involved, but I do know it's possible. And believe me, I feel your pain. I work with people who are similarly resistant to unit testing.
