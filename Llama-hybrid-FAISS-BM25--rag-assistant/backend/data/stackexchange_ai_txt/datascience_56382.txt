NLP - How can I encode single words from one feature (No word frequency)

I'm constructing a pandas data-frame as an input for some sklearn machine learning models. It is a supervised learning problem that consists in classify 'words' included in the body-content of documents to different labels. I got categorical, numerical and text data. The text data is already tokenised. So in feature 'text' I have single words. Meaning that, there is one word per row. E.g., 'downtown road', '5678-VB', '3552', 'product#3'. The data frame looks like the following: label 316511 non-null object num_feature_1 316511 non-null float16 num_feature_2 316511 non-null float16 num_feature_3 316511 non-null float16 num_feature_4 316511 non-null float16 text 316511 non-null object length 316511 non-null float16 start_with_capital 316511 non-null uint8 is_upper 316511 non-null uint8 ending_with_colon 316511 non-null uint8 I already encode every-feature but the words (I got current word, previous word and next word as three different features). I have thought about using sklearn.preprocessing.LabelBinarizer for one-hot-encode the words. However, I got 316511 instances/words and 161880 unique words so I created a total of 161920 features. This increased the weight of the pandas data-frame up to 47GB. This is not feasible for my laptop/cloud instance so I had to find another way to handle this large dataset. I found that HashingVectorizer as another way to encode large dataset in a more optimised way But still, this uses frequency of words and for this problem case it does not make sense to apply frequency. Anyone got some other idea on how to encode text/strings on this fashion to input sklearn-models? ****EDIT: Just to have a small view about 5 entrances with few features of the dataset: +--------+-----------------------+--------------+-------------+------------+---------------+ | | actual_label |num_feature_1 | text | is_upper |num_feature_2 | |--------+-----------------------+--------------+-------------+------------+---------------| | 22337 | Sold-to-party Address | 0.989258 | 6B | 1 | 0.0400085 | | 199218 | Material Description | 0.956543 | 32X10 | 1 | 0.0999756 | | 33579 | Sold-to-party Address | 0.989258 | Hatfield | 0 | 0.160034 | | 6506 | Sold-to-party Address | 0.956543 | 26 | 0 | 0.0400085 | | 199066 | Material Description | 0.93457 | scanalatura | 0 | 0.219971 | +--------+-----------------------+--------------+-------------+------------+---------------+
