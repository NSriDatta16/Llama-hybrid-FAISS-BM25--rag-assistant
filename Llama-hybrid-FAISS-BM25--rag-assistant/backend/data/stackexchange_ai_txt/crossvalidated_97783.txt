Understanding vec2var conversion in R

I'm using Bernhard Pfaff's packages {urca} and {vars} to analyze 3 time series. Each is I(1) and cointegrated with $r =2$ cointegrating relationships. The vec2var () command should make the conversion from the ca.jo object (my VECM) to its VAR representation in levels. But I do not understand the output from vec2var (), nor how to perform VAR analyses on this output (i.e., send the data to the VAR () function to get a varest object). That is, after converting from VECM to VAR what do I send to the VAR () function (which performs the standard VAR estimates)? Should it be: var.form$A%*%var.form$datamat[ , c(6:11)] + var.form$deterministic%*%var.form$datamat[ , c(4:5)] where dimensions in the code above are because I have $K=3$ variables, $p=2$ lags, a constant term and a deterministic trend. But the formulation from vec2var () [on which I've based the above R code] is something like \begin{equation} Y_t = A_1 Y_{t-1} + A_2 Y_{t-2} + \Phi D_t + \mu + \epsilon_t \end{equation} That is, a basic VAR(2) with a deterministic time trend and constant. But this is what I'm confused about: The VAR form of the long-run VECM (equation 4.8a, in Pfaff's Analysis of Integrated and Co-Integrated Time Series with R. useR! , and elsewhere e.g. LÃ¼tkepohl eq'n 7.1.1) is: \begin{equation} \Delta y_t = \Gamma_1 \cdot \Delta y_{t-1} + \Gamma_2 \cdot \Delta y_{t-2} + \Pi \cdot y_{t-2} + \Phi \cdot D_t + \mu + \epsilon_t \end{equation} To get the proper VAR level representation do I have to take the data from vec2var () and manipulate it myself? (i.e. find the difference series and then multiply by the appropriate cointegration matrix)? If this is the case then which [in R code please!] coefficient matrices should multiply which vectors? I feel like there's a disconnect from the theory and mathematical formalism and these R packages... but more likely I'm missing something pretty basic. Here's the basic R code set up: library(urca) library(vars) vecm
