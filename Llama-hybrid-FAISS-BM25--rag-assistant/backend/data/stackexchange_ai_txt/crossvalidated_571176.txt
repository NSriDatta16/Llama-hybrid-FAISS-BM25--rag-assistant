This shift is an indication of a very strong correlation with the previous lag h-1 and a low correlation with other feature variables. In other words, the model is mainly using h-1 to estimate the current hour consumption h . While this can lead to acceptable results (and sometimes really good results as well) in terms of R2 and RMSE . It also means that the model is not really better than a baseline model that just uses h-1 to estimate h (i.e. f(h) = h-1 ) In this case, a machine learning model is just adding complexity with no clear improvement in performance. Nothing smart going on here This video from Marco Peixeiro, the author of the book Time Series Forecasting in Python discusses this exact problem as well
