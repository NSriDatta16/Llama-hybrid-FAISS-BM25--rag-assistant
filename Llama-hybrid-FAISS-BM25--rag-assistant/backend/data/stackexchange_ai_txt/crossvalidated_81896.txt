Have you thought about orthogonalizing the entire data matrix with PCA? You could replace the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ with the un-correlated principal components (eigenvectors normalized to their $\sqrt{\lambda_m}$). It sounds like you don't have grouping categorical variables among the 40 variables as well. In this, the only thing you are left with is measuring the association between variables. Indeed, if you are trying to linear and non-linear assessments on sensitivity analysis and variance explanation, then break up the data using a "divide and conquer" approach to solve a large problem by solving smaller problems. Mixtures of variables generated from DOW, LHS, and genetic algorithms sounds quite complex -- but as long as you generate questions singly, and then do the associated analysis to answer the problem, you can work through your analytic goals. By the way, there doesn't exist variance explanation approaches that allow you to pull out non-linear and linear components using the same model, unless you code what you are doing using non-linear regression and linear regression. There are packages that allow you to fit data based on equations, so maybe look at those (IGOR, EGRET, AMFIT(Poisson), MATLAB, etc.) Last, be careful of the "so what?" question, whereby after you have done all of your model checking, a reader could ask why you did all of this on simulated data.
