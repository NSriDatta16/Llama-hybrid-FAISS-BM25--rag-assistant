Switching databases in TG2 during runtime

I am doing an application which will use multiple sqlite3 databases, prepopuldated with data from an external application. Each database will have the exact same tables, but with different data. I want to be able to switch between these databases according to user input. What is the most elegant way to do that in TurboGears 2?
