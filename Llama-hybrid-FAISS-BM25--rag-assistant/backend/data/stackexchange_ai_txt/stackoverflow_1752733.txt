This security sandbox issue is specific to dragging UIComponents that have Image components in them. The Image components reference external images. I've looked everywhere and every post I run into the thread ends unanswered, which typically means its a bug. My bootleg workaround? After the image has downloaded to the Image component, cache it as a bitmap and reassign the Image components source to the Bitmap. This fixed the issue for me: private function authorImageLoadComplete(event:Event):void { var bp:Bitmap = dupeImage(authorImage); authorImage.source=bp; } private function dupeImage(source:Image):Bitmap { var data:BitmapData = Bitmap(source.content).bitmapData; var bitmap:Bitmap = new Bitmap(data); return bitmap; } Then your image tag in your UIComponent: Best of luck guys
