How do I use a different database connection for package configuration?

I have an SSIS Package that sets some variable data from a SQL Server Package Configuration Table. (Selecting the "Specify configuration setings directly" option) This works well when I'm using the Database connection that I specified when developing the package. However when I run it on a server (64 bit) in the testing environment (either as an Agent job or running the package directly) and I Specify the new connection string in the Connection managers, the package still reads the settings from the DB server that I specified in development. All the other Connections take up the correct connection strings, it only seems to be the Package Configuration that reads from the wrong place. Any ideas or am I doing something really wrong?
