The issue sounds like the RaisePropertyChanged method isn't being raised by your MVVM Light ViewModel - if you're binding Get{} accessor of your IsEnabled property on the viewmodel directly to a value in IsolatedStorage, then the ViewModel isn't going to know that that underlying value has necessarily changed. When you write the value to IsolatedStorage, you can use the Messenger interface in MVVM to notify the ViewModel-in-question that it should fire the RaisePropertyChanged() event for your model, and that will re-bind that property in your view.
