I think of it this way; the SEM is a measure of the precision of a sample mean. But a sample mean from one experiment (say, with 3 -6 replicates) is hardly enough to gauge the precision of a population mean. FOr me, one needs to do multiple independent experiments (each with replicates to generate a mean) and then each of these means are taken as individual n's. So, instead of individual samples (replicates from an experiment), I only use the individual means of several (at least 3, more often 4-6) independent experiments to calculate the SEM and I use the STD of those averaged means in the calculation of an SEM. SInce few (including me) perform experiments more than 3 times, I elect to use the STD of a "representative" experiment. I think the SEM is not very useful and most people use it simply to reduce the size of the error bar. Therefore, I do not like the SEM much and loathe its pervasive use in science.
