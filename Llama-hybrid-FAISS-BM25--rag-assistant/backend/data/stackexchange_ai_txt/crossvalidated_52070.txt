difference in training and testing procedure of model

Can anyone please tell me the difference in training and testing of a model. I have developed 5/6 different single pass online learning algorithm (ets, ets+, evolving fuzzy modelling, SOFNN, Gustafson-Kessel, participatory learning). I have collected 3000 pts of data for training and 500 points of data for testing from MG time series in *.mat file in simulink. How do the training and testing procedures differ?
