What test(s) can I use to determine whether this is a valid p-value or whether this happened because the sample size was large? Nothing. There are investigations you may be able to perform to determine if your model is bad, but not if the significance is significant. As sample sizes become very large, Frequentist tests become very sensitive to small departures from your model. Also, if your null is $\beta=0$ , then it is also sensitive to slopes near zero but not actually zero. If your sample is large enough, it can detect small differences from zero. What you may be thinking of is the Jeffreys-Lindley Paradox where the Frequentist test falsifies the null when a Bayesian one strongly affirms the null. You can find a paper on it at Lindley Paradox. Things you can do is look at graphs of the bivariate plots. You can also look at the marginal distributions and the relationships among the variables. It should be noted that if you are setting a level of $\alpha$ such as $\alpha=.01$ then a p-value of $p is not more significant than one of $p . The "extremeness" does not matter. It is either in the rejection region, or it is not in the rejection region. Now, if you are not fixing a cutoff, and you are using a p-value as a measure of the weight of the evidence against the null, then there is a difference in weight, but the idea of significance becomes blurry.
