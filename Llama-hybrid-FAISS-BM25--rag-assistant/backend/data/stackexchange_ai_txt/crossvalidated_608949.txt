Want to examine effect of both specific covariates and their sum in regression

I have a regression model that I am using for explanatory purposes. I have a set of binary covariates which are specific comorbid diseases. I also have a variable which is the sum of comorbid diseases (categorical). I would like to examine the effects of both on an outcome. I ran the 2 models separately and the results of all other covariates are nearly identical. My initial thought is to report the results of model 1 (individual diseases) and then also include the CIs of the sum variable, with an asterisk indicating how the model was ran twice. Perhaps averaging the results of other covariates between the 2 models. Is there a standard methodology for this scenario? I want to report this in a single table and am having trouble researching this specifically.
