A covariance matrix is the matrix of the covariance between features in your dataset. The PCA can use the covariance matrix to transform a set of linearly correlated into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables. The correlation $\mathrm{Corr}$ can be obtained directly from the covariance matrix $Cov$ by the following formula: $$ \mathrm{Corr}_{i,j} = \frac{\mathrm{Corr}_{i,j}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Corr}_{i,i}\mathrm{Corr}_{j,j}}}$$
