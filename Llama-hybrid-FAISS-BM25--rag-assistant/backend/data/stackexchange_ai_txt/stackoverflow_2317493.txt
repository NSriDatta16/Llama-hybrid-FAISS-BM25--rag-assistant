How to correctly detect touches in my UIView?

I'm having a problem. I have a UIView, that looks like this : In that view controller I implemented the "touchesBegan:withEvent:" method, but the method is only getting triggered when I touch the bar at the bottom of the view , nothing happens when I touch the table. How could I change this behavior to be able to detect the touches that occur in the table too ? This is the code that basically declares that UIViewController: #import #import @interface TripSearchDetailViewController : UIViewController { //Parent of this sub-view. UIViewController *parentController; //GUI elements UITableView *tableView; UIButton *backButton; } //Button actions - (IBAction) goBack:(id) sender; - (IBAction) showDatePicker:(id) sender; //Class Methods. - (void) presentDatePicker; @property (nonatomic, retain) UIViewController *parentController; @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UITableView *tableView; @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIButton *backButton; @end
