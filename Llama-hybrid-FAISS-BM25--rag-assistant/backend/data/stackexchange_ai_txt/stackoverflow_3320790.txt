Eclipse - netbeans style tab template completion

In NetBeans I can set up a bunch of templates such that typing psvm tab expands to public static void main(String[] args) { } I see that Eclipse also has templates, but they are triggered in a different way - Ctrl-Space. But I don't see a way that you can have the template automatically triggered -instead, a popup appears and you pick which of the code completions to execute. Is there a way to make Eclipse pick the template that matches automatically, without showing that popup? In Netbeans it's a lot less intrusive to insert these code snippets, and I'm hoping it's possible to do the same in Eclipse. Any experts know for sure?
