how to replace all occurences of a word in a string with another word in java?

I want to replace all occurrences of a word in a long string with another word, for example if I am wanting to change all occurrences of the word "very" with "extremely" in the following string. string story = "He became a well decorated soldier in the line of fire when he and his men walked into the battle. He acted very bravely and he was very courageous." I guess I would use the replaceAll() method but would I simply insert the words such as story.replaceAll("very ", "extremely ");
