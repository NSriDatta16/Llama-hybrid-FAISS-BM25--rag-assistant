Is a (G)ARCH model a regression model?

I am wondering how to distinguish between the terms 'regression model' and '(G)ARCH model': Is a GARCH-model a (special) kind of a regression model? What are the major groups of econometric methodologies (time series analysis, linear models,...) and to which of them belong the two methods?
