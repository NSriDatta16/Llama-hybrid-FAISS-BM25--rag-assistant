More elegant SQL?

The query below is perfectly functional, and queries a single table to find the last 50 usernames added via a sequential userid number column. Logic so far is to: find out the highest userid; subtract 50 from that; pull usernames back where greater. However, it doesn't look elegant, and uses two subqueries to achieve it's goal: SELECT username FROM table WHERE userid IN (SELECT userid FROM table WHERE userid > (SELECT MAX(userid) -50 FROM table)) Is there a way to make this less nested? More efficient? More elegant? Any help would be much appreciated, as this can't be the best way! Cheers & many thanks Ali
