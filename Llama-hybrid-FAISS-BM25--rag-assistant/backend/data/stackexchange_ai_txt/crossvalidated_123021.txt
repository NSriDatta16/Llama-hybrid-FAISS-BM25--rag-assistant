Outliers In Predicted Intervals

In my stats class today, the professor was showing us some output from MINITAB on a prediction interval that was calculated (from time series data). For one of the prediction intervals, MINITAB had an X marked with the statement that there was an outlier in the prediction interval. My recollection is that the prediction interval was actually a prediction interval for some time at which we wanted a forecast into the future. I searched the MINITAB documentation and can't find a satisfactory explanation for how a computed prediction interval can contain an outlier. Does anyone know what this means? TIA, Matt
