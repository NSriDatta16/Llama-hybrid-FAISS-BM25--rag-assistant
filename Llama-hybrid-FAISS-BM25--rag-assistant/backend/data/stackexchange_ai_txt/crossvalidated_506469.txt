One Hot Encoding of ranges of data vs. leaving data as is for Logistic Regression

Recently whilst doing an assignment using the PIMA Diabetes set I ran Logistic Regression using, amongst others: the age predictor as is segmented the age into ranges and applied OHE (with and without scaling). There was a slight increase in some trained and validates models when using OHE. My question is: why would OHE be better than the (scaled) age predictor? I cannot find a suitable explanation.
