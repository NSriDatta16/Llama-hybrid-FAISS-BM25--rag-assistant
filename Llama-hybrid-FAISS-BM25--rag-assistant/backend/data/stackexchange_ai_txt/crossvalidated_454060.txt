Bayesian formulation of best subset regression

We know Ridge is equivalent to using a Gaussian prior and Lasso is equivalent to using a double exponential prior. What is the Bayesian interpretation (implied prior) for the best subset regression? Or is it the case that there is no Bayesian formulation for this?
