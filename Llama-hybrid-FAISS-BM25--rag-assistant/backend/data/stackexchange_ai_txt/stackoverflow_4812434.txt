Though you can disable conversation threading in Gmail as a user, there is no way to tell it not to thread an email you send to someone else. Why not just append the date to the end? That way you will have a bit more easily-accessible information, and you shouldn't have a whole bunch of old messages dragged up as part of a thread.
