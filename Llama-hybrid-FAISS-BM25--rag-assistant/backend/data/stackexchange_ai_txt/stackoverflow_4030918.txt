With PDFsharp you must draw the bullets yourself. With MigraDoc you add a paragraph and set paragraph.Format.ListInfo for this paragraph to create a bullet list. The linked thread shows two helper routines: DefineList() only sets a member variable so next time a new list will be created. AddToList() is called for each entry. Simply call DefineList() to start a new bullet list, then call AddToList() for every entry. DefineList() makes a big difference for numbered lists. Adapt the helper routines for your needs.
