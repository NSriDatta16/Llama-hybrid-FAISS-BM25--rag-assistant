I would go with either a dom parser or roll my own simple tag parser that understands quoting as well as escaping quote characters so that it doesn't take "he said \"blah\"" as he said \ , blah\ and empty string . It could detect whether the quoting to be modified is inside a tag easily. Over many years I have learned that regular expressions are way too fragile for such tasks.
