VB.NET (Of T) Comparison Operator

In the sample code, the line with the 'error comment' gives the following the error - Operator ' Why wouldn't VB automatically call the appropriate T operator? (i.e. If T is an integer then call the integer comparison functions.) Is it possible to make this work in an elegant fashion? This is for .NET 2.0. Edit - Updated code for anyone interested. Public Class TreeNode(Of T) Public Left As TreeNode(Of T) Public Right As TreeNode(Of T) Public Value As IComparable(Of T) Public Sub New(ByVal _value As T) Value = _value End Sub End Class Public Class Tree(Of T) Private _Root As TreeNode(Of T) Public ReadOnly Property Root() Get Return _Root End Get End Property Public Sub New() _Root = Nothing End Sub Public Function Add(ByVal value As IComparable(Of T)) As TreeNode(Of T) If _Root Is Nothing Then _Root = New TreeNode(Of T)(value) Else Dim node As TreeNode(Of T) = _Root While node IsNot Nothing If value.CompareTo(node.Value)
