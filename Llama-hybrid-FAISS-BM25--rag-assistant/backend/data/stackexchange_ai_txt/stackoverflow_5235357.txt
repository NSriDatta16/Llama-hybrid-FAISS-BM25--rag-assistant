It means precisely "there exists a type a for which I can provide values of the following types in my constructor." Note that this is different from saying "the value of a is Int in my constructor"; in the latter case, I know what the type is, and I could use my own function that takes Int s as arguments to do something else to the values in the data type. Thus, from the pragmatic perspective, existential types allow you to hide the underlying type in a data structure , forcing the programmer to only use the operations you have defined on it. It represents encapsulation. It is for this reason that the following type isn't very useful: data Useless = exists s. Useless s Because there is nothing I can do to the value (not quite true; I could seq it); I know nothing about its type.
