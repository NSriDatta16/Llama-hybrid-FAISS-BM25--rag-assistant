Bootstrapping Average Treatment Effects and Confidence Intervals for multinomial logit models

I have a multinomial logit model with three outcome categories and a variety of (primarily binary) independent variables. How would I go about bootstrapping the average treatment effect and its confidence interval of a binary variable? Right now my procedure is as follows: After running the full model as a multinomial logit I Sample with replacement to create temporary data of same length as original dataset. Reestimate the model using temporary data set set indep. variable to 0 in temporary data and predict probabilities of outcomes (using reestimated model) set set indep. variable to 1 in temporary data and predict probabilities of outcomes (using reestimated model) Take the mean of the average difference in predicted probabilities Save this mean difference in pred probabilities Repeat this process a lot of times Take mean of all the mean differences pred. probabilities for average treatment effect, Take 0.25 and 0.975 quantile for a 95% confidence interval around the mean. The issue I am having right now is, that this seems to create very large confidence intervals. This has created a situation where a lot of the variables that are significant in the regression output no longer have an effect that is differentiable from 0. Two questions: Is this bootstrap procedure sensible? If so, what explains the difference between the regression outputs and the bootstrap results?
