Where to find textbook with Toda Yamamoto causality test example?

I'm trying to create a Toda Yamamoto analysis on a VAR system, for Granger causality test, so far i only find a book where is mentioned: Levendis, J. D. (2018). Time Series Econometrics: Learning Through Replication Springer -Texts in Business and Economics, ISSN 2192-4333. DOI, 10, 978-3. But there is no numerical example, i will like to test this method with a full documented example. Is there any textbook where i can find it? i look this for teaching and research. So far, I found an example from this blog but no textbook. Thanks for reading my question. PD: Sorry for my English
