//where contextObject is your activity ContentResolver cr = contextObject.getContentResolver(); String[] columns = new String[] { ImageColumns._ID, ImageColumns.TITLE, ImageColumns.DATA, ImageColumns.MIME_TYPE, ImageColumns.SIZE }; cur = cr.query(MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI, columns, null, null, null); My code is pretty much like yours (except broken down) and it works. You don't need to go about asking the Gallery Intent for stuff, it should work. My two guesses are: 1) Make sure your USB storage is not mounted, if it is you'll see no external images. 2) Maybe a permissions issue? Try adding GLOBAL_SEARCH permission to see if that helps at all.
