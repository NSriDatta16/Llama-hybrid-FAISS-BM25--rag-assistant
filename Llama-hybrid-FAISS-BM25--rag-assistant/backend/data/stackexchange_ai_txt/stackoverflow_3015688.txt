Scrum backlog sizing is taking forever

I work on a huge project. While we program we end up meeting for endless backlog sizing sessions where all the developers sit down with the team and size user stories. Scrum doubters are saying that this process is taking too long and development time is being wasted. My question is how long should it take to size a user story on average? And does anyone have any tips to make these sizing sessions go quicker?
