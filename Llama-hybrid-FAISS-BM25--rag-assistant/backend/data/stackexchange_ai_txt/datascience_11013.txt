You can use word embedding in order to compare whole phrases. I am aware about two models: Google's word2vec and Stanford's GloVe . Now, word embedding works best with, well - words. However, you could concatenate every word in your phrase and re-train the models. Afterwards, you could calculate their similarity (say, with cosine similarity) and see how similar your whole phrases are semantically. Hope this helps.
