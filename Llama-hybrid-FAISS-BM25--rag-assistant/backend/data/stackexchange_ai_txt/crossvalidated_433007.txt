At first I thought there was a deeper explanation to this and I'll include it below because it is also important to know. But I think in your case the problem is actually rather superficial. You started out by predicting Score by ScoreMaximum. These two variables are pretty much guaranteed to be linked, as you can't score higher than the maximum on any exam. So unless scores are always really low (which wouldn't make sense because it would suggest that people consistently get a certain number of questions right, rather than a certain fraction), the upper bound (ScoreMaximum) will be quite strongly correlated to the average. So, ScoreMaximum may be accounting for a large fraction of the $R^2$ of your initial model fit. (This is similar to how the number of people that live in a city is a very good predictor of who many women live there.) If you normalize scores by their maximum, this trivial relationship disappears, and so the variance explained drops considerably. The fact that the remaining $R^2$ is quite low suggests that the other predictors simply aren't very good. The deeper explanation (which I don't think actually underlies your findings) was this: You are applying a non-linear transformation to your data. Fitting the same model to data sets with different transforms will not give the same (and possibly not even similar) results. For instance, if your data is very well fit by a linear regression model, then that linear relationship will be distorted or destroyed by applying a non-linear transformation to your data. That is, if your data $y$ are described by a standard linear model like this: $$y=X\beta+\varepsilon$$ where $X$ is a matrix with your predictors in its columns, $\beta$ is a vector of coefficients and $\varepsilon$ is random (e.g. Gaussian) noise, then if we apply a non-linear transformation $f(\cdot)$ we get: $$ f(y)=f(X\beta+\varepsilon) $$ And, importantly: $$ f(X\beta+\varepsilon)\neq X\beta+\varepsilon $$ So, the same model that was a good fit to $y$ isn't going to be a good fit to $f(y)$ (even if you refit the parameters of the model).
