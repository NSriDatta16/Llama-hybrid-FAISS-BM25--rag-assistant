It's still an open field of research, but there are many examples. Hyperparameter tuning is an example of a noisy and expensive function that can be handled by evolutionary algorithms . Neural architecture search is another example. You can also find a list of examples in this review paper , that mentions things like: 6.1.1 Variable and parameter optimization 6.1.2 Symbolic and polynomial regression 6.1.3 Automated code production 6.1.4 Regular expression 6.1.5 Circuit design 6.1.6 Code improvement and optimization 6.1.7 Simulator testing 6.1.8 Walking robot 6.1.9 Automated machine learning 6.2.1 Configuring neuromorphic computers 6.2.2 Forecasting financial markets 6.2.3 Predicting future city landscapes 6.2.4 Designing an optimized floor-plan 6.2.5 Antenna design 6.2.6 Defect identification of electron microscopy images but again, this list is not exhaustive. The general answer is that genetic algorithms are a broad family of general-purpose optimization algorithms and we have many examples, from many domains, where they proved to work nicely.
