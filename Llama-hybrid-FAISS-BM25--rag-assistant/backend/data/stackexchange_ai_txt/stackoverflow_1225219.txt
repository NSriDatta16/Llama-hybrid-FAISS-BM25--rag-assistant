Examples of context menus that don't require a right click

I am looking for examples of menus or toolbars that are shown without having to perform a right click. One example is the mini toolbar in Office 2007 which is shown automatically when selecting text. Are there any other examples out there of menus which are shown on a single click? (source: geekpedia.com ) I am looking for an elegant way to provide formatting options right on the canvas, next to a shape.
