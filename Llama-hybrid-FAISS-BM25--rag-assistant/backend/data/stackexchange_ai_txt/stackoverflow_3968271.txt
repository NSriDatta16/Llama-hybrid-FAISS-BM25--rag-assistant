The engineTime and engineBoots values are probably what is messing you up because SNMPv3 requires they not go backwards. If you have an agent that is restarting from scratch and not incrementing it's boots count (which is illegal, but under tests I could see why you'd be doing that) then you'd need to reset the internal notion of boots and time. However, setting them to 0 and 0 won't help because it'll assume those are defaults. You should, instead, change one of them to '1' which should trigger the override clause to actually use the values. Set the time to 1 and try it and I think it'll work (and if it doesn't, set them both to 1 instead and try that).
