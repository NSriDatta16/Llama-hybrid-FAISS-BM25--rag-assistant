Training tesseract to use with iPhone

I am trying to use tesseract-2.04 in my iPhone application and just want to detect the numbers. What I am doing here is first I am cross compiling tesseract to generate lib file using this post http://robertcarlsen.net/2009/07/15/cross-compiling-for-iphone-dev-884 and then using the the demo application at http://robertcarlsen.net/2010/01/12/ocr-for-iphone-source-1080 , but the results far away than realistic. I am not able to resolve the issue or how to train tesseract so that it comes closure for practical usage. Please help. Thanks, Madhup
