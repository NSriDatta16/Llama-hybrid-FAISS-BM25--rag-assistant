How can I download a file using WWW::Mechanize or any Perl module?

Is there a way in WWW::Mechanize or any Perl module to read on a file after accessing a website. For example, I clicked a button 'Receive' , and a file (.txt) will appear containing a message. How will I be able to read the content? Answers are very much appreciated.. I've been working on this for days,, Also, I tried all the possibilities. Can anyone help? If you can give me an idea please? :) Here is a part of my code: ... my $username = "admin"; my $password = "12345"; my $url = "http://...do_gsm_sms.cgi"; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new(autocheck => 1, quiet => 0, agent_alias =>$login_agent, cookie_jar => $cookie_jar); $mech->credentials($username, $password); $mech->get($url); $mech->success() or die "Can't fetch the Requested page"; print "OK! \n"; #This works $mech->form_number(1); $mech->click() ; After this, 'Downloads' dialog box will appear so I can save the file (but I can also set the default to open it immediately instead of saving). Question is, how can I read the content of this file? ..
