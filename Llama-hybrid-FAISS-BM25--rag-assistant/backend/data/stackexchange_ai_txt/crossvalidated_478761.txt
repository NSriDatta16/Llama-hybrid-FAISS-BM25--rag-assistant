(Non-limit) distribution of maxima from different univariate, discrete and stationary time series

Motivation : I'm currently studying the convergence of maxima from simulated time series to max-stable distributions, and in order to do so, I want to better understand the penultimate distribution of such maxima in non-limit cases. I tried to read Leadbetter et al. (1983) "Extremes and related properties of random sequences and processes", but did not get too far. Starting point : I understand that maxima $M_n$ from a sequence of n iid r.v. $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are distributed according to $P(M_n\leq x)=P(X_1\leq x, X_2\leq x,...,X_n\leq x))=F^n(x)$ . Thus I manage to derive the penultimate distribution of maxima from a white-noise process with Gaussian innovations. Question 0 (New) : Is $F^n(x)$ even the penultimate distribution of the Gaussian, or is this a first misunderstanding? According to Cohen (1982) , the penultimate distribution of maxima from a sequence of Gaussians is the Type III Extreme Value distribution / GEV with shape parameter $\xi . Question 1 : Is there are closed-form distribution of maxima from an ARMA(2,2) process with Gaussian innovations? I found something on arxiv on maxima of ARMA(1,1) processes. But if there is not such distribution, ... Question 2 : ... what is the unconditional (i.e. $P(X_i , not $P(X_i ) distribution of ARMA(2,2)-generated r.v., such that one could employ $F^n(x)$ (either ignoring that fact that these r.v. are not independent, or adjusting $n$ such that it accounts for the dependence, e.g. such that $n^*=n/k$ , where $k$ is the lag where the ACF/PACF are close enough to zero). I'm thankful for both every hint you can give me, but also for pointing out if my questions are nonsense.
