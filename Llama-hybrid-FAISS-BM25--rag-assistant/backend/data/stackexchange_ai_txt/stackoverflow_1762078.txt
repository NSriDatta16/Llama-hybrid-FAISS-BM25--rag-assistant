Combine two core data applications! Iphone

Just preparing myself for a task that i feel could be quite troublesome, and just wanted to get any advice or pointers on where i may fall over with this task. I have two "mini" applications, they both use core data as a persistent storage solution. I am going to combine these two apps to make a "Medium" sized app :) Is there anything i should be looking out for when combining two apps that implement core data as their persistent storage solution. All tips and advice welcome :)
