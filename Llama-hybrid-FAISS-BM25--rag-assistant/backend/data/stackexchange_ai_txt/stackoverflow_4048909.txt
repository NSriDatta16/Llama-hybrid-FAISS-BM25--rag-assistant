Android applications from unknown sources

I don't know if this is programming-related (much) but I've recently started playing around with writing my own applications. My phone is running cupcake/1.5. There is no "unknown sources" option, anywhere, at all. Carrier is AT&T. Does anyone know how I can overcome this issue?
