How to count how many listeners are hooked to an event?

Assuming I have declared public event EventArgs MessageReceived; public int SubscribedClients { get [...] } I would like to count how many "subscribed clients" my class has. I need to sum those that subscribed over network though my APIs (not shown in the fragment) plus those that did channel.MessageReceived+=myMethod; . I know that C# events may be declared explicitly with add and remove statements, and there I can surely count + or -1 to a local counter, but I never wrote code for explicit events in C#, so I don't know exactly what more to perform on add and remove rather than updating the counter. Thank you.
