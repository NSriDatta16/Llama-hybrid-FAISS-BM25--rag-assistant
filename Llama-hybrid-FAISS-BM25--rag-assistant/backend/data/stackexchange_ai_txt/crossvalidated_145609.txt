Combining Models for different levels of target variable in R

I have a classification variable with 7 levels. The crux of the problems comes down to the splitting of levels 1 and 2. Below is the output of a random forest in R. I want to add a second model which is a model used just for variables 1 and 2 and has a lower mis-classification rate. I've tried to run the full model and then re-run the second model where the output of the first model was a 1 or 2. This is not adding any value at present which is not what I expected. Any help is much appreciated.
