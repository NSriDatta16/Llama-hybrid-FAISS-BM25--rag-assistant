If the column contains actual dictionaries you can simply use the .str accessor to access the data in the dictionary by simply using the keys. For example, if you want to get the location from the dictionary you would use df_json["metadata"].str["area"].str["name"] to get the value 'Southern Suburbs & Logan' .
