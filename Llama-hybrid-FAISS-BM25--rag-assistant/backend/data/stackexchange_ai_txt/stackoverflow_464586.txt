From Eclipse to IntelliJ

I know some (crazy) people want to move from IntelliJ to Eclipse . On my side, I am moving the "normal way", i.e. from Eclipse 3.3 to IntelliJ 8.0.1 I really like it, but I am a little lost sometimes. Do you know any specific IntelliJ guide or tutorial created specifically for Eclipse users? For example, after some tests, I missed some options usefull on Eclipse (I don't say they don't exist in IntelliJ, I just say that I didn't find them !): Automatic insert at the correct position of the ';' character Actions made on save (format, reorganize and clean imports)...
