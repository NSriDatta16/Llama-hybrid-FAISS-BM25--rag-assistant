Scikit-learn's OneHotEncoder will encode all variables in the dataframe by default. If you want to encode just a subset, you need to wrap the OneHotEncoder with the ColumnTransformer . Alternatively, you can use Feature-engine's OneHotEncoder which encodes only variables of type object or categorical by default, leaving the numerical variables the way they are. See for example this code snippet: import pandas as pd from feature_engine.encoding import OneHotEncoder X = pd.DataFrame(dict(x1 = [1,2,3,4], x2 = ["a", "a", "b", "c"])) ohe = OneHotEncoder() ohe.fit(X) ohe.transform(X) The result of that transformation is the following dataframe, where the numerical variable remains unchanged and the categorical one was one hot encoded: x1 x2_a x2_b x2_c 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 2 3 0 1 0 3 4 0 0 1 I leave a link to Feature-engine's OneHotEncoder for more details.
