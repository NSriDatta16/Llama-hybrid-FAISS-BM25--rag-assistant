A link from the Desktop Java Java Speech API leads to the SourceForge page for FreeTTS . The FAQ says : The Java Speech API (JSAPI) is not part of the JDK and Sun does not ship an implementation of JSAPI. Instead, we work with third party speech companies to encourage the availability of multiple implementations. The FAQ also lists and links to several more implementations: FreeTTS The Cloud Garden Lernout & Hauspie's TTS for Java Speech API (link redirects to http://www.nuance.com/ , so the application may or may not still be available) Conversa Web 3.0 (link now goes to a Spanish immersion training company) Festival Elan Speech Cube (link gets an HTTP 404 error) I haven't investigated any of these myself, but there appears to be a wealth of 3rd party implementations.
