ggplot2 is a plotting package for R , written by Hadley Wickham , based upon the principles of Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson. It partially replaces R's graphics and the lattice packages, while providing a clean, powerful and fun API. Repositories Development version on GitHub ( issues , wiki ) Stable version on CRAN Vignettes Extending ggplot2 Using ggplot2 in packages Aesthetic specifications Frequently Asked Questions FAQ: Axes FAQ: Faceting FAQ: Customising FAQ: Annotation FAQ: Reordering FAQ: Barplots Books ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham ( online ) R Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang R Graphics by Paul Murrell Other resources Package homepage Current documentation Google group Graphs section of Cookbook for R by Winston Chang Detailed usage and comparison to lattice on the Learning R blog Posts on R-bloggers ggplot2-gallery with lot of example and use cases ggplot2 cheat sheet by RStudio R packages extending ggplot2: cowplot . This provides support for arranging multiple ggplot plots using a robust grid system, as well as tools for annotating plots, and a theme optimized for academic publications. GGally . Contains templates for different plots to be combined into a plot matrix, as well as a parallel coordinate plot function. ggalt . Extra Coordinate Systems, Geoms, Statistical Transformations, Scales & Fonts for ‘ggplot2’. ggcolpairs Combination of GGplot2 plots into a matrix based on data columns ggdendro Tools for extracting dendrogram and tree diagram plot data for use with ggplot granovaGG Graphical Analysis of Variance Using ggplot2 nvis Combination of visualization functions for nuclear data using ggplot2 and ggcolpairs ggmap . Allows visualization of spatial data and models on top of Google Maps , OpenStreetMap , or Stamen Maps using ggplot2 ggsignif . Provides a single layer geom_signif which can calculate the significance of a difference between groups and add the annotation to the plot ggstance . Provides horizontal versions of ggplot2's stats and geoms. ggtern . An extension to ggplot2 for the creation of ternary diagrams ggthemes . Contains extra geoms, scales, and themes for use with ggplot2 ggsubplot . Makes it easy to embed customized subplots within larger graphics gridExtra . This is useful for arranging multiple ggplot objects together, as ggplot2 is based upon the grid graphics system. An alternative to cowplot . ggpmisc . Makes it easy to add equations and parameters from model fits as text or labels, to label peaks and/or valleys, to use time series objects as data, to label or highlight observations in low density regions, to debug stats code. ggrepel . Makes it easy to add repulsive text and labels (relocated to avoid overlap). ggspectra . Makes it easy to plot and annotate light spectra. ggridges . Partially overlapping line plots that create the impression of a mountain range, useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or space. ggtext . Improved text rendering support for ggplot2, enables complex formatted plot labels. See also the ggplot2 extensions web site. Related tags plot r 's lattice package
