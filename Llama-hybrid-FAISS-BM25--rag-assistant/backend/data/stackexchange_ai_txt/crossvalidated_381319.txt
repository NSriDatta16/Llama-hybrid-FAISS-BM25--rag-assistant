Determining if two time series are cointegrated

I'm currently working on a problem where I am given that $\epsilon_t$ is a series of independent draws from a N(0,1) distribution $w_t$ is another series of independent draws from a N(0,1) distribution. Each $w_t$ is distributed independently of all $\epsilon_t$ s $x_t = \sum_{s=1}^t \epsilon_s$ $z_t = x_t + w_t$ and am asked whether $x_t$ and $z_t$ are cointegrated. First I've determined that $s_t$ and $z_t$ are I(1)/Have order of integration 1 since for $x_t$ : $$ x_t = \sum_{s=1}^t \epsilon_s = \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} \epsilon_s + \epsilon_t = x_{t-1} +\epsilon_t $$ which through some rearrangement yields: $$ x_t - x_{t-1} = \epsilon_t $$ where $\epsilon_t$ is a stationary process since it has a constant mean, variance, and an autocovariance that is not dependent on time. For $z_t$ $$ z_t = x_t + w_t = x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t + w_t $$ $$ z_{t-1} = x_{t-1} + w_{t-1} $$ so $$ z_t - z_{t-1} = x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t + w_t - (x_{t-1} + w_{t-1}) = \epsilon_t + w_t - w_{t-1} $$ where $\epsilon_t + w_t - w_{t-1}$ is stationary since it is a linear combination of normal distributions N(0,1). However, I'm not 100% confident in this. Moreover, I'm not sure about how to go about determining the cointegration from here. I know for non-stationary and cointegrated series $a_t$ and $b_t$ , there must exist a $\beta$ such that $$ a_t - \beta b_t = u_t $$ where $u_t$ is a stationary process. From this, I could do: $$ z_t - \beta x_t = x_t + w_t - \beta x_t $$ and setting $\beta = 1$ would then give $$ z_t - \beta x_t = x_t + w_t - 1 x_t = w_t = u_t $$ where $w_t$ would be a stationary process and therefore fulfill the necessary requirement. But are $x_t$ and $z_t$ non-stationary if they are pretty much just linear combinations of normal distributions N(0,1)? And is my assumption about the stationarity of the normal distribution right? Thanks for any help you can provide!
