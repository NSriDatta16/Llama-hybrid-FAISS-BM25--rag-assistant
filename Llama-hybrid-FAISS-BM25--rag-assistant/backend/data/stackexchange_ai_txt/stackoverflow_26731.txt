@Geoff- The system, which has been in production for 8+ years, was architected to use PL/SQL for the CRUDs and most of the business logic. The PL/SQL also generates 90% of the presentation layer (HTML/JavaScript), using mod PL/SQL . The other 10% is report data done via Oracle Reports Builder. So, there isn't application code like you'd see in more modern, better architected systems. I do want to do things the right way, I just don't have that luxury given organizational constraints.
