Comparing PCAs using the distances between the centroids of groups

For example, I have a data for N countries where quantitative values for men and women are given. I ran PCA separately for the data from each country. PC1 and PC2 explain most of the variance, so I use them for further steps. I want to test how similar or different the groups - i.e. men and women - are, in respect to their separation or closeness on the PCA scatterplot (PC1 vs PC2). To do this, I calculated a quantitative proxy which is the (Euclidean) distance between the centroids of the two groups, as shown in the schematic (top). The two plots are some two countries. I have a few questions about this approach to compare, in the context of the PCAs: Could the (Euclidean) distance between the centroids of the groups be used as an appropriate proxy to measure how similar/different the groups are? Can such a proxy be comparable across different PCAs? In the context of the example, because the distance for a country x is higher than country y , can I state that that men and women from country x are relatively different compared to country y ? Finally, extending the pairwise comparisons, based on the distribution of the distances, can I make a statement that a country has higher or lower than average difference between men and women?
