Let's partition our N elements into two sets (s1, s2) with sizes N1, N2 and averages A1, A2 respectively. To to deduce the average A of N elements from this information ( N1, N2, A1, A2 ), we can use this formula: Average = Sum / NumElements => Sum = Average * NumElements Also: Average of all numbers = Sum of numbers / Count of numbers Now Sum of all numbers = N1*A1 + N2*A2 Total Elements = N1 + N2 Therefore correct answer is : A = ( N1*A1 + N2*A2 ) / ( N1 + N2 ) Only when sizes of both partitions is same: N1 = N2 A = (N1*A1 + N2*A2 )/ (N1+N2) = (N1*A1 + N1*A2)/(N1+N2) = N1*(A1+A2)/(2*N1) => A = (A1 + A2)/2 Hence the first answer only holds when size of both partitions is same.
