The thing I spotted right off is that .th will find elemets with the class th, not elements (use plain th for that). Also, I'm not sure that $(this) is referring to the selected element in this case - I think it only behaves like that in .each(function() {}) functions... Anyways, I think you can do this in a pretty elegant one-liner: thestop = 4; $('#MyTable th.MyClass:lt('+thestop+')').width('60px'); This'll find all the s in your table that have an index of less than thestop (using the jQuery :lt selector ), and set their widths right there. And if you actually did want things with the class 'th', just put that leading dot back in. Hope that helps!
