How can I estimate the time at which 50% of a binomial variable will have transitioned?

I have the following data, representing the binary state of four subjects at four times, note that it is only possible for each subject to transition $0\to 1$ but not $1\to 0$: testdata I can model it with a logistic regression: testmodel summary(testmodel) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -0.018890 0.148077 -0.128 0.899907 day 0.032030 0.007555 4.240 0.000493 *** First, how can I account for repeated measures on the same individual within the model? Second, how can I estimate, with uncertainty, the day on which 1/2 of the subjects will have made the transition from $0\to 1$?
