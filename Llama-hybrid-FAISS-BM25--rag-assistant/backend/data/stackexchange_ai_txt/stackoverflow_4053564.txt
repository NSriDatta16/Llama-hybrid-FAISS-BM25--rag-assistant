soap call error

I'm trying to call a function via a SOAP webservice. The following code is run: $return_soap = $this->soap->__soapCall($soap_function, $params); I have also tryed: $return_soap = call_user_func_array(array($this->soap,$soap_function),$params); The headers are good, and i'm sending the following parameters: $params = array('customer_info'=>array_values( 'name'=>'Stephen de Tester', 'i_parent'=>12695, 'iso_4217'=>'EU', 'i_customer_type'=>1, 'opening_balance'=>'10.00', 'i_customer_class'=>1)); i have tryed it without array_values and a bunch of other combinations. I always get the following message: ( [error] => SOAP-ERROR: Encoding: object hasn't 'customer_info' property ) However if i try a webservice call without parameters it all seems to work perfectly... Could you guys help me in the right direction?
