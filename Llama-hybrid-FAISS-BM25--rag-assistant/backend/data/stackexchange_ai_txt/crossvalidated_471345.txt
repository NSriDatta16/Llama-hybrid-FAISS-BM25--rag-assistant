Inverse of Global Average Pooling?

I am working with a project where I want to upsample some parameters to create an electrical signal (shape: input=(3) output=(50,19)) The first part of my project was to predict the parameters using the electrical signal. At that moment, the global average pooling worked really well. I wanted to know if you are aware of construction that could be the inverse of Global Average Pooling. Similarly to upsampling which is used in the decoder as the closest "inverse" of max-pooling.
