Since ARIMA is regressing on itself for the most part, it uses a type of self-induced multiple regression that would be unnecessarily influenced by either a strong trend or seasonality. This multiple regression technique is based on previous time series values, especially those within the latest periods, and allows us to extract a very interesting "inter-relationship" between multiple past values that work to explain a future value.
