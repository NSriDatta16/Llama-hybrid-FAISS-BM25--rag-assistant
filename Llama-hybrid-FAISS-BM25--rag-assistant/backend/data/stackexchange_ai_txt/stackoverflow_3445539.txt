Create your UIView and configure it (or any subclass thereof such as a UIImageView ) Set the position of your Image to be where the user is touching: There are four delegate methods for accepting touch events which are a part of any class that inherits from UIResponder such as a UIView . Use the delegate method that is most appropriate to you. If you want it to follow your finger, this will be -touchesMoved : - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)toucheswithEvent:(UIEvent*)event { CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; myImageView.center = pt; } Other delegate methods available to you are: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event I wrote an example application that does exactly what you want. It's a demo of drawing Quartz 2D graphics, but it draws a red square and black circle where you drag your finger and should be simple enough to follow: alt text http://brockwoolf.com/shares/stackoverflow/3445494/screen.png Download Xcode project (32kb)
