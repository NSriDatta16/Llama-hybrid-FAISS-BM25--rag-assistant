First of all, PDB file (produced during the compilation) should be in the same directory with DLL (can be set in project properties). If your object does not use some ASP-specific functionality (Request, Response, Session objects) you can copy its invocation code to .vbs file and debug via setting cscript.exe your.vbs as debug target program. There are explanations ( for example ) how to debug ISAPI DLLs - they are applicable to your COM object too (from OS/debugger point of view both are DLLs loaded into IIS process). Put attention to your IIS version and in/out-of-process stuff. And finally, if nothing other helps, you can add some logging via OutputDebugString function and see it in free DebugView program.
