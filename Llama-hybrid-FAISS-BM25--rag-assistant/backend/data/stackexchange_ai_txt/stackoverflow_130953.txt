The choice of whether to use dynamic compilation or compiled DLLs really has to do with how organized your release process is. If your application is tightly compiled into DLLs than you can expect that you've tested for build errors and expect things to be more sturdy when you release. With dynamic compilation you have the ability to swap out .cs files on the fly (e.g. drag & drop, ftp). This means you may be more agile, but you might not have that extra step of assurance that helps you know you're keeping the build intact.
