Ruby merge hashes putting keys into csv string

Is there a clever way to achieve the following in Ruby? hash1 = { "a" => 1, "b" => 2, "d" => 3} hash2 = { "a" => 4, "b" => 5, "c" => 7} hash3 = { "a" => 4, "d" => 7, "e" => 9} puts hash1.csvMerge(hash2).csvMerge(hash3) with the output being: { "a" => "1,4,4", "b" => "2,5,0", "c" => "0,7,0", "d" => "3,0,7", "e" => "0,0,9" } What I'm trying to do is merge a bunch of Ruby hashes, in practice I have over a dozen, into a single hash where the values are combined into a comma separated string.
