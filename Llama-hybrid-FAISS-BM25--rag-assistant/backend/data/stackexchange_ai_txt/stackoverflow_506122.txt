I'd like to second Gregg Lind's recommendation of thinking about statistics in the biological sciences. It's well-funded, there's a lot of interesting work going on (both theoretical and applied!), and you can sound really cool at parties because somehow, someway you can always make some sort of connection from your work back to curing cancer. :) Seriously though, a lot of great statistical work was done in the early 20th century by people like Haldane, Fiscer and Wright. More recent interesting work has been done on analysis or large data sets, multiple hypothesis testing, and applied machine learning. It's super exciting. Come join us!
