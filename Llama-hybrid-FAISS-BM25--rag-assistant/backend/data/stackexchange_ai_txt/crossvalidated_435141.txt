Clarifications on Poisson Regression

I am watching this Bloomberg course on machine learning, and i need help on understanding the application of Poisson Regression. So it goes like this Let $Y=\{1,2,3,...\}$ and let $X$ be a vector in $\mathbb{R}^d.$ We can then model $Pr(Y_i|X_i) = e^{W^TX}.$ The vector $W$ can then be found using an optimization algorithm. But, $e^{W^TX}$ is not always an integer. So, my question is how do we predict a particular $Y_i$ given $X_i.$
