Interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression

So I have weight (kg) as a predictor variable and FEV1 groups as binary outcome ( =3 is 1). I've centered and standardised the weight variable so weight_centered = (weight-70)/20, reason being 70kg is close to the mean of the weight variable and β1 would correspond to change of 20kg in weight rather than 1kg. From the parameter output generated in R I've come up with the equation $$\log(odds) = -1.293 +0.023\times weight$$ From what I understand, if you exponentiate -1.293, which is 0.275, it can be interpreted as odds of having FEV1 equal to or greater than 3L when weight is 70kg (correct?), but what would be the interpretation for β1? Also, is my approach to centering and standardising the weight variable appropriate for logsitc regression or am I better off just leaving it as it is?
