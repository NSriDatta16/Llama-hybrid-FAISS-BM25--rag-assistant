There are a large number of pseudo-$R^2$s for GLiMs. The excellent UCLA statistics help site has a comprehensive overview of them here . The one you list is called McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$. Relative to UCLA's typology, it is like $R^2$ in the sense that it indexes the improvement of the fitted model over the null model. Some statistical software, notably SPSS, if I recall correctly, print out McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$ by default with the results from some analyses like logistic regression, so I suspect it is quite common, although the Cox & Snell and Nagelkerke pseudo-$R^2$s may be even more so. However, McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$ does not have all of the properties of $R^2$ (no pseudo-$R^2$ does). If someone is interested in using a pseudo-$R^2$ to understand a model, I strongly recommend reading this excellent CV thread: Which pseudo-$R^2$ measure is the one to report for logistic regression (Cox & Snell or Nagelkerke)? (For what it's worth, $R^2$ itself is slipperier than people realize, a great demonstration of which can be seen in @whuber's answer here: Is $R^2$ useful or dangerous? )
