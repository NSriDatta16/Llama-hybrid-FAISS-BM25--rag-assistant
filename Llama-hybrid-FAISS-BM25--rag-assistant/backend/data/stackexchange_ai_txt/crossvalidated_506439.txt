Not from that data alone. You need to think about what is the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis and what size of (type 1 and type 2) errors are acceptable. If you are trying to show the new machine is different from the old machine, you would need to make an assumption about how they might differ. For example, the new machine gives counts that are 10% higher on average. If you are trying to show the two machines give similar results, it is more complicated.
