It is still unclear whether the OP wants a solution with a mode of 0.33 or $1 \over 3$ or a mean with one of those two values. Without knowing the exact need, there are multiple possibilities. [1] and [4] below address the problem of getting a mean of ${1 \over 3},$ while [2] and [3] are for a mode of ${1 \over 3}$. [1] Generate $U_1, U_2, U_3$ as continuous uniform random variates on $[0,{2 \over 3}]$. Let $A = {{U_1} \over {U_1 + U_2 + U_3}},$ $B = {{U_2} \over {U_1 + U_2 + U_3}},$ and $C = {{U_3} \over {U_1 + U_2 + U_3}}.$ [2] Let $X=(1/3)*W_1 + (1/6),$ $Y = (1/3)*W_2 + (1/6),$ and $Z = 1 - X - Y,$ where $W_1$ and $W_2$ are continuous uniform on $[0,1].$ $Z$ has a different distribution than $X$ or $Y,$ but I think this will meet the original mode requirement. [3] In an effort to produce a more intuitive version, let $R_1$ be right triangular with left endpoint at zero and mode at ${1 \over 3} .$ Let $L_1$ be left triangular with mode at $1 \over 3$ and right endpoint at ${2 \over 3} .$ Then $R_1 + L_1$ has a unique mode at ${2 \over 3},$ and if we define $Q = 1 - (R_1 + L_1)$ then $Q$ has a unique mode at ${1 \over 3}.$ The pdf of $Q$ is given below in the comments. [4] Trying to be clever, simple, and elegant. Generate 2 independent uniform[0,1] realizations. These 2 points divide the interval from 0 to 1 into 3 pieces. Use the lengths of these 3 pieces as the desired variates. Note how this generalizes intuitively to any sum and any number of random variables. Each variate is identically distributed (another right triangular distribution). Every pairwise correlation is $-{1 \over 2}.$ However, like approach [1], the mean is ${1 \over 3},$ but the mode here is not ${1 \over 3}.$ As whuber noted, it is at zero.
