Classification Algorithms with Connected Pre-Images/Classification Boundaries

Given some function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$ , let us assume that $f^{-1}(\{0\})$ , as well as $f^{-1}(\{1\})$ are connected, and at least one is an open set. Is there a classification algorithm to estimate $f$ from a collection of data $\{(x_1,y_1), \cdots, (x_n,y_n)\}$ , such that such an algorithm can Accomodate non-linear separation Force (or at least guarantee with high probability) that its classification regions are also connected sets? If not, can currently existing algorithms be modified to reach such a goal? (e.g., SVM with a low-degree polynomial kernel and large regularization constant). Perhaps another way to consider this would be - how do we turn the topological notion of connectedness into some sort of criteria or constraint for optimization?
