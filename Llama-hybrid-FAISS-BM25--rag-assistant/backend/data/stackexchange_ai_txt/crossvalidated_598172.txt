Contradiction in ARIMA: How does ARIMA predict a stationary series?

I know that for ARIMA to run, the series first needs to be made stationary using differencing. But stationary series are not predictable. So, how is this happening actually? Quote from Stationarity and differencing : In general, a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term. Time plots will show the series to be roughly horizontal (although some cyclic behaviour is possible), with constant variance.
