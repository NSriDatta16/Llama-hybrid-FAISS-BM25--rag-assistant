As Zoul said, you could obtain them in the Organizer. But prior to that, you should tell your application to store the logs in the Documents folder, for example. That way when you are in the Organizer,extract the application data and you will find the logs there. Now, in order to tell your app to redirect the NSLog() outputs to a file, you should do something like this: NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory,NSUserDomainMask, YES); NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0]; NSString *fileName =[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@.log",[NSDate date]]; NSString *logFilePath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:fileName]; freopen([logFilePath cStringUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding],"a+",stderr); The last sentence is the one that actually redirects the output. So once you have done that, your app logs will be stored in the application's documents folder. Don't you know how to extract the application data? Here you shall find out. I hope it helps you out.
