(More of an extended comment than a real answer) : I tend to agree with Sycorax: A common issue with RNN is that they end up simulating a random walk (i.e. your best bet is to use the most recent value as your next step forecast), and this seems to be the behavior shown in your 30000 training sample plot. Your RNN simply memorized the training data and is returning a naive one step ahead forecast. This also seems to be confirmed by the 3rd plot you are showing, the one of the training set with only 300 samples: The RNN has memorized only parts of the data and not all of it and the plateaus correspond to the parts that it hasn't memorized yet. As I said this is more of comment. To get a definitive answer, you should try the experiment 300 vs. 30000 samples on the same data set (you seem to be using two different series here), and also give an indication of the input and output window sizes you are using and how you are batching the data.
