Extension method for elegance (arguably "prettier" at the call level) I'll implement an extension method that allows you to call your implementation directly on the original string as seen here. value = value.Remove(y); // or value = value.Remove("Hello", "You"); // effectively string value = "HelloGoodByeSeeYouLater".Remove("Hello", "You"); The extension method is callable on any string value in fact, and therefore easily reusable. Implementation of Extension method: I'm going to wrap your own implementation (shown in your question) in an extension method for pretty or elegant points and also employ the params keyword to provide some flexbility passing the arguments. You can substitute somebody else's faster implementation body into this method. static class EXTENSIONS { static public string Remove(this string thisString, params string[] arrItems) { // Whatever implementation you like: if (thisString == null) return null; var temp = thisString; foreach(string x in arrItems) temp = temp.Replace(x, ""); return temp; } } That's the brightest idea I can come up with right now that nobody else has touched on.
