Plotting a "ragged array" - a list of vectors in R

I have a list of numeric vectors, not necessarily all the same length. I'd like to get a plot where each vector in the list is plotted vertically above a label for that vector on the x-axis. Is there an "automatic way" to do that in R? Here's an example set of data: yl = structure(list( A = c(4.232886, 3.338263, 1.765557, 1.438516), B = c(3.046518, 4.500074, 1.508675, 3.226517, 5.982371, 1.519653), C = c(5.788882, 7.644319) ), .Names = c("A", "B", "C")) In this case I'd like labels A, B and C on the x-axis, and the corresponding data values plotted vertically parallel to the y-axis.
