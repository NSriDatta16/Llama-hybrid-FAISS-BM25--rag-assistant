You could have a look at Terracotta and especially at its uses in implementing Distributed Caching . You could have a look at the source code of the open source edition of Terracotta . Also, you could even consider Terracotta as your framework for building the distributed cache. I don't have any personal experience in using Terracotta with Scala, but it has been done . Features of the language... Try starting with the Programming in Scala book. It's a very good resource. If you want to do any concurrency you will have to be proficient in using Actor s. I would recommend having a look over all the features of Scala. Each one has its uses and you will need to know at least a bit of them to recognise situations in which to use their power. :) -- Flaviu Cipcigan
