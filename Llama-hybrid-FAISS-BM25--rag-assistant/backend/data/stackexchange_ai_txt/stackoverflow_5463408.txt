Visual Studio 2010 very slow, unusable

I've searched for this topic but can't seem to find posts that relate exactly to what I am experiencing. I have a Visual Studio solution that I need to work on, its fairly large and contains 16 projects. Everything is just so so slow and choppy (Except start-up which is actually quite fast). Clicking a line in the text editor, it takes about 5 seconds just to move the cursor. Switching between files ~1-2 mines (if I'm lucky) Clicking on 'Tools' ~ 2 minutes for the drop down menu to appear. If I right click one of the projects then its ~5-10 minutes before I get the drop down menu. During this time my entire PC locks up. Closing Visual Studio (in rage) ~10-20mins As for debugging and building.. well I've never managed to get that far. Looking in task manager (opening this with visual studio going takes a long time) there is nothing running that is consuming a lot of memory/cpu. I know Microsoft products are not renowned for being fast but this is ridiculous, there is no way I can code anything like this. Something must be wrong. Any help would be so greatly appreciated, my head is ready to explode. Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate SP1 Windows 7 x64 Intel i7 950 @ 3.07GHz 6GB RAM (Tri Channel) 2x nVidia GTX 470 (SLI)
