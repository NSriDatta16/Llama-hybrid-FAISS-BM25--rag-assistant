create size categories without nested ifelse in R

Basically I got the problem solved, but I am trying to find a more elegant solution since the code gets a little bit hard to read. Here´s what I got: mydf$size_class = ifelse(mydf$absolute_number 6 & mydf$absolute_number Maybe I need rather some formatting help / hints, convention than a new code :) – those are also very welcome ;)
