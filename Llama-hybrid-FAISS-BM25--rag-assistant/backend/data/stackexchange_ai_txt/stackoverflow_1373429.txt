There are significant benefits to your user interaction being a first-class web citizen and not trapped in another frame (or dependent on a plugin). It isn't perfect, but jQuery does remove a lot of the barriers to rapidly coding cross-browser javascript which can replicate many of the features that might encourage a developer to turn to Flash or Silverlight. This is another instance of choosing the right tool for the right problem, but javascript's access to everything in the DOM and its ability to gracefully degrade make it a pretty versatile tool, and a great framework like jQuery (that removes much of the programming pain) just helps it to be even more so.
