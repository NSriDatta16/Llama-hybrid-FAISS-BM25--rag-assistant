First question is... what version of Cach√©? Second question is... what tools do you have access to? Terminal, Studio, Management Portal?? If the data is in tables/classes, you should be able to access it via ODBC, at least. If there aren't any tables/classes, the data is probably in Globals. If the data is in Globals (persistent sparse array storage) they can look a bit wierd if you aren't used to the common patterns. Even if it is in Globals, it may be possible to define classes with custom mapped storage to make them appear in a table-like way via SQL. Cache is EXTREEMELY flexible, but can be a steep learning curve. :-(
