What's the purpose of `tunegrid` in the caret package?

I am deciding the parameters for a random forest classification model. I am using the caret package and read, here , about the tuning grid. My understanding is that it helps determine the best values for the tuning parameters, like mtry and n.trees . Isn't that redundant to trControl ? As I understand it, if I set trControl to trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 3) , then it will re-run the model three times with ten-fold cross validation to find the best values for the tuning parameters. If that's true, then what purpose does tunegrid serve?
