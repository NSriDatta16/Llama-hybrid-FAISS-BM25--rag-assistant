I was confused by this, too, when I started using NHibernate. That's how it works. Because the mapping includes fetch="join" , it's using an SQL JOIN between the parent table and the child table, so the parent data is repeated for each child. But then rather than filter out the extra instances of the parent, you get back a collection with one object per row in the query. You need to indicate you want distinct objects. Using ICriteria syntax, you can add Transformers.DistinctRootEntity to your query. See Get Distinct result set from NHibernate using Criteria API? , and the link it mentions within.
