Normalize data for Artificial Neural Network

I use min-max normalization for my training data, so each variable should have range, and then I use de-normalization for my test output value to compare the actual output value. My question is: 1. Does my output value should locate between minimum and maximum? 2. If there is an extra variable out of range, do I need to redo the model?
