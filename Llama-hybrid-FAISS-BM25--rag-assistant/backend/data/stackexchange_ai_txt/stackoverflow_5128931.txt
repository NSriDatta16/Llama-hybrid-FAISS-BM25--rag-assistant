how to move element in dom and on screen with javascript or jquery

Lets say I have a "p" tag like this: This is a text example. If I later insert other elements into that div is it possible to move the paragraph tag somewhere else in the dom, and it be visible to the user where I want it. So the result should be like this: Another block of text. This is a text example. Yet another block of text. So not only do I want to move it around...perhaps even into another div or different area of the page, but I also would like the ability to make sure that the user sees the text exactly as I want them too...maybe moved to the bottom or something.
