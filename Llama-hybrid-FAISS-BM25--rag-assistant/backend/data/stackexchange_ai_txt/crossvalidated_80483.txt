Recursive partitioning (CART) will require an enormous sample size in order to achieve stability and have good discrimination ability. It will not handle continuous variables appropriately, and its apparent interactions are often spurious. I suggest fitting a pre-specified logistic regression model with pre-specified sensible interactions, and using a quadratic penalty if the sample size does not support the pre-specified degrees of freedom. Then the search for a set of $X$ yielding maximum $\hat{P}$ is an algebraic problem except that this is subject to a large multiple comparison problem that will result in regression to the mean (overprediction of high $P$). You can bootstrap the entire process to (1) check the stability of the solution for $X$ and (2) find a multiplicity-penalized confidence interval for $P_{\textrm max}$.
