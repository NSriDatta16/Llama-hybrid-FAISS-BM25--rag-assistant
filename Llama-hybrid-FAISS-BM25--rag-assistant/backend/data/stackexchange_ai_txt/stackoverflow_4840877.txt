Just looking at the numbers you provided: (1.0-0.8)*255 ~= 50.9 = 51 Where: 1.0 is the maximum alpha intensity 0.8 is the currently set alpha intensity 255 is the maximum intensity of each of the RGB channels (the color of the background) This fits the B and G channels of your example. So, in the general case, it seems to be a simple weighted average between the channel value (either of RGB) and the background color (in your case, white -- 255). Alpha is being used as the weight. Here's some Python code: MIN_ALPHA=0.0 MAX_ALPHA=1.0 MIN_CH=0 MAX_CH=255 BG_VAL=255 def apply_alpha(old, alpha, bg=255): assert alpha >= MIN_ALPHA assert alpha = MIN_CH assert old And some output: misha@misha-K42Jr:~/Desktop/stackoverflow$ python alpha.py 255 0.8 255.0 misha@misha-K42Jr:~/Desktop/stackoverflow$ python alpha.py 0 0.8 51.0 Try this for other examples (in particular, non-white backgrounds) -- it's probably that simple. If not, edit your answer with new examples, and I'll have another look.
