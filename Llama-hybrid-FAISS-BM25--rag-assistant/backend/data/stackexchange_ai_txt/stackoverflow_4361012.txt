The general rule is to use Density Independent Pixels (dips) for size definitions in your layout xmls - I see you already do it. Doing so I just have the only layout for all range of devices. What needs to be splited is graphics. For that I use 3 different drawable directories - 'drawable-ldpi', 'drawable-mdpi' and 'drawable-hdpi'. This is done in order images to have the same size (let say, in millimeters) on various screen densities (assuming screen size is the same - Normal, for instance) they should be scaled as follows: drawable-hdpi: 150% drawable-mdpi: 100% drawable-ldpi: 75% Probably it is a bad advice. However, if you look at the Google chart of Screen Sizes and Densities you can decide to not invest your additional efforts to thorough testing for Large screens, since there are almost no such devices on the market.
