Use of ARDL, VECM, along with the Multiple OLS Method

Besides ARDL & VECM, in the Multiple OLS, I regress the dependent Y(0) time series with independent time series (19 in number) X(0) and (4 in number) X(1) variables. The residuals are serially uncorrelated at BG Serial correlation tests, the coefficients stable at 5 percent level, the CUSUM Stability Diagnostic test shows stable at 5.2 percent level, R-square value is 0.313, Adj. R-square is 0.206, F-value (p-values) is 2.916 (0.001), DW stat is 2.092. Can I accept the OLS method besides the ARDL and VECM observations?
