You can approach the problem within a VAR (vector autoregressive models) framework. Essentially, you would ask: after I take into account the past values of M, and the past values of IMF, is there some information in the past values of G that would help me improve my prediction for the current value of M (and similarly for the other variables in the system). The vars package in R can be used to estimate VAR models. Note that depending on the properties of the time series (e.g. stationarity), the VAR approach can be more or less appropriate. An alternative to consider is vector error-correction models. You can find this document useful: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vars/vignettes/vars.pdf
