Load an existing many-to-many table relation with sqlalchemy

I'm using SqlAlchemy to interact with an existing PostgreSQL database. I need to access data organized in a many-to-many relationship. The documentation describes how to create relationships, but I cannot find an example for neatly loading and query an existing one.
