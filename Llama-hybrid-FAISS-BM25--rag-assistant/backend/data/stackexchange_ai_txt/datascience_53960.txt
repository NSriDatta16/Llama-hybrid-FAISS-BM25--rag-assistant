I think SMOTE is the best approach to try out first and if you want to try further look into the XGBoost parameters especially Scale_pos_weight is the ratio of number of negative class to the positive class. Suppose, the dataset has 90 observations of negative class and 10 observations of positive class, then ideal value of scale_pos_Weight should be 9. You can check this link .
