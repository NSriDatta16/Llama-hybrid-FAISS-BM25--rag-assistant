If you're already familiar with HTML4, v5 is not terribly different, mostly it adds new elements and attributes, and removes some. For essential coverage of web standards, I suggest Jeffrey Zeldman's Designing with Web Standards (v3) . It's largely theory and background, with little code. I recommend it. There is a sister book by John Allsop, Developing with Web Standards , which I have not (yet) read, but it is supposedly the implementation half of the topic the two books cover. There is a book in the making by Jeremy Keith, HTML5 for Web Designers , on the new A Book Apart site (backed by the people of An Event Apart, including Jeffrey Zeldman). Jeffrey writes about the new book on his site , and provides links to other related coverage, including Jeremy Keith's take on it.
