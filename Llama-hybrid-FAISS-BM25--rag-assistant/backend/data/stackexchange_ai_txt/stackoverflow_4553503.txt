3d graphics, unit vectors and orthogonal matrices

I'm trying to get my head wrapped around tangent space and I'm starting to come up with questions that I can't ask my colleagues because they're starting to have no idea what I'm talking about. I'm trying to do normal mapping on opengl. My current plan is to calculate the tangent-bitangent-normal matrix in a geometry shader. When I have an orthogonal matrix (such as the TBN matrix) and I let opengl interpolate it between vertices, are the three resulting vectors (T, B and N) then still unit length? are they still at a 90 deg angle to each other? When I multiply my (unit length) normal map sample with my orthogonal matrix, is the result guaranteed to be unit length too? I think it is but can't reason through it. I was thinking about using detail normal maps such that objects up close don't look as bad as they do now. That would mean that there's then two normal maps. How do I combine the two samples? To reply to my own question, a colleague came over to work on #2 and he came up with an elegant proof. It's a bit much to type out here but suffice to say that it's true.
