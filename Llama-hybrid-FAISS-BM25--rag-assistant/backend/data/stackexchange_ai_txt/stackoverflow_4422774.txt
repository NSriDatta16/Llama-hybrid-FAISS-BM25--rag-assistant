The format you are trying to pass the arguments in is not possible. You are passing a string instead of an int . The expected parameters are: string number_format ( float $number , int $decimals = 0 , string $dec_point = '.' , string $thousands_sep = ',' ) you will need to pass the arguments accordingly: echo number_format($number, 0, ",", "."); If you have a special reason to do this the way you show, you would have to use eval() which is highly discouraged, or maybe call_user_func_array() but you would have to explain in detail first what you are trying to do.
