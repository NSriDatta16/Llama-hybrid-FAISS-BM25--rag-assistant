iphone mapkit drag and get center location

HI, I have a Mapview with some marker points + a marker for current location. Now, what I want to do here is, when user drag or traverse through mapview, I want to find coordinate (latitude, longitude) of the new center location after map has been dragged. I want to clarify once again, I am not talking about dragging the marker/point, I am talking about dragging the map with touch. Thanks in advance.
