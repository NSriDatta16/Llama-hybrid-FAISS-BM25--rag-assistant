RNA-seq differential expression with DESeq2: p-value and FC "limits"

I have used DESeq2 package (version 1.12.3 with R 3.3.1) to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes between two groups of cell culture samples, 3 treated and 3 controls. Considering adjusted pvalue log2(FC)>5 and the top one with log2(FC)=9.5 ). Also, some (n=16) adjusted p-values are 0. I have a few questions: I guess the 0 pvalues are shown as zero because they are lower than the smallest representable value with the computer. Is that correct? How much is this value? clustering and PCA plot of the samples show that treated and control samples are clearly separated. However I am still surprised by the extremely high fold changes and small p-values, compared with other datasets I have seen. From the analysis point of view, is there a way to understand whether there is some 'bias' in the data, such as the replicates not being truly independent?
