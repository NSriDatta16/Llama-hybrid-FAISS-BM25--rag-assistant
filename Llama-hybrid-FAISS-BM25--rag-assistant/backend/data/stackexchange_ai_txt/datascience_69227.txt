Is it good practice to convert columns with a number to a range between 0 and 1?

Relatively new to data science. I heard something about converting columns which contain integers into a range between 0 and 1. I think the reasoning was that so all the columns will be more similar in their range. I think along with that there might have been a step of removing outliers (very high integers) to that they wouldn't cause all other results be skewed as a low fraction. Is this accurate? If yes, is there an easy command to make it happen with a Pandas dataset?
