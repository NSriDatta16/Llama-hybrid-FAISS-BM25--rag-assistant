noSQL implementation: threaded messaging system

I'm trying to build a threaded messaging system for my website. Basically the system provides following features : allow users to send messages between each other arbitrary levels of replies (threads) I already tried using mysql+php and has built a skeleton. However in the whole thread retrieving part is kinda recursive, which I believe is not the best thing a relational schema can do. So now I'm researching for a non-SQL implementation. Hopefully to avoid such problem making the data retrieval more natural. Anybody has such experience give me a hint please. Update: My client app is written in PHP and will probably remain so.
