What causes Attribute Error: 'classObject' object has no attribute '_w'?

I'm working with Python 3.1, and I want to create a game. I made a class Board(Canvas): Why? because I need to keep track of the pieces via 'tag'. BUT, when I attempt to bind a tag to a piece, I get a traceback that read something like... Traceback (most recent call last): File "/Users/bluedragon1223/Desktop/Djambi0-2.py", line 282, in x = Board() File "/Users/bluedragon1223/Desktop/Djambi0-2.py", line 94, in __init__ self.tag_bind(self.canM, ' ', _onPieceClick) File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1/lib/python3.1/tkinter/__init__.py", line 2103, in tag_bind return self._bind((self._w, 'bind', tagOrId), AttributeError: 'Board' object has no attribute '_w' I can follow the code all the way to the error, and I think I lack the understanding of what '_w' is here. After x = Board() the def __init__(self, window=mainWin): contains self.M = PhotoImage(file=path+'M.gif') . self.M then goes into: def __draw(self): canvas = Canvas(mainWin,width=810,height=810) for i in range(9): canvas.create_line(90*i,0,90*i,810) for j in range(9): canvas.create_line(0,90*j,810,90*j) canvas.create_rectangle(3,810,810,3) canvas.bind(' ', _point2square) canvas.pack() self.canM = canvas.create_image(405,405,image=self.M,tag = 'M') After that, it's used in self.tag_bind(self.canM, ' ', _onPieceClick) . And that's where the error occurs. My question is why? What did I do, and how do I fix it? I appreciate any sort of help!
