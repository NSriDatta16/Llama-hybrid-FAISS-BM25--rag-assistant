There is some built-in SOUNDS LIKE functionality in SQL Server, see SOUNDEX http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa259235%28SQL.80%29.aspx As for full / nickname searching there isn't anything built it that I am aware of. Nicknames vary by region and it's a lot of information to keep track of. There might be a database linking full names to nicknames that you could leverage in your own application.
