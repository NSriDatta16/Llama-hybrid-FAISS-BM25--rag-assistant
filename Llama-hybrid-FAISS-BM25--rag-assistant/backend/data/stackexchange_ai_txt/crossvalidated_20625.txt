You can't get rid of the tautology. I think you are supposed to just add the tautology and apply the product rule and then the sum rule and you get: $$p(C|(A+B)W) = \frac{p(CA|W)+p(CB|W)-p(AB|W)}{p(A|W)+p(B|W)-p(AB|W)}$$ where all the probabilities are expressed as posteriors to the tautology. I think this is the most similar equivalent to the sum rule that you can get for this problem, so that would be the solution. Note that if you add the condition $p(AB|W)=0$ (i.e. $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive) you get the same expression that you have to prove in the problem 2.2, that would indicate this solution is most probably correct (by Bayesian induction ;).
