DTW often uses a distance between symbols, e.g. a Manhattan distance $(d(x, y) = {\displaystyle |x-y|} $). Whether symbols are samples or features, they might require amplitude (or at least) normalization. Should they? I wish I could answer such a question in all cases. However, you can find some hints in: Dynamic Time Warping and normalization Section 1.2.1 of Searching and Mining Trillions of Time Series Subsequences under Dynamic Time Warping Normalization for Dynamic Time Warping
