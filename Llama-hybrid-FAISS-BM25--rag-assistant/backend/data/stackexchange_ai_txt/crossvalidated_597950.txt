There are many opinions on when and how to use exploratory factor analysis (EFA) , all of which require consideration of item content and the purpose of the analysis. So, regarding which of the 2-13 factor solutions you should pick, I would review both the literature and the item content. Put differently, psychometricians and statisticians disagree on quite a few things. However, the importance of incorporating things such as item content and theory into your decision process is not one of them. Additionally, what type of EFA are you using? I ask because not all EFA techniques incorporate the bifactor restriction, which is essential if you assume such a structure likely underlies your data (e.g., see Mansolf & Reise, 2016). Finally, I would not suggest selecting a model based on the fit of an EFA model (e.g., see Montoya & Edwards, 2021) unless your final model allows for all items to load onto all factors (which is seldom, if ever, what is done, unless the purpose is pure dimensionality reduction. In which case model fit would not be important anyways). References Mansolf, M., & Reise, S. P. (2016).
