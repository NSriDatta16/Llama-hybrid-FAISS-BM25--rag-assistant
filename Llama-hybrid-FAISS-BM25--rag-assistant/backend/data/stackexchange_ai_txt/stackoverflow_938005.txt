MIME Header - Content Disposition

I am trying to figure out if "Content-Disposition:attachment; filename=file_name" is required or not when file is sent as an attachment, and I am interested to persist it by the original name on a storage (drive). It looks like this is the only way to retrieve the original file name, but RFC is so muddy on it ( link to RFC ). It uses words such as "should" and not "must". WIKI ( link to WIKI ) says it better, but it's not RFC I can take to the client. Ideas?
