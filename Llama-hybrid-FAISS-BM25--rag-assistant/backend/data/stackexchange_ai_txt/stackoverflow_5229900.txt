Using OpenGL draw_indirect with OpenCL

I don't quite have a 100% clear picture how the Draw Instanced/Draw Indirect family of functions all the way down to glDrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstance work together. Using OpenGL 4.0+ & OpenCL interop capable hardware and drivers, how (if possible) can we leverage tools like draw indirect (now also multi draw indirect) to draw an instanced geometry across multiple frames while changing geometry on the GPU? For example, could one tessellate a shape then apply some filter to the shape via opencl all while referring to geometries the CPU will only need to cull out when needed? * Original post has been heavily edited
