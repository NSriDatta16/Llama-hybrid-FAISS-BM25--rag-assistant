If You need to calculate "correlation" between three or more variables, you could not use Pearson, as in this case it will be different for different order of variables have a look here . If you are interesting in linear dependency, or how well they are fitted by 3D line, you may use PCA, obtain explained variance for first PC, permute your data and find probability, that this value may be to to random reasons. I've discuss something similar here (see Technical details below). Matlab code % Simulate our experimental data x=normrnd(0,1,100,1); y=2*x.*normrnd(1,0.1,100,1); z=(-3*x+1.5*y).*normrnd(1,2,100,1); % perform pca [loadings, scores, variance]=pca([x,y,z]); % Observed Explained Variance for first % principal component OEV1 = variance(1)/sum(variance) % perform permutations permOEV1=[]; for iPermutation=1:1000 permX=datasample(x,numel(x), 'replace', false); permY=datasample(y,numel(y), 'replace', false); permZ = datasample(z, numel(z), 'replace', false); [loadings, scores, variance] = pca([permX, permY, permZ]); permOEV1(end+1) = variance(1) / sum(variance); end % Calculate p-value p_value=sum(permOEV1>=OEV1)/(numel(permOEV1)+1)
