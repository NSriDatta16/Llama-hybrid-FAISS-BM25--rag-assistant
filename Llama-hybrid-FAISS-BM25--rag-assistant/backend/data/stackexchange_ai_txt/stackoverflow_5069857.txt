There are no good web-based editors for PowerPoint, other than Office Web Apps . For that, you need SharePoint 2010. Note that this is intended for internal organizations - not for the public web. Creating one yourself would be a ton of work. However, if you just needed basic editing of certain parts (in particular, textual), you could work with the Open XML SDK to create something workable. This article may give you a good start: Creating a PresentationML Document through a browser interface . For web-based players, there are a few options: Silverlight : Convexion by Electronic Rain. It's not the best of players/converters, but currently better than the rest ( PPTX2Silverlight , Powerlight , etc.) Flash : Articulate , Adobe Presenter and iSpring Free are all good options.
