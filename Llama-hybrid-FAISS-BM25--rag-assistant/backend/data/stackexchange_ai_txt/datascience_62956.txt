Yes, adding noise can help to regularize a model. It is well known that the addition of noise to the input data of a neural network during training can, in some circumstances, lead to significant improvements in generalization performance from Training with Noise is Equivalent to Tikhonov Regularization In particular, adding structured noise that is consistent with natural perturbations of the data could help regularized a model. This is a form of data augmentation .
