In response to my own question, an article was just published in the journal Ecology titled "Density estimation in tiger populations: combining information for strong inference" by Gopalaswamy et al. They used a Bayesian model that combined information from tiger studies with different methodologies to improve the accuracy of their estimation of the density of tigers nature preserve. On their own the two separate studies indicated that there were ~12 +/- 1.95 tigers/100km2 (posterior mean +/- SD) or 6.7 +/- 2.37 tigers/100km2. The combined Bayesian model provided an estimate of 8.5 +/- 1.95 tigers/100km2.
