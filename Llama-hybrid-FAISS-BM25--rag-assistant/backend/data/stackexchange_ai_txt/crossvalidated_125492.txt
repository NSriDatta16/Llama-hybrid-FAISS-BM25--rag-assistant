Distribution of p-values in this thought experiment?

I'm trying to check whether my clustering was informative above and beyond random clustering. This is my thought experiment to do it, can someone help? Suppose I have a large number, $N$ , groups. Suppose within a group $r$ , I have $M_r$ (on average 20) observations, $\; Y_{r,i}$ . Suppose I then randomly assign each observation within a group to 1 of two clusters. Then I run a regression for each group and find whether cluster 2 or cluster 1 has a smaller mean. $$Y_{r,i}=\beta_{0} +\beta_{1}{\rm Clust2}_{g,i} + \varepsilon_{r,i} $$ Finally, I get the pvalues for all these regressions. If the clusters were randomly generated, can I expect only 5% of the pvalues to be less than 5%? Or should I expect more?
