I would advice you to look at SRP and Interface Segregation Principle . A class with 100 properties is probably doing way too much. You should also pay attention to these subsets and if they are something you could extract out as interfaces or super classes. If yes then you need to use SRP and make sure you have a right inheritance hierarchy. And btw what's your lanugage of implementation and target platform?
