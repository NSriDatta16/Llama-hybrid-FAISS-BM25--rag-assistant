It is not possible to map a conceptual model, to two storage models. If you find yourself needing to join between 2 databases, I have seen this accomplished via Data Services. You basically talk via URIs. So you query for URI to some set of data (ultimately gives you the surrogate key) and then you use that to query for data in the second database.
