The paper is incorrect in applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to boolean data since PCA implicitly minimizes a squared loss function, which is not always appropriate for not real-valued data. " A Generalization of Principal Components Analysis to the Exponential Family " by Collins et al. goes into detail. Boolean data would be more appropriately modeled with Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) .
