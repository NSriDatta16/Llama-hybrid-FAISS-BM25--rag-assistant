It seems your model is Underfitting . Change in data sequence changes its learning path and since learning is not complete(Underfit), this position becomes a random position based on the path. Had the learning been completed, irrespective of the starting path. It will reach the same End position. You can't rely on whatever accuracy you are getting. Work is not done. Don't think about the reporting strategy now Issue seems with high dimension data. Imagine a space of 300 dimensions but only 150 points. Would be difficult for any model to learn. What can be done - If data is Sparse, try using SVM once. if not, reduce the dimension and simply use RandomForest.
