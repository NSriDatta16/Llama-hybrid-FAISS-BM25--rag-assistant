What do all these "Save DTS Package" options mean?

I'm creating a DTS package. After specifying the source, destination, and tables, I get the Save, schedule, and replicate package step, which has a Save DTS Package checkbox. If I check the box to save, I get these options: SQL Server SQL Server Meta Data Services Structured Storage File Visual Basic File Can anyone give a good explanation of what each option means, and the pros and cons of using it to save my DTS package? (Particularly if you have experience with the different options, and aren't just regurgitating something like this .)
