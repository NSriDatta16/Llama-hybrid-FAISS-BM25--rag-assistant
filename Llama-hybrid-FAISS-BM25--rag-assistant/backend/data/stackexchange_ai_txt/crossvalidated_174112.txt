Time series data prediction with neural network model

I would like to predict stocks of a company for 6 months. I would like to use neural networks for this prediction. Can anyone suggest how many hidden layers and hidden nodes to be used? I have modeled a neural network with 3 input nodes and 2 hidden nodes and 1 output node in R but I am getting forecast accuracy of around 35% only. Can anyone suggest how I can improve the forecast accuracy of my model? Are there any other models which give better accuracy for this kind of data?
