In short, the answer is no. The median cannot be determined given only the average (assuming you refer to the mean) and sample size. For a counterexample, consider the following set of three test scores. $$75, 86, 94$$ The mean of this set is $(75+86+94)/3 = 85$ and the median is $86$ . Now consider the set $$74, 87, 94.$$ These three numbers have the same mean as before, but the median becomes $87$ . As @Alexis suggests in the comments, it is worth considering a third set $$75, 86, 100.$$ Here, the mean increases to $87$ while the median stays at $86$ .
