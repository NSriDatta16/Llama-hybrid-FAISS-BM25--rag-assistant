Ignoring Leftmost Bit in Four Bytes

First an explanation of why: I have a list of links to a variety of MP3 links and I'm trying to read the ID3 information for these files quickly. I'm only downloading the first 1500 or so bytes and trying to ana yze the data within this chunk. I came across ID3Lib, but I could only get it to work on completely downloaded files and didn't notice any support for Streams. (If I'm wrong in this, feel free to point that out) So basically, I'm left trying to parse the ID3 tag by myself. The size of the tag can be determined from four bytes near the start of the file. From the ID3 site: The ID3v2 tag size is encoded with four bytes where the most significant bit (bit 7) is set to zero in every byte, making a total of 28 bits. The zeroed bits are ignored, so a 257 bytes long tag is represented as $00 00 02 01. So basically: 00000000 00000000 00000010 00000001 becomes 0000 00000000 00000001 00000001 I'm not too familiar with bit level operations and was wondering if someone could shed some insight on an elegant solution to ignore the leftmost bit of each of these four bytes? I'm trying to pull a base 10 integer from it, so that works as well.
