When dealing with random events, your goal is make intelligent guesses / predictions, otherwise all you can do is say "This is random, I don't know what to do" and go home crying. Philosophically speaking, Distributions and Random Variables are ways to model random events given our prior knowledge (Bayesian approach) or the frequency of past events (Frequentist approach). And you know what, it actually works... For example, if you work in the logistic department in a hospital and need to buy diapers for the new born babies, Empirical data shows that modelling the weight of newborns as a normal distribution makes sense, and seem to work quite well.
