SPSS vs R confidence interval

When I performed logistic regression and generated a confidence interval of the odds ratio with R using confint , it gave a different confidence interval than the one generated in SPSS. However, when I use confint.default in R instead, the confidence intervals were the same as those generated in SPSS. Can someone explain why I am getting different confidence intervals from SPSS vs R with confint and confint.default ?
