Here's an excerpt from perldoc perllocale which makes the issue clear: write() and LC_NUMERIC Formats are the only part of Perl that unconditionally use information from a program's locale; if a program's environment specifies an LC_NUMERIC locale, it is always used to specify the decimal point character in formatted output. Formatted output cannot be controlled by use locale because the pragma is tied to the block structure of the program, and, for historical reasons, formats exist outside that block structure. It seems that print() and printf() have the same behaviour.
