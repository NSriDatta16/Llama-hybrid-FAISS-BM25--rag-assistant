Please investigate the execution plan and see what are the differences between each runs. I guess SQL-server uses a different execution plan for your exists(...) query than for insert-select as it doesn't have to reach for all the columns in the first case. If there are confusing indexes or confusing statistics, optimization may get confused and pick a really bad plan. For this reason, after you investigate and save execution plans, try to reorganize/rebuild all indexes and recompute statistics on that table. Regards, Rob
