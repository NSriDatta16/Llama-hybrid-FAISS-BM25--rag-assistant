To mitigate the problem of class imbalance, you can do: Apply weighted cross entropy. When you are feeding each batch to the model, try to make sure there is no class imbalance in the batch data. Training word embeddings on such small data doesn't make sense. Try to use pre-trained word vectors like the Google news word vectors.
