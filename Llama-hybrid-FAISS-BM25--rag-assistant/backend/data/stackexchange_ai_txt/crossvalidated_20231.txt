A population either does have or does not have a natural clustering structure (schools, classes, students), and/or list information for every unit (that you can use for stratification; geography or ), and that's what dictates feasibility of a particular sampling method. Generally, stratified samples have smaller variances; systematic samples may approach the efficiency of proportionate stratified samples if the list from which the stratified sample is taken is cleverly organized, but it is more difficult to estimate variances with them properly. Systematic samples are actually clustered samples constructed in such a way that each cluster is approximately as heterogeneous as the whole population; in practical situations, real clusters tend to be more homogeneous than the population, and efficiency losses are suffered.
