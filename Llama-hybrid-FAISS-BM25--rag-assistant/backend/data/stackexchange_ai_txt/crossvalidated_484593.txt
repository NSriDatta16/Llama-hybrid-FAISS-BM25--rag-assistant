How to calculate this dependent probability (marbles without replacement)?

I present the question in two steps: First : Let there be 100 bags. A person puts 5 marbles into 5 separate, randomly selected, bags. You are now to collect the contents of the bags, one by one. If you have collected 3 marbles, you stop. What is then the expected number of bags to open for a 50% chance of getting 3 marbles? I suspect that this is some kind of binomial distribution, but I canâ€™t really phrase the exact solution. Second : Let there be 99 bags, and 500 marbles of 100 different colors, so that there exists 5 marbles of each color. For each of the 100 colors, a person takes all 5 marbles of that color and puts them into 5 separate, randomly selected, bags. I.e. each bag contains on average 5.05 marbles, and no bag contains more than 1 marble of the same color. You are now to collect the contents of the bags, one by one. If you have collected 3 marbles of the same color , you stop. What is then the expected number of bags to open for a 50% chance of getting 3 marbles of the same color? This second problem feels more like the birthday problem, but with multiple birthdays. How do I calculate these expected values?
