I also doubt that regular expressions are suitable for this. As Kragen has demonstrated, there are cases where regular expressions will match some piece of source code, but they will ignore the context in which that bit of source code appears. This can lead to errors. While it might be possible to write smarter regular expressions for such cases as Kragen showed, they will quickly become extremely complex and hard to read/maintain/understand, because they have to consider many different possible contexts. I'd prefer writing a parser using a parser generator (such as Yacc or Bison). But depending on the language of your source code, that can also be quite tricky.
