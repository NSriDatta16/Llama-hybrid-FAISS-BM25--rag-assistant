iphone image. multiple touches/drag

The problem im facing rightnow is that in an above portion i have scrollview which have different images clicking on it will clone a same image on to the screen. i have enable touches so i can drag it, but when i clicked another image and it comes to the screen i can drag that anotther image but not the previous one now. can any one have a solution so i can drag multiple images on clicking on it. i can put 4-5 on it for my use. i have use this code: Code: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch=[[event allTouches]anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; g1.center = location; } -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } thanks in advance.
