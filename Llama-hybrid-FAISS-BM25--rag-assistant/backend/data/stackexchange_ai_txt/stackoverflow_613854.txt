In addition to Robert's answer: Use enum for a finite set of named values. You don't really care about the numerical value behind each symbol (but you still have the ability to impose them, e.g. for compatibility with a legacy system). Robert: Yes, Enum's can be used as bit fields. Use the Flags attribute (and make sure members of the enum have suitable numerical values).
