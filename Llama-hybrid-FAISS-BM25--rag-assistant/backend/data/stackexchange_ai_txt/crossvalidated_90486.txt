Infer causality with high collinearity

I recently started to ask myself how to measure the impact of education on indexes like GDP: what is the outcome of mathematics or computer science on GDP, at the country level for instance. In this example, it is not possible to modify the experiment. I am aware of methods like Granger causality for time series, but more interested in knowing if we can gain insight directly from the couples (education, GDP) of all countries. Is it possible to use propensity scores when the variables are highly correlated? Can we reduce the collinearity by adding other variables to the model?
