Deep learning with Imbalanced classes

I am trying to model a packet data with 1 dimensional CNN but I have a very imbalanced classes in my target. I have 3 classes as class 0 has 53000 cases, class 1 has 300 cases and class 2 has 150 cases. Thanks in advance! I have tried what you have suggested but I do not think I am getting a good results(loss and accuracy), from the model.
