Difference between "probabilistic modeling" and "statistical modeling"

Is there a formal difference between the terms "Probabilistic Model" and "Statistical Model"? Is there a methodological difference between the two or just a preference of terminology? I see the former used most often with graphical models and Bayesian models, while "statistical" seems to be anything specifically Frequentist.
