If the data is unbalanced then the classifier would give more weight-age that set of group which has higher number of records. So it is obvious that the outcome would be biased towards that group. To overcome such issues we balance the data before hand. Yes, you can use Naive Bayes Classifier, it works based on the probability. Since your problem is document classification, Naive Bayes might give you good result, as you know in most of the scenarios simple models gives best results in complex scenarios. The other classifiers which you can try are Random Forest Decision Trees SVM. Most likely either of them would give you the desired result. As far as I understand there is no thumb as such because an algorithm can be used in many different ways. To put in bluntly, it is trail and error, very subjective to the business problem. So, please be careful when you finalize your model.
