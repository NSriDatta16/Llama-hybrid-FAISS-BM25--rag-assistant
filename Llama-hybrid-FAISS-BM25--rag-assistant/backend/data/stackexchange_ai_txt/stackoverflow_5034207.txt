Sort of in jest, but also serious: Line 1 fails because you used the strcpy( ) function, which may result in the copy overwriting the bounds of the destination buffer if a maintenance programmer increases the size of the student array at some point in the future. This could potentially allow arbitrary code execution in some environments, and is a security vulnerability. Line 2 fails because you now have two names for the same block of memory, which may result in aliasing conflicts and data corruption if both are used later. Line 3 fails because you have spelled Albert Einstein's name incorrectly. Line 4 fails because it's invalid C. The point is, you need to have a spec before you can have a meaningful discussion about how a program does or does not fail.
