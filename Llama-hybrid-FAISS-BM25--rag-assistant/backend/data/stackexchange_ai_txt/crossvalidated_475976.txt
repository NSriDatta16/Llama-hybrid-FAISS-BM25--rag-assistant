Dynamic Bayesian network notation

I am reading Murphy's thesis on Dynamic Bayesian networks [ pdf download ] . On page 14 (27 of the pdf) the variables within a DBNs are defined by a collection of nodes " $Z_t = (U_t , X_t , Y_t )$ to represent the input, hidden and output variables of a state-space model." What are input nodes please. How do they differ from observed nodes?
