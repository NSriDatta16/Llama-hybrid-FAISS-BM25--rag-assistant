To do this, you can leverage the fact that lists represent non-deterministic values when using applicatives and monads. It then becomes as simple as: apply f = mapM (\x -> [x, f x]) It basically reads as follows: "Map each item in a list to itself and the result of applying f to it. Finally, return a list of all the possible combinations of these two values across the whole list."
