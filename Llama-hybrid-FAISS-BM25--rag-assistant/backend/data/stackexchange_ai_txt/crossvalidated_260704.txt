Predicting risk of rare event occurring

Let's say I have a dataset containing a list of car accidents and associated information (e.g. weather, driver info, car state etc.). Let's assume I know the number of cars on the road and the distribution of the relevant characteristics (e.g. number of male / female drivers, historical weather data etc.). I would like to create a model to predict the risk of accidents given the current environment and the information about the driver. It does not have to be precise (i.e. low/medium/high risk would be enough). How should I proceed with that? I cannot think of any standard machine learning technique to predict the risk/probability of a rare event such as a car accident occur.
