The negative transfer problem in machine learning?

I can find the definition of negative transfer on Wikipedia: In behavioral psychology, negative transfer is the interference of the previous knowledge with new learning, where one set of events could hurt performance on related tasks. And a good illustration in this book: The ABCs of How We Learn . People use something they have memorized but in the wrong situation. This often happens because people do not learn to recognize the deep structure of a problem but instead use the obvious surface features as the cue for which solution to apply. Is it the same as what we talk about in machine learning? What caused the negative transfer? How can we prevent that?
