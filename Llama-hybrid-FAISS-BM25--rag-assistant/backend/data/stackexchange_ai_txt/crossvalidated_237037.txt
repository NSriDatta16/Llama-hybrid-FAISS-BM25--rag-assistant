Bayesian updating with new data

How do we go about calculating a posterior with a prior N~(a, b) after observing n data points? I assume that we have to calculate the sample mean and variance of the data points and do some sort of calculation that combines the posterior with the prior, but I'm not quite sure what the combination formula looks like.
