Is it valid to do a Bayesian analysis on an old paper which didn't publish a Bayesian analysis?

Is Bayesian Analysis, and the judgement it allows on the chance of a true effect being significant despite an overall analysis being not statistically significant, something that can be retrospectively applied to published data?
