Magento paypal currency error

Im using jamaican currency for my magento shopping cart.And i use paypal Express checkout with website payment standard. I set up the currency in the admin panel and also the paypal settings etc are done. My problem is when i click the button with Checkout with paypal i get the folowing error "PayPal gateway has rejected request. Currency is not supported (#10605" I go to paypal the paypal does not support the jamaican dollar. It would be great if some one can provide insights. Thannks
