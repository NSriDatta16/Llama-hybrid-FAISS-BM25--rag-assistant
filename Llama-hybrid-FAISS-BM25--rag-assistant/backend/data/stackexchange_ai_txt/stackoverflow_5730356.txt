You could either: Render a grid of vertices and use a vertex shader to rotate each vertex around the center according to its distance from the center. This would require lots of vertices towards the center, to maintain clean curvature. Render a single quad and use a fragment shader to similarly rotate the texture-coordinate. This would render more accurately, but would also be slower than the fragment shader.
