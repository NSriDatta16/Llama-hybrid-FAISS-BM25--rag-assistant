Python lib to make nice command line scripts with options etc

I remember coming reading about a python module/lib that helped make nice command line scripts that takes in options. My python script (1 file) does many things, and currently I comment out/uncomment the function I want run in my main section. I was hoping someone knows the lib I'm talking about that would help me organize the various functions and call them when I run the .py script.
