Nested triggers in WPF

I'm designing an application that uses a considerable amount of nested controls. Without going into too much (unnecessary) detail, the basic idea is that I have a ListView, where each ListItem may contain one or more ListViews, and this may repeat infinitely (ListView inside ListView). I have set up a DragEnter/DragLeave trigger on each ListView, so that when the cursor enters the region, the background changes. The problem is that due to the nesting, the trigger fires on every single ListView in the hierarchy, which is not what I want - I would like only the ListView directly under the cursor to animate. Is there a simple way to prevent trigger propagation on nested controls?
