If the response only takes a few categories, you may be able to use classification methods or ordinal regression if your response variable is ordinal. Plain linear regression will neither give you discrete categories nor bounded response variables. The latter can be fixed by using a logit model like in logistic regression. For something like a test score with 100 categories 1-100, you might as well simplify your prediction and use a bounded response variable.
