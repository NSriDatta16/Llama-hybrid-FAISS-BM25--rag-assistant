You don't have a constructor that initializes thetable . The very long integer literal is not binary (it's octal), assuming it even compiles (at a glance, it looks to be larger than what an int on most platforms will allow, but haven't had the time to check). Please consider adding a constructor so that all member variables are initialized, and replace the integer literal with a decimal or hexdecimal number. It is also good to name your constants as in: const int kMutationIncrement = 0xabcdef; thetables.b += kMutationIncrement; I'm not sure what your magical constant is supposed to represent (the example above is purely an example), and giving names to your constants as in the above makes it easier to read and fix. Also, just some other things to bring to your attention... You probably should pass the string seq to the constructor of Sequence . In Genome::loadData you pass a string by value... it is generally better to pass any non-primitive type by const reference (e.g. const string& ), unless you will need to copy it (e.g. assignment).
