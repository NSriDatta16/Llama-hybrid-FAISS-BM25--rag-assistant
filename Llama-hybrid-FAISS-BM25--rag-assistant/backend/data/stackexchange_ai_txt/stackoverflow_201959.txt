Limits on number of Rows in a SQL Server Table

Are there any hard limits on the number of rows in a table in a sql server table? I am under the impression the only limit is based around physical storage. At what point does performance significantly degrade, if at all, on tables with and without an index. Are there any common practicies for very large tables? To give a little domain knowledge, we are considering usage of an Audit table which will log changes to fields for all tables in a database and are wondering what types of walls we might run up against.
