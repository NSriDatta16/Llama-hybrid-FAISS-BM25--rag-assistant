From a technical point of view this is probably possible and I have heard it is already happening at a botnet vs. botnet level (can't find the reference - sorry), and I wouldn't be surprised if there were researchers out there also doing similar things, though they're unlikely to announce it or brag about it due to the ethical concerns. From an ethical point of view, you probably shouldn't do this. You're installing software onto someone else's machine and mucking around with it without their permission. It would be similar to breaking into someone's house through the living room window to ensure that the smoke alarms are still working. If the users participated in it voluntarily (that is, they deliberately install the software) then it would be OK, but then it would be like any other anti-virus... consent is the key here.
