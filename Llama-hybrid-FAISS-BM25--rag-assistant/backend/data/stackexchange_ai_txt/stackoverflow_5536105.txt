You can in principal store as much data as you have RAM with the exception that, currently, vectors and matrices are restricted to 2^31 - 1 elements because R uses 32-bit indexes on vectors. General vectors (lists, and their derivative data frames) are restricted to 2^31 - 1 components, and each of those components has the same restrictions as vectors/matrices/lists/data.frames etc. Of course these are theoretical limits, if you want to do anything with data in R it will inevitably require space to hold a couple of copies at least, as R will usually copy data passed in to functions etc. There are efforts to allow on disk storage (rather than in RAM); but even those will be restricted to the 2^31-1 restrictions mentioned above in use in R at any one time. See the Large memory and out-of-memory data section of the High Performance Computing Task View linked to in @Roman's post.
