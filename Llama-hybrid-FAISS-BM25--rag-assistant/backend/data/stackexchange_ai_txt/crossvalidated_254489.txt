Deep learning - how to approach the problem when the output itself has effect on the results

I have a set of 10 possible banners to show on a web page. For a given page view only a subset of them are available. I can only show one per page. There are some additional parameters for example page type, number of page viewes in the session and session count for the user. I want to use deep learning to maximize conversions (purchases) by showing the most effective banner given the available banners, page type, session number, etc... The desired output is 10 numbers representing the banners where the highest represents the banner with highest probability to convert. The problem: For training I need to show random banners in part of the sessions (e.g. 30%) (please correct me if I'm wrong on this). Then my training data will include the banner that was shown and whether it resulted in conversion or not. How do I treat the banner that was shown in the training? I cannot add it as additional input data because the desired output will be which banner to show.
