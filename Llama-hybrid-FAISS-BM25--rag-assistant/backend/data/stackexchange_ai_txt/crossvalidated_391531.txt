In your model: $$ y \sim Binomial(n, p) $$ $$logit(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$ you get: $$ log{p \over{1-p}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$ $$ log{~O_{y|x}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$ and solving for $\beta_1$ gives you: $$ \beta_1 = (\beta_0 + \beta_1) - \beta_0 $$ $$ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\beta_1 = log{~O_{y|x=1}} - log{~O_{y|x=0}} $$ $$\beta_1 = log{~O_{y|x=1} \over ~O_{y|x=0} } $$ and finally: $$exp(\beta_1) = {O_{treatment} \over O_{control}} $$ Since your OR is in fact $exp(-.64) = 0.53$ , you can convert this to a percentage via $(exp(\beta_1)-1) \times 100 = -47$ % and conclude that: The average probability of getting positive savings is 47% lower at level "treatment" than level "control". If independent variable $x$ were continuous you would say: The average probability of getting positive savings gets 47% lower for every unit increase in $x$ .
