Loss function in GAN

Since the aim of a Discriminator is to output 1 for real data and 0 for fake data, hence, the aim is to increase the likelihood of true data vs. fake one. In addition, since maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the log-likelihood, why are we updating the discriminator by ascending its stochastic gradient as mentioned in Algorithm 1 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf . Shouldn't we update the discriminator by descending its stochastic gradient? Any help is much appreciated!
