Modelling temperature: seasonality, stationarity, differencing

I have temperature-related time daily time series. I plot the time series and found that the plot have seasonal variations. Thus I differenced the series. When I did Dickey-Fuller test for both temperature and differenced temperature using ur.df , the results say that both time series are stationary. Dickey-Fuller test for differenced temperature: y_tempmax |t|) (Intercept) 1.353e-02 7.477e-02 0.181 0.856 z.lag.1 -1.593e+00 3.436e-02 -46.375 Dickey-Fuller test for temperature: summary(ur.df(production$tempmax, lags=1, type='trend'))#drift ############################################### # Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test Unit Root Test # ############################################### Test regression trend Call: lm(formula = z.diff ~ z.lag.1 + 1 + tt + z.diff.lag) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -11.6277 -1.0295 -0.0107 1.0514 9.4926 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

I got the following results: summary(a_tempmax) Series: production$tempmax ARIMA(2,0,1) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 mean 1.2924 -0.3013 -0.7346 89.4272 s.e. 0.0404 0.0391 0.0301 1.0500 sigma^2 = 2.776: log likelihood = -4049.1 AIC=8108.2 AICc=8108.23 BIC=8136.44 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 0.006608083 1.664633 1.27077 -0.02703688 1.419712 0.9228368 0.003088886 Do I need to difference the original temperature series to make it stationary? Any suggestions will be appreciated.
