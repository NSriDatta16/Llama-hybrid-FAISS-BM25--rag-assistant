What about using a timespan. if (Math.Truncate((A - B).TotalMinutes) == 0) { //There is less than one minute between them } Probably not the most elegant way, but it allows for cases which are one second apart and yet have different days/hours/minutes parts such as going over midnight. Edit : it occured to me that the truncate is unecessary... if (Math.Abs((A - B).TotalMinutes) Personally I think this is more elegant...
