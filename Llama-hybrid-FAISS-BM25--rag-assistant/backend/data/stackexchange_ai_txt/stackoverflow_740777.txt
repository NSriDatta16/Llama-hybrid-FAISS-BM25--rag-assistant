Is the xxm step by step install tutorial clear enough?

I know the xxm install guide is a lot to read and doesn't get you up and running as fast and easily as it would when you've seen it done. So I've installed xxm on a clean Windows install, and made screenshots at every step. I haven't made much tutorials before, and wouldn't even know where to start to make one of those walk-through video's with a voice-over... Is it clear enough? How could I improve it? (First thing that comes up to mind is I should have set the screen to 800x600) Should I extend this tutorial with how to include fragments on pages or how to debug a project, or should I make new tutorials about those?
