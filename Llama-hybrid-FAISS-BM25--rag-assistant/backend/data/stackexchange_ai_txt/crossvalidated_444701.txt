When is EarlyStopping really neccessary?

I have trained a CNN with EarlyStopping and I wonder if I should not use EarlyStopping and waste 20% of Trainingsdata for Validation, because it looks like as that the validation loss doesn't increase after 50 Trainingsepochs (please see the image). Sorry for this simple questions but I'm a beginner and I try to understand when EarlyStopping is really necessary and when it is superfluos to use EarlyStopping.
