Indy works quite well. I use it quite a bit with few problems. If your looking for more basic socket interaction you could use these other components: TTCPClient TCPServer TClientSocket TServerSocket All of these components also ship with Delphi. Don't know about winpcap directly, but I believe there is a delphi wrapper for it. I don't currently know where I've seen it but it shouldn't be hard to find using Google code search.
