It depends on the context. There are a few options: Return the collection. The caller can modify the collection as they wish, but they cannot assign a new collection. This is cheapest, but offers the least protection. Return a view (using unmodifiableXXX factories of the Collections class). The caller cannot modify the collection, but updates to the collection will be visible to the caller. This is usually relatively cheap because element storage isn't allocated; only a wrapper is created. Return a snapshot of the collection, using a copy constructor of the appropriate collection. Here, the caller gets a copy of the collection. They can modify the copy, but the original is not updated, and updates to the original are not visible in the copy. This is the most expensive.
