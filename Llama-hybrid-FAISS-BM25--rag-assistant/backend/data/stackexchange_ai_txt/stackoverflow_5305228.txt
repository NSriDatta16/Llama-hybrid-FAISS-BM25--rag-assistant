You can go this route: When the test is started, put start time in user's session. Afterwards, every time you display a page dealing with test, make sure you have a common part which will be used across these pages. At this part, every time a page is clicked, using jsp/servlets, you "push" in remaining time left, and using something like JavaScript countdown , you can elegantly display remaining time without that counter resetting itself.
