For a small amount of data (aka you'd feel comfortable loading it all into memory), I'd store the data using the NSUserDefaults persistence mechanims, which can easily handle serialization and storage of standard data structures on application startup and shutdown. It's very simple/quick to use. For larger datasets that shouldn't be loaded into memory at one time, sqlite seems reasonable.
