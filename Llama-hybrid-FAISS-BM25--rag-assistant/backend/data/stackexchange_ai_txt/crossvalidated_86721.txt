I don't think I would call either of them a "simple linear regression model". Although it is possible to use the log or the logit transformations as the link function for a number of different models, these are typically understood to refer to specific models. For example, "logistic regression" is understood to be a generalized linear model (GLiM) for situations where the response variable is distributed as a binomial . In addition, "log-linear regression" is usually understood to be a Poisson GLiM applied to multi-way contingency tables . In other words, beyond the fact that they are both regression models / GLiMs, I don't see them as necessarily being very similar (there are some connections between them, as @AdamO points out, but the typical usages are fairly distinct). The biggest difference would be that logistic regression assumes the response is distributed as a binomial and log-linear regression assumes the response is distributed as Poisson . In fact, log-linear regression is rather different from most regression models in that the response variable isn't really one of your variables at all (in the usual sense), but rather the set of frequency counts associated with the combinations of your variables in the multi-way contingency table.
