SSIS Package run from SQL Server Agent Job no longer do Logging

I Have a package stored in SQL Server which works properly with logging when I run it directly by right-clicking it in SQL Server, with logging. Logging is set to 'SSIS log provider for Text File'. When I run it from an SQL Server Agent Job, it works fine, without errors but the logging isn't done. The job runs with the my user, the same one that I use to start the package from SQL Server Anyone know why and how to make it log Thanks
