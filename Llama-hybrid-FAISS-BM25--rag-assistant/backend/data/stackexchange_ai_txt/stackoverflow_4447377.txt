ASP.NET super fast data search for autocomplete, please guide me

Thanks for your time and attention. I have ajaxtookit Autocomplete and requriment is to make it super fast. Currently data is in database and on every request it is fetched and come from database. This data are contacts and addresses and often new records will be added in the tables. There are 3 solutions that come to mind. Please guide me what you suggest and what you feel is the best. Let the data in database, just do indexing and if possible do some connection polling so that connection establishing time can be saved. Cache data in application server. Use Linq to query. Do search on sorted data in some file. Please guide and help me. Thanks
