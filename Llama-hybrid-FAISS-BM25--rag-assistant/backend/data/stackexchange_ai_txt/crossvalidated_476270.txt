Books Similar to Introduction to Statistical learning

I'm looking for books similar to Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (ISLR), which is not too rigorous in terms of the mathematical treatment, but still able to provide you the intuition about the methods? I'm particularly looking at this topics: Generalized Linear Models Time Series Analysis Survival Analysis
