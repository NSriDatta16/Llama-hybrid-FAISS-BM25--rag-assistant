It's Reliability vs Performance. FPS games don't require -all- the packets to reach the destination, to reach it in order, to be exceptionally big, or to assure big throughput. They only require the packets to reach the server AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. This is the ultimate priority and overhead of TCP is simply an unnecessary burden. WoW, in its "not quite realtime" communication and often tons of data to transmit (in crowded areas), may have to deal with packets exceeding MTU (requiring fragmentation) and requires reliability (fewer bigger packets = packet lost hurts more). So its choice of TCP is logical. Same would go for most turn-based strategy games and the like. In games where the player with ping of 30ms beats the player with ping 50ms UDP is the king.
