Rewriting mysql select to reduce time and writing tmp to disk

I have a mysql query that's taking several minutes which isn't very good as it's used to create a web page. Three tables are used: poster_data contains information on individual posters. poster_categories lists all the categories (movies, art, etc) while poster_prodcat lists the posterid number and the categories it can be in e.g. one poster would have multiple lines for say, movies, indiana jones, harrison ford, adventure films, etc. this is the slow query: select * from poster_prodcat, poster_data, poster_categories where poster_data.apnumber = poster_prodcat.apnumber and poster_categories.apcatnum = poster_prodcat.apcatnum and poster_prodcat.apcatnum='623' ORDER BY aptitle ASC LIMIT 0, 32 According to the explain: It was taking a few minutes. Poster_data has just over 800,000 rows, while poster_prodcat has just over 17 million. Other category queries with this select are barely noticeable, while poster_prodcat.apcatnum='623' has about 400,000 results and is writing out to disk
