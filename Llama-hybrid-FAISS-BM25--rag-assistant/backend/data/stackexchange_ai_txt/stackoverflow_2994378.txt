How to drag an item out from an Iframe and drop onto the parent

I have a folder tree view on the left page which was in a tag. The left page was the iframe container which contained the file list. When I want to drag the files out from the iframe, I got a headache. No matter if the containment option was set to 'parent' or 'window', I just can't drag out elements in the iframe container. How can I do this?
