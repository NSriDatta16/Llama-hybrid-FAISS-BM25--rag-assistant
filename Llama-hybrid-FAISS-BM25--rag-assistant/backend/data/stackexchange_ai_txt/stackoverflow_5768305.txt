Initialize already created objects in Spring

I'm intrested is there any way to initialize with dependencies already created objects? Suppose I have following class: class MyPage { @Autowired LogStorage storage; private String applicationId; private Date date; public MyPage(String applicationId, Date date) { this.applicationId = applicationId; this.date = date; } public String render() { Collection entries = storage.getEntries(applicationId, date); // render entries into HTML for example } } I want to split object creation into two phases. First of all, creating object with user provided data ( applicationId and date in this example) and the second is initializing object with Spring DI container dependencies. So I need some sort of initializing already created object. I think client code should look something like this: MyPage p = new MyPage(applicationId, date); beanFactory.initDependencies(p); String html = p.render(); The client doesn't know (and shouldn't in my case) all the dependencies required by Page object, so I can not provide dependencies explicitly. But I have reference to BeanFactory object and can delegate this task to Spring. Is there any ways to do it?
