How to check if modified genetic algorithm is significantly better than the original?

My question deals with how to be able to assert that an "improved" evolutionary algorithm is indeed improved (at least from a statistic point of view) and not just random luck (a concern given the stochastic nature of these algorithms). Let's assume I am dealing with a standard GA (before) and an "improved" GA (after). And I have a suite of 8 test problems. I run both both of these algorithms repeatedly, for instance 10 times(?) through each of the 8 test problems and and record how many generations it took to come up with the solution. I would start out with the same initial random population (using same seed). Would I use a paired t-test for means to verify that any difference (hopefully an improvement) between the averages for each test question would be statistically significant? Should I run these algorithms more than 10 times for each test/pair? Any pitfalls I should be aware of? I assume I could use this approach for any (evolutionary) algorithm comparison. Or am I really on the wrong track here? I am basically looking for a way to compare two implementations of an evolutionary algorithm and report on how well one might work compared to the other. Thanks!
