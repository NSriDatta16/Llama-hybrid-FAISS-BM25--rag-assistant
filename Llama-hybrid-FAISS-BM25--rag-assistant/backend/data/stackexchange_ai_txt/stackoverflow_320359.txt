Google Maps Polyline speed in Internet Explorer

Is there a way to speed up the rendering of Polylines in Google Maps when using Internet Explorer (7)? My map loads quickly in other browsers. I've encoded the Polylines as described here - http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/EncodePolyline/ and they are loaded from a static JavaScript file.
