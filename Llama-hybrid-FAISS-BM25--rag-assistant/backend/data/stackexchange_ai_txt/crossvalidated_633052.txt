Logistic regression - When to include or exclude a confounding variable from the model?

I am working on determining if there is an association between a medication (yes/no) and a health outcome (yes/no). However, the lines between what is a confounding variable to include in the model, and what is a known risk factor that should dictate who is included or excluded from the study cohort, are becoming blurred. For example, antibiotics are a known risk factor for this health outcome. Thus, there are several studies identical to mine that exclude people from their study cohort if they took an antibiotic within a certain time frame. However, prior hospitalization is also a known risk factor, yet I have seen some studies identical to mine handle it by excluding everyone who was hospitalized within a certain time frame from their study cohort, whereas some include prior hospitalization as an independent variable. How should I approach these types of variables?
