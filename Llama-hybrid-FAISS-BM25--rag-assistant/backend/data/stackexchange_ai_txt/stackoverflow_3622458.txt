This question is more than enough to fill a book. In fact, that's precisely what happened! Mark Jason Dominus' excellent Higher-Order Perl is available online for free. Here is a quote from it's preface that really grabbed me by the throat when I first read the book: Around 1993 I started reading books about Lisp, and I discovered something important: Perl is much more like Lisp than it is like C. If you pick up a good book about Lisp, there will be a section that describes Lispâ€™s good features. For example, the book Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming, by Peter Norvig, includes a section titled What Makes Lisp Different? that describes seven features of Lisp. Perl shares six of these features; C shares none of them. These are big, important features, features like first-class functions, dynamic access to the symbol table, and automatic storage management.
