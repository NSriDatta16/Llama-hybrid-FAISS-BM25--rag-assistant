As Robert Levy pointed out, you are referring to a "Nested Class" and not a "Subclass" etc. As for how to achieve what you are looking for... are you simply looking to make ControlPanel a private class? That will ensure that all members of ControlPanel are only accessible to Car. If you have other members on ControlPanel that need to be exposed, or the outside outside world needs to hold a reference to ControlPanel in someway, consider using an Interface to expose only those members that you want to be publically available. Public Class Car Dim cp As New ControlPanel Private Class ControlPanel Public Property Speedometer As Integer Public Property Odometer As Integer End Class Public Sub Drive() cp.Odometer = 76323 cp.Speedometer = 86 End Sub End Class Optionally... Friend Interface IControlPanel //Whatever actually needs to be publically accessible. End Interface // Other Code... Private Class ControlPanel Implements IControlPanel // Other Code... What is the goal that you are trying to achieve in terms of API?
