iPhone SDK: URL request not timing out

I am having a problem with a network request that should timeout, but the method is not called. The request is as follows: #define kCONNECT_TIMEOUT 20.0 request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL: aUrl]; [request setHTTPMethod: @"POST"]; postData = [jsonData dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding]; [request setHTTPBody:postData]; [request setValue:@"text/xml" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Accept"]; [request setValue:@"application/json" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"]; [request setCachePolicy:NSURLCacheStorageAllowed]; [request setTimeoutInterval:kCONNECT_TIMEOUT]; self.connection = [NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest:request delegate:self]; assert(self.connection != nil); This should get a callback to - (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didFailWithError:(NSError *)_error But after 4 minutes no error message is displayed. Anyone know why this might be?
