dectect sifr is active on page

I want to be able to check if sIFR has activated after the page has loaded so that I can then make other adjustments - sort of like setting up () alternate behaviours Since sIFR is already checking for the existence of flash, is there an easy global flag I can refer to, or should I just query the DOM to see if the sIFR-replaced class has been added ? It would be more elgegant if you could just test on a flag ;-)
