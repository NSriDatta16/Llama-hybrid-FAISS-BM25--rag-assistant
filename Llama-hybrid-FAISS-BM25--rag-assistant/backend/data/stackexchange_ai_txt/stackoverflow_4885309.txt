javascript error: invalid label? what does this mean?

no worries! it looks like more text than it is ;-) so please go on reading! The Main Questions are: What does the error: invalid label mean? Where is the error in my script? now the geeky stuff begins ;-): I have a script which loads items of an language-array (items defined via lang_keys in js - see above) from the server (server delivers a JSON version of that array), for the current language. with JS translate(" "); function you get the required text in the current language. UPDATE: jquery 1.5 not minified (old: jquery.js (v1.4.1 - minified)) is loaded and lang.js too. so I get an error, which I just can't find I have to add: the translate() function works without errors and the JS is not interrupted. All functions work as desired. i don't have any other errors and all the JS works fine ... but i don't want to be surprised in the futur - so i need to get rid of that error. console output in chrome (which is listed after the ajax request [/query/js_lang/json]): Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : jQuery.jQuery.extend.globalEvaljquery.js:602 jQuery.ajaxSetup.converters.text scriptjquery.js:6992 ajaxConvert jquery.js:6884 done jquery.js:6454 jQuery.ajaxTransport.send.callback jquery.js:7252 jQuery.ajaxTransport.send jquery.js:7261 jQuery.extend.ajax jquery.js:6646 (anonymous function) lang.js:116 console output in firefox (which is listed after the ajax request [/query/js_lang/json]): invalid label {"js_accept_terms":"Du musst unseren A...:"Kontaktname","js_agent_email":"Konta Can anyone tell me exactly what the error: invalid label means? My script (lang.js) looks like that: var month_names = new Array(); var day_names = new Array(); var lang_keys = new Array( "js_accept_terms", ... "nope" ); var translations = new Array(); function translate(key, replace){ var translated = translations[key]; if(replace != undefined){ for(var i=0; i out_message() displays a css-styled div. I am using that function in other parts of the website, where it works without any problems. I removed items in lang_keys where the return value has special characters like ':', umlauts, slashes and so on ... say: I tested it with only alphanumeric values and got the same error. sorry for my English ;-) and thanks for your help
