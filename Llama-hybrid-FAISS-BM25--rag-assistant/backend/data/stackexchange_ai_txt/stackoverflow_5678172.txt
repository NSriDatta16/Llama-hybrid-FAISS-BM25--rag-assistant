I would look at the user agent string the browser is sending in. Chances are, the user agent string is not the same in that version of chrome on those 2 platforms. There are lots of little differences. Also, I would add that, in most cases, server-side browser sniffing has very limited uses because, as you have seen, it is not particularly reliable and can be easily faked. If you are looking to style things differently or tweak some client-side behavior, using a javascript package like Modernizr to do feature detection is a much more robust way to go.
