Unfortunately, it seems to be surprisingly difficult to make AOP really useful in a normal mid-large size organization. (Editor support, sense of control, the fact that you start with the not-so-important things leading to code-rot, people going home to their families, etc.) I put my hopes to composite oriented programming , which is something more and more realistic. It connects to many popular ideas and gives you something really cool. Look at an up and coming implementation here: qi4j.org/ PS. Actually, I think that one of the beauties with AOP is also its achilles heel: Its non-intrusive, letting people ignore it if they can, so it will be treated as a secondary concern in most organizations.
