p-value for results of sub group analysis with ML?

I developed a ML algorithm (Xgboost) to predict a target in my data set. I obtain here the results of my predictions on my test set : tibble( truth = factor(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)), response = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0), prob_0 = c(0.8829266, 0.8831959, 0.7404993, 0.3993190, 0.6625459, 0.3192227, 0.6028344, 0.2362246, 0.4525665, 0.9415646), prob_1 = c(0.11707342, 0.11680406, 0.25950068, 0.60068098, 0.33745408, 0.68077731, 0.39716560, 0.76377536, 0.54743350, 0.05843538) ) I understand that the accuracy here corresponds to this code : num_total But I'm stuck now, because I don't know what to comparate to have the p-value of this accuracy. Do I must compare the response column versus the truth ? Or the num_sucess versus 0.5 (hazard) ? Or the prob versus the ground truth ? it's not a code question but way more a methodology one.
