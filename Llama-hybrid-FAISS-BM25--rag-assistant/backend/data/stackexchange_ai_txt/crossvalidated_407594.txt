Calculating bias of ML estimate of AR(1) coefficient

I am trying to develop adjustment factors for maximum-likelihood estimates of the auto-regression coefficient in an AR(1) process. By simulation I have discovered that the estimates are positively biased but consistent. I would like to produce a table of bias factors by number of observations N in the time series and population coefficient, which I would then try to convert into a table of correction factors by N and estimate value. Looking at related posts on here I see confirmation that the estimate is biased and consistent, and there is a formula for the asymptotic variance. there is also a thread about the bias from using MA(1) to approximate AR(1). But I could not find any formula for the bias of a MLE estimate of teh AR(1) coefficient. If no formula is available, I can use simulation to produce my table. But I would rather do it analytically if possible. The estimator is: $$\hat\theta = \frac{\sum_t y_t y_{t-1}}{\sum_t y_{t-1}{}^2}$$ where $\theta$ is the AR coefficient and $y_1,...,y_N$ are the observed time series values. What I am looking for is how to calculate $E[\hat\theta]$ in terms of $\theta$ and $N$ . For the time series I am working with, the instantaneous volatility $\sigma$ is always 1. Any suggestions on how I could develop a formula for $E[\hat\theta]$ , $E[\hat\theta] - \theta$ or $E[\hat\theta]/\theta$ would be gratefully received. Ditto if you can advise that there is no known solution, in which case I will just proceed to use simulation. Thank you
