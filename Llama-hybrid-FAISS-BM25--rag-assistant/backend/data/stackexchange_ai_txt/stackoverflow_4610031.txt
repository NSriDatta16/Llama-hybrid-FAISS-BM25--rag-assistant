I would recommend using JSON over HTTP; can be very high performance (see this benchmark ), readable, has good support for libraries. Many developers have misconception that JSON is mostly for AJAX; but JSON actually works pretty nicely as a service-to-service format too (and for storage on document databases too). Oh and Spring (version 3.0) has rather good support for JSON as well.
