Bayesian model validation LOOCV

I am fitting a Bayesian logistic regression using Stan in R. My model will be used for drawing inference rather than prediction. My dataset is very small (around 50 observations) so I am planning on using leave-one-out cross validation to check the model. My current plan is to fit the model on all data points and then assess the model fit separately using accuracy from LOOCV. This way I can draw inference from a version of my model fitted on all data points. Does it make sense to check the model like this?
