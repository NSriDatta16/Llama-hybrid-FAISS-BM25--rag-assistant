Can an iOS App's system settings be configured via Enterprise Distribution?

Apple's Enterprise Deployment Guide says that apps distributed internally to an organization can be accompanied by a "Configuration Profile" that changes certain system settings (like VPN or wifi preferences). Can the same system be used to distribute custom settings (as defined in the system wide "settings" application) for the enterprise application itself?
