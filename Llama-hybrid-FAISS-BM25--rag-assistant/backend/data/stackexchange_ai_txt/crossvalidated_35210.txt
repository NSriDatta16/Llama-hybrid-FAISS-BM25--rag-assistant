I don’t know if you have used “Time Series Modeler” in "SPSS Forecasting" or not. But If you did, then you can obtain different statistics including Goodness-of-fit measures: stationary R-square, R-square (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), maximum absolute error (MaxAE), maximum absolute percentage error (MaxAPE), normalized Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as referenced here , page 4. You can use these statistics to compare your models. To do so, from the menus choose -> Analyze -> Forecasting -> Create Models... (after selecting variables and methods) -> “statistics” tab.
