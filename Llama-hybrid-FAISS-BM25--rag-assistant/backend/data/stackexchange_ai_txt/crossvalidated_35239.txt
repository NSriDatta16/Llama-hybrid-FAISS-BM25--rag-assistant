To follow up on Michael's remarks. You didn't say whether or not the original data was time series data but an analysis of the residuals can often uncover that. Is this data time series i.e. observations taken over time for a particular country/section or is data taken for 1 period of time for many countries/sections?. My analysis tells me that this is most probably time series data. Concluding about normality requires testing for independence. On the off chance that you had misused regression and employed an OLS model, I took your 18 residuals into AUTOBOX to investigate the need for ARIMA structure and the detection of unspecified deterministic structure like Pulses, Level Shifts, Seasonal Pulses and/or local time trends. In the absence of knowledge about the possible frequency of measurements, I assumed that the data was annual. Here I plot the ACF of the original series ( your residuals ). suggesting a time dependence structure in the original series. A plot of AUTOBOX'S model residuals suggests randomness. . The model for your 18 values is which includes an AR(1) coefficient and a few pulses. Also, the statistical summary of this model is of interest as it suggests the importance of the model identified . The actual/fit/forecast graph illustrates the analysis visually. while the cleansed graph pinpoints the unusual activity . In summary, data exploration/assumption checking/data mining/exploratory data analysis all comes seamlessly together in this simple analysis. My conclusions are that your residuals are not normally distributed ( see histogram ) and your conclusions about statistical significance of your regression model coefficients are suspect. Auto-correlation in your error series is a de facto example of heterogenous variance and in this example is simply handled by the extraction.identification of the embedded ARIMA process and a few anomalies. There is no need for over-complicating the solution by non-linear transformations. The mantra of the statistician should be KISS (but not too simple ! ) and do no harm.
