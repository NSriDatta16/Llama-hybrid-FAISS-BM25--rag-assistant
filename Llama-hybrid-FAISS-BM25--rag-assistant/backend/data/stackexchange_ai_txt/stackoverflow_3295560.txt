Is this thread/background worker design for a C# WPF application OK?

Being new to using threads etc in UI's, can I ask is the following simple design seem OK. Refer to diagram image at link here In particular: a) use of backgroundworker & backgroundworker ProgressChanged to have the aggregator work on a separate thread. So I would need a custom class/type that had all the data I'd need to pass back from the aggregator thread to the UI thread I assume. b) create a separate thread within the aggregator to ensure that the SharpPCap/WinPCap callback method is in a different thread. So this Capture Manager thread writes packet results to a shared Buffer. I'm assuming here that if the code can see the buffer variable that they can both access it, irrespective of which thread they're running in? thanks
