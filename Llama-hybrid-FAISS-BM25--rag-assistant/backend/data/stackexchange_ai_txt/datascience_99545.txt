How to impute missing text data?

Lets say I have a dataframe consisting of two text columns. By text, I mean the values in those columns are either sentences/paragraphs. In such a case, how do I handle missing 'NaN' values? If it were a numeric data, I would use frequent/mean/median/knn imputation. But, what to do about text data? Any ideas?
