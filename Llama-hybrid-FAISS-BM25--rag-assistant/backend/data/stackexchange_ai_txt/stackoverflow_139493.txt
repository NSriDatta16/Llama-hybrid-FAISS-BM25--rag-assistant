I've worked on a couple of projects where we used GANTT charts. Yes they were useful, and yes they were larger than a page. What we did was to cut and paste (literally, with scissors and glue) the chart into a single big chart and put it on the wall. McConnell in his excellent Software Project Survival Guide recommends having something that every member of a team can look at to get a rough idea of whether they are on track, and this was it for us.
