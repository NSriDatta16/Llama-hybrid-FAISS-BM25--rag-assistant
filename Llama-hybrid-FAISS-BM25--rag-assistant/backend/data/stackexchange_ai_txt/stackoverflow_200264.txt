IMO; DataSets are evil. They are, and should only be used as, offline databases. Nothing more, IMO. However, what you do in your Data Access Layer (DAL) should not really impact your Business layer (BL). I'd just use objects (use interfaces) between them (IList) and then use an interface to define your DAL (IRepository) and the nyou can mock that interface to return whatever you need in your BL for unit testing. Unit testing Datasets is another beast, never tried it and I hopefully never have to... Perhaps an in-memory database is your best bet there... Oh, and for mocking I've used RhinoMock with some success. I'd also encourage you to look at IoCs ( http://www.castleproject.org/ ).
