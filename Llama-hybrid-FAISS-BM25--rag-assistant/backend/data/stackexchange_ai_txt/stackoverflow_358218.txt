Pertaining to what Greg mentioned above. You can definitely add a user agent to your header which we did in our application. There's more to the whole http connection code, but here's one way you could add the user agent to your header: NSMutableURLRequest *request; NSMutableDictionary *headers; headers = [[[NSMutableDictionary allocWithZone:[self zone]] init] autorelease]; [headers setValue:@"YourApp/1.0 (iPhone)" forKey:@"User-Agent"]; [request setAllHTTPHeaderFields:headers]; Again, note that this code is only focused on the header bit, so you'll have to implement the complete http solution.
