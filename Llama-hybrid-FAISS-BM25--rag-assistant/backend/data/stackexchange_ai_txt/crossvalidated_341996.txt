What you are proposing is the (weighted or not) arithmetic mean of precision and specificity . Two of the most common (confusion matrix) metrics being used are: F1-score . This is essentially the harmonic mean of precision and recall . Fβ-score . A weighted version of the above. It measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches β times as much importance to recall as precision. Geometric Mean Score . It corresponds to the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity and is used mostly in imbalanced problems. Your question essentially comes down to: Why are the harmonic and geometric means preferred to the arithmetic mean for averaging confusion matrix metrics? An excellent answer concerning these three means and their diffenences can be found here . Also, a discussion on which mean to use and when can be found here .
