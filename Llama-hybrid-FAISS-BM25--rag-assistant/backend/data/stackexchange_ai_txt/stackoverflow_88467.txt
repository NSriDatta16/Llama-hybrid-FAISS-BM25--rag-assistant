The short answer is that it cannot be done securely. There are, however, a lot of tricks that can be implemented to make it difficult for users to hit back and get sensitive data displayed. Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetExpires(Now.AddSeconds(-1)); Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); Response.AppendHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); This will disable caching on client side, however this is not supported by all browsers . If you have the option of using AJAX then sensitive data can be retrieved using a updatepanel that is updated from client code and therefore it will not be displayed when hitting back unless client is still logged in.
