Expectation is a probabilistic procedure that maps a random variable to a constant. It integrates over the known distribution of the random variable. A statistic is a functional that maps a random sample to a point. The sample average is a statistic that, by the SLLN, converges to the expectation in the long run. For example, if $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \sim \text{iid Uniform} (0, \theta)$ . The maximum is a statistic, the expectation of the maximum is $(n-1)/n \theta $ . Obviously if you collected such a random sample IRL, you wouldn't know $\theta$ , but you can find an unbiased estimator of it.
