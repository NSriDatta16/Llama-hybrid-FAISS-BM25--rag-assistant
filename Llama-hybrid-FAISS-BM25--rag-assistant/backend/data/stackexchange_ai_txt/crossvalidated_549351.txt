Here is an example, simulated in R . library(ggplot2) set.seed(2021) N Here, the x and g alone are awful predictors. However, using both together creates an excellent predictor. While, yes, I did have to engineer the interaction term, the question concerns a neural network, which would be able to figure out (or at least approximate) such a feature. Interestingly, this example does not even feature much correlation between x and g .
