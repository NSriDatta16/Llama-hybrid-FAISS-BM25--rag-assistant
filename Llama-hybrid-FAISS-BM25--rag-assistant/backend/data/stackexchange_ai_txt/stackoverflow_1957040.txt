someone here in SO told me that the hash (#) in the url could be retrieved by php function parse_url? is this true? Yes: parse_url('http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1957030/retrieve-the-hash-in-the-url-with-php/1957040#1957040', PHP_URL_FRAGMENT); // 1957040 But you can't determine the hash on the server side without knowing the full URL Ã  priori, not sure if the HTTP_REFERER holds this hash (think not).
