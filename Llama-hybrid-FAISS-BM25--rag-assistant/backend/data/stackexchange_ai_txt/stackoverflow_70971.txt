Don't accidentally conflate encryption with obfuscation. We commonly obfuscate emails to prevent spam. Lots of web sites will have "webmaster _at_ mysite.com" to slow down crawlers from parsing the email address as a potential spam target. That should be done in the HTML templates -- there's no value to doing this in persistent database storage. We don't encrypt anything unless we need to keep it secret during transmission. When and where will your data being transmitted? The SQL statements are transmitted from client to server; is that on the same box or over a secure connection? If your server is compromised, you have an unintentional transmission. If you're worried about this, then you should perhaps be securing your server. You have external threats as well as internal threats. Are ALL users (external and internal) properly authenticated and authorized? During backups you have an intentional transmission to backup media; is this done using a secure backup strategy that encrypts as it goes?
