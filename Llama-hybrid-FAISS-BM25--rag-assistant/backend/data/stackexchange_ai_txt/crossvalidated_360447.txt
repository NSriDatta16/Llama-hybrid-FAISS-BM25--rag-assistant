What you are basically looking for is how the time series are behaving taken as a group. Am I right in that. In that case what you can do is consider the time series and then the simplest method would be to find the tick by tick mean and then a standard deviation of the entire matrix for all the three time series at all ticks. Now you can define the outliers as any point which lies outside the mean (plus-minus) standard deviation. However, if you want a more robust approach as mean is highly susceptible to outliers what you can instead do is go for the median in place of mean and MAD in place of standard deviation. Although, you would have to multiply your MAD by a normalizing parameter to make it a consistent estimator. MAD by the way is median absolute deviation.
