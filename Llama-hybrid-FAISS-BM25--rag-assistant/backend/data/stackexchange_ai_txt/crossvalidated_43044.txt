There are many different meanings of a term "representativity" in different fields. To give an answer I will post a quote from Bethlehem, Cobben, Schouten (2009) Indicators for the Representativeness of Survey Response . The concept of representativity is often used in survey research, but usually it is not clear what it means. Kruskal and Mosteller (1979a, 1979b and 1979c) present an extensive overview of what representative is supposed to mean in non-scientific literature, scientific literature excluding statistics and in the statistical literature. They found the following meanings for ‘representative sampling’: (1) general acclaim for data, (2) absence of selective forces, (3) miniature of the population, (4) typical or ideal case(s), (5) coverage of the population, (6) a vague term, to be made precise, (7) representative sampling as a specific sampling method, (8) as permitting good estimation, or (9) good enough for a particular purpose. They recommended not using the word representative, but instead to specify what one means. These are the references to Kruskal, and Mosteller: Kruskal, W. and Mosteller, F. (1979a). Representative sampling, I: Nonscientific literature. International Statistical Review, 47, 13–24. Kruskal, W. and Mosteller, F. (1979b). Representative sampling, II: Scientific literature, excluding statistics. International Statistical Review, 47, 113–127. Kruskal, W. and Mosteller, F. (1979c). Representative sampling, III: the current statistical literature. International Statistical Review, 47, 245–265. Kruskal, W. and Mosteller, F. (1980). Representative sampling, IV: the history of the concept in statistics, 1895 - 1939. International Statistical Review, 48, 169–195.
