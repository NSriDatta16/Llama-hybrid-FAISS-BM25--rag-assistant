In my app I just use this cache to store a bunch of data retrieved from a remote api every X hours; in other words I don't stress this cache too much. â€¦ How could I improve it? If your code works for you, why bother? However as you explicitly asked for comments, I try to add my ideas anyway. To me it sounds like you could use a traditional storage like files or a database to store the data as it is only refreshed periodically. In many cases one just needs some (potentially expensive) preprocessing, so you might be able to focus on doing the work once and just storing the data in a form so access/delivery to the client is fast. Advantages: simple no issues with multiple processes (e.g. FastCGI) reduced memory foot print Do I need to make it Thread-Safe? That really depends on your usage pattern. However from your API I guess that's not really necessary as you compute a value twice (worst case).
