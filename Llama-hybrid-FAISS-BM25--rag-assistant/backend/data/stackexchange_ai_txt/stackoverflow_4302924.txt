First of all, setting revert to false, will disable the revert function entirely. As you point out, you'll be able to drop the draggables anywhere. What you usually want is revert: 'invalid' which means that it'll revert whenever it's dropped on anything that isn't a droppable that accepts it. What you want to do ought to be something like this: $('#selected').droppable({ drop: function() { // since you're doing a full re-calc every time, this doesn't need to be global var total = $("#selected li").length; if(total >= 5) { // once you've reached five, simply don't accept any more elements // the rest will revert if dropped here $('#selected').droppable('disable'); } } });
