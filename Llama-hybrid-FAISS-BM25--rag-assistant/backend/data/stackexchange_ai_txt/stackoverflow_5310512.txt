There are two things you could check: have you set the minimum SDK version of your app to use version 4 (Android 1.6) support for this started? Secondly, the layout-large and layout-small folders are designed for different sized screens (think tablet vs phone), and not resolution. If you're changing the resolution (DPI) of the device, you'll need to use layout-hdpi , layout-ldpi etc. Further, if it's only the images you're changing, you should be placing the different images in drawable-hdpi , drawable-ldpi etc, and not layout-xxxx . If on a supported device, Android will pick the image from the correct folder, so you'll only have one layout folder (or 2 if you use layout-land ) Some (or all :S) of these points are covered in this link, to another question on StackOverflow. Try to use the search function before asking a question. Also, you'll find people are more receptive to providing answers to users with higher accept percentages. Android - layout-large folder is been ignored Edit: for multiple screen support, also look at Fragments to better organise and fit your content for both large and small screen devices ( dev.Android , worked example )
