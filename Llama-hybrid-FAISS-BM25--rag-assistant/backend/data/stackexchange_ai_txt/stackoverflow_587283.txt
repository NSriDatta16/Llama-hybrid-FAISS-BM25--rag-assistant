Looking at the documentation, I believe you need to get the IHTMLElement2.currentStyle property as the regular style property is the inline style only. This difference is indicated in the remarks for IHTMLElement2.currentStyle : The values returned by the properties of the IHTMLStyle and IHTMLCurrentStyle interfaces differ when the style of an object is not set inline. For example, if the author of a Web page sets the color property of a paragraph to red only through a linked or embedded style sheet, and not inline, then the IHTMLCurrentStyle::color property returns the value red, and the IHTMLStyle::get_color property does not return a value. However, if the author specifies the value of the color property inline, as in the following example, both the IHTMLCurrentStyle::color and IHTMLStyle::get_color properties return the value red. currentStyle provides a IHTMLCurrentStyle interface, which when queried for IHTMLCurrentStyle2 will give you writingMode as you require.
