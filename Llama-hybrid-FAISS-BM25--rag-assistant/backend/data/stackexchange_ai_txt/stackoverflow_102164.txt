My favorite quick tip is that when you expand a table name in the object explorer, just dragging the word colums to the query screen will put a list of all the columns in the table into the query. Much easier to just delete the ones you don't want than to type the ones you do want and it is so easy, it prevents people from using the truly awful select * syntax. And it prevents typos. Of course you can individually drag columns as well.
