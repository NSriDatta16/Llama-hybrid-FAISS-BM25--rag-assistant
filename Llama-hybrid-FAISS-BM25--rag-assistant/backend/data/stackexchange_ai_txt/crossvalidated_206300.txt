I'm haven't been working with very complicated problems of classification (prefer regression modeling), but I can recommend 2 techniques, which handle the most complicated decision boundaries for classification: neural networks and k nearest neighbors analysis. I'm not sure about Python and R, but MATLAB definitely has very good libraries for neural networks; k nearest neighbors analysis isn't very complicated and can be coded easily in any language. You can also try adaptive nearest neighbor metric for the boundaries to stretch in one direction. You may also try using Gaussian methods such as na√Øve Bayes classifier using Gaussian density (smooth Parzen estimate). Hope you will solve your problem effectively!
