Java: find parent and children ....Tree, Loop, ArrayList, List, HashMap, ....what to do?

I'm encouraged by so many warm-hearted Java experts that I dare to throw another question today for help (all my questions are from real life projects - and since I'm taking a shortcut for learning Java, I have more difficulties than taking a normal course of Java).. Here is the data structure I want to achieve (the final result should be a TreeMap with id as the key) id (int) Characteristic (int) parent(by id) immediate children (by id) 1 1 {} {2,3,4} 2 99 {1} {} 3 99 {1} {} 4 2 {1} {5,6} 5 99 {2} {} 6 3 {2} {7,8} 7 99 {3} {} 8 4 {3} {x,xx, ...} .... .... The first two columns are known, the last two columns need to be obtained programmatically. Here are the rules: 1) item with Characteristc as 1 is ancestor and will never have parent. 2) items with Characteristic as 99 will never haven childen. 3) items with Characteristics (2 - 9) can have parent and children and their children can have children (that must be greater than them or 99) or no children (99). For example, 2 can have 99 and 3 as children, but 3 cannot have 2 as their child) thanks
