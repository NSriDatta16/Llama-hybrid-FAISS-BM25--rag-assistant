In simulator, just copy your Documents folder somewhere else (or an item from it, if that's all you need). I presume you know this, but you'll find the home directory for you app when run in simulator at: /Users/ /Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/3.1.3/Applications /Users/ /Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/3.1.2/Applications etc. Before launching again in simulator if you want to restore the data files, drag them into the current app/sim folder. I just did exactly that (transferring something from 3.1.3 over to the 3.1.3 app) ten minutes ago. Other alternatives I've considered in the past include: Zip and attach to email the Documents directory. Use an HTTP file upload for a data file or zipped set of files, and http download to reinstate files. More work, but you can also use the Google Docs API ( sdk available ) to exchange files with a Docs account.
