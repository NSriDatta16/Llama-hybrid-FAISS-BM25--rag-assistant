My understanding is that in the context of unit tests ( TransactionalTestExecutionListener ), the code that otherwise looks up the transaction manager is not used ( TransactionInterceptor#determineTransactionManager ). You could try to annotate your test class with @TransactionConfiguration , which accepts a transactionManager attribute. Not the most elegant way, but possibly the best option for the time being.
