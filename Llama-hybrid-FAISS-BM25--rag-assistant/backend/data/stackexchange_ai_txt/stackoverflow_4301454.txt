Generating synthetic social networks?

I have come across a number of social network analysis tools but I was wondering if there are any libraries that let you generate synthetic social networks like the Watts and Strogatz model or the Barab√°si-Albert Scale-Free networks or a network dependent on the Caveman model. Whatever I have come across are either pure algorithms or implementations in Fortran which is not really my language of expertise. What I am currently looking for is a way to set the properties of the social network and be able to generate a synthetic network (adjacency list perhaps) for further analysis. Does anyone have any suggestions?
