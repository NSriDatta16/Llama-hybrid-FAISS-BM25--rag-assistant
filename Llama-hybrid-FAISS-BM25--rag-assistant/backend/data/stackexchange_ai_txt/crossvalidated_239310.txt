Book to read after Bishop's "Pattern..." to complete my stats knowledge

I am finishing the (very good, although demanding) "Pattern recognition and machine learning". I think I have learnt a lot. My previous knowledge in statistics and probability was very superficial. I would like to know more about statistics and probability, trying to cover the topics that Bishop doen't treat in his great book. So I suppose this question is mostly for people who know Bishop's "Pattern...", but I invite everybody to answer. Bishop's book is very strong in the machine learning part, but, for example, the part of the statistical tests (in a frequentist or Bayesian approach) is missing, as far as I have noticed. Some time ago, not related to this question, I was recommended the book "Probability theory, the logic of science", by E. T. Jaynes. (I am a physicist, so I suppose this is a book that attracts me naturally). Is it a good option to continue learning about prob and stats? Do you know other options? Thank you very much.
