Multinomial Logistic Regression in R: varying label set

I have a relatively large data set of 9M rows that is almost 1GB in size. The data looks like: t e p acs acc v correct_p t1 e11 p11 acs11 acc11 v11 0 t1 e12 p12 acs12 acc12 v12 1 t1 e13 p13 acs13 acc13 v13 0 ... t2 e21 p21 acs21 acc21 v21 0 t2 e22 p22 acs22 acc22 v22 0 t2 e23 p23 acs23 acc23 v23 1 t2 e24 p24 acs24 acc24 v24 0 ... t3 e31 p31 acs31 acc31 v31 1 t3 e32 p32 acs32 acc32 v32 0 My questions are: Is it feasible to train/iterate a multinomial logistic regression model on my local installation of R for the data set above? I have access to a computing cluster, but I'd have to use the ml Python library or Scala, both of which I am less familiar with. If the answer to the previous is yes, then I am concerned about my labels . There are 3.1M distinct labels (the p column). For each t , I would like to calculate the probability for each of the labels p possible only for that t . So t1 can only be labeled with p11 , p12 or p13 and t3 can only be labeled with p31 or p32 . The features would be acs , acc and v . Is this possible? I've only ever seen cases where there is a small set of labels available for all observations.
