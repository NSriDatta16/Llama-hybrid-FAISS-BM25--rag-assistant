You might have read something incomplete or misleading. To quote Bjarne Stroustrup from "The C++ programming Language", fourth Ed., p. 602: In a class , members are by default private ; in a struct , members are by default public (ยง16.2.4). This also holds for members inherited without access level specifier. A widespread convention is, to use struct only for organization of pure data members. You correctly used a class to model and implement object behaviour.
