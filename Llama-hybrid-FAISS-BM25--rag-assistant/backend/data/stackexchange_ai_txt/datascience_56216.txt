Expanding on my comment, The SelectFromModel selects the best features based on some information criteria. When the estimator (random forest in your case) is fitted, the SelectFromModel calulcates feature importance for each of the features the estimator is fitted with. Then the SelectFromModel 'filters' out those features which don't meet a specific criteria, for example a feature_importance value criteria. Setting this criteria (named threshold in Sklearn) can have big affect on number of features being filtered out. Based on your question its hard telling if indeed all features are valuable to estimators fit quality. One way examining if it's a code related issue is trying different values for the threshold param. One would expect number of selected features (features with support) to decrease when threshold increases. If this works as expected you can think of how you determine the threshold value that will best serve your needs.
