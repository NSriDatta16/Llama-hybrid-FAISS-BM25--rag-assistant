Actually, have you looked at the other 'wmode' available? I think there's a "normal" value too, which if I recall correctly will set your Flash object flat on a layer (like it should :P) in its current container. So just make sure its within it's own DIV tag too and has a z-index setup as well. HTML Flash embedding ain't really something I do on a daily basis (even less tested in Chrome) but hopefully this will shed some light.
