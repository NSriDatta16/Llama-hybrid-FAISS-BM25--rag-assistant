Maybe with data as small as 36 and only 3 positive samples the way is try to do a simple rule instead of a model, because it looks like a machine learning approach wouldn't work. But if you really want modelling one way is using Bayesian logistic regression because with this you can estimate the distribution of the betas and see the broadness of the intervals, or perform a simple logistic regression and bootstrap the sample in order to estimate the beta's intervals and any another metric of your interest.
