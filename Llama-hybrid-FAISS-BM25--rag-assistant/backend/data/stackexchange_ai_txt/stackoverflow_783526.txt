I'm sure most of the time the reason companies go forward with VB.NET is exactly as you mentioned - large amounts of VB6 in the organization, both in terms of codebase and developers. Keep in mind that ASP websites and VB6 applications can be migrated to VB.NET with little to no pain. VB6 to C# is a different story. That being said, having worked at companies that have used VB.NET, there's really very little difference in how you do things and developers who are curious get used to reading examples, books, etc. in C#. It's not like it's terrifically hard to translate C# code to VB.NET, especially if you're not copy-pasting.
