Performing an action after a RowSort operation

I have a JTable and a TableRowSorter which I'd like to perform an operation after a sort is finished. I've been browsing the net, and so far I haven't had much luck. Initially I thought just a RowSorterListener would do the trick, but unfortunately it doesn't perform the operation after the sort is finished. Adding a MouseListener to the JTable header could work, but the solution isn't terribly elegant. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks a bunch! Edit (from comment): The following is added in a method inside a custom TableModel class which extends AbstractTableModel . This method is invoked whenever the JTable is set/specified in the custom TableModel class. sorter.addRowSorterListener(new RowSorterListener() { @Override public void sorterChanged(RowSorterEvent rowsorterevent) { rebuildMItems(); // The method which executes } });
