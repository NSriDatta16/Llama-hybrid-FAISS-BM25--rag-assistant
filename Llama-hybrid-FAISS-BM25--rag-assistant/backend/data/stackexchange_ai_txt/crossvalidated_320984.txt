Does PCA make these assumptions (ellipsoid and hyperplane concentration)?

I have used PCA many times. Now, I always understood it as a method that: assumed that you can apply linear transformations (rotation, scaling, translation of axes) on your data axes to find a set of axes which are orthogonal to each other and maximally explain variance. Now, I watch a lecture which says: Why does PCA make these assumptions? From which line of reasoning I can go to those assumptions because apparently they must be equivalent.
