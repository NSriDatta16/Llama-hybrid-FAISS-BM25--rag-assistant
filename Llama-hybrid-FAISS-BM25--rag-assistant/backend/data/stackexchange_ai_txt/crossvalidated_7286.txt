Can I change the proposal distribution in random-walk MH MCMC without affecting Markovianity?

Random walk Metropolis-Hasitings with symmetric proposal $q(x|y)= g(|y-x|)$ has the property that the acceptance probability $$P(accept\ y) = \min\{1, f(y)/f(x)\}$$ does not depend on proposal $g(\cdot)$ . Does that mean that I can change the $g(\cdot)$ as a function of previous performance of the chain, without affecting the markovianity of the chain? Of particular interest to me is the adjustment of the scaling of Normal proposal as a function of acceptance rate. Would also greatly appreciate if someone can point out to the adaptation algorithms used in practice for this type of problem. Many thanks.
