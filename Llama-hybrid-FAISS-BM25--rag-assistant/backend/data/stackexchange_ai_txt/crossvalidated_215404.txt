Is there Factor analysis or PCA for ordinal or binary data?

I have completed the principal component analysis (PCA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), treating data with likert scale (5-level responses: none, a little, some,..) as a continuous variable. Then, using Lavaan, I repeated the CFA defining the variables as categorical. I would like to know what types of analyses would be appropriate for and would be equivalent of PCA and EFA when data are ordinal in nature. And when binary . I would also appreciate suggestions for specific packages or softwares that can be easily implemented for such analyses.
