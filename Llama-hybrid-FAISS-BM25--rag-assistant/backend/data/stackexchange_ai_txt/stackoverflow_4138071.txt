How to start a process with extra data and then search for this process?

I have an agent program that will launch multiple instance of the same executable. Each of those instances need to have an individual ID associated with them. The agent retains a reference to the Process object that was used to load the instance, but I have to consider that the agent may be shut down and restarted without affecting the started instances. Once the agent starts again, I need it to search the existing processes and rebind a reference to the processes. How can I assign data to a process and retrieve it afterwards? Right now, I am starting the process like this: this.AttachedProcess = new Process() { StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo(filename) }; And, later, I need to search for that process by calling Process.GetProcesses() . While I could use a command line argument to start the process (something like -instance XX ) and read that command line using this answer , I'd like to know if there is another way to assign extra data to a process and retrieve it later.
