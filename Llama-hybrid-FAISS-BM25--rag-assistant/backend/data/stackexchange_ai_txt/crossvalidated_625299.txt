How to analyse trend lines on non-uniformly sampled time series data in R?

I have four time series of the same parameter (e.g., air temperature) sampled at four distinct stations. Because of sampling and logistical issues, the sampling at the four stations were conducted manually by one operator and applying a continuous regular time interval sampling was not possible. As such, samplings at the various stations are non-continuous and have different time lengths. Here are two of the four datasets that I am analysing using R: >ST1 Date_Time_UTC Air_Temp 1: 2016-12-24 -26.19000 2: 2016-12-24 -20.58000 3: 2016-12-24 -22.69000 4: 2016-12-24 -27.43000 5: 2016-12-25 -20.63000 6: 2016-12-25 -22.26000 7: 2016-12-25 -22.49000 8: 2016-12-25 -25.07000 9: 2016-12-25 -24.95000 10: 2016-12-25 -24.69000 11: 2017-01-15 -25.23000 12: 2017-01-15 -24.81000 13: 2017-01-16 -24.50000 14: 2017-01-16 -23.90000 15: 2017-01-16 -23.72000 16: 2017-01-16 -25.14000 17: 2017-01-16 -23.63000 18: 2017-01-16 -23.47000 19: 2017-01-16 -25.45000 20: 2017-01-16 -25.24000 21: 2017-01-17 -23.71040 22: 2017-01-17 -24.07000 23: 2017-01-17 -21.78000 24: 2017-01-23 -22.80000 25: 2017-01-23 -22.28000 26: 2017-01-23 -22.75582 27: 2017-01-23 -22.82000 28: 2017-01-23 -23.30000 29: 2017-01-23 -21.53000 30: 2017-01-24 -21.21000 31: 2017-02-19 -20.83000 32: 2017-02-19 -22.18700 33: 2017-02-26 -24.13000 34: 2017-02-26 -24.94000 35: 2017-02-26 -23.43000 36: 2017-03-16 -23.56783 37: 2017-03-16 -23.72000 > ST2 > Date_Time_UTC Air_Temp 1: 2017-01-03 -26.32000 2: 2017-01-03 -25.87000 3: 2017-01-03 -26.19000 4: 2017-01-03 -26.30000 5: 2017-01-03 -26.30000 6: 2017-01-04 -25.87000 7: 2017-01-04 -25.67000 8: 2017-01-04 -24.73000 9: 2017-01-04 -25.61000 10: 2017-01-04 -24.09000 11: 2017-01-06 -25.93000 12: 2017-01-06 -24.89000 13: 2017-01-06 -24.64000 14: 2017-01-06 -22.91000 15: 2017-01-07 -22.35000 16: 2017-01-07 -23.98432 17: 2017-01-07 -24.02000 18: 2017-01-07 -25.09000 19: 2017-01-07 -24.81000 20: 2017-01-07 -24.41000 21: 2017-01-07 -24.29000 22: 2017-01-07 -22.26000 23: 2017-01-08 -21.62000 24: 2017-01-08 -19.74000 25: 2017-01-08 -24.75000 26: 2017-01-08 -19.29000 27: 2017-01-08 -19.47000 28: 2017-01-08 -26.20000 29: 2017-01-08 -23.30000 30: 2017-01-10 -26.83000 31: 2017-01-10 -23.10000 32: 2017-01-10 -26.97000 33: 2017-01-10 -24.12000 34: 2017-01-10 -25.83000 35: 2017-01-10 -26.04000 36: 2017-01-10 -22.57000 37: 2017-01-10 -25.80000 38: 2017-01-11 -26.44000 39: 2017-01-11 -24.77000 40: 2017-01-11 -25.53000 41: 2017-01-11 -25.50272 42: 2017-01-11 -26.64000 43: 2017-01-11 -26.19000 44: 2017-01-11 -26.06000 45: 2017-01-12 -25.69000 46: 2017-01-12 -26.76000 47: 2017-01-12 -25.54000 48: 2017-01-12 -27.23000 49: 2017-01-12 -26.55000 50: 2017-01-13 -26.96000 51: 2017-01-13 -26.69000 52: 2017-01-13 -27.00000 53: 2017-01-13 -27.05000 54: 2017-01-13 -28.12000 55: 2017-01-13 -26.88000 56: 2017-01-25 -28.59000 57: 2017-01-26 -27.96000 58: 2017-01-26 -28.84000 59: 2017-01-26 -28.26014 60: 2017-01-26 -27.42000 61: 2017-01-26 -26.80000 62: 2017-01-26 -28.07000 63: 2017-01-27 -31.53000 64: 2017-02-18 -27.21000 65: 2017-02-18 -27.28000 66: 2017-02-18 -28.84464 67: 2017-02-18 -27.19000 68: 2017-02-28 -24.82000 69: 2017-02-28 -24.68000 70: 2017-03-01 -27.93044 71: 2017-03-01 -25.08245 72: 2017-03-01 -24.70034 73: 2017-03-01 -23.09000 74: 2017-03-02 -28.45894 75: 2017-03-14 -26.84184 76: 2017-03-14 -27.08000 77: 2017-03-14 -26.56000 78: 2017-03-14 -26.43000 79: 2017-03-14 -26.91900 80: 2017-03-14 -26.97000 81: 2017-03-15 -26.21000 The aim of my analysis is to draw a trend line for my time series data, fitting a regression model that can capture the relationship between the variable and time. My hypothesis is that temperature decrease or increase over time at different stations. What should I do in order to achieve my goal? Initially, I draw a linear regression using geom_smooth with ggplot and testing the lm function to get slope, R2 and p-value, but I am not sure if this is appropriate for non-uniformly sampled data. I also do not know if I need to test some conditions, such as stationarity, autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and/or others. e.g. formula I tried to find online a clear explanation on how to deal with my aim and the type of dataset I have. Unfortunately I did not find a clear explanation. I have the suspicion that I need to test for stationarity and autocorrelation and in case at least one of them is not satisfied it is advisable to use a different model than linear regression, such as the OLS which uses the principle of minimizing the sum of squared errors. However, I am not sure at all of what I have understood. My knowledge in statistics is very basic. May you please explain what are the steps and methods that I need to follow in order to draw a trend line on a non-uniformly sampled time series data? May I use a linear regression model in these conditions in order to show the overall variability of my variable over time? What are the tests I need to perform and can you suggest an R-script?
