They used a Beta-Binomial Bayesian model to calculate the posterior efficacy ( link to study plan as PDF). First, letting $\pi_v$ and $\pi_c$ be the population probabilities that a vaccinated or a control subject contract Covid-19, respectively. The population vaccine efficacy is defined by $$ \mathrm{VE}=1 - \frac{\pi_v}{\pi_c} $$ The statisticians assume a prior distribution for the parameter $$ \theta = \frac{1 - \mathrm{VE}}{2 - \mathrm{VE}} $$ Substituting the definition of the efficacy, this can be rewritten as $$ \theta = \frac{\pi_v}{\pi_v + \pi_c} $$ So $\theta$ is the probability that a subject who contracted Covid-19 is from the vaccinated group and $1-\theta$ is the probability that the subject was in the control group. The study plan states that they assumed a Beta( $a_0 =0.700102, b_0=1$ ) prior for $\theta$ which results in a prior mean of $\mathrm{E}(\theta)=0.4118$ which corresponds to a prior mean of 30% efficacy, because $\mathrm{VE}=(1 - 2\theta)/(1-\theta)$ . Recall that the posterior is simply another Beta distribution with parameters $a_1 = a_0 + m_v$ and $b_1 = b_0 + m_c$ where $m_v$ and $m_c$ denote the number of subjects that fell ill in the vaccinated and control group, respectively. You can calculate all desired probabilities from this posterior distribution (and updated it when more data are available). Let's illustrate it with the data given in your post. We have $m_v = 9$ and $m_c = 85$ so the posterior Beta distribution has parameters $a_1 = 0.700102 + 9 = 9.700102$ and $b_1 = 1 + 85 = 86$ . We are interested in the probability that the vaccine has 90% efficacy or more which corresponds to a $\theta \leq 1/11$ . The calculations in R are as follows: # Priors a0 = 0.700102 b0 = 1 # Posterior a1 = a0 + 9 b1 = b0 + 85 # Critical probability p_crit So the posterior probability that the efficacy is greater than 90% is $0.398$ which corresponds to the grey area in the plot. The mode of the posterior Beta distribution is at $0.093$ which translates to an efficacy of $0.898$ , which corresponds nicely to the reported efficacy of 90%. Here is the plot of the posterior density. The red vertical line denotes the $\theta$ below which the efficacy is $\geq$ 90% (depicted by the grey area): A more detailled exposition can be found in this blog .
