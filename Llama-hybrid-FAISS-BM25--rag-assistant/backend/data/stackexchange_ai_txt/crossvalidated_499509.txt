Need Concrete Example of Where a Frequentist Clustering Technique Outperforms the Existing Bayesian Clustering Techniques

I'm looking for a concrete example of frequentist clustering outperforming Bayesian clustering (using the best Bayesian algorithm for the problem, using the testing criteria below). There are many types of clustering techniques, such as K-means and DBSCAN. There are many different ways of measuring how well clustering works, and I'm using one here. To make this problem specific, I'm looking for the following criteria: The results need to be realistic and generalized, not some rare case. The clustering needs to result in a model/specification that will be used to cluster unseen data (to make a prediction), that will run on the new (additional) data without user intervention. The underlying ideal number of clusters is between 4 and 9. (To limit the scope to the problems I'm interested in - not binary, and not many clusters.) It doesn't matter what is being clustered (text, images, numbers, etc.) The Bayesian and frequentist clustering models will be compared with categorical cross entropy:
