Should I use DateTime.Now or DateTime.UtcNow in HttpCookie.Expires and HttpCachePolicy.SetExpires?

Should I use DateTime.Now or DateTime.UtcNow in HttpCookie.Expires and HttpCachePolicy.SetExpires ? Cookies are sending 'GMT' time, but I don't know what happen if I send DateTime.Now.AddDays(3) if I would be in GMT+5. Same with Expires HTTP header (sec 14.21) . What should I use?
