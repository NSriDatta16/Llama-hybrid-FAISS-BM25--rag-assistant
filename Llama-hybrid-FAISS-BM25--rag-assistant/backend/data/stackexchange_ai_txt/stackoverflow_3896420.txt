I second Affe's suggestion, the Criteria API is exactly what you're looking for and is recommended when dealing with dynamic queries. This is very nicely illustrated in Hibernate Querying 102 : Criteria API that I'm quoting below: Using the Hibernate Criteria API The Hibernate Criteria API provides an elegant way of building on-the-fly dynamic queries on Hibernate-persisted databases. Using this technique, the previous 24-line example can be coded more consicely and more clearly using a mere 8 lines of code : Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Sale.class); if (startDate != null) { criteria.add(Expression.ge("date",startDate); } if (endDate != null) { criteria.add(Expression.le("date",endDate); } List results = criteria.list(); Let's have a look at the use of the Hibernate Criteria API in more detail. The code shown in the article speaks for itself, just have a look.
