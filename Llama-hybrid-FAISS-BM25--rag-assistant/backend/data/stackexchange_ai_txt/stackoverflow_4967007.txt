First of all it's probably better to keep this logic within the form class instead of doing it in the action. Secondly when embedding a form it copies the validatorschema to the parent form, that's why changing the option on the embedded form itself has no effect. Another way of accomplishing what you are trying to do could be this: class myForm extends BaseForm { public function configure() { // set up widgets, validators etc } protected function doBind($values) { is (!empty($values['charity']['charityCheckbox']) { $this->validatorSchema['charity']['name']->setOption('required', true); } parent::doBind($values); } }
