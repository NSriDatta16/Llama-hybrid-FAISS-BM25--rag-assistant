Significance of differences in answers to vague questions

Participants in an experiment were divided in “Truth-judgers” and “Falsity-judgers”. The former were asked “When is it true to say that a man is tall [cm]?” while the latter were asked: “When is it false to say that a man is tall [cm]?” How could the hypothesis that average estimates of “Truth-judgers” are significantly larger than those of “Falsity-judgers” be analyzed with the obtained data?
