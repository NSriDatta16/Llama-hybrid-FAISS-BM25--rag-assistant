What is the difference between monte carlo integration and gibbs sampling?

I am aware that both are methods of sampling from the posterior. MC integration replaces the integral by a sample MC sample. Is this sample independent? Gibbs sampling is a class of MCMC techniques. It provides a dependent sample and during the iteration that produces the sample each variable is updated in turn. The result is a dependent vector of parameters that with markov property. Summary measure calculated from the chain consistently estimate the true posterior measures. However I cannot see a real difference/link between these two?
