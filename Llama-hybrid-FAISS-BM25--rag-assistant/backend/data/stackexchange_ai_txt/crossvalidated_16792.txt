If you are trying to make one-off decisions about reality and want to control the rate at which you falsely reject the null hypothesis, then you will be using null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) and will want to use correction for multiple comparisons. However, as Peter Flom notes in his answer, it's unclear how to define the set of comparisons over which to apply the correction. The easiest choice is the set of comparisons applied to a given data set, and this is the most common approach. However, science is arguably best conceived as cumulative system where one-off decisions are not necessary and in fact serve only to reduce the efficiency of evidence accumulation (reducing obtained evidence to a single bit of information). Thus, if one follows a properly scientific approach to statistical analysis, eschewing NHST for tools like likelihood ratios (possibly Bayesian approaches too), then the "problem" of multiple comparisons disappears.
