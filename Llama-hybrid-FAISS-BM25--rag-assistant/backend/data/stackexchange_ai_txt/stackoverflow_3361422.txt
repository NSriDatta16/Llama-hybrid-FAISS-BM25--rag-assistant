iPad issue : Selecting a video from the videos folder using UIImagePicker

I created an app that allows the user to select a video from the photo Library e.g self.imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary; However, on the iPad you have a videos directory which if you drag a video in to iTunes, the video gets put in this directory. How can I access this directory from a UIImagePicker or cant I? Do I need to use a different type of picker?
