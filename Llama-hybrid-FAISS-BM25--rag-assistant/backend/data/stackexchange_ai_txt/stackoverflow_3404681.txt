How to launch the application after the setup finishes, but in non-elevated mode?

When I launch my appliation after the setup completes, it launches the application in elevated mode. One of the problems, that this creates is that the user can no longer drag drop files into the application. Running the application from Start Menu works fine. Is this even possible?
