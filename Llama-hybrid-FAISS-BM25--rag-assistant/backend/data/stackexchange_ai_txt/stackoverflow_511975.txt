The next-generation Java plugin found in Java 1.6 Update 10 and later has some very neat features: Pass java_arguments parameter to pass arguments to the JVM that is created. This allows you to control the amount of memory given to the applet. Create separate class loaders or even separate JVM's for each applet. Specify the JVM version to use. Install partial Java kernels in cases where you only need a subset of the full Java libraries' functionality. Better Vista support. Support (experimental) to drag an applet out of the browser and have it keep running when you navigate away. Many other things that are documented here: http://jdk6.dev.java.net/plugin2/ More from this release here: http://jdk6.dev.java.net/6u10ea.html
