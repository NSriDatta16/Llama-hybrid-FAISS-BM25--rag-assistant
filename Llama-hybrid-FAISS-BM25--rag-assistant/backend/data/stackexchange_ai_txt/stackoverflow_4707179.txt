It depends on your design and the notion of a more simpler solution, and how you want to organize your code and keep it simpler, smaller and make it maintainable at the same time. Ask yourself why you would call checkCredentials and then call login and then maybe some other method. Do you have a good reason for doing so, is this a good design, what do I want to achieve with this. Calling just login , and performing every login operation is much more simple and elegant. Giving it another name while doing so is much more understandable and also more maintainable. If you ask me, I would use a constructor.
