Offline Amazon S3

So I would like to try using Heroku to be my server, however heroku does not allow writing to its file system. Instead I need to use the database and something like Amazon S3 for storage of things like uploaded images. The problem is that I often don't have internet access when developing. Or very poor internet access. So developing for Amazon S3 is kind of impractical. Is there an offline version to use so that my local machine can act as the S3 cloud, and when in testing/production environments I can use the real S3?
