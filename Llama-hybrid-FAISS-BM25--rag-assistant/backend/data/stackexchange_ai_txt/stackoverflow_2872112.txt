"Knowing XML" can mean a couple of different things. The first is understanding the basic syntax. It is a prerequisite for writing XHTML, SVG, Atom, RSS, and a host of other languages which are XML applications. The second builds upon the first and is an understand of how to develop your own XML applications, i.e. custom data storage or exchange formats. JSON can fulfill a similar role and has some advantages (such as being able to implicitly represent an array of data: { bar: ['foo'] } . In XML a parser would have to know to convert the contents of into an array for the programming language if you want to treat it as a simple data structure) ) and disadvantages (XML lets you have optional things in any order with less effort).
