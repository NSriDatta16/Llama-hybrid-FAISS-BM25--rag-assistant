Marco, I thought about this a bit, and I have a few guesses for you to try. Before you do either of these, restart your app. Sometimes that does miracles. heroku restart Ok, now, try in console just @customer.responses What does that return? I assume it should be [] . Maybe doing some inspection etc. of that can give us insights here. If you build and associate a response manually can you get it to show up? Second, your no method error is on responses , not on create , so whatever you type after that probably doesn't matter, BUT, are your offer_id and digit fields integers? If so, try creating them using integers, not strings. PostgreSQL is so fragile compared to MySQL or SQLite, I've had loads of issues that trace back to my unfamiliarity working with Postgre prior to developing on Heroku. @customer.responses.create(:offer_id=>1,:digit=>3) That probably doesn't matter but it's worth checking out. The other thing to check is all your callbacks and validations etc. Is anything failing? It may not seem related but I've had issues before where things acted very weird because of seemingly tiny silent failures in a callback that I had overlooked. I'm sure you're testing as you go, but if you've got shallow test coverage anywhere on this model you might as well use this bug hunt as a chance to beef it up :) Sympathies on the error, I don't know if any of this will help, but good luck! Please post if Heroku staff find the issue, I'd be very interested to learn from it!
