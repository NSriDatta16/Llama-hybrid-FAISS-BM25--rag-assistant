Sending asynchronous request on clicking a sharepoint web part button control

I am new to this whole sharepoint and aspx programming. I have developed a sharepoint web part that has a button control. The onclick event is mapped to a method in my web part code. When I click the button the whole page reloads and the web part is rendered again. Is there a way to prevent this reloading of the page? Is there a way to call the function method in the background? Something similar to AJAX. Thanks, Jagannath
