How to organize a MST when one node disappear?

I'm doing my research and stuck with a question: I am having a minimum spanning tree (prim algorithm), now one node in my tree gets deleted, I wonder if there is a way i can re-organize my tree such that the optimality still maintains? I'm looking for some suggestions here and I will appreciate your help. Thank you!
