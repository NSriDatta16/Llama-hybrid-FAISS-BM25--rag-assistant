Disable page cache on a specific page

Not sure if I really am on the right forum, but if not, just tell me. I have a page that is coded in ASP (not .net) which is used to send email. We are currently having a problem in which the page seem to be sent twice sometime. Upon checking, we found out that those who have this problem are coming from big organisation, so it was suggested that their server might cache the file for some reason. I would like to know, is there a way in HTML (or ASP ) to prevent that from happening ? Or is it in IIS that we must set this up ? EDIT : I forgot to mention is that sometime, the time between the two mails can be in hours, not mere seconds Thanks,
