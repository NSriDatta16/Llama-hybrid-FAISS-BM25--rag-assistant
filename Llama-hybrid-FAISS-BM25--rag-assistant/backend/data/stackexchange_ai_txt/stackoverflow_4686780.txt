If it's just arithmetic, you can leverage javascript within C# to "eval" the string . If you want to build a proper parser, you'll need to create a grammar, generate a parser from that grammar, and then build an interpreter to process the output of the parser. The GOLD Parsing System is very helpful for that task and has .NET engines, including C# . Other options include the ANTLR Parser Generator and LEX and YACC . If you really want to roll your own, there are a lot of resources out there. The GOLD Parsing System pages actually have a lot of information about it already: Left-to-Right Derivation Parsing Deterministic Finite Automata Etc.
