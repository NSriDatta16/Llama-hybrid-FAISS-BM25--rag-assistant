A random forest is a set of decision trees. There's no prediction "formula" to speak of in the sense of an ordinary regression; a random forest prediction is the output of a bunch of trees. Elements of Statistical Learning provides more information about how random forests work. I'm not sure what random forest implementation you're using. If it's randomForest , then you can extract particular trees from the random forest object rf.obj using getTree . So getTree(rf.obj, k=1) will give you the first tree, k=2 will give you the second, and so on. The help page for getTree explains the output. In a classification problem, the predict function gives each tree a vote, and plurality rules. This is, effectively, an average over many decision trees. A tie is broken at random.
