Firstly, as the documentation says, using values gives you a list of dictionaries , not model objects. So each s doesn't have an attribute sm_whatever , it has a dictionary key. So try this: s['sm__lname'] However, I must say that I don't see the need to use values here at all. You would be better off just getting the actual objects: sm = Disposal.objects.annotate(average_discount=Avg('discount')).order_by('-discount') and then accessing the relevant related objects normally: s.fname .
