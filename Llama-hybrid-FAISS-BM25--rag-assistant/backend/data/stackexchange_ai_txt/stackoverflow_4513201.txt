If your objects are independent of each others, you could pickle and unpickle them individually using their key as filename, in some perverse way a directory is a kind of dictionary mapping filenames to files. This way it is simple to load only relevant entries. Basically you use a memory dictionary as cache and if the searched key is missing try to load the file from the filesystem. I'm not really saying you should do that. A database (ZODB, SQLite, other) is probably better for persistant storage.
