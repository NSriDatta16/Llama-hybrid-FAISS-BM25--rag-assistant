How to interpret regression in a time series context?

I am a newbie in stats and I have a hard time grasping regression in the context of time series, while reading "Time series analysis and its applications" by Robert H. Shumway; I came across: When I think of regression I think of something like: $$housePrice=\beta_0 + \beta_1*houseSize$$ And in the example provided from the book it is as if the author is doing: $$housePrice=\beta_0 + \beta_1*house1Size+\beta_2*house2Size...+\beta_n*houseNsize$$ It doesn't make sense to me. I know my logic is faulty, I do not know how to interpret the formula. My question is: why in the formula there are several variables( $z_{t1}, z_{t2}...z_{tq}$ ), if in time series we only have one variable.
