If you want the simplest way to make this work, you probably want to keep the service tier (i.e. Java/Hibernate/mySQL) since switching to AIR means you will have to rewrite that logic in flex again. I would suggest running Jetty directly on the client machine (assuming that they have Java) and using HSQLDB as the backing datastore (which supports just having a database in-memory). Serve the flash file from Jetty as well and point the client's browser at a local URL. Better yet, have a simple java app that includes an embedded browser so the jetty instance would be killed when the user closes the app. Apart from configuring everything on the java-end, the amount of code to rewrite should be minimal.
