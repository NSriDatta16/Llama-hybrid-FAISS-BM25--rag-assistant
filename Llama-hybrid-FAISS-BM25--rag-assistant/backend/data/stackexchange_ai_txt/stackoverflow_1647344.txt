Obviously, VARCHAR is not the best datatype for the storage of numerical amounts. If you must use it, you need to CAST the price column to an appropriate numeric type in the SELECT and ORDER BY parts of your statement, or create a view containing the CAST and SELECT from the view. The datatype to CAST to, and the syntax for CASTing are product-dependent.
