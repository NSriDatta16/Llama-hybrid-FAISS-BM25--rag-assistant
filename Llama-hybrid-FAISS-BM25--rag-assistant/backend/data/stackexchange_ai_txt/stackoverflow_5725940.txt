Isolated storage is not used in asp.net applications for storing profile info - this is generally used in .net apps running on the client side. To get profiles up and running, see any of the many posting on it.. a good one by Dino Esposito http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163724.aspx and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2y3fs9xs.aspx The configuration is there by default but in visual studio you will want to bring up the admin site for your web app to make sure everything is setup. Using web applications or web sites also gives you different access to profile properties. One will strongly type them, one will not.
