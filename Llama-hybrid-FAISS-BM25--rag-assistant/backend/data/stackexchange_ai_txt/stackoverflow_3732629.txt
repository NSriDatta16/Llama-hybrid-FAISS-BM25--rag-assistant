If the rounded corners are images, this is better treated as a photoshop problem. Save for web/png-24/transparency dither. If I understand your problem correctly it's not just an issue of light and dark but of hue too. Those corners are dithered to a background that doesn't match these alternate ones. By that I mean the rounded edges are slowly faded from the border to the background color so the jagged pixel edges don't appear to be as jarring. An arbitrary light/dark solution where you average the three and compare would only work well with fairly extreme lights and darks I would imagine but with a png transparency dither they'll soft-blend into any background automatically. There are workarounds for IE 6 if you have to support it.
