I had originally intended to post my solution a week ago, on the main stackoverflow.com site, back when this question was first posed over there, however the version which appeared in that forum was placed on hold while I was actually in the midst of entering my solution. Despite my emphatic protests to the moderators, the "on hold" status was allowed to simply languish for a week without any further attention, only to be closed ultimately without comment or explanation. So unfortunately, I suspect that my answer has probably become somewhat stale news by this point, but I'll still post it anyhow, just in case it may still be of some small use to somebody. To fit two Gaussians, you may use the nls() function, as in the following example: library(ggplot2) # Create partial data frame Tiempo Please beware that nls() can be somewhat fussy about having good starting parameter values. If they aren't at least reasonably close to the correct search neighborhood, you can end up with convergence failures. In particular, the default Gauss-Newton fit algorithm can be especially fussy about good starting values, and may even return a "singular gradient" error (which appears to be distinct, as an error condition, from convergence failure). I chose algorithm="port" in order to mitigate this problem somewhat. Output is shown below. Also, final tip: if you want to see the optimal final parameter estimates selected by nls() , just type summary(fit) (substituting, if necessary, whatever alternative object variable name you may have chosen in place of fit , to hold the fit information).
