Visual Studio 2010/WinForm/Snap-To Lines/Control Visibility

Every so often, I lose the pink and blue snap-to lines when editing a WinForm in VS2010. I have tried rebooting my workstation, closing unnecessary open applications, checking and unchecking the various options in Environment>General>Visual experience, but this still happens. It makes editing WinForms very difficult when you can't see the control you are dragging around and where you are dragging it to. I checked with The Googles and didn't locate a definitive answer. Anyone else have a solution for this?
