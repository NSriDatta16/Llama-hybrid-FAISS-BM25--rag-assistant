MongoMapper Parent Inheritance

I am trying to get a better and organized result from using class inheritance with MongoMapper, but having some trouble. class Item include MongoMapper::Document key :name, String end class Picture When I run the following commands, they don't quite return what I am expecting. >> Item.all => [# ] >> Video.all => [# ] >> Picture.all => [# ] They are all the same result, I would expect to have Item.all list all of the results, so including itself, Picture , and Video . But if the item is actually a Picture , I would like it to be returned if I ran Picture.all and not if I run Video.all . Do you see what I mean? Am I misunderstanding how the inheritance works here? If I am what is the best way to replicate this sort of behavior? I am trying to follow this (point 2) as a guideline of how I want this work. I assume he can run Link.all to find all the links, and not include every other class that inherits from Item . Am I wrong?
