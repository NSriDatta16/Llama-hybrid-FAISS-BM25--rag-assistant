If you need to allow users to enter some HTML but not any HTML, I recommend investigating the Microsoft Web Protection Library , which includes methods for making user-entered HTML fragments "safe". I agree with Matt Greer in saying that trying to create your own solution for recognizing illegal tags is a bad idea. There are so many attack vectors to inject script into HTML that you won't be able to guard against all of them. (See this XSS Cheat Sheet for a sampling, but it's out of date so there are probably more.)
