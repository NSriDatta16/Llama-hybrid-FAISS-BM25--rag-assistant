When the app transitions from the launch image to the actual app content, it should not be jarring to a user - content (text/images) can be added to the screen, but content should never change. If all this leaves you with is an empty blue header, a white body, and a blue footer - then that's all you should have. If you have a persistent tab bar on the bottom & a localized app (different text descriptions), then then launch image should appear with icons but no text. (See Clock.app & Facebook.app for examples.) Screenshots can also be taken in XCode using the Screenshot tab in the Organizer window and a plugged-in device.
