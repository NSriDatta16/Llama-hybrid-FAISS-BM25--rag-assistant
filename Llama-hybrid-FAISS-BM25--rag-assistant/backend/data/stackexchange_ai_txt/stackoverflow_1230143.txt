Blend 3 - Keyboard Shortcut to switch between design and xaml views?

As I'm not more of a developer than a designer I like to hand code my xaml rather than using draggy-droppy stuff. Since silverlight 3 - the design preview in VS2008 has disappeared. It wasn't that great but at least I got a visual representation of my markup without having to run the application. So I installed Blend 3 and I'd still like to hand code my xaml. Does anyone know a keyboard shortcut to switch between design view and xaml view - I've tried editing the xaml in VS then tabbing over to blend but theres a small delay that can be annoying when I just want a quick preview. Thanks.
