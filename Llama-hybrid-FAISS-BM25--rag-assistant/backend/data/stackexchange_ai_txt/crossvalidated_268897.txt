I believe you have two nominal categorical variables. So you shouldn't treat them like ordinal and take the averages. Can you do a chi-square test of independence? EDIT: Do you know how to reject a null hypothesis? You may want to get yourself a statistics text book. If you don't care, look at the p-value. It's very small so you can conclude your samples are significantly different on the two variables you give.
