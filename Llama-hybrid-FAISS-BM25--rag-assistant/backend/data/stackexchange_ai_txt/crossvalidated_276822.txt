Can I ask why you are using the analysis strategy rather than another method, for example, why not use a spline model (or piece-wise, or split, or whatever your field calls a continuous time series with more than one slope)? Coding a continuous time variable along with your fixed levels (period one, period 2) seems like it would provide a little more clarity. You have time period 1 (before treatment) and time period 2 (after treatment), you want to compare the slope and rate of change between the two so why not do the following model- model = y ~ X + T1 + T2 + I(T1)^2 + I(T2)^2 + (X : T1) + (X : T2) + ( X:(I(T1)^2)) + (X:(I(T2)^2) + (N [whatever random slope]|group), data=data) The T1 and T2 terms will give you your slope, and the I(T1)^2 term will give you the rate of change. Also, for reference, this coding using the lme4 package.
