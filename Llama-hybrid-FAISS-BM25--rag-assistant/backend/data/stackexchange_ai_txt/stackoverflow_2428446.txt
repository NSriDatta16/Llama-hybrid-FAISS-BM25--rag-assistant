It seems to me what you're asking is different from what your query is doing. If I understood you right, this query should do what you need: SELECT bulding_name, tag FROM buldings b LEFT JOIN (SELECT tag, building_id FROM tags INNER JOIN buildings_tags ON tags.id = buildings_tags.tag_id WHERE building_id = b.id LIMIT 5) t ON b.id = t.building_id ORDER BY bulding_name This would get you all the buildings, with at most 5 tags for each. There might well be a more elegant way to do it though.
