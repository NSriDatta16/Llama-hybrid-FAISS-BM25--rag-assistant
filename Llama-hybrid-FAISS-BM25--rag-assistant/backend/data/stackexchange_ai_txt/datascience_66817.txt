Calculate confidence score of a neural network prediction

I am using a deep neural network model to make predictions. My problem is a classification(binary) problem. I wish to calculate the confidence score of each prediction. As of now, I use predict_proba of sklearn to get probability of a class and consider it as the model confidence for that prediction. Is it the right approach? What could be a better way to calculate the confidence score? Kindly add relevant literature to support your approach.
