Time Series forecasting with useful predictor variables

I am playing with time series data related to a issue ticketing system. The system logs all open tickets at any one point and my task is to predict what the volume of open tickets will be in 5,10,15 days in the future. I was thinking of avoiding the stereotypical ARIMA style models for a machine learning approach with a lot of feature engineering as the data has a lot of powerful associated information. My plan was to build a testing data set of my predictor variables (#open tickets, 10 day avg close rate, 10 day avg open rate, profile of the open tickets, profile of there close rate etc.) and use them to predict #open tickets 5 days into the future with traditional algorithms(NN,RF etc). Just wondering is the approach a good one and general pros and cons.
