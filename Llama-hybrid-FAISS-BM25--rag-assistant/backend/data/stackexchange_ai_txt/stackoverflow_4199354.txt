You'll need to construct the HTTP request manually and pass that to LWP. Something like the following should do it: my $uri = 'https://orbit.theplanet.com/Login.aspx?url=/Default.aspx'; my $json = '{"username":"foo","password":"bar"}'; my $req = HTTP::Request->new( 'POST', $uri ); $req->header( 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' ); $req->content( $json ); Then you can execute the request with LWP: my $lwp = LWP::UserAgent->new; $lwp->request( $req );
