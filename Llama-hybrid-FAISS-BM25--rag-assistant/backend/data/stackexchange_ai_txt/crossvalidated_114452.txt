Logistic regression is not necessarily the best approach to predict propensity scores, but it seems to be the most commonly used. There are a number of alternatives including probit regression, classification and regression trees ( Westreich, Lessler and Funk 2011 , or generalized boosted models ( Ridgeway, McCaffrey and Morral 2004 ). Each method has advantages and disadvantages. For example, Ridgeway and McCaffrey (2007) suggest that logistic regression results in more extreme weights in inverse propensity score weighting compared to some other alternatives.
