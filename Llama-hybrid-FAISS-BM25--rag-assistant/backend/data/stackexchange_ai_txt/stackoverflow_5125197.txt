It's highly doubtful that you can create something as robust and easy to maintain as Drupal in less time than it takes to learn and setup a Drupal install. But it really depends on your needs and objectives. Is your goal to learn how to program and gain experience developing web applications? Is your goal to develop a better CMS than what is available? If the answer to either of these questions is "yes", then you should build your own CMS regardless of which takes more time. But if your goal is to create a website (for yourself or for a client), the CMS simply being a means to an end, then in 99% of the cases, it's best to just deploy a CMS or CMS framework. Something you can build in 2-3 months time is never going to compare to something as mature and with as much community support as Drupal. You might be able to code up all of the basic functionality of a CMS, but what about extensibility? or scalability? or maintainability? or user-friendliness? or SEO? or the hundreds of minor features that you never notice when you use a mature CMS, but which add immeasurable convenience and useful functionality that reduce the TCO of a website? That said, Drupal may not be the best CMS out there for your organization. But just because one CMS doesn't fit your needs doesn't mean that CMSes are overrated. Unless you're running a static site (which unless you're operating a 1-page website, is inexcusable in this day and age), you'll need a CMS of some sort. And if you honestly think you can build a better CMS than Drupal, then you should do it. The internet community will thank you for it. But more than likely you're just not used to working with a CMS framework. Most sites have nearly identical requirements, so if you're trying to set up a pretty standard basic CRUD site, then you might consider trying a more end-user oriented CMS rather than Drupal. Drupal's complexity comes from its ability to be used as a platform for much more complex applications. That has a cost in terms of ease of configuration and learning curve. You haven't given us much details about the site you're trying to build or your requirements, but Wordpress can be customized for use as a CMS for many sites. Or you might try something like Traffik, which is more aimed at designers and business owners.
