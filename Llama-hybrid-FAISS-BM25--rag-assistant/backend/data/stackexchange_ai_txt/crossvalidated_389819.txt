Interpretation of the Impulse Response Function - VAR Estimation

I have some issues while discussing and interpreting this impulse response function (the graphics analysis). What do they mean and represent economically? What can the conclusions be? Basically initially I had the time series of government spending (first column), GDP growth rate (second column) and inflation rate (third one). Can you please help me understanding it?
