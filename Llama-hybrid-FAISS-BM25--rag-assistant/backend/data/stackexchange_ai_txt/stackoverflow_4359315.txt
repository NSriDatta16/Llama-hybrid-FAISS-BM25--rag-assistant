Fastest way to check list of crawler IPs via contains in Java

I got list of crawlers from following website: http://www.karavadra.net/blog/2010/list-of-crawlers-bots-and-their-ip-addresses/#respond If you know better list of IPs that is regularly update please let me know. Now I created object: private static final HashSet list = new HashSet (){{ add("66.249.71.248"); add("66.249.66.38"); add("66.249.65.142"); // 331 more entires }}; And I'm checking the list via this method: public static boolean isCrawler(String ip){ return list.contains(ip); } Please advise on how to improve this to be faster and more elegant solution. I use spring so beans are an option as well. I would like to integrate update service on the list but I didn't find downloadable IP list that would be useful and parsing websites via Jsoup is never ideal solution.
