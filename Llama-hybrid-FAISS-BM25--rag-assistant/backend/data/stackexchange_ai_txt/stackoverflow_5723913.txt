We faced the same JMX ObjectName collision problem with CXF and EhCache. The solution we found is to append the context-path of the web app to each ObjectName registered in the MBeanServer. This is directly inspired by the federated MBeansServers of big clusterisable JavaEE server (Websphere, etc). Thanks to this, the cxf bus ObjectName is : "org.apache.cxf:type=Bus,host=localhost,path=/my-application,bus.id=my-application-cxf-bus" We packaged this " servlet context aware mbean server " in a library with a spring namespace to ease configuration: ... This is packaged with many other JMX extras to ease monitoring of common components (dbcp, util.concurrent, cxf, jms, etc) and proposed under a business friendly Apache Software License at http://code.google.com/p/xebia-france/wiki/XebiaManagementExtras . Hope this helps, Cyrille (Xebia)
