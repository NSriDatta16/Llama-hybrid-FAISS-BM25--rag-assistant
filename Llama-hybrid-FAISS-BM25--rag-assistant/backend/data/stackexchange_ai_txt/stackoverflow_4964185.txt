extjs Image in listView with tooltip and conditional colors

I am developing a listView with very limited space in width, so I come with idea that some information (like agent who create that record) can be replaced with an icon (of human) and th full information (first and last name) displayed when mouseOver (like a tooltip). how to place an image on listView row (I think about 2 kinds: red shirt and blue skirt icon) how to implement tooltip on it ? EDIT: Also I am looking for way to conditionally change backgroud color of the cell: if hidden column "reason" = 1, column "AAA" will have red backgroud color, if = 2 column "BBB" and .... Help will be welcome
