There's a really good explanation of the limitations of the mouseover and mouseout events in the jQuery docs (about half way down that page). Mouseover and mouseout events trigger when you move the mouse over the bound element, as expected, but they also fire a separate event when you mouse over any inner elements within the parent element - this is obviously undesirable in most circumstances. Basically, to fix your problem, use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead. From a user experience point of view, I'd encourage you to bind both events to the link, so that the special background colour actually indicates that the link is active - I think I'd find the effect you are trying to achieve quite misleading, because the highlighted background would make me think that I can still click the link, even though I cannot.. If you want to keep the visual effect you've current got (with a tall coloured area behind each link), make the link take up the whole box - i.e. 100% of the height and width of the div.
