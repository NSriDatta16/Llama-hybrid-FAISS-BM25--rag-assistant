The terminology differs between fields, unfortunately. So I suggest that you stick to the convention within your field, and define what you mean by the term in your methods. Incidentally, there is one more option for 'dependent/response variable', and that is target variable . I find predictor and target (which may be standard in machine learning) to be simple and clear while avoiding any implications of causal relationships.
