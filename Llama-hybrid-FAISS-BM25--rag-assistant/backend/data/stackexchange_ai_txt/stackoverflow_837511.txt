Assuming that you're working with dynamic content, the best I could suggest is to accept graceful degradation and use a mix of great_llama and Bohdan Ganicky Imagine: A long title that will wrap to two lines___________________ and leave you like this in great_llama's solution and nothing appearing at all with Bohdan Ganicky's solution if ul isn't immediate preceded by ul. Solution: .c h3 { display: inline; background-color: white; margin: 0; padding: 0; line-height: 1em; } .c + * { margin-top: -1px; border-top: 1px solid; padding-top: 1em; /* simulate margin with padding */ } We care about IE6, but accept that this is an aesthetic touch and IE6 users will not suffer. If you can't get the designer to accept this AND you can't alter the HTML, then do something else (before you find another job ;) )
