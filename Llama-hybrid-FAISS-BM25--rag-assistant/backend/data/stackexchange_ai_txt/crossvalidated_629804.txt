For a stochastic system, should we optimize its time average cost or total cost? What is the difference between the two goals?

For a stochastic system, the time average cost like: $ \lim_{T \to \infty}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\mathbb{E}\{cost(t)\}$ and total cost like: $ \lim_{T \to \infty}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\mathbb{E}\{cost(t)\}$ . If our goal is cost minimization, which optimization objective should be used?
