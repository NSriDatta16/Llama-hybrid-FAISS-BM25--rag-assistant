The framework versions on disk do not match the versions on the device. Delete the folder: /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/ 4.2.1 / The SDK version (bolded above) can be any installed version. Choose the version(s) of your test device(s). Plug in your device and start Xcode. Open the Organizer (Window > Organizer) and you will be prompted to restore these frameworks. Once this is complete, restart Xcode and Clean All Targets before building the app for the device. See: UUID mismatch detected with the loaded library
