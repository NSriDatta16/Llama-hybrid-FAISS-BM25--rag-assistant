Multinomial logistic regression analysis or binary logistic regression

I need to analyse data and am unsure whether or not I should use a multinomial logistic regression analysis or a binary logistic regression analysis. I have just conducted a latent class analysis and am interested in seeing if my variables can predict class membership. There are only two classes and so my response variable only has two categories; however the variables range from having 2 to 3 to 4 and are mostly nominal categorical data.
