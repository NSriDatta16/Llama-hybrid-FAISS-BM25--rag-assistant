For human readable text files, it's almost a standard for a line to be 80 characters long, and not more than that. If you want to obey this rule, auto-fill-mode will certainly help you. Yes, there are editors that will do automatic word wrapping for you, but if your intentions are to write 5 lines paragraphs in more than one line, then auto-fill-mode will certainly help you. When writing anything that is not computer bound (configuration files, source code, etc...), I always turn on auto-fill-mode. It's there for a reason. Use it when appropriate.
