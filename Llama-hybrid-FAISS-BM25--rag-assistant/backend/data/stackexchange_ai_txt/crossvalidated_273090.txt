There are a number of methods for estimating the $\tau^2$ parameter in meta-analysis. Perhaps because DerSimonian and Laird were first on the scene their method is sometimes erroneously identified with random effects meta-analysis. For a review of some of the methods for estimating $\tau^2$ one might refer to this article by Wolfgang Viechtbauer entitled "Bias and Efficiency of Meta-Analytic Variance Estimators in the Random-Effects Model" which compares five methods with extensive discussion. There is also a recent article with more simulations here . The short conclusion is that no method is demonstrably superior but the restricted maximum likelihood estimator and Paule and Mandel method have good overall properties. As far as what statistics can be extracted from the primary studies and used then note that all that is needed is an estimate $y_i$ with its standard error $s_i$ and optionally the value of $\tau^2$ mentioned above.
