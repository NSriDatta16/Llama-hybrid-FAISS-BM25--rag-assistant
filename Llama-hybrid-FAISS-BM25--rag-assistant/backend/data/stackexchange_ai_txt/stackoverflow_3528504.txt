Use host and cpu number as a double key, and the a group by to get the average. Here's an example with sqlite3. First create the table: CREATE TABLE cpu (host string, cpu integer, load integer, primary key (host, cpu)); Then insert some testdata (this would be done by your perl script): INSERT INTO cpu (host, cpu, load) VALUES ("appserv", 1, 25); INSERT INTO cpu (host, cpu, load) VALUES ("appserv", 2, 15); INSERT INTO cpu (host, cpu, load) VALUES ("dbserv", 1, 10); INSERT INTO cpu (host, cpu, load) VALUES ("dbserv", 2, 30); INSERT INTO cpu (host, cpu, load) VALUES ("dbserv", 3, 5); INSERT INTO cpu (host, cpu, load) VALUES ("dbserv", 4, 5); Now you can get the average load for each host, which could be retrieved and plotted using PHP: SELECT host, avg(load) FROM cpu GROUP BY host; appserv|20.0 dbserv|12.5 The total average across all hosts: SELECT avg(load) FROM cpu; 15.0 Or find any hosts with at high load: SELECT host FROM cpu WHERE load > 25; dbserv You would probably want to make a to make a table of all your computers and link it to the cpu table above, exchanging the host string with a computer_id. All this assumes you're using a relational database (i.e. SQLite, MySQL, Oracle, etc.).
