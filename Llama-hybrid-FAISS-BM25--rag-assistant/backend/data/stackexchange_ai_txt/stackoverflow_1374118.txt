I disagree with all of the answers saying "write comments". That's being offered as a catch-all for the code itself not being understandable. Get yourself a copy of Code Complete (Steve McConnell, 2nd edition). If you learn the techniques of writing maintainable code in the first place, it won't take you more time, and you will be able to return to your work later with less trouble. Which would you prefer: Cryptic code with comments? Mostly OK code without? I strongly prefer the latter, as the OK code is easier to understand in the situations where the cryptic code was uncommented, and comments are another place that the original developer can make mistakes. The code may be buggy , but it's never wrong . Once you're comfortable with Code Complete , I'd recommend The Pragmatic Programmer , as it gives slightly higher-level software-development advice.
