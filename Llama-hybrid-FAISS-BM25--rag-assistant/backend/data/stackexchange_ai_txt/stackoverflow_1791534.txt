Try replacing pTags[i].onClick = myFunction(pTags[i]); with pTags[i].onClick = function() { myFunction(pTags[i]); } You see, when you assign to the onClick of an object, you're copying the result of the expression to it. What your supposed to copy is a function to call when the p is clicked. Instead, you're running the command myFunction(pTags[i]) , which executes the alert() s, and takes the result of the function. Now, since the function doesn't return anything, the value of the expression myFunction(pTags[i]) is undefined. And you take that value, and assign it to onClick . So basically what you've done is: For each "special" paragraph: Execute alert Assign undefined to the paragraph's onClick .
