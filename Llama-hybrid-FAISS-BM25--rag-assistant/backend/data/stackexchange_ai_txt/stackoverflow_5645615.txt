SPARQL Queries on Sub atomic particle ontology

I am attempting to write SPARQL queries on the ontology periodic.owl available from http://robertdavidstevens.wordpress.com/category/ontologies/ Please provide some sample queries on it that can I use to further build more. For example a query to retrieve the properties of a particular element Queries that i build: select distinct ?b where { ?s a ?b. } Now if i want all the details about Antimony5Ion,then i did this: SELECT * FROM WHERE { ?a owl:onProperty ?b. }
