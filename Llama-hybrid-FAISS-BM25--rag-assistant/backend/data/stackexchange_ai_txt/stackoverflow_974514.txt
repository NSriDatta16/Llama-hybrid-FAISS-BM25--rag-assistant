IDE complains Config files referenced in ConfigSource attributes do not comply with DotNetConfig.xsd

I find configsource references in the .config-files to be very helpful. However, since these referenced config-files only contain fragments of the entire app.config hierarchy, the IDE complains. In the app.config file: (snip) in the Profiles.config: However, the IDE has associated Profiles.Config file with the DotNetConfig.xsd schema, which expects the "customProfiles" to be declared in the configSections element, which the Profiles.config file does not have. I am not particularily bothered by this as it basically only affects intellisense and generates misleading tooltips when you point at the blue undersquiggle, but I was surprised that google came up absolutely empty on this. And no, it is not because I included the word "undersquiggle" in my search ;)
