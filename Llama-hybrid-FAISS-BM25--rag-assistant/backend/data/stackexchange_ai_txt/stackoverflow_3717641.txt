Page_PreRender event can be used to specify changes to the html rendering for your controls. One important difference between Load and PreRender is that Load runs before your control events are fired and PreRender is called after the control events. So, if on the basis of your control events code you want to change the output html, you can do so in the PreRender event. Another important thing to note is that the Page object raises the PreRender event on the Page object, and then recursively does the same for each child control. The PreRender event of individual controls occurs after the PreRender event of the page. So, this gives you added leverage on how to modify the rendering of a particular control. This is not possible in Page_Load. It may also be used if you're using custom/user controls where the rendering of the control is done by you.
