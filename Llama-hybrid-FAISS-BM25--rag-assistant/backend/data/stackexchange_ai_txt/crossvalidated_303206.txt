This sounds like an attempt to compare two samples each of size one. If the two time series are not equal, then there is, with hindsight, and arbitrage strategy. The question is whether this strategy is discoverable in advance. To answer this you must have some idea of the universe from which strategies can be drawn, e.g. an arbitrageur could be guided by exchange rates, weather, phases of the moon... You can then find the best arbitrage strategy from the family you have defined. If the family is big, then there is risk of overfitting.
