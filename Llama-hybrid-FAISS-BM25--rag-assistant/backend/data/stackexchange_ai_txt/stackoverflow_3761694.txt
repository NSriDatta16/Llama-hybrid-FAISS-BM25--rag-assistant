Zend_Mail - how to get only html body from email?

I'm working with emails from google oauth. This is the format I'm using. $emailmessage = $storage->getMessage($i); $fromaddress = $storage->getMessage($i)->from; What format can I use to get only the html body of the email? I've been looking at this document http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Mail/Zend_Mail.html , but the formatting seems off. It only has getFrom, which leads me to believe it's an old version. EDIT: I'm using Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap
