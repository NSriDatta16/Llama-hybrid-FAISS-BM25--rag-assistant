Belief network is a synonym of the Bayesian network, while deep belief networks are a class of deep neural networks(actually hybrid graphical models with both directed edges and undirected edges but are equivalent to the deep neural networks). Deep neural networks are nothing more than complex functional compositions that can be represented by computation graphs, and the values in their hidden neurons cannot be interpreted as probabilities(often black box), but it can be seen as a process of learning to learn . Belief networks are acyclic directed graphs and the parameters can all be interpreted as probabilities, and they are best for provably correct inference.
