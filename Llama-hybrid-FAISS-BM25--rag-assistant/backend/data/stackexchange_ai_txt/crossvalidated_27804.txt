I didn't see anybody mention influence functions . I first saw this idea in Gnanadesikan's multivariate book . In one dimension an outlier is either an extremely large or an extremely small value. In multivariate analysis it is an observation removed from the bulk of the data. But what metric should we use to define extreme for the outlier? There are many choices. The Mahalanobis distance is just one. I think that looking for every type of outlier is futile and counterproductive. I would ask why do you care about the outlier ? In estimating a mean they can have a great deal of influence on that estimate. Robust estimators downweight and accommodate outliers but they do not formally test for them. Now in regression, the outliers--like leverage points--could have large effects on the slope parameters in the model. With bivariate data they can unduly influence the estimated correlation coefficient and in three or more dimensions the multiple correlation coefficient. Influence functions were introduced by Hampel as a tool in robust estimation and Mallows wrote a nice unpublished paper advocating their use. The influence function is a function of the point you are at in n-dimensional space and the parameter. It essentially measures the difference between the parameter estimate with the point in the calculation and with the point left out. Rather than go to the trouble of doing the calculation of the two estimates and taking the difference, often you can derive a formula for it. Then the contours of constant influence tell you the direction that is extreme with respect to the estimate of this parameter and hence tell you where in the n-dimensional space to look for the outlier. For more you can look at my 1983 paper in the American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences titled "The influence function and its application to data validation." In data validation we wanted to look for outliers that affected the intended use of the data. My feeling is that you should direct your attention to outliers that greatly affect the parameters you are interested in estimating and not care so much about others that don't.
