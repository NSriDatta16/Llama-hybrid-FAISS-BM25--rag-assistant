How about this vulnerability that was left unpatched for 17 years: http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/17-year-old-unpatched-windows-vulnerability-discovered-20100120/ There was also the "drag-and-drop" vulnerability that allowed for remote code execution in IE that was being exploited for many years before it was finely patched. There is also the " Passing The Hash " SMB vulnerability that Microsoft ignored from ~2000-2007. In both cases Microsoft denied that there was a vulnerability while hackers happy to pw3n the neglected windows boxen. All three of these are now patched.
