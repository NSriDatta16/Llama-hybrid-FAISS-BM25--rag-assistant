There are ways of understanding which of these is the right one to go with. Unforunately 10 views means no calculation is going to be great for you, but i'll try to explain both. T-tests and Z-tests are used by a lot of AB Testing tools, as described here , to calculate winners. You'll be able to input views and clicks, and receieve back stats that describe if Group B's treatment is to win. You get back a yes/no answer, based on tolerances provided. Bayesian calculations, on the other hand, rely on a percentage likelihood of being a winner, after which you can make a judgement. If possible, you should run this for longer and try to drive more views to Group B. If the interaction rate of 20% persists, you'll see an eventual winner there (100% lift over the 10% rate for Group A).
