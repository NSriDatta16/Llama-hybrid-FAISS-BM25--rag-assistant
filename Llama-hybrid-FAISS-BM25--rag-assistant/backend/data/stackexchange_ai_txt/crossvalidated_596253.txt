You can use these values as regressors (right-hand-side variables) without worrying about leaking the training data into the test set. Your target values (left hand side) will all be unseen, and this is what matters. However, by splitting your data only once you only get a single one-step-ahead forecast on the test set. All the other forecasts will either be multiple steps ahead or they will be based on other forecasts (by iterative substitution of the necessary but unavailable actual data with their forecasts) rather than actual data. Therefore, instead of splitting the data as you have intended you may want to use time series cross validation via rolling windows or expanding windows . See Hyndman & Athanasopoulos "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" section 3.4 .
