Bayesian logistic regression analysis

I am doing bayesian analysis in which my outcome variable is binary (perinatal mortality). I have a couple of explanatory variables such as gender, birth order, maternal education, residence, maternal weight, birth interval etc. I am new in bayesian analysis but I have invested a lot in learning it. now I am trying to reproduce one example which exactly looks similar to my model using rjags. Unfortunately I am getting this error "Error parsing model file: syntax error on line 20 near "" Can anyone help me where do I go wrong. These are my codes: logistic_model
