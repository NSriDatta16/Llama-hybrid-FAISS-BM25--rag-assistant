Foundations of F# example code does not compile, why?

I am reading the Foundations of F# by Robert pickering. When I try to run the first example in the book (below) I am getting a runtime error at function print, "Unable to parse format string 'Missing format specifier'" #mytestapp let message = "Hello World\r\n\t!" let dir = @"c:\projects" let bytes = "bytesbytesbytes"B let xA = 0xFFy let xB = 0o7777un let xC = 0b10010UL let print x = printfn "A%" x let main() = print message; print dir; print bytes; print xA; print xB; print xC main() The output should be (according to the book): "Hello\n World\r\n\t!" "c:\projects" [|98uy; 121uy; 116uy; 101uy; 115uy; 98uy; 121uy; 116uy; 101uy; 115uy; 98uy; 121uy; 116uy; 101uy; 115uy|] -1y 4095 18UL I think, that maybe I don't have something referenced that I should?
