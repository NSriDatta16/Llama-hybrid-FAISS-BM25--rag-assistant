Well, I can only speak about the Infragistics controls - they have a lot of bang for your buck and are well documented, very consistent and are well integrated with the standard ASP.NET programming model, etc. Begin rant: I personally think they are bloated and past their prime in today's world of lighter-weight JavaScript libraries and toolkits. Most developers are becoming more and more proficient in such toolkits, so the abstractions provided by Infragistics and other such and similar control vendors are not needed as much. But that is purely my opinion .
