what is the difference between Bayesian optimization and kriging?

Both methods use Gaussian process, and kriging uses the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) to predict the mean (this is not seen in Bayesian optimization?). At the bottom line, they also have covariance matrix, whose inverse has to be computed before moving out to the next sample point. As far as I understand, Bayesian optimization yields a posterior pdf with mean and variance kriging yields a predicted mean and MSE $\sigma^2$ Obviously they are different for some reasons. Why are they different?
