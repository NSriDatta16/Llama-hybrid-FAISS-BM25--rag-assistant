Examples for multi-input Convolutional Neural Network

I want to create a multi inputs Convolutional Neural Network (cnn) that takes two inputs and produces one output of the inputs class by using Keras . I searched for resources that explain multi inputs cnn, but only found brief explanations. I need examples for multi-inputs cnn for images classification .
