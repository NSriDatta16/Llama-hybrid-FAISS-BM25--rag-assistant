Binary Logistic Regression - How are my IVs affecting each other?

I am a relative stats noob trying to create a binary logistic regression model in spss to explore the relationship between internet access and feeling part of your community. I am also interested in including smart phone ownership as an IV to see if that has an effect. Just to be clear, in this data set not all smart phone owners have access to the internet (around 90% do) and not everyone with access to the internet owns a smartphone. The problem I have is that I am confused by the change in internet access sig and Exp(B) results when I take out smart phone ownership as an IV. DV - Do you feel part of the community? 0 = No 1 = Yes IV1 - Do you have access to the internet? 0 = No 1 = Yes IV2 - Do you own a smart phone? 0 = No 1 = Yes The following IVs are also included in the model because of their significant effect on feeling part of the community: IV3 - Gender 0 = Male 1 = Female 2 = Other 3 = No Response IV4 - Do you have a job? 0 = No 1 = Yes IV5 - How long have you lived in the community? Continuous variable Model 1 with both Internet Access and Smart Phone Ownership: Model 2 with only Internet Access: Please can someone help me, I've been struggling to find explanations about what is going on here. Why are there such big changes to the Exp(B)? What is going on between the IVs in the models and is the model more accurate when both are included? And please let me know if I need to provide more information.
