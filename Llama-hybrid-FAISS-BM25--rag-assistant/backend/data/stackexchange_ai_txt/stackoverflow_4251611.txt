Having trouble parsing website with regular expressions

I'm trying to parse search results for WorldCat.org in order to fetch basic information about books and articles. A typical search result (and the one I'm using for testing) can be found here: http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3Aorganizations&fq=dt%3Abks&qt=advanced&dblist=638 The html for that page is here: http://pastebin.com/w2U91F1i Here is the regular expression I'm using with PHP preg_match_all to capture basic details about each entry: $data = file_get_contents($url); preg_match_all('/ (.*?) \n.*? \n.*? (.*?) \n.*?\n\n by\s(.*?) .*? (.*?) .*?\n.*? (.*?) .*? Publication:\s*?(.*?) /', $data, $topics, PREG_SET_ORDER); When I use this expression with the regexr tool ( http://gskinner.com/RegExr/ ) it works just fine (except I use \r instead of \n -- usually \r doesn't work for me). But preg_match_all gives me an empty array each time. Any clues as to what I'm doing wrong?
