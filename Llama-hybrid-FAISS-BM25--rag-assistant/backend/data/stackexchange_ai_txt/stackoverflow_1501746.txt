Wrap the string in a stdClass? $dummy_object = new stdClass(); $dummy_object->string = $whatever_string_needs_to_be_tracked; $splobjectstorage->attach($dummy_object); However, every object created this way would still be unique, even if the strings are identical. If you need to worry about duplicate strings, perhaps you should be using a hash (associative array) to track them instead?
