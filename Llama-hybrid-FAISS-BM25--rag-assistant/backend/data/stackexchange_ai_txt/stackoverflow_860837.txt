Well obviously paragraph.split('.') won't cut it #split will take a regex as an answer so you might try using a zero-width lookbehind to check for a word starting with a capital letter. Of course this will split on proper nouns so you may have to resort to a regex like this /(Mr\.|Mrs\.|U\.S\.A ...) which would horrendously ugly unless you built the regex programmatically.
