(If I understood the question correctly) UIScrollView intercepts touchMoved events and does not propagate them to its contents if scrolling is enabled. So to do the dragging in the UIScrollView contents in my app I did the following trick: touchesBegan: Check if you touch the "draggable" region. If YES - disable scrolling in UIScrollView. touchesMoved: Now as scrolling is disabled your contents view receives this event and you can move your draggable UIImageView accordingly. touchesEnded: Reenable scrolling in UIScrolliew. If you want to drag the view outside of the visible UIScrollView area you may also need to check manually if you're near the boundaries and manually adjust contents offset (I didn't try this myself but I think it should work).
