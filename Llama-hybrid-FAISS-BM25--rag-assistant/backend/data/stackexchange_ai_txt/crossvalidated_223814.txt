When I compare two samples with a chi squared, should I compare one sample against a combination of the two?

I have a categorical variable for measured for two samples and I want to see if this variable differs significantly between the samples. I want to do a chi-squared test, with the samples as the columns and the categories of the variable as the rows (or vice versa). However, I have seen some people combining the two samples and then comparing one sample against this combined sample. Is this correct? Are there any consequences of doing a sample A vs (sample A + sample B) comparison? My instinct is that you are less likely to find a significant difference between samples because you are comparing one sample against an average of the sample and the other. EDIT: I'll provide an example illustrate my confusion. Here I run A vs B m Then when I combine A and B n The p-value is much greater in (A+B) vs B in comparison to A vs B. Reading the response to this question, I found this quote: Thus, it comes out that chi-square tests the deviation of each of the two groups profiles from this average group profile, - which is equivalent to testing the groups' profiles difference from each other, which is the z-test of proportions. If this is the case, then surely adding B to A decreases the difference between the two and therefore leads to larger p-values. To clarify : if I want to test for independence between two categorical variables, is it ever suitable to compare one group verses a combination of the two? If so, what am I effectively doing by comparing one group to a combination of the two?
