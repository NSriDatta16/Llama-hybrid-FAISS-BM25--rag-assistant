The view knows how to display the data. The view knows you want to color some values red, and display these values as a list, and you want to use drag-and-drop to rearrange a list. It doesn't know where these values come from, so you can focus on the layout and user interaction. The controller doesn't know any of that specific layout or behavior stuff. The controller only knows how to give the view values, how to save the order of the list, etc.
