How many models does caret::trainControl() actually train?

I searched around CV and the caret documentation but couldn't find an answer to this. I'm using caret in R to tune some random forests for classification trained using ranger . I've made a tuning grid that varies the number of variables sampled, mtry , and the minimum node size, min.node.size in this dataset. I defined the grid as follows: mtry So this grid should yield 15 models. Next, I set the trainControl function to use out of bag error, trainControl(method = "oob") . There are no repeats, because the method isn't repeated cross-validation. So I would only expect 15 models to be trained and the model with lowest OOB error to be chosen. However, looking at the "Growing trees.. Progress: X%" progress message that ranger prints, I can see that right now it's starting to train the 16th random forest instead of stopping, because it has already hit 100% 15 times and is starting to train a new forest. Did I misunderstand the trainControl() function? How many models is it supposed to train? Thanks for reading my post!
