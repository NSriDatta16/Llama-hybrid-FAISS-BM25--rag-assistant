How can I buy time to fully dismiss a UIAlertView when entering background?

I pop up a UIAlertView to ask the user if they really want to open a URL. If they choose "Yes" my app immediately opens the URL and is sent to the background. When the user reopens my app (with multitasking) the alert view hasn't disappeared completely and is in a half-transparent state. Presumably the screenshot used in multitasking was taken before the alert view completely disappeared, but just after it began to fade away. How can I give my app the extra second it needs to completely dismiss the alert view? It seems like I should do something in -applicationDidEnterBackground: or listen in the view controller for the equivalent notification but I'm not sure about the best approach.
