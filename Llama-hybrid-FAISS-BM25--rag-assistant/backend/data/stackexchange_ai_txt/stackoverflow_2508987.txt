Insert XML with more than 4000 characters into a Oracle XMLTYPE column

I have an oracle table with a column from type " SYS.XMLTYPE " and a storage procudure which is doing the insert: (Short version): PROCEDURE InsertXML ( pXMLData IN LONG ) IS BEGIN INSERT INTO MY_TABLE (XML_DATA) VALUES(pXMLData); END InsertXML; I call this sp from my C# code with type " OracleType.LongVarChar ". Now the problem: If the xml has less than 4000 characters everything is working fine, but by using a xml with more than 4000 characters I get the following error: ORA-20000: ORA-01461: can bind a LONG value only for insert into a LONG column How can I handle this? Thx 4 answers
