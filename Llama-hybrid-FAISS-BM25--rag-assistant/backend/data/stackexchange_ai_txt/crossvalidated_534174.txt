PCA new axes: always the same origin as the "original" axes?

When we carry out PCA, is my understanding correct that the new principal components will need to agree on the same origin as the "original" axes of the data? I have read through this great thread on PCA here : what confused me slightly is that the animations done by user Amoeba suggest the first PC does not need to go through the origin... I always assumed that in linear algebra, whatever transformation we do, the origin has to remain the same (otherwise it's no longer linear...?)
