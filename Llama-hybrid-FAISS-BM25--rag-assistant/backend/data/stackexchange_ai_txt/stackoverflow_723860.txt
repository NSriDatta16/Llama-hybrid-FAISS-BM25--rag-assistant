How do you generate a database schema diagram in visual studio (express)?

Right now all I did was use the Dataset designer and dragged tables into it from the Database Explorer. It works (for what I need anyway) but it feels like it's a misuse of Datasets. (Actually I'm not really sure how to use Datasets or what the intended usage is, I was planning on using LINQ2SQL to interact with the DB) Is this ok? I only need it for the designer view and it's a very simple DB layout (just 4 tables). I'm sure there's other tools out there, but is there anything integrated into VS Express that I should be using instead?
