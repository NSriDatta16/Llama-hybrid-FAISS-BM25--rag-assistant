Yes, all data has a lifespan. And yes, it is relative to the type of data you have. Some data has a lifespan measured in seconds (authentication tokens, for instance), some other data virtual eternity (more than the medium and formats it is stored into, like for instance ownership records). You will have to either be more specific as to the type of data you are envisioning, or do a census in your own organization as to the usual lifespan of stuff.
