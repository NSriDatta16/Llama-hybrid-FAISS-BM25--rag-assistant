How to enable Drag & Drop for all the children controls

My situation is as follows, I have win-forms applications with DockPanel Suite and lots of controls, which cover the entire screen, I want to enable D&D of files from the windows explorer to the application. I know how to implement the D&D, but it seems that if i enable it for the main parent form, only the applications title-bar and task-menu icon reflect the change in the D&D. I want the entire form to accept the files from the explorer. Do i have to enable D&D of files for each top control displaying in my application? I am sure there is a better way to implement this, help? Clarify When a user drags files from the windows explorer to my form, I want every place in the form to give a feedback for such an event. Much like you can drag a file from the explorer to the Visual Studio, and it doesn't matter to where you drag it, the application accepts the file.
