In view controller: public override void TouchesBegan (NSSet touches, UIEvent evt) { base.TouchesBegan (touches, evt); myField.ResignFirstResponder(); } Edit: From what I've read, you can use the TouchesBegan event for the cell subview instead of the table itself. I'm not positive that works. Good luck :)
