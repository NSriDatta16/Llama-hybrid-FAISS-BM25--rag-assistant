It really depends on what type of problems you are working on. I have been working on a new project for the past few months and I think every class inherits from boost::noncopyable. Nine months ago I worked on a different project that used PODs quite a bit and I leveraged automatic copy ctor and assignment operator. If you are using boost::shared_ptr (and you should be), it should be rare to write your own copy ctor or assignment operator nowadays.
