Navigating Silverlight pages from HTML

I am developing a website that contains a number of "forms" for entering data, etc, and I plan on using Silverlight and RIA Services for managing the data within these forms. The rest of the site will be normal HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The plan was to create a single Silverlight control with many pages and each page would represent a single form. A HTML page would display this control, but would display a specific page within the Silverlight control. So, my questions are: When embedding a Silverlight control within a HTML page how would have the control automatically navigate to a specific page? After loading a HTML page, and display the Silverlight control, would it be possible to have some JavaScript tell the Silverlight control to navigate to another page?
