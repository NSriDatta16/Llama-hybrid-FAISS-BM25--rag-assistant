Calculating an average

Hi Iâ€™ve got a quick question. On statistics. I ran a survey in which I asked respondents how many hours of quality time they spend with their family per week . I also asked them what percentage of that quality time is genuine in another question. When I calculated the average for the number of Hours of quality time, I got 20.8. I then also calculated the average for the second question I.e percentage of that time that is genuine and got 52.5%. If I wanted to then get an overall average of how many hours respondents think is genuine of the quality time they spend, can I simply multiple 0.52 by 20.8? I've tried calculating it using 2 methods which I will describe below. Q1 - asks how many hours of quality time respondents spend Q2 - asks what percentage of that quality time stated in Q1 is genuine Method A Respondent A stated 20 hours in Q1 and 50% in Q2 Respondent B stated 30 hours in Q1 and 25% in Q2 Average of Q1 = (20+30)/2 = 25 hours Average of Q2 = 37.5% Therefore average number of genuine hours is 37.5% of 25 hours = 9.375 hours Method 2 Respondent A stated 20 hours in Q1 and 50% in Q2 Respondent B stated 30 hours in Q1 and 25% in Q2 Respondent A genuine hours = 50% of 20 hours = 10 hours Respondent B genuine hours = 25% of 30 hours = 7.5 hours Average of respondent A and B genuine hours = (10 + 7.5)/2 = 8.75 hours How come each method gives me a different answer? And which method is the correct one? I'd greatly appreciate if someone could let me know which is the correct method and why. Thanks in advance.
