Over a year ago I was faced with a similar problem and could not find a ready solution therefore has made as follows: 1.Using SWFUpload upload images to an "store_image" action that stores, resizes, ..., and returns path to the thumbnail and the IDs of uploaded image. 2. Using JS put image IDs in hidden field(s) value. I used single field with value like "2312111:3231231:323212". 3. When create a "master" object, find the uploaded images by their IDs and establish their relation with the subject. Also garbage collector removes unrelated images created over 3 days ago. The garbage collector runs by cron every day. As for me, it is the most elegant solution. __ Sorry for my bad English
