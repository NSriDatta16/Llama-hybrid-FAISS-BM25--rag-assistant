I think no-one can solve this analytically, and I cannot model this easily with ML algorithms. Furthermore I think your problem specification is not clear enough. For instance, there are not enough constraints, and you don't say how many types of agents there are. In any regard, this seems to be a job for the Netlogo agent-based-modeling software. Answer part 1: You could reframe your question, assign it a "NetLogo" tag, ask again on stackoverflow.com. I happen to know that the Netlogo developers and other experts hang out there. You could get a much better answer than I could provide here. Maybe someone has developed a NetLogo Model that is similar to your problem, and you can adapt and study it. (Netlogo has an internal grid-search tool called "BehaviourSpace"), you can export data, and there are APIs for connecting Netlogo with other tools such as R. Answer part 2: In any case, this reminds me of the "El Farol" model included in the Netlogo agent-based-modeling software. El Farol is a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The bar is popular — especially on Thursday nights when they offer Irish music — but sometimes becomes overcrowded and unpleasant. In fact, if the patrons of the bar think it will be overcrowded they stay home; otherwise they go enjoy themselves at El Farol. This model explores what happens to the overall attendance at the bar on these popular Thursday evenings, as the patrons use different strategies for determining how crowded they think the bar will be. ... El Farol was originally put forth by Brian Arthur (1994) as an example of how one might model economic systems of boundedly rational agents who use inductive reasoning. I have included a screeenshot so you'll get an impression what I'm talking about. In the screenshot, replace The Blue square (The bar) with "Your System" "Crowded" with "Capacity Utilization: high", "Bar Attendance" with "General Performance" and "number-strategies" with "agent-types"
