I don't think you can really apply PCA directly to your data! Actually you can, but you should proceed in the opposite way as you would do for stationary data: For stationary data, you usually focus on the first PCAs ( highest eigenvalue ), that summarises the most the variance of your data for cointegrated data, you focus actually on the last PCAs ( smallest eigenvalue ), since the largest one has the highest variance, i.e. is the most non-stationary! You can verify this easily by looking at the paper of Harris and Snell, who find that PCA can be used to estimating the cointegrating space, by focusing on the smallest eigenvalues: Harris, D. (1997) Principal components analysis of cointegrated time series, Econometric Theory, 13, 529–57. Snell, A. (1999) Testing for r versus r-1 cointegrating vectors, Journal of Econometrics, 88, 151–91.
