Since the input will go through Ethernet, I assume data will be encapsulated within packets. I have no idea what your input data looks like, but I suggest using the Jpcap (available here : http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/Jpcap/doc/ ). Once you've messed around a bit with the API, it is really easy to learn and use. I've personnaly used it a couple of times, and I have created a "Router" which acted as an ARP proxy. This lets me think you could use this library to achieve what you've explained. Hope this helps!
