WF Extend Activity Behavior (or like Template Activity)

I want to create WF activity (let's call it Template Activity) with the following structure: several predefined activities (including conditions like if and so on) + one or more placeholder activities (for example sequence activities could be place holders). That mean, when I drag this activity to the workflow in designer, I will not be able to remove the predefined activities. And I will be able to add any activities to the placeholders to define custom behavior specific for the concrete workflow. The issue is that I could not create the designer of the Template Activity to behave this way. I could not add any activities (in any place) to the Template Activity when it is dragged to the workflow in designer. Does anybody know how I could achieve this Template Activity behavior?
