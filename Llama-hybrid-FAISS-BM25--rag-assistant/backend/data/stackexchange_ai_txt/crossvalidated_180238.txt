Let's say you know where you start, and it's in state $i$. Let's also name the transition matrix $Q$. The expected count of how many times you hit state $j$ in $n$ steps will be $$\sum_{t=1}^{n} Q^{t}_{i,j}$$ and therefore the expected frequency will be that number, divided by $n$. Just as an interesting addition: when $n\rightarrow \infty$, the expected count is only finite for absorbing markov chains (otherwise you will be in any state an infinite number of times), and the answer is, as expected, the appropriate entry of $$N= \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} Q^{t}$$ The matrix $N$ is called the fundamental matrix of an absorbing markov chain, and it is well-studied. See, for example https://hips.seas.harvard.edu/blog/2013/02/15/the-fundamental-matrix-of-a-finite-markov-chain/ .
