I would avoid putting your data access inside of your model. This could quite possibly lead to a dependency in the model on the storage mechanism. I would typically place this logic in the service/business logic layer which would do the speaking to the data layer and models. In your case with only model and controller it would be the controller that does this job. I think of the domain model as a group of toys or tools, that you pick up, use, manipulate, etc. The toys don't really care where they are stored, nor should they. You should be able to put a toy on the shelf, or in a toolbox. It doesn't affect the toy.
