The --trace-ascii option to curl will show the request headers, as well as the response headers and response body. For example, the command curl --trace-ascii curl.trace http://www.google.com/ produces a file curl.trace that starts as follows: == Info: About to connect() to www.google.com port 80 (#0) == Info: Trying 209.85.229.104... == Info: connected == Info: Connected to www.google.com (209.85.229.104) port 80 (#0) => Send header, 145 bytes (0x91) 0000: GET / HTTP/1.1 0010: User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 (powerpc-apple-darwin9.0) libcurl/7.16.3 0050: OpenSSL/0.9.7l zlib/1.2.3 006c: Host: www.google.com 0082: Accept: */* 008f: It also got a response (a 302 response, to be precise but irrelevant) which was logged. If you only want to save the response headers, use the --dump-header option: curl -D file url curl --dump-header file url If you need more information about the options available, use curl --help | less (it produces a couple hundred lines of output but mentions a lot of options). Or find the manual page where there is more explanation of what the options mean.
