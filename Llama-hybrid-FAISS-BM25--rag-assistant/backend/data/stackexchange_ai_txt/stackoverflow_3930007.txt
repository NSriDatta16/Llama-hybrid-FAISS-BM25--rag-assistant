The InnoDB engine does not store deleted data. As you insert and delete rows, unused space is left allocated within the InnoDB storage files. Over time, the overall space will not decrease, but over time the 'deleted and freed' space will be automatically reused by the DB server. You can further tune and manage the space used by the engine through an manual re-org of the tables. To do this, dump the data in the affected tables using mysqldump, drop the tables, restart the mysql service, and then recreate the tables from the dump files.
