Just want to add one point to @ShannonC 's comment on interval data: although scales are not technically interval data, in some cases it's appropriate to treat them as such. Especially if you have taken the mean or created a factor from several items, such that your values for each individual are continuous and normally distributed within the bounds of the scale. For example, although Jim's responses to the questions about masculinity may be 2, 3, 2, 3 his average score is 2.5. Sarah's average score is 2.3, and Bob's is 2.7. You can then use a histogram to see if the answers are normally distributed. If they are, it's probably safe to treat the scales as a continuous variable.
