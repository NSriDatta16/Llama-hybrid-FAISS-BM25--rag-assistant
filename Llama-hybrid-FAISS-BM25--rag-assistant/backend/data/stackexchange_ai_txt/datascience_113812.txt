Is it possible to implement logistic regression (or any other ML method) to impute null values in a categorical feature with multiple values?

I'm doing a Data Science project, and I'm on the stage of cleaning categorical features. I've been researching, and it seems that imputing the mean or median can change the distribution. Therefore, a better way would be to use logistic regression or any other model to predict null values in categorical features. In this post , the author explains how to use logistic regression to impute null values in a binomial categorical feature. However, the categorical features that I'm using have multiple possible values. Do you know of any approach to solve this and get an accurate imputation of null values on multi-categorical features? Thanks!
