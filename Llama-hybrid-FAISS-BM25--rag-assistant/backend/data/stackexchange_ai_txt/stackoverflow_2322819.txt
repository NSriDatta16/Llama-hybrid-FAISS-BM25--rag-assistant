How do I convert NSMutableString to double for storing in Core Data?

my app needs to store latitude and longitude values parsed from XML into Core Data. Currently, I have a Core Data Model which has these attributes set to type double . The header file for the Model Object has them defined as NSNumber How can I convert the string stored in my CurrentNodeText variable into the required type for storage in Core Data? Also, is this an appropriate way to store coordinate data in Core Data?
