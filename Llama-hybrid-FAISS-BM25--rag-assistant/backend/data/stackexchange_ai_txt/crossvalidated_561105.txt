Methods to calculate confidence interval for proportion with potential bounds?

I am trying to calculate the confidence interval on a time series proportion. For example, I have 1000 years of data, and I use 20 days to calculate some proportion. The thing is, I know the proportion should be closer to 0 than closer to 1. In fact, I hypothesize that it should be between 0 and 0.20 almost 100% of the time, and I'd imagine 90% would be a lot tighter. I've briefly glanced at this: https://towardsdatascience.com/five-confidence-intervals-for-proportions-that-you-should-know-about-7ff5484c024f . Wald gives me something too wide, and the other methods, I haven't looked through. Is there a way to simulate? Could I assume if I have 1000 days of data, make that the population proportion?
