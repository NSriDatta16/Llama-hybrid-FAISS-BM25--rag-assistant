That's not valid JSON. JSON is a data transport format that requires field names to be string delimited with double quotes , e.g. { "info" : { "First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Smith" } } After parsing, you can then use obj.info["First Name"] to access the First Name field. What you have is a JS object literal (that's still invalid), but you can apply the same technique (stringify the property names) to reach the same end goal.
