Confidence intervals and variance for ordinal scale set [0-5]

We have a known sample of data coming from a multiple choice ordinal scale survey question with scores from the set [0,1,2,3,4,5] . In one sample, the mean of this sample was 3.9032 and the std deviation 1.3255. We want to chart this sample with confidence intervals or some other indicator of variance/spread . However when I chart this using normal distribution, the top confidence interval is above 5 (the max possible score) because we are not dealing with a normal distribution. Question: What type of analysis could we use to plot a visual view of variance or spread on such a sample set over time, avoiding returning an impossible value less than 0 or greater than 5? Additional notes: The green line (mean) and the area is an example of the type of thing we want to create. This is time series plot of a longitudinal survey. At each point, we want to show the trending mean, and some indication of variance so the consumer can see if the trend and spread is changing over time. Please ignore the blue line.
