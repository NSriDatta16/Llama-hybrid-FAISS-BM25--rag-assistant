That dataset is plenty large. With cross-validation you usually split the dataset into k-partitions of test and training, where k is >= 2 but = caret package in R which it automates the training, testing and error calculation procedure. It also lets you adjust tuning parameters to see which settings provide optimal results. You can use this package to fit linear regressions as well so that both models are compared in the same way. Here is a tutorial for caret to start you off. You want to check for multi-collinearity between variables - this needs to be addressed for PCR - an easy way to do this is to produce a pairs plot of your variables. You can also plot a PCA, since that is more or less what it is based off, and check that you don't have problem shapes like these . Following the above this question will be irrelevant. caret::train will produce a final model for you based on it's results. Let me know if any thing is unclear! I am happy to help if you have more questions.
