From your description I'm not 100% sure I fully understand your scenario I assume you're splitting the file through a disassembler in the receive pipeline, and that your reference to "Use Temporary file for writing" refers to the file send adapter setting and that this send port subscribes to the messages from the receive port. Given this scenario each output message (a fragment of the original incoming message) will be processed independently and will be delivered as soon as possible, certainly after the message box (on the send side) If you have a RecoverableInterchangeProcessing setting on your disassembler, and you have set it to True, the messages will be processed completely independently; if this setting is false they will all be committed to the message box together, but then BizTalk may pick them up in any order.
