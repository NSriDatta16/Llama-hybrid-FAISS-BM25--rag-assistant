Generally speaking this ties closely in to the concept of strong-convexity. Of interest here is the so-called condition number which is defined as $\kappa = \frac{L}{\mu}$ for an $L$ -smooth, and $\mu$ -strongly convex function. Of relevance here is the lower bound in this paper on the number of Oracle calls, which has a dependence on $\sqrt{\kappa}$ . For SVM (or similar formulations with smoothed loss functions which converge to the hinge loss), $\mu=\frac{1}{C}$ (always), so one can indeed see that the lower bound increases at $\sqrt{C}$
