It is not necessary to have auto-correlation in time series data but if you want to use the normal ARMA parametric modeling, both the moving average and the autoregressive processes have some sort of autocorrelation structure. One of the requirements of normal regression is that each observation should be independent of each other. So there should not be any correlation between observations You can check if there is autocorrelation in the data by using a correlogram plot which laggs the data n steps and then check the correlation of original data with the lagged data. For lag = 1, you check the autocorrelation of 1 step and for lag = 2 you check the autocorrelation of 2 steps etc.
