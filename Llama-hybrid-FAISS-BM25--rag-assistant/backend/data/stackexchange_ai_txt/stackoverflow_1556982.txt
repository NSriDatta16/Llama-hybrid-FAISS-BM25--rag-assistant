Google has released a federation protocol that lets your write your own Wave servers and have them talk to Google's. They also have embedding APIs that let you put your HTML content in Wave and put Wave in your HTML content. Neither of these get you where you want, though, because the way that Google's in-browser Wave client and their Wave servers talk is still proprietary, and that's what you're looking for. Your answer is "it doesn't even make sense". You'd be better off building your own chat support and then connecting it to Wave later on.
