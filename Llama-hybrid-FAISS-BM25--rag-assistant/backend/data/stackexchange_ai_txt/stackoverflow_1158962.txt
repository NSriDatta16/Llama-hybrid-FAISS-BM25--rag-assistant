Rather than rolling your own Quartz graph with interactivity, you might want to take a look at the Core Plot framework, which is available for Mac and iPhone. The stubs are there to provide user interactivity, but we haven't filled in any implementations of this yet. If you wish, you can implement -(BOOL)containsPoint:(CGPoint)thePoint -(void)mouseOrFingerDownAtPoint:(CGPoint)interactionPoint -(void)mouseOrFingerUpAtPoint:(CGPoint)interactionPoint -(void)mouseOrFingerDraggedAtPoint:(CGPoint)interactionPoint -(void)mouseOrFingerCancelled within the appropriate CPLayer subclass to make that Core Plot element respond to user interaction. We will also be setting up a delegation pattern so that your controllers can handle the logic for interaction events as well.
