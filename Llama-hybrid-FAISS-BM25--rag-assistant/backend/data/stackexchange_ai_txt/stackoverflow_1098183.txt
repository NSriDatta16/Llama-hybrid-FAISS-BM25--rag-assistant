Is it possible to programatically add some controls to a WinForm?

i have a pretty simple rectangluar WinForm that uses timers to check the end content of a number of files. Works fine. Now, the list of files to check is dynamic. Could be 3. could be 30. It dependant upon some value in the database, which i check regularly. That's also fine. What I wish to do is visual this, on my winform. For each file, have a red circle. when the file is being 'checked', show that circle as green. once finished, red again. How can i programatically display a row (or rows) of this circle? I know the width of the form, if that helps. Remember, i have no idea how many to display if i drag/drop them onto the designer. I need to be able to do this dynamically :) How can i switch/flip this circle from red to green and later green to red? What is the circle? a custom image (eg. png) i make in MSPaint and add it to the project as an embedded resource? Cheers!
