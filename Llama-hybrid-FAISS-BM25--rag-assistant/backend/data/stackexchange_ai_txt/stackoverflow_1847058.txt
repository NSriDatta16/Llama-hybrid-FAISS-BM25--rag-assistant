killing process java.exe

I launch some batch file from my C# app via Process class. This file started java app. I cant recognize which process called java.exe must be kill to stop this application. Is there some more elegant way than kill them all, hope that i end the right one and dont kill some other important java app? Thanks for any help I really stuck there. Cheers, Andrew
