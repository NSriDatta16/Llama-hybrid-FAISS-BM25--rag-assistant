How does inception decrease the computational cost?

From the second paragraph of 3.1 Factorization into smaller convolution in the paper Rethinking the inception architecture for computer vision : This setup clearly reduces the parameter count by shar- ing the weights between adjacent tiles. To analyze the expected computational cost savings, ... This way, we end up with a net 9+9 Ã— reduction of computation, resulting 25 in a relative gain of 28% by this factorization Apprantly this design decreases the number of parameters. But I can't understand why it decreases the computational cost? For the case of using 2 3*3 convnets to replace 5*5, I think it increases (3*3*9+3*3)/5*5 = 3.6 times of computational cost. What do I miss here?
