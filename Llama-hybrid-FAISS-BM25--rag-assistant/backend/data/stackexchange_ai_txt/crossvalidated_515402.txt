Shuffling data for machine learning

I've come across a lot of posts suggesting shuffling data for certain machine learning models. Are there any downsides to this? Should this be a standard practice regardless of the model? I'm curious to know this, because there are a few approaches for which there is no literature on shuffling, so if there is no downside, it might be better to do it anyway.
