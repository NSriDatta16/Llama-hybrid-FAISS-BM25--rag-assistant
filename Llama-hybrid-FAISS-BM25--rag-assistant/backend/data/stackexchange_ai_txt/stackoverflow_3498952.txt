The question you have to ask is do you have the right features and they aren't organized correctly preventing them from being usable, or are you missing some key features and with those features your application would be more usable. The easiest thing to do is ask your users. If you have a base of users then I'd suggest signing up for http://getsatisfaction.com/ . You can place a button on each page of your web application and this allows people to submit ideas about that page to you, and aggregate ideas so you can find out what the most common suggestion or desire is. It allows you to open up communication with your users, and have a dialog with them about what would make them use the application.
