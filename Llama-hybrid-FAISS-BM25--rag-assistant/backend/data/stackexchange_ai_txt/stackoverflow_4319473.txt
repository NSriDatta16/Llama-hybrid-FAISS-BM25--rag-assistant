python truncate text around keyword

I have a string and I want to search it for a keyword or phrase and return only a portion of the text before and after the keyword or phrase. Google does exactly what I am talking about. Here is a string I grabbed from the web: "This filter truncates words like the original truncate words Django filter, but instead of being based on the number of words, it's based on the number of characters. I found the need for this when building a website where i'd have to show labels on really small text boxes and truncating by words didn't always gave me the best results (and truncating by character is...well...not that elegant)." Now lets say I want to search this for the phrase building a website and then output something like this: " ... the need for this when building a website where i'd have to show ... " Edit: I should have made this more clear. This has to work on multiple strings / phrases, not just this one.
