On a Windows box, checkouts get put into the work directory inside the build agent. I'm making the assumption that it will be same on linux. The TeamCity docs seem to confirm this. The checkout directories' names resemble hashes. Look in the directory.map file for a mapping of which directory represents which build configuration. To answer your question in the comment: To do this, you could add a build step that does the modification (using some custom logic that you would have to create) as the first step of the build. I would recommend changing your tests so that they work the same way as when cleanly checked-out from source control. This will ensure that your tests are repeatable in a consistent manner. It might be more work, but it will pay off in the longer term, especially if your tests fail in TeamCity but not on your machine - a difficult situation to debug.
