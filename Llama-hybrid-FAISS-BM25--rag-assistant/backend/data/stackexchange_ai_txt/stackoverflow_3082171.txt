It makes less sense to fragment TCP than it does to fragment UDP. Since TCP provides a reliable segmentation/reassembly/retransmission mechanism, one can just send smaller TCP segments and avoid the whole necessity for fragmentation (this is what d3jones is talking about). In UDP, however, fragmentation still makes sense. You can send a single UDP segment greater in length than the MTU. The IP layer will fragment it correctly and invisibly. The application developer doesn't have to determine the MTU or anything about the network in order to code the application layer protocol.
