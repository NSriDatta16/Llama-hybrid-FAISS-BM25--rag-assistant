My knee jerk response is: without a measure of goodness the word "better" has no meaning. I am trending to "c, none of the above" as my preferred approach The approach to "build", if you mean build = grow, is to split on the best leaf until a stopping criterion is breached. Like all Machine Learning tools, there are two goals for the tree, and they comprise a measure of goodness for the pruning process: maximize generalization, minimize error in representation. If you can agree to these two, in a general sense, then I can proceed with an answer.
