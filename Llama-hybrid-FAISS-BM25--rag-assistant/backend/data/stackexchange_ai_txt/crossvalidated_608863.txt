Build time series models for 50k customers?

I have time series data for 50k customers.I want to forecast at a customer level. But the problem is it is not possible to train a ARIMA/ARIMAX model on each customer. Can I train a general time series model on the population which has an effect term for each customer? Or is it somehow computationally possible to have a time series model for each customer?
