Having a FileSystemWatcher service like Kevin Jones suggests is probably the most pragmatic answer, but there are some other options. You can watch the directory with inotify if you mount it with Samba on a linux box. That of course assumes you don't mind fragmenting your platform, but that's what inotify is there for. And then more correctly but with correspondingly less chance of you getting a go-ahead, if you're sitting monitoring a directory with 20K files in it it is probably time to evolve your system architecture. Not knowing all that much more about your application, it sounds like a message queue might be worth looking at.
