There is also the issue with fonts. There are two ways to handle fonts. Either you use a gigantic font with glyphs for all the Unicode characters you need (I think recent versions of Windows comes with one or two such fonts). Or you use som library capable of combining glyphs from various fonts dedicated to subsets of the Unicode standard.
