In server-client programs, the biggest bottleneck is usually the network latency unless you are doing very complicated time-consuming processing at server side or you have behemoth data in your RDBMS and need to search from it. There are a couple of things (scopes more than XML) that you may try for fast loading: If you are feeling that database is the bottleneck, you may try caching (look for MemcacheD and the likes) objects in front of database. This will reduce DB hits and retrieval will be faster. Use compression in XML. Or use shorter notation like JSON or YAML. In general, for webapps : Reuse and use optimized (compressed) images. Use more CSS less images wherever you can. Minify the components like CSS and JS. Don't load everything at once, if not needed. You may look into XML compressors or if you can, use some shorter notation like JSON or YAML . But I guess it will be hard to change data format if you have already developed the app.
