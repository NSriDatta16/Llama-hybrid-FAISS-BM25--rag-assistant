" rotation " are the principal components (the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix), in the original coordinate system. Typically a square matrix (unless you truncate it by introducing tolerance) with the same number of dimensions your original data had. E.g. if you had a 3D data set, your rotation matrix will be 3-by-3. " x " is your data set projected on the principal components ("rotated"). It has the same dimensions as your original data set (again, assuming you don't truncate low-ranking PCs). Here is an example: Assume your data set looks like this: (the red and the blue line are the first and the second principal components, respecitvely). After performing the PCA, you can plot it in terms of its PCs: And here is the code, for reproducibility: library(tidyverse) theme_set(theme_bw()) set.seed(1) N = 1000 X = matrix(c(rnorm(N, 0, 3), rnorm(N, 0, 1)), ncol=2) phi = 30/180*pi M = matrix(c(cos(phi), sin(phi), -sin(phi), cos(phi)), nrow=2, byrow=T) X = X %*% M p = prcomp(X, center=T) p X %>% as_tibble %>% ggplot(aes(V1, V2)) + geom_point(size=.5) + xlim(-15, 15) + ylim(-15, 15) + geom_abline(slope=p $rotation[1, 2] / p$ rotation[1, 1], colour="red") + geom_abline(slope=p $rotation[2, 2] / p$ rotation[2, 1], colour="blue") + coord_fixed(ratio = 1) p$x %>% as_tibble %>% ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2)) + geom_point(size=.5) + xlim(-15, 15) + ylim(-15, 15) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour="red") + geom_vline(xintercept = 0, colour="blue") + coord_fixed(ratio = 1)
