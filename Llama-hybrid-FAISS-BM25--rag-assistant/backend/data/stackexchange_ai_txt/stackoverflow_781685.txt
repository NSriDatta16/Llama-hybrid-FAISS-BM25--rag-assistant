Database design: Splitting a blog entry into multiple pages

What is the best database strategy for paginating a blog entry or page content where some entries may be a single page and some may span multiple pages? Note: The content would be article-like rather than a list of items. The method that I'm currently considering is storing all of the content in a single text field and using a page separator like {pagebreak} . Upon retrieval, the content would be split into an array by the page separator and then the page would display the appropriate index. Is this the best way to go about it, or is there a better approach?
