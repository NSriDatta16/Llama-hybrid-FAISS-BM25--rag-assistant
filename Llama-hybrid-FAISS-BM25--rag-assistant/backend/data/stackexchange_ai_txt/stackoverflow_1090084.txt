I use sqlite for desktop apps that need a good way to store relational information. Lots of other people do too. SQLite is easy, robust, fast, and light. There are plenty of .NET data providers for sqlite, and there's a nice SQLite browser app to check out your data file. SQL Server [Express] is appropriate for "big" apps, or apps that need features of a "real" sql database (like stored procedures or something). You can do an embedded sql server express , if you have enough memory on your target machines. XML is appropriate for (read-only) configuration info, but using it as a r/w storage format is just asking for a lot of time in your debugger.
