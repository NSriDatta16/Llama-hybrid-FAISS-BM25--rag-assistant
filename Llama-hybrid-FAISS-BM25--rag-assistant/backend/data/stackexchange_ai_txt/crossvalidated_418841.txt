How to write the log likelihood for the sum of independent poisson events

Say that the per each event of TYPE 1, the average number of occurrences is $\lambda_1$ . Then the likelihood for the number of occurrences in a single event, $k_1$ , is $\lambda_1^k / k_1! * e^{-\lambda_1}$ . Now let's say I also have events of TYPE 2 for which the average number of occurrences is $\lambda_2$ . I want to write a likelihood for the total number of occurrences across multiple events of each type (i.e., across $n_1$ events of TYPE 1 and $n_2$ events of TYPE 2)? The main unknown in this case would be the total number of occurrences, $k$ . The "occurrences" in these two types of events are the same (e.g., number of traffic stops on weekdays [TYPE 1] and weekends [TYPE 2]) As an example, let's say $\lambda_1 = 1.2$ and $\lambda_2 = 1.8$ and there are $n_1 = 10$ events of TYPE 1 and $n_2 = 20$ events of TYPE 2. The likelihood should maximize right around $k = \lambda_1*n_1 + \lambda_2*n*2 = 48$ . How would I write out such a likelihood?
