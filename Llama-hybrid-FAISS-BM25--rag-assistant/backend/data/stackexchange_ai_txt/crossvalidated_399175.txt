An interesting question. Right from the start I think you are correct and it is just your intuition that "let's you down". I guess the only 2 case, I can think of, when you do not get any information is when the initial distribution is uniform or when it is 20%, 40%, 40%. In all the other cases T will get an extra piece of information from the A's answer just because he is not allowed to disclose to T he is actually the one to be fired. There is some sort of inevitable "asymmetry" in the setting. I encourage you to watch this 3 card problem from a David MacKay's lecture about information theory (the whole series is a gem imho): https://youtu.be/9w4LnXIip5A?list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6&t=1655 . He also rightfully points out why the Monty Halls problem is not very good educational example, since "everyone" has heard the answer but does not know why it actually is what it is :).
