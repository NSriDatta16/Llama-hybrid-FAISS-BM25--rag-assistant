No - when you submit time series data to a power spectrum analysis, the result you obtain looks like a histogram constructed via a line instead of vertical bars. A power spectrum will have its greatest peak (spike) at the dominant cycle over the wavelength of the data submitted. You can see this by adding together vertically several sine and cosine waves with various amplitudes and wavelengths. If you use a large major cycle with a large amplitude, then that will be the dominant cycle which contributes to the sum, and there will be a spike in the power spectrum at the wavelength for the dominant cycle. (be careful, you can perform power spectrum analyses based on wavelength or amplitude).
