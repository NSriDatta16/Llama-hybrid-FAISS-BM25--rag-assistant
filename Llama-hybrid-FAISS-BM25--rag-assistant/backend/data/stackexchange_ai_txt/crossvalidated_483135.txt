Robert is right, these are not crossed random effects, but I think I understand the data enough that I can answer the other parts of your question. If you are interested in how phoneme changes across the different contexts, you need to have it has a fixed effect. Something like this: fit As for the last question You have plotted the different individuals for each phoneme. So the (Intercept) category corresponds to the phoneme . The model above will allow you to plot the difference between the different F2 values of the three phonemes taking into account the differences between participants and that participants may not all produce the phonemes with equal differences between the three levels. You can then plot the fixed effects to see the differences of the "average" participant. For example, the code below would plot all fixed effects using the effects package. library(effects) plot(allEffects(fit))
