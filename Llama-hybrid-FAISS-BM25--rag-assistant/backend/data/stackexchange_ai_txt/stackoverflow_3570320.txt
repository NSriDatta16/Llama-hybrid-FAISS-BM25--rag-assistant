I've attempted to use it a few times over the past ten years. Previously, the menu was cluttered with disabled items, and uselessly disorganized. Actually making a selection was unpredictable, as the few items that weren't disabled were often supposed to be. The appearance of possibly doing something was itself just a bug. However, it appears to be much improved in 10.6. If you want to provide a universal, context-sensitive service, I'd say go for it. Maybe it will be the killer app for this decade-dormant delivery doodad.
