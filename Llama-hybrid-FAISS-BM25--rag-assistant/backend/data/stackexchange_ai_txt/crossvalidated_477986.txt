The linear trends look about right. The issue is you have seasonality in your data (at least in the rental data - there doesn't appear to be seasonality in the stock price data). This is, there is a cyclic effect due to the time of year/day of the week or some other repeating time.For instance, in your rental data there are more rents in the summer months - if this is a holiday let then this makes complete sense, lots of people go for a holiday/vacation in the summer and less so in the winter. Dealing with seasonality is as simple as including factor terms in your mean function. At the moment, your mean function is $$f(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t.$$ You should add in seasonal components $$f(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + s_t$$ where $s_t$ is the 'season' we are in at time $t$ . This could be a typical season (summer/winter/spring/autumn), a month, day of the week, or any other sensible cyclic 'time'. You need to define the seasons in a way that makes sense for the data (like in the rental data, using months or standard seasons seems appropriate). Another important thing to think about is the error structure in the data. Errors in time series are correlated so a linear regression, although good for 'de-trending' the data, isn't the best for prediction. You need to find a suitable error structure for your data too. ARIMA models will be a good starting point for this.
