[Note that the R help gives Hollander and Wolfe [1] as a reference so that would be one place to look for more details.] Each set of block-ranks contains the numbers $1$ to $k$, so the average rank, $\bar{r}$ in each block will be $(k+1)/2$ (ties within a block won't change that average either, but I will work on a "no ties" basis, since it will affect later calculations). Consequently, the average rank across all blocks will also be $(k+1)/2$. Similarly, $SS_e$, is purely a function of $n$ and $k$. For a particular block, $i$, $$\sum_{j=1}^k\left(r_{i,j}-\bar{r}\right)^2=k(k-1)(k+1)/12$$ Hence the double sum in $SS_e$ is $nk(k-1)(k+1)/12$ and so $SS_e$ itself is $k(k+1)/12$ What remains then is to show that $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^k\left(R_j - \frac{n(k+1)}2\right)^2=n \sum_{j = 1}^n \left(\bar{r}_j -\frac{(k+1)}{2}\right)^2$. Taking the RHS \begin{eqnarray} n\sum_{j = 1}^n \left(\bar{r}_j -\frac{(k+1)}{2}\right)^2&=&n\sum_{j = 1}^n \left(\frac{1}{n}R_j -\frac{1}{n}\frac{n(k+1)}{2}\right)^2\\ &=&n(\frac{1}{n})^2\sum_{j = 1}^n \left(R_j -\frac{n(k+1)}{2}\right)^2\\ &=&\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j = 1}^n \left(R_j -\frac{n(k+1)}{2}\right)^2\end{eqnarray} So when there are no ties the two formulas are algebraically identical.
