Does a model learn the same attention scores when retrained?

As in the title, should I expect a model to learn almost the same attention scores in its attention layers when I train it? Perhaps only in the first one if there are multiple such layers? It feels intuitive to me that, if attention is learning the most 'important' features for the prediction, then it should learn almost the same scores, or at least give the same 'order' to the features. Thank you!
