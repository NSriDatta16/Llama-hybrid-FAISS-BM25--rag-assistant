Intuition behind the first, second, third order differencing. When to use them?

I am working with time series data and out of curiosity took the first, second and third order differences of my data. However, I am not quite sure when they are used? I also wonder about the intuition behind differencing. First order is pretty clear; it is the difference. $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \Delta X_t &= X_t - X_{t-1}. \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ The second one as described here is the curvature of the series at a given point in time. $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \Delta^2 X_t = \Delta (\Delta X_t) &= \Delta (X_t-X_{t-1}) \\[6pt] &= \Delta X_t - \Delta X_{t-1} \\[6pt] &= (X_t-X_{t-1})-(X_{t-1}-X_{t-2}) \\[6pt] &= X_t - 2X_{t-1} + X_{t-2}. \\[6pt] \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ But I don't know actually what the third difference means and when to use first, second and third differences. $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \Delta^3 X_t = \Delta (\Delta^2 X_t) &= \Delta (X_t - 2X_{t-1} + X_{t-2}) \\[6pt] &= \Delta X_t - 2\Delta X_{t-1} + \Delta X_{t-2} \\[6pt] &= (X_t - X_{t-1}) - 2(X_{t-1} - X_{t-2}) + (X_{t-2} - X_{t-3}) \\[6pt] &= X_t - 3X_{t-1} + 3X_{t-2} - X_{t-3}. \\[6pt] \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$
