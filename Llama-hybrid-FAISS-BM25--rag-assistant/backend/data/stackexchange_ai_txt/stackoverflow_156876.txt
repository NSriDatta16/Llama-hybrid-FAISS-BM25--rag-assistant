The names of the areas vary by platform, compiler and linker. In general, there are: program text: The executable code space. constants: Non-executable constants. stack: The stack. bss: Broadly "statics" in C/C++ terms. "Block Started by Symbol" data: Uninitialised globals heap: Storage allocated at runtime. In this case the documentation in question is using the name "data area" for what is traditionally called the bss segment. In C terms, the storage class specifier "static" means memory that exists for the lifetime of the program and is initialised to zero or value of the initialiser. In the example: static int s_value_one; static int s_value_two = 123; The value of s_value_one is guaranteed to be zero and the value of s_value_type is 123 at the point of the first statement in main(). How this comes to be true is an implementation issue.
