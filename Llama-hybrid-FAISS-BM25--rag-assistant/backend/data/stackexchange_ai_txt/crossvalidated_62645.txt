The arguments based on scale (for variables expressed in the same physical units) seem rather weak. Imagine a set of (dimensionless) variables whose standard deviations vary between 0.001 and 0.1. Compared to a standardized value of 1, these both seem to be 'small' and comparable levels of fluctuations. However, when you express them in decibel, this gives a range of -60 dB against -10 and 0 dB, respectively. Then this would probably then be classified as a 'large range' -- especially if you would include a standard deviation close to 0, i.e., minus infinity dB. My suggestion would be to do BOTH a correlation- and covariance-based PCA. If the two give the same (or very similar, whatever this may mean) PCs, then you can be reassured you've got an answer that is meaningul. If they give widely different PCs don't use PCA, because two different answers to one problem is not sensible way to solve questions.
