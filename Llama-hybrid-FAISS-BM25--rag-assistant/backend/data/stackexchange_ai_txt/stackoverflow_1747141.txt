Though a bit more fragile since it uses keycodes... the following would work more intuitive because it makes it completely impossible to enter non-numbers: $("#target").keydown(function(event) { return ( event.keyCode = 48 && event.keyCode Note to add: This is actually not the best way to go... since a (windows) ALT+[num]132 will make it possible to enter Ã¤ into the box. It should be combined with the keyup event to ensure that no characters have been entered as well like so, Combined: $("#target").keydown(function(event) { return ( event.keyCode = 48 && event.keyCode Also, this doesn't work with the num-pad-numbers over here so it definately is more fragile than a simple blur() event.
