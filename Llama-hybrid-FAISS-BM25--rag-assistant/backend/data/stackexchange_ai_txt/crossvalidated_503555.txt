In general math sense an equation like $ x_{t+1} = x_t + \epsilon_t$ holds, you can build a time series consistent with it (simple sum of series). However $\epsilon_t$ cannot be interpreted as residual. If in the equation $ x_t = x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t $ represent and AR(1) model and, then, the term $\epsilon_t $ is a residual, the two equation cannot represent the same series. In this sense are not consistent.
