How to transform a unit root process to a stationary process?

If a time series has a unit root, that can be modeled as discretized geometric Brownian motion, then are there any ways to reduce the series to $\sim I(0)$? subject to the fact that no other time series $I(1)$ exists with which a linear combo of them would produce $\sim I(0)$ via cointegration? Without having to 1st-difference the series? I even tried detrending the processes by eliminating the drift, and almost every possible way except for 1st-differencing, and the final process still ends up with a unit root.
