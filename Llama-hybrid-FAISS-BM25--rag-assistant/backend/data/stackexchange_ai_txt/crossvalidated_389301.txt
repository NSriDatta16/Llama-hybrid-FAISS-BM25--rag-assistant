Biased coins and Markov processes

Good day, I am attempting an optional exercise and I am finding it hard to interpret the problem in terms of matrices and vectors. Coin 1 has probability 0.4 of coming up heads, and coin 2 has probability 0.8 of coming up heads . The coin to be flipped initially is equally likely to be coin 1 or coin 2 . Thereafter, if the flipped coin shows heads then coin 1 is chosen for the next flip, and if the flipped coin shows tails then coin 2 is chosen for the next flip. Let $X_0$ be the coin chosen for the initial flip, and, for $n \geq1$ , let Xn be the coin chosen for the nth flip after the initial flip. (a) Explain why $X_0,X_1,X_2, . . .$ is a Markov chain. Write down its statespace and its transition matrix. (b) Let $p^{(n)}$ be the probability row vector giving the distribution of $X_n$ . Find $p^{(0)}, p^{(1)}, p^{(2)}$ . (c) Write down the probability that coin 1 is chosen for the second flip after the initial flip. (d) Find the probability that coin 1 is chosen for the second and third flip after the initial flip. What I thought of is that the state space is $S=(1,2)$ and the transition matrix would be $$\begin{pmatrix} 0.4 & 0.6\\\ 0.8 & 0.2\end{pmatrix}$$ After doing this, I think the rest of the questions will be easy to approach Using this, I get that $p^{(0)}=( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ as the initial toss has equal probability of being in state 1 or 2. Using the answer below, I get that $p^{(1)}=( 0.6, 0.4)$ $p^{(2)}=( 0.56, 0.44)$ The answer to $c)$ is then $0.6$ . But the last part ( $d)$ ) is still puzzling me. I feel like there is some Bayes involved and that the answer is not simply $0.6*0.56$ .
