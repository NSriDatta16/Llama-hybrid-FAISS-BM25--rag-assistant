On WinMo you currently only get Flash Lite and the old Player version 7. General-purpose desktop Flash games will probably not run. Adobe are promising full Flash for mobile operating systems with the 10.1 release; maybe that'll work for you when it comes out. I'd definitely try to embed Flash rather than a web browser control, as IE Mobile is a hive of bugs and differences between OS versions. Keep IE Mobile out of the equation as much as possible if you value your sanity. It remains to be seen how embedding Flash will work in the new Player. But it's worth getting the VirtualPC images for Windows Mobile set up now to play and test with.
