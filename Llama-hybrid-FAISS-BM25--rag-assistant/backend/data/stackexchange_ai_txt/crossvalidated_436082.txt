Let $Y$ be the binary outcome, OP the ordinal position and $x$ the other predictors. Then build a logistic regression model for $Y$ using both $x$ and OP, maybe representing OP via a spline. Then when you want to make predictions without knowing OP, make predictions for all possible values of OP and average them over the marginal distribution of OP.
