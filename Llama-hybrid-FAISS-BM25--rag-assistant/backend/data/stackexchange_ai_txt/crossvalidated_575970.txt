Exists an option to avoid reference categories in logistic regression?

I was wondering if there exists an option to avoid reference classes in logistic regression by transformation estimaters (especially the intercept)? Normally the intercept contains the information of all reference classes. Is it possible to get three estimators for a variable with three categories? It would be very much appreciated if someone has got an example. Edit: I've read about models using intercept and having estimaters for each class.
