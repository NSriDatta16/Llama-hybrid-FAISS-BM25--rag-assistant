I think the only general solution would be to: increase the threshold of the model confidence. For example you are doing binary classification of dog in images: Dog = 1, No Dog = 0 Generally a model (like Neural Network) would output the probability of the image being 1: if it's > 0.5 then predicts 1 else 0. Increasing the confidence to 0.7 would decrease the False Positive .
