Question about the Solution for Problem 3.7b, Introduction to Probability (Bertsekas, 2nd Edition)

I am currently working on the problems in Introduction to Probability (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 2nd Edition) and one of the problems is as follows: For Problem (b), the final answer is as follows: My question: Why do we have cumulative density for 0 ? Shouldn't the cumulative density be 0 on the 0 interval? Based on the problem statement, my assumption is that s can only be 0 or [1/t, +inf) so anything outside of that shouldn't be possible (hence, 0 probability). Am i missing something here? Thanks in advance. P.S The final answer is taken from the book's Problem Solutions supplement.
