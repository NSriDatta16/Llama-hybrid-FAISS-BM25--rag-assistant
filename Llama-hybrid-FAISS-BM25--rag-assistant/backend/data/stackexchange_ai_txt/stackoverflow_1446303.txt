Thanks Pete Kirkham & Tyler for your answers which are really helpful. Lets say i dont wanna use buttons as i am mainly displaying images as a small rectangles. To check for the rect @ (x,y) , i can trigger that easily by making my grid as a square & finding gridcolumn = Math.floor(pos.x / cellwidth); gridrow = Math.floor(pos.y / cellheight); But my problem is with touchesMoved. Lets say i started @ grid-1 & dragged till grid-9 (in a 3*3 matrix), in this case, i am assuming i will get 100-300 (x,y) positions, so everytime i need to run above formula to determine corresponding grid. This results in 300 calculations which might effect the performance. So when i display an image as a rect, can i associate some id for that image? so that i can simply just save the ids in a list (from grid-1 to grid-9) so that i can avoid the above calculation. Thanks for your help
