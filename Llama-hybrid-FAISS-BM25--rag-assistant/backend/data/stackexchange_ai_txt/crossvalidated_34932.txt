Proper use of weights argument in linear mixed model [lme()]?

After attempting to produce a linear mixed model I was left with a great deal of heterogeneity. lme1 The response term Average.payoff is continuous, whilst all explanatory variables are binary. When I look to validate, I can clearly see that the spread of the residuals decreases with the larger fitted values. So, I decided to look at using the weights argument. I came up with the following model which seems to be the best fit ( AIC and loglik ). vf1 Can I justify using the varIdent function alongside random effects? Can I justify combining varIdent functions so the variance of all explanatory variables are accounted for? If I remove a fixed effect explanatory variable for being insignificant should the same variable be removed from the variance structure? If I get a better fit (using AIC and loglik ) without including the random effects by re-modelling with gls() , can I justify using the model without the random effects? The experiment involved $20$ subjects, for each subject I have two samples, one where Others.Type=0 and one where Others.Type=1 .
