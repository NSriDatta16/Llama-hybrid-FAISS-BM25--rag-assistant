You can still use a linear SVM classifier in a non-separable case. However, you should then tolerate misclassifications. You should then tune the hyperparameter $C$. There are cases where a linear SVM in a non-separable case gives better results than a RBF kernel. For instance, the optimal decision boundary for two classes with equal covariance matrices is linear.
