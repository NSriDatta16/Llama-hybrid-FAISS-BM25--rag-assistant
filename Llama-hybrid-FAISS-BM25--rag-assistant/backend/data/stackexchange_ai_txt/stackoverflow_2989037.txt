MSTest code coverage

I have a test project for a web service and, when I run tests in debug mode, everything works ok. However, when I just run tests, I get following error, for a referenced assembly that I try to obtain code coverage: Class Initialization method WebServiceTest.wstest.MyClassInitialize threw exception. System.IO.FileLoadException: System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'TestAssembly, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=57f286581e1d278a' or one of its dependencies. Strong name validation failed. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8013141A) ---> System.Security.SecurityException: Strong name validation failed. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8013141A). Everything I found said to register TestAssembly in GAC. Is this what should I do? Why is it working in debug mode? Thank you
