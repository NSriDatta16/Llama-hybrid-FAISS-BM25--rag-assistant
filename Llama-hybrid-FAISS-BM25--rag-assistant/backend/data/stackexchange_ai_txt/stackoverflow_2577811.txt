Ok this is what i could figure out from my setup. Everytime i run an app 2 httpd processes spawn. I currently have 3 apps running and hence have 6 httpd processes. It has to do with passenger. It is tightly integrated with apache. This is what i get: 0 20 1 0 0:00.32 ?? 0:01.48 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND 70 104 20 0 0:00.01 ?? 0:00.01 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND 70 264 20 0 0:00.01 ?? 0:00.01 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND 70 265 20 0 0:00.01 ?? 0:00.01 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND 70 271 20 0 0:00.01 ?? 0:00.01 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND 70 275 20 0 0:00.01 ?? 0:00.01 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND 70 277 20 0 0:00.00 ?? 0:00.00 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND 70 278 20 0 0:00.00 ?? 0:00.00 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND I don't suppose its a problem. Guessing by your process list you have around 7 apps running in the cloud if i am right. According to the Phusion Passenger docs: PassengerMaxPoolSize The maximum number of Ruby on Rails or Rack application instances that may be simultaneously active. A larger number results in higher memory usage, but improved ability to handle concurrent HTTP clients. The optimal value depends on your system’s hardware and the server’s average load. You should experiment with different values. But generally speaking, the value should be at least equal to the number of CPUs (or CPU cores) that you have. If your system has 2 GB of RAM, then we recommend a value of 30. If your system is a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and has about 256 MB RAM, and is also running other services such as MySQL, then we recommend a value of 2. If you find that your server is unable to handle the load on your Rails/Rack websites (i.e. running out of memory) then you should lower this value. (Though if your sites are really that popular, then you should strongly consider upgrading your hardware or getting more servers.) This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration. The default value is 6. You mentioned this: "eventually requiring an apache reboot". So does any of your rails app freeze after a point?
