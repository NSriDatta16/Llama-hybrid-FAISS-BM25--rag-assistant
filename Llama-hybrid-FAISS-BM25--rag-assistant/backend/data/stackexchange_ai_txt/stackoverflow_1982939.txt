SQL to identify out of tolerance values

I have a database table with the following structure - Week_End Sales 2009-11-01 43223.43 2009-11-08 4324.23 2009-11-15 64343.23 ... What I want is a SQL statement that will take a start and end date, and identify all rows within that period where the sales figure is more than 3% above or below the average sales figure for that period. So, run against the above data, it would return - Week_End Sales 2009-11-08 4324.23 I am using SQL Server 2008, btw.
