How to statistically compare frequency / distribution over time?

Imagine this (illustrative) situation: there's a lake and in this lake 4 different fish species live. Every day for a year I count how many fishes there are in the lake (complete census, not sampling), and at the end of the year I make a nice plot, where it shows every month the percentage of each species in the lake, like so: Let's suppose that my H0 is that time has no influence in the distribution of fishes, and my H1 is instead being able to say "time does have an effect in fish population". What's the most appropriate statistical approach to test this hypothesis? Also, is there a way to tell which month / period in specific has the most influence? If this was not a time series but simply categorical data, I would probably start with a Chi-square test for independence followed by a Cronbach's Alpha to see which groups are most divergent from the mean, but in the case of a timeseries I'm totally lost. I'm quite noob at stats so any suggestion is much appreciated.
