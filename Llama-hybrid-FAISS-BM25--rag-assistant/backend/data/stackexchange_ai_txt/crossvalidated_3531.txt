Are there any R functions which support Reversible Jump MCMC for a GLM or SGLM?

I would like to perform reversible jump on a network model, but before arriving there, I'm wondering if there are any R packages which support reversible jump for a user specified generalized linear model or spatial-GLM? Something as simple as an RJMCMC procedure (in R) for the selection of predictors in a logistic regression would be a nice place for me to start? Does such a function exist? Through googling, I've only found RJaCGH which appears to be a bit more complicated (and application specific) than I was hoping for.
