I am unaware of deep learning architectures for your setting, but I want to share some knowledge. Extreme classification is a very demanding task. $^\dagger$ There are many large-scale open-source implementations for such a task. Google's ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors) is one of them, which implements this paper . You can check their example on the GloVe dataset. Spotify also has one called Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah). I reference it because they have benchmarked their approach against others (including ScaNN). $^\dagger$ I point it out to highlight the keywords for your problem to investigate further if you want.
