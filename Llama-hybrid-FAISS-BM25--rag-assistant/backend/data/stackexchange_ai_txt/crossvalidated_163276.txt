You can test Device B vs. Device A at Session 3 without changing the intercept. You have to create an individual contrast matrix that matches your research questions. First, we combine Session and Device into a new factor cond . D1 Now, we specify the contrasts corresponding to the research questions. mat1 Rows one and two correspond to the tests of Session 2 vs. 1 and Session 3 vs. 1. The third row corresponds to the test of Device B vs. A at Session 3. Note that this is a -1 vs. 1 contrast at Session 3. The values at the other sessions are 0. We have to transform this matrix into a contrast matrix for R. This can be don with ginv from the MASS package. library(MASS) Cmat This contrast matrix Cmat can be used for the regression. summary(lm(Y ~ cond, D1, contrasts = list(cond = Cmat))) cbind(1, Cmat) The result: Call: lm(formula = Y ~ cond, data = D1, contrasts = list(cond = Cmat)) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -12.4879 -2.2356 -0.1177 2.0643 12.6545 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 80.5713 0.5631 143.075 As you can see the value of Device B is smaller that the one of Device A at Session 3. The difference is not significant. Note that the intercept still corresponds to the average of all conditions.
