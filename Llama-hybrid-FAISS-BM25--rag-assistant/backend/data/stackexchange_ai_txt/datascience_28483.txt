Your example is cherry-picked: You mask out small numbers and keep a large one. But dropout is applied randomly. Each of the following six masks, and of the corresponding values for the vector length, is equally likely to appear: $$ \begin{align*} &(1, 1, 0, 0): &\sqrt{0.1^2 + 0.1^2} &\approx 0.1414,\\ &(1, 0, 1, 0): &\sqrt{0.1^2+ 0.2^2} &\approx 0.2236,\\ &(1, 0, 0, 1): &\sqrt{0.1^2+ 5^2} &\approx 5.0010,\\ &(0, 1, 1, 0): &\sqrt{0.1^2 + 0.2^2} &\approx 0.2236,\\ &(0, 1, 0, 1): &\sqrt{0.1^2 + 5^2} &\approx 5.0010,\\ &(0, 0, 1, 1): &\sqrt{0.2^2 + 5^2} &\approx 5.0040.\\ \end{align*} $$ The average vector length is $$ \frac16 (0.1414+0.2236+5.0010+0.2236+5.0010+5.0040) = 2.5991, $$ which is roughly half of the original vector length $5.006$. So it makes sense to divide it by the dropout rate of $50\%$.
