Overriding set methods in Python

I want to create a custom set that will automatically convert objects into a different form for storage in the set (see Using a Python Dictionary as a key non-nested ) for background. If I override add , remove , __contains__ , __str__ , update , __iter__ , will that be sufficient to make the other operations behave properly, or do I need to override anything else?
