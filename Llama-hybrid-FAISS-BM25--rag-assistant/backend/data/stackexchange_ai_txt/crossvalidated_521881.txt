How to compare two VAR time series models in R?

I have generated two VAR time series models in R for a dataset. My query is how can I compare those two models based on any kind of metrics like forecasting power :accuracy / f-1 score or something which can tell that 1st model is say 70% better than the second model. I need some comparison metrics code in R. Thanks in advance
