I've talked to an Apple engineer about this. touchesBegan won't work in the portion of a subview that's not contained w/in its superview because the system clips each subview on the way down the hierarchy as it tries to determine which subview's touchesBegan gets called. In order to resolve the issue, I removed the intermediate wrapper views that were causing the clipping problem and hoisted the subviews up one level. This necessitated a minor change in logic but ultimately proved to be a cleaner solution -- and more importantly, one that worked.
