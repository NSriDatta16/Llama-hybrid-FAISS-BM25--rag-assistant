Though you can use the native NSString methods to scan through the string, use substrings, and all of that jazz, this really seems like a good place to use regular expressions. It seems like you're going to be doing a lot of parsing of this data, and because of that scanning/substring work is going to be a gigantic pain. Here is a regular expression that matches only the line you are talking about, and gives you two captures: ([\w]+[^\w]*?) posts the big blind of ([\d]*) The first capture is the username of the person that posted the big blind (I know you didn't ask for that, but I bet it'll be helpful), and the second capture is the number. Newer versions of iOS contain the NSRegularExpression class to use regexes, but if you need to support older software, I highly recommend RegexKitLite for both Mac and iOS.
