Need help interpreting linear/nonlinear time series

I have a set of data, which i am tasked to find out anything that i could from this set of one dimensional data. Im looking at the ACF and PACF plot. Can anyhow determine if below indicates seasonality? if the data is from a linear process? or a non linear one? what else should i look at to determine these? im a total newbie in time series, this set of data is the first actual data that i got to actually try and analyse. Any help is greatly appreciated! I've added a few more plots. the time series plot for the whole of data isnt helpful but i think from here, i can say that there is no trend and is of constant variance? upon zooming in, i saw patterns from t=1 to t=100 then from t=101 to t=200. then the pattern repeats all over again. I have 4000 plus of data points of unknown origin. I was hinted that the data is of non linear nature rather than linear.. but i would have to find out more and support my claim. However, the plot for mutual information is showing that MI is not significantly different from zero hence i suspected that the data is not nonlinear. The link below is my data set. http://www.filetolink.com/b7e2e49597 [EDITED] [ ] 8 I've generated a few more for x[t] to x[t-10] but all are showing random clouds like the ones above with no patterns.
