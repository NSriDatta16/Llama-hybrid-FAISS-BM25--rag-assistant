.Net Cloud Based Storage solution

I am now at the point where i cant get any further with out some help.I am trying to host files on the cloud and then access those files via code (C#). So far i have tried Rapidshare and Skydrive and have been unable to get either working at all. Below is a few things that i am trying to do or rather must be able to do with the cloud storage. What i need is a place to host files on the internet (obvious). The files can range in size from 10 megs to 100megs. I Must be able to download the files via code as well as upload via code. I don't really mind having to pay as long as the price is not ridiculous.Any help at all will be much appreciated. Thanks Stalkerh
