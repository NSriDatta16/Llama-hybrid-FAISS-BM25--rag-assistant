Don't worry about the inconsistency, it doesn't matter. Too much time is often spent obsessing about such details, and everyone is guilty of it. Just be consistent with your own coding standards. You'll eventually use some 3rd party library or several that use different conventions than you. There's nothing you can do about it, and often 2 of those libraries you use will be conflicting with your standards and with each other. That's not only for include extensions, but also for naming convetions like function_that_does_something vs FunctionThatDoesSomthing .It's fine. I would definitely strongly advice against trying to change someone else's library to fit into your coding standard. I.e. for example renaming boost .hpp to .h. This is a bad idea and when you want to upgrade to newer versions of the library it will be a nightmare. Spend your time solving the problem you're solving in a more elegant way rather than worrying about details like this.
