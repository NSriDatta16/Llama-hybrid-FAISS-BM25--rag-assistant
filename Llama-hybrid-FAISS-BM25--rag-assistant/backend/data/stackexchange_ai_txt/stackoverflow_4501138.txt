I just looked in N3225, section 28.4 (header synopsis) and indeed, the basic_regex template has no member function str , and there are no operator provided. The paragraph 28.8/2 provides a little insight on this : Objects of type specialization of basic_regex are responsible for converting the sequence of charT objects to an internal representation . It is not specified what form this representation takes, nor how it is accessed by algorithms that operate on regular expressions. What I understand is that the standard mandates that basic_regex can be constructed from const charT * but does not require the implementation to keep this string.
