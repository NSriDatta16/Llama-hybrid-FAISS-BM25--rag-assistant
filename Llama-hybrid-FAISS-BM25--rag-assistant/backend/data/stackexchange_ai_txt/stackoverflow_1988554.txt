image not showing in UIBUtton

I'm writing a small application that allows for patterns to be placed on a button. When I run the app in the simulator the patterns display ok on the button. When I compile the application to the device the patterns do not display on the buttons but all other logic behind the buttons works fine. The patterns are simple png images and I use the basic code: [orangeButton setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"circle.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; to add the patterns to the buttons. To bring the patterns into Xcode I have just dragged them from the desktop to the resources folder in Xcode. Why are the patterns displayed in the similuator but not the provisioned application?
