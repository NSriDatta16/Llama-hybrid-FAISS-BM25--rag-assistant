You can assume the name of an anonymous class and call Class.forName("mypackage.MyBaseClass$1") to get a handle to an anonymous class. This will give you the first anonymous class defined in your MyBaseClass , so this is a rather fragile way to refer to a class. I suspect whatever you are trying to do could be done a better way. What are you really trying to achieve? Perhaps we can suggest a way which doesn't require you to pass a Class this way.
