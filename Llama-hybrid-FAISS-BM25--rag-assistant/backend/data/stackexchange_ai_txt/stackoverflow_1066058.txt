It's the construction like this?: jdhfksdjhfksdhk jdhfksdjhfksdhk jdhfksdjhfksdhk kfdhsjkfdks You use padding: 10px so the div has 10px inside margin. If it's a CMS, I'm sure that the text of the paragraph could be wrapped inside another tag (DIV) or maybe a class for the (P). If this isn't the case, may I ask if there's a surrounding wrapper around all of the article divs and the p tag? If that's the case then you can get to the P tag using CSS, if not, there's no way you achieve this in every browser. OR... I realized you could do a trick here. but you've got to be sure you have a selectable div on top of the article divs. It should be something like this: .article { margin-top: -5px; margin-bottom: 15px; } so, every div.article will move 5px up, leaving 10px of real margin betwen article divs. but the last one won't have the -5px move up, so you'll end up with 15px bottom margin for the P tag. You could play with the numbers to make it the most comfortable number. And in case you need more control, then use the padding values you set to 10px in every way and set them accordingly to compensate the margin offset.
