I think this is really impossible to say. We all manage content. The "system" is just whatever mechanism you use to do so(dragging and dropping in Explorer or committing content changes via a SQL query). To say there is a minimum amount of code needed really isn't indicative. What is indicative is how often you find yourself making mistakes and how easy it is for a given user of a given skill level and knowledge to execute the functions in the designed system. That tells you the quality/degree of what you have in place being worthy of being called a "CMS." Simply put a CMS is an application that allows the user to publish and edit existing web content. In response to the edit: A "good" CMS allows of extensibility. By using inheritence you can extend the functionality of a CMS outside of the core components provided. That's the magic. About Extensibility: Depending on the language/framework you want to build your CMS with, you can load pages or controls(ASP.NET) using command built into the framework. Typically what is being done is a parent class/interface is being defined that forces an module that is to be developed to follow some given standards: Public MustInherit Class CMSModule 'Here you will define properties and functions that need to be global to all modules being developed to extend your CMS. public property ModuleName as string End Class public class PlugInFooCMSPage inherits CMSModule end class Then it's just a matter of simply loading a module dynamically in whatever construct a given language/framework provides.
