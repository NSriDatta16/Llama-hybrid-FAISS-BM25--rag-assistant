What is considered a fast or slow load w/ respect to a web page

I just built a web page that is employing several different javascript elements. I am just curious as to what is considered a fast vs. a slow load time. Mine is coming out to be about 490ms w/ four different javascript pieces. Is that good, bad or average? Wondering if I need to optimize my js elements or not.
