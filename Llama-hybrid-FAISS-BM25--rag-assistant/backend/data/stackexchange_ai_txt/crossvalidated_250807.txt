Tic Tac Toe AI with Machine Learning

I am new to machine learning and as one of my first projects I decided to make a tic tac toe bot. What I've done so far is a rgb/hex color recognition with the naive bayes algorithm, which was really simple to make. Now I am struggling a bit with making a tic tac toe bot. My question is how should I proceed with this, is there a dataset, and should I take naive bayes again, or decision tree would be better for tic tac toe? (once again, purpose is just that I learn and dive deeper in machine learning)
