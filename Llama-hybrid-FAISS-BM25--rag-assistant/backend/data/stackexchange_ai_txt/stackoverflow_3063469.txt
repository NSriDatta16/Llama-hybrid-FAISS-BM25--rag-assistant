No. Bug 58945: CTabFolder should support multi row and vertical style options , opened since 2004! ( other bugs exist on the same topic) ( Update Feb. 2017 : it seems to be assigned, with Oxygen 4.7 as target! Thank you specializt for mentioning that in the comments ) CTRL + F6 is one workaround for now. Other "workarounds" are listed in this thread : turn on the "close editors automatically" option (preferences > General > editors), which will close editors automatically when the limit is reached an a new editor is to be opened. make use of multiple windows each with a set of editors for areas you are editing or browsing or searching CTRL + Shift + W to close all tabs quickly As mention by Big Chair in the comments : Someone made a workaround here: " Eclipse multiple tab rows " Wes explains: I've discovered that while it is true that you cannot have multiple rows of tabs for the same code-space, it is possible to have multiple rows of tabs showing on your window at the same time : To accomplish this, simply drag a tab up to your title bar and release. It will create another row of tabs .
