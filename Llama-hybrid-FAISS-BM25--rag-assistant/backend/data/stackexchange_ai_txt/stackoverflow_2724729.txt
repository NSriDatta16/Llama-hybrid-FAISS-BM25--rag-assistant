Many project types in VS2010 target the client profile. MS is making a bigger push this time around to get the 4.0 client profile to take hold (the 3.5 client profile was largely ignored). For what it's worth, what profile a project type targets by default is defined in its template, and easy to change if you desire ([VS Root]\Common7\IDE\ProjectTemplates and alter the TargetFrameworkProfile element inside the csproj files inside the templates as you see fit). I don't recommend this though. Generally speaking, as inelegant as it may be, I think we just have to get used to the idea that the client profile is more prominent now and be more aware of it as we work with VS2010
