Is PCA suitable when there are continuous variables with many zeros?

I am dealing with a database where frequencies of behaviors are recorded, thus being continuous data but with many zeros. Aiming to reduce the dimensions of the seven variables, I have carried out a principal component analysis. I was wondering if this methodology is appropriate for this kind of data set, or whether it is preferable to use other methods such as NDMS or PCoA.
