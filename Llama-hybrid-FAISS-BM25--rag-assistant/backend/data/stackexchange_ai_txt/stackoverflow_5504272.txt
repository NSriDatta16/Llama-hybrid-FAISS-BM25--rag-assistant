Ruby regular expressions: negative matching

I was wondering if it was possible to use negative matching on whole words, so that something like [^( .*? )] would match everything but text between (and including) ... . I was thinking about using negative lookahead, but I don't think this will work, as I need to check for the opening as well. Of course, I could just use the positive regex and then subtract the matches from the original text, but I'm looking for a more 'elegant' solution. thx for any help
