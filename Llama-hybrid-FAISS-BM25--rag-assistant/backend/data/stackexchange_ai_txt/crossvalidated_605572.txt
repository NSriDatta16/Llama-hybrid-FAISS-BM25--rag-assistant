Referring to the documentation and the original paper of the method, the authors applied independent filtering setting p-values to NA for genes which do not pass the filter step. That is what the documentation says about it: The results function of the DESeq2 package performs independent filtering by default using the mean of normalized counts as a filter statistic. A threshold on the filter statistic is found which optimizes the number of adjusted p values lower than a significance level alpha (we use the standard variable name for significance level, though it is unrelated to the dispersion parameter α ). The theory behind independent filtering is discussed in greater detail below. The adjusted p values for the genes which do not pass the filter threshold are set to NA. http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#independent-filtering-of-results You can remove the option by setting independentFiltering to FALSE in the results function. Also, following the documentation: The results function automatically flags genes which contain a Cook’s distance above a cutoff for samples which have 3 or more replicates. The p values and adjusted p values for these genes are set to NA. At least 3 replicates are required for flagging, as it is difficult to judge which sample might be an outlier with only 2 replicates. This filtering can be turned off with results(dds, cooksCutoff=FALSE) . What you can do here it's to set cooksCutoff to FALSE to see whether your genes are outliers or if they did not pass the independent filteringstep. I bet the latter is more likely to occur. However, I will give you some good practices learnt from my own use. It is strongly inspired by the workshops I gave in my lab. Even if DESeq2 is a very powerful tool to assess differential expression between two or more conditions, it is often a bad practice to use it as "black box". I will provide a "ready-to-go" tutorial, to present you, what kind of parameters you can play on, for which purpose. Before going any further, the tool was designed for balanced or unbalanced design. Except if you suscept some contamination for certain replicate, we can expect stable expression levels for replicates within the same condition. If you do suspect contamination, removing the replicate should be the best thing to do. Anyways, we assume that that the gene expression for the gene i in the sample j follows a $$NB(\mu_i, \alpha_i)$$ Since the data are often overdispersed, one of the main task of DESeq2 is to correctly estimate the overdispersion parameter. To do so, authors provide an empirical bayesian method to "shrink" dispersion estimate to the fit curve. Indeed, using only about 10 replicates to estimate overdispersion is not enough to obtain stable estimates, authors use all the available information from all genes to stabilize estimation. That is what you can see from this: You can change the model to fit the red curve, i.e., to adjust your model to your data. It is the first step to do (second actually after checking whether your data are over dispersed) before going any further. Then, if you have a small number of replicates by condition (which is your case here), I strongly recommend to use shrinkage methods to obtain your LFCs. One major advantage I see to use it, it's to correct your estimates when variance is high or little information is available for one gene, making the LFC comparable across a large range of designs. Again, you have different methods leading to different results. Here just an example of "unadjusted" LFCs versus "shrink" LFCs when normal distribution is used as prior. Regarding your question on Cook's distance, one thing you could do, if you suspect leverage for some gene, is simply plotting the Cook's distance for each gene and see what you can conclude. Anyways, you can find whether your gene is considered as an outlier and the Cook's distance using mcols(DEA_matrix). However, I do not expect that outliers play a key role in your case since all steps in DESeq2 was designed to reduce low count impacts on variance estimation. Finally, I cannot strongly recommend you enough to read the original paper. It is very clear and present all the core concepts with a biological perspective.
