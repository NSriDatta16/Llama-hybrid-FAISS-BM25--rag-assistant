To add to the existing answers, if you are using R a simple way to proceed is to allow the ARMA errors to be modelled automatically using auto.arima() . If x is your time series, then you can proceed as follows. t This will fit the model $x_t = a + bt + e_t$ where $e_t\sim\text{ARMA}(p,q)$ and $p$ and $q$ are selected automatically using the AIC. The resulting output will give the value of $b$ and its standard error. Here is an example: Series: x ARIMA(3,0,0) with non-zero mean Call: auto.arima(x = x, xreg = t) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ar3 intercept t -0.3770 0.1454 -0.2351 563.9654 0.0376 s.e. 0.1107 0.1190 0.1145 11.4725 0.2378 sigma^2 estimated as 5541: log likelihood = -475.85 AIC = 963.7 AICc = 964.81 BIC = 978.21 In this case, $p=3$ and $q=0$. The first three coefficients give the autoregressive terms, $a$ is the intercept and $b$ is in the t column. In this (artificial) example, the slope is not significantly different from zero. The auto.arima function is using MLE rather than GLS, but the two are asymptotically equivalent. The use of a Cochrane-Orcutt procedure only works if the error is AR(1). So the above is much more general and flexible.
