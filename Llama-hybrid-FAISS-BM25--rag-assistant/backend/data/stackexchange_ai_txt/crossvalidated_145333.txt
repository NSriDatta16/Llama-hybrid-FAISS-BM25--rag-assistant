The concern with the first approach is that you use both aggregation and interpolation, and aggregation is a known risk in regression because of Ecological Fallacy. Thus, any interpretation that follows is subject to attack - and interpolation adds another degree of uncertainty. An alternative would be to just select the month during which the quarterly data point was drawn from - i.e. if the Q1 data observation was drawn from March, then drop the January and February data observations and keep March. Perform your analysis with four monthly data observations for each year, and then use interpolation to forecast by month. If you'd rather not simply drop data and/or would rather capture each observation's value somehow, you could attempt a moving average calculation or other smoothing techniques. For more about moving average and smoothing techniques: http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc42.htm The second option, like you mentioned, is to use interpolation (to obtain monthly data from quarterly data). This is reliable, but you usually need to justify why you use interpolation - and which scheme you wish to use (linear, cosine, cubic, etc.). If the quarterly data observations are simply snapshot measurements at a point in time, interpolation might not be your best bet. Interpolation would best be used if the quarterly measurements are representations of the entire quarter or if you have a reason to capture the difference between two quarters. So as an alternative, you could just repeat the raw values of Q1 for Jan, Feb, Mar, and so on for the other quarters.
