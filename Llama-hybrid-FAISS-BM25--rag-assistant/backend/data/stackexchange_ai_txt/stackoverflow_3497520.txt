Proper way to include files

I am trying to keep a somewhat organized directory structure as I plan to add more and more scripts. So lets say I have a structure like this: /src/main.py /src/db/ /src/api/ My main.py script will include certain classes from db & api folders as needed. I have the blank _____init_____.py files in each folder so they are included fine. But say I want to include a class from the db folder in a script in the api folder? Like I would need to back up one dir somehow? The api scripts fail when I have a line like this in them: from db.Conn import QADB I am on v2.6. Update: I have tried a relative import, but get this? from ..db.Conn import QADB ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
