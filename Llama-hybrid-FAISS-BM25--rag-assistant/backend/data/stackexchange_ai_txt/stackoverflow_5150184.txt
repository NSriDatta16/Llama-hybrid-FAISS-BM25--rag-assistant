Trouble filtering out fields w/ identical titles in MySQL, can't use DISTINCT

SELECT america, america_un, game, genre, id, platform, url FROM `main-games` ORDER BY tally_rank LIMIT 3 Basically my issue is that I may at times have two games (different data, just the same name) which have tally_rank-s which are one off from each other, giving me duplicates. Essentially what I'm wanting to do is make the game column distinct so it disregards any other games with the same name except for the first one I come across. So if I had "game1, game2, game2, game3", I would want the first game2 and would disregard the second one. Not sure how to do this since from what I can recall, DISTINCT is all-or-nothing in MySQL. EDIT: I should note I've used GROUP BY game on this, but it skips every other record (2, 4, etc.) for some reason. EDIT 2: Here is the correct order by tally_rank in the database: Knight's Contract Fight Night Champion The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky PopCap Hits! Killzone 3 What will happen is that the query will grab 1/3/5, and if I remove the "GROUP BY game", it grabs 1/2/3. Not really sure why "GROUP BY game" is skipping records.
