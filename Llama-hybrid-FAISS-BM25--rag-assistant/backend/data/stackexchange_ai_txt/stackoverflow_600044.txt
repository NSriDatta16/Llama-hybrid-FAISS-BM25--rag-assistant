Your solution is actually quite OK, but there are alternatives: If you are using Python 2.5 or higher, you can shorten the if statement: print 'Success' if data == 'True' else 'Fail' If you are finding yourself repeating the check often, you might consider writing a function for it to make it more readable: def is_true(mysql_boolean): if mysql_boolean == "True": return True else: return False # now you can use this: if is_true(data): # this is really going to be more than one line of code anyway. # or maybe a function call, in which your solution might be enough. print "Success" else: print "Fail" You can achieve the same thing with a dictionary, but I don't find this as elegant: mysql_bool = {'True': True, 'False': False} if mysql_bool[data]: print "Success" That said, what are you using to connect to the DB? There is probably a way to directly get a bool out of there. Please update your Question!
