Can Delphi dragging be "promoted" to docking?

I have a TPageControl whose pages are all various forms that are attached using ManualDock() . The user should be able to rearrange the tabs by dragging them, which works already. It should however also be possible to undock the docked forms. For now I have the following code: procedure TMainForm.PageControlMouseDown(Sender: TObject; Button: TMouseButton; Shift: TShiftState; X, Y: Integer); begin if (Button = mbLeft) and (Shift * [ssShift, ssCtrl] = []) and PageControl.DockSite then begin PageControl.BeginDrag(False, 32); end; end; If either the Shift or the Ctrl key are held down, then a docking operation will be started, otherwise the tabs can be rearranged by dragging them. Using the keys as modifiers is awkward though. Is there any way to cancel the active drag operation when the mouse cursor is outside of the tab area of the page control, and start docking the child form? This is with Delphi 2009.
