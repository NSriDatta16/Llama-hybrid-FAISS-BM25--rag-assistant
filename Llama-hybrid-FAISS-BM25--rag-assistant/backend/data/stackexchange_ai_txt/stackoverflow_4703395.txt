Silverlight application global data

I am re-making a Console game, that my boss made a considerably long time ago, in Silverlight. It's totally text based. In the Console version, each computer that had it installed had its own map, which was divided into a grid of rooms. What I want to do is make the map global; when anybody runs the Silverlight version, they will all see the same map. There is no changing that goes on in the map, only new rooms being added to the map. So, currently I'm storing all the data in IsolatedStorage , which is obviously not global. How should I store the data and retrieve it so that everybody playing can see the same map? If it helps any, the server that it will be hosted on is a linux server, and has MySQL.
