Suppose you have a treatment $X$ with unknown effect $\beta$ that could quite likely be (approximately) zero. For example, someone's currently doing a small trial of tannic acid to reduce viral load in Covid. I think you could reasonably ask, given the results of a trial: how likely is it that there's a (non-negligible) effect? â€‹ if there is a (non-negligible) effect, how big is it likely to be? The second question is the average conditional coefficient. It's unlikely to be the optimal summary -- you might really want to know the probability that the effect is greater than some 'clinically meaningful' threshold given that it's non-negligible -- but I don't think it's meaningless. If, for comparison, you had a full Bayesian model and a bimodal posterior distribution with one mode at zero, you couldn't really say it was universally meaningless to ask where the other mode was located. That said, I'm not arguing it should be a default summary of the output. In particular, if there are multiple variables in the model, it probably won't be a meaningful summary for all of them even if it is for one of them.
