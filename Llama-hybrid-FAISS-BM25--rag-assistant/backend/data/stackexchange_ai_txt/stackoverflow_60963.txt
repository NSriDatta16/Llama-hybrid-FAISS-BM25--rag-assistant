Here you go: Project size: about 1 million lines of code, 30 people Project time: 9 years Project life cycle: good old waterfall, due to big customers requirements, but with staggered delivery to the QA team - it is very difficult to be agile when you have customers commitments to large clients Project structure: we are organized in departments but we use CMMI to keep them in sync - we have stakeholders, work products, deviance procedures, etc. Project result: we've really improved with the implementation of CMMI and have delivered our last few releases on time every time -C.
