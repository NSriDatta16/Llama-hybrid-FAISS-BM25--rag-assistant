What are the null and alternate hypotheses? Will you use a left, right, or two-tailed test?

Ben has a coin which he claims is weighted in a way so that when he flips it, heads appears more often than 50% of the time. He tries to prove it to you by flipping the coin 100 times, which results in 60 heads. Test the claim that the population proportion of heads that result from flipping this coin is actually more than 50%. Use a 1% level of significance. Identify the sampling distribution you will use, what is the value of the test statistics, then find P-value. I know the level of significance is 0.01; I'm just stuck on how to go about finding the null and alternate hypotheses. $\rm H_0$ : would it be μ = 60, since that's the average of how many heads he got, and $\rm H_1: μ > 60$ ?
