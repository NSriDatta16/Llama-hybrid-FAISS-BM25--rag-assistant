I guess you may have boundary set wrong. The boundary should look like Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="--------A4D921C2D10D7DB" meaning - contain two less '-' characters. See the source of any email. The mail ending boundary - on the other hand - should probably look like ----------A4D921C2D10D7DB-- (again, see the source of any mail message. Or read the RFC, of course :)). I encourage you to use exisitng mailer classes, like Swift Mailer or PHPMailer . Why reinvent the wheel?
