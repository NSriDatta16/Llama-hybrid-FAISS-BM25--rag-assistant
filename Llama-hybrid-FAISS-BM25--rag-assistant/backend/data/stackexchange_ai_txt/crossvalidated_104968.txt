Linear regression on several trials of experiment

Sorry about asking such a basic question. Assuming I have data like this x Trial1 Trial2 Trial3 1 1.0 2.0 3.0 2 1.1 2.1 3.1 3 1.2 2.2 3.2 How exaclty to I regress my predictor variable x onto my data. I was thinking naively that I could just take the average of the data trials and get something like x y 1 1.1 2 2.1 3 3.1 for which I could simply use model . But I think I would introduce a bias by using the average. I was thinking instead to to create ordered pairs like (1,1.1), (1,2.0),...(3,2.2),(3,3.2). And use that for the regression but I'm not quite sure how to do this in a clean way in R. I was going to use data slicing and cbind a bunch of times, but I'm sure there is something better. An example of what I'm getting at The crux of my question is: how to do a regression model when you have data from mutiple runs of the same experiment. For example if I was looking at the temperature along a really thin metal wire (so its essentially 1-d), and then I mark off lenghts on this wire called x=0, x=1, x=2, ... x=total length. Then I take 10 temperature measuresments for each value of x. How do I create a regression model, which gives Temperarute as a function of length, i.e. T(x), given that I have 10 T values for each value of x?
