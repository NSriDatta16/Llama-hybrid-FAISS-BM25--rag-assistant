I think you'd be surprised how reasonably priced online storage is these days. Amazon S3 (simple storage solution) is $0.10 per gigabyte per month, with upload costs of $0.10 per GB and download costing $0.17 per GB maximum. Therefore, if you stored 20GB for a month, uploaded 20GB and downloaded 20GB it would cost you $8.40 (slightly more expensive in the European data center at $9). That's cheap enough to store your data in both US and EU data centers AND on dvd - the chances of losing all three are slim, to say the least. There are also front-ends available, such as JungleDisk. http://aws.amazon.com http://www.jungledisk.com/ http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=amazon%20s3%20clients
