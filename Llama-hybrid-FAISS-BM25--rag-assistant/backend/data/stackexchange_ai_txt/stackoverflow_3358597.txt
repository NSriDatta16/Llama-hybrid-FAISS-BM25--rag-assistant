Flash will work for what you described here, but you could do it effectively with the canvas tag. Now, Flash has a better development environment, since it has been around longer, but there are many tools for using javascript in various IDEs. I would go with HTML5/javascript as it will work better with your page, so, you can just integrate your application into any web page, and it fits in better than Flash will, IMO. If you want to get some ideas about SVG and canvas then you can get a basic idea at http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/talks/canvassvg/ . As to the development environment it would depend on how much you want to spend, and whether you want to have a drag and drop capability for UI components.
