The problem is that you're building you application to use UNICODE Win32 API's, but you're passing around non-UNICODE strings. You have two options: convert the msg string to Unicode using something like MultiByteToWideChar() . This is probably the 'right' way to do it, if a bit more complex because you need to deal with codepages and managing the buffers used for the conversion. you can force the ANSI version of the API to be used: MessageBoxA(NULL, msg, NULL, NULL); That's a simple workaround, if not elegant. Other options include only building the application to use Win32 ANSI APIs instead the Unicode APIs or changing the strings you pass around as LPTSTR and using the TEXT() or _T() macros for your literals. However, if you're reading non-Unicode data from files or elseswhere, then you still have to deal with the conversion at some point...
