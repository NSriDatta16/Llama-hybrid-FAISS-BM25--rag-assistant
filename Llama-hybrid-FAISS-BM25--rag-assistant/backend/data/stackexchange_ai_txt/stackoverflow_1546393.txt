According to the Java 4 API , The unsigned integer value is the argument plus 232 if the argument is negative; otherwise it is equal to the argument. This value is converted to a string of ASCII digits in binary (base 2) with no extra leading 0s. In reality, data storage is actually much more complicated. For efficiencies in processing, most data types are stored at word-boundaries, which means 4 bytes on 32-bit machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines. Arrays may be packed more closely, so that char [4] may end up using the same amount of "actual space" as char . Java is a virtual machine, and I'm not certain what memory architecture, if any, it uses.
