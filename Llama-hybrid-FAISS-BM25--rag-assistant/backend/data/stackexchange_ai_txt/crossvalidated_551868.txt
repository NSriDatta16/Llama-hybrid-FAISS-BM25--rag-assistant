The zero-inflated original logit has a single likelihood that represents the likelihood of all the parameters being estimated. There are not two likelihoods for the two portions of the model. There is a single estimation procedure over all the parameters. This is why at each iteration you see only a single likelihood. This is done by writing down the likelihood for all the parameters in a single expression and maximizing this value. The two components of the model are estimated simultaneously and depend on each other. It's not the case that each unit is used twice; each unit contributes exactly once to the likelihood. The /cut1, /cut2, and /cut3 in the output are the cutpoints in the ordinal logit model. See help ologit for more details. These are the equivalents of the intercept in a binary logistic regression. The probability that the linear predictor plus error falls between the cutpoints is the probability of receiving the corresponding value of the outcome (given that you are not in the inflation group).
