Why do you need to learn statistics for machine learning?

This maybe a very broad question. Please do not delete. However, I am curious on why do we need to learn statistics for Machine Learning? This is given that the software libraries used already have the ‘knowledge’ encoded. Of course, a general understanding of how things work under the hood, but other than that is there a need for a more in-depth understanding? Same question applies regarding inner workings of various models. How will a good understanding (including the maths) help?
