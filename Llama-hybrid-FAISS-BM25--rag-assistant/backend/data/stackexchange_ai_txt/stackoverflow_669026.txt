Is it good practice to use typographic quotes on web pages?

Lately I have been seeing an increasing number of design articles encouraging the use of typographic quotes (Curly Quotes) for use in web pages over straight quotes. While I agree typographically, that correct quotes are that much more appealing and add a nice touch to a design, I wonder if it is actually better practice from an encoding standpoint. I have found that these quotes do not copy and paste across documents as well, Do not necessarily scrape as well, and can end up with the annoying missing character symbol. Never mind when they are used in sample code blocks, I hate that. I am not very knowledgeable on text encodings so I am wondering if anyone has any advice on this subject? Is &quot; better or more reliable then &ldquo; Edit: This issue mainly applies to content areas, where or is semantically not the best option. Also, things like plurals and such.
