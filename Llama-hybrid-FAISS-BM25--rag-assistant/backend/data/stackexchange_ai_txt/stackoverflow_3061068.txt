Setting up Team System Load Test Agent correctly on a workgroup

I'm trying to start a load test on a rig. I've got three computers : Computer 1: Visual Studio Team System Test Edition Computer 2: Controller Computer 3: Agent The computers are part of a workgroup (not on a domain), the controller indicates that the agent is ready for testing. My problem is that when I try to run a test (from C1), it gets stuck in pending mode forever. Can anyony advise on how to solve that ?
