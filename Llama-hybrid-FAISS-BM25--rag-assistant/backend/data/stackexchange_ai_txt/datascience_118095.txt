Based on the problem you described, it sounds like you want to predict the total hours needed for a given set of work orders on a new car (Car 3) based on historical data. Since you want to predict a continuous value (total hours needed), a regression algorithm would be a good choice. One approach you can take to handle the large number of inputs is to use a feature selection technique to select the most relevant inputs (work orders) that have the most impact on the total hours needed. This will reduce the number of inputs and make the model more efficient. You can use techniques like Lasso regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest and Recursive Feature elimination etc for feature selection. Another approach is to use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal component analysis) which will reduce the number of input features by creating new features that are linear combinations of the original inputs. It's also worth noting that when you are dealing with a large number of inputs, it's important to have a large enough dataset to train your model effectively, otherwise, the model may not be able to generalize well to new data. In summary, you can use a regression algorithm to predict total hours needed, and use feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques to handle the large number of inputs.
