Remember that the & character has special meaning in xml (the start of an entity). You need to write your comment like this instead (annoying, I know): /// /// Initialises Drag &amp; Drop /// void initDragDrop() { } I might be wrong on this next point, but I don't think you can even use a CDATA section to avoid the entity, because it breaks the comments. You must type out the entire &amp; entity.
