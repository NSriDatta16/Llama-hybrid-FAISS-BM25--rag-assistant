Assumedly, you're talking about having the SQL Server Agent job refresh when you republish a package. This won't happen. The job just points at the package, and doesn't need to update whenever the packages do. If you deployed without any errors, the package run will be the latest published package. If you're publishing to the File System, you can go digging in %Program Files%\Microsoft SQL Server\90\DTS\Packages . There, you should see the updated dtsx files. If you're publishing to SQL Server, then you need to connect SSMS to your instance of Integration Services, expand the tree to your package, and hit Reports-->General . This will tell you the version number. Upon change/deployment, you'll see that number go up. You can also do select * from msdb.dbo.sysdtspackages90 to get the same info.
