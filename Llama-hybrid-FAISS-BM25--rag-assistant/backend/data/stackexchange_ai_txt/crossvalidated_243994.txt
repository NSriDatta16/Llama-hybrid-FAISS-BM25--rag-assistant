How to interpret R's auto.arima function alongside the ACF and PACF?

I have annual time series data for rice productivity for India from 1951 through 2008. I stored the data as a ts object in R and made the data stationary with one difference as indicated by > ndiffs(rice) [1] 1 My ACF and PACF for the first difference of the logarithm of the rice series log(rice) look like so: Observing the ACF and PACF indicates an ARIMA(2,1,1) process, but the auto.arima() function in R indicates an ARIMA(0,1,1) process. Has this got to do with the principle of parsimony? I'm not sure. Can someone please help me identify my model correctly? > auto.arima(log(rice)) Series: log(rice) ARIMA(0,1,1) with drift Coefficients: ma1 drift -0.7650 0.0191 s.e. 0.1115 0.0026 sigma^2 estimated as 0.006048: log likelihood=64.13 AIC=-122.27 AICc=-121.82 BIC=-116.14
