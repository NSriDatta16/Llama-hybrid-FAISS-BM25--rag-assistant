Create a div with color of your choice and add a button/image at the right most corner to close the section (make it go away). Initially this should be hidden and based on some response from user or some activity (probably using AJAX), you can change the innerHtml content of some element (inside that div) and make that bar visible. The closing button/image should again make that hidden when clicked. To give it an animated effect, you can use jquery hide and show features providing a timer value of your choice to make it look good and attract user attention. This should do the required task.
