I recently came across SFrames and GraphLab Create . These are libraries for Python that offer the kind of functionality you seem to be looking for From the Pypi site: "SFrame is an scalable, out-of-core dataframe, which allows you to work with datasets that are larger than the amount of RAM on your system." So think of it as the data manipulation functionality and API in Pandas but without puttin all the data in memory first. SFrame is free and open source as far as I know. On the other hand GraphLab builds on the SFrame functionality to provide algorithms for doing descriptive and predictive (machine learning) analytics on data that is stored in SFrames. GraphLab Create create is not free / open source, but has a free demo license. In any case, depending on how sophisticated your algorithms need to be, SFrame might suffice for you. Or if you require for instance a quick and dirty linear / logistic / ridge regression on your data, you can implement your self it on the SFrame with some simple SGD method, for example, and avoid having to pay for Graphlab Create license.
