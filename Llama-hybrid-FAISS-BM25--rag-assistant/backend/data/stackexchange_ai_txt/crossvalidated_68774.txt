Multilevel model with Hierarchical Bayes

I want to apply a multilevel model (random intercept random slope model) comparing Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian estimation. I am used to Maximum Likelihood estimation, however, the Bayesian estimation part is not perfectly clear to me. 1) Do I necessarily have to use Hierarchical Bayes estimation when I want to apply a multilevel model the Bayesian way? 2) And in turn, can I infer that a paper that has used a Hierachical Bayes estimation necessarily applied a multilevel model? Thanks for your help!
