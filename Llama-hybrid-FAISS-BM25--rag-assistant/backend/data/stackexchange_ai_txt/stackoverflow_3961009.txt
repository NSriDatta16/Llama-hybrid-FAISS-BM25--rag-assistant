First of all never ever cluster on a uniqueidentifier when using newid() , it will cause fragmentation and thus page splits, if you have to use a GUID then do it like this create table #test (id uniqueidentifier primary key defualt newsequentialid()) newsequentialid() won't cause page splits Still an int is still better as the PK since now all your non clustered indexes and foreign keys will be smaller and now you need less IO to get the same numbers of rows back
