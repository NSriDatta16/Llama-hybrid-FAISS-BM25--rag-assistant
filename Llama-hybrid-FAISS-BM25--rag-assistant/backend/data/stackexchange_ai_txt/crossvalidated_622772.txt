Appropriate tests and normalization approaches for highly non-normal data

I'm trying to ascertain whether a particular type of article, $T$ , is associated with higher engagement scores in academic journals, and how substantial the effect size might be. I have raw data of engagement figures for every article published in one year period for 10 different journals. The first thing to note is that the data is highly skewed - most articles get low engagement, some get huge traction. It is not normally distributed, nor does any obvious transform seem to make it so. A histogram from 6872 articles from one journal (shown below) has median engagement 2, mode 1, mean 13.3 and a max of 15984. In this example, there is only one article of the particular type, which just so happens to have the max engagement score. The second highest score for comparison is 2676. Secondly, while different journals tend to be broadly similar, some trend higher on engagement in general by virtue of being bigger journals with wider interest. I was thinking that one way of looking at this might be to normalise the data in some way for each journal - for example, the one article of type $T$ accounts for 17.48% of all engagement, while the remaining engagement (82.58%) is shared over the other 6871 articles, yielding an average contribution of 0.012% per article of all other types. While I could in theory do this for each journal, given the highly non-normal nature of the data, I'm not convinced that a typical parametric test would hold - and in each journal, the articles of interest are rare (usually 1-5 per journal year) so does anyone know any good ways to approach this question? Very open to suggestion...
