How do I "unpair" two regressors from one another that are from a common subject in a linear mixed-effects model?

I'm building a linear mixed-effects model, and I'm not sure how to best structure my data. I was forced to collapse the response variable for each of the three conditions, so I am not even sure that it is possible to do what I'd like. Details below. I have 6 conditions (0, 20, and 30%, each @ X3=0 or 1), and I effectively have 1 response/condition/subject. Let's call this Y. I have 3 predictors, but for each of these predictor variables, I have 6 trials/condition/subject. However, two of the predictors are not necessarily "paired"; that is, they were collected at different times (both different from one another and at a different time than Y), but under the same conditions. Let's call X1 and X2 the "unpaired" variables and X3 the variable that is paired with both X1 and X2. Ideally, my model would look something like: Y ~ X1 + X2*X3 + (X1 + X2*X3 | subject) However, I do not know how to effectively structure my data so that X1 and X2 become "unpaired". Is this possible? If so, how can I structure my data in R to do this? I'd rather not average X1 and X2 if I don't have to, but I am starting to think that this is my only option. Thank you! **** EDIT FOR CLARITY **** This problem can be simplified if we get rid of X3. It will also be easier if we consider the data in the following format, which repeats for each subject: subject Y X1 X2 1 Y1 X1_1_1 NA 1 Y1 X1_1_2 NA 1 Y1 X1_1_3 NA 1 Y1 X1_1_4 NA 1 Y1 X1_1_5 NA 1 Y1 X1_1_6 NA 1 Y1 NA X2_1_1 1 Y1 NA X2_1_2 1 Y1 NA X2_1_3 1 Y1 NA X2_1_4 1 Y1 NA X2_1_5 1 Y1 NA X2_1_6 1 Y2 X1_2_1 NA 1 Y2 X1_2_2 NA 1 Y2 X1_2_3 NA 1 Y2 X1_2_4 NA 1 Y2 X1_2_5 NA 1 Y2 X1_2_6 NA 1 Y2 NA X2_2_1 1 Y2 NA X2_2_2 1 Y2 NA X2_2_3 1 Y2 NA X2_2_4 1 Y2 NA X2_2_5 1 Y2 NA X2_2_6 1 Y3 X1_3_1 NA 1 Y3 X1_3_2 NA 1 Y3 X1_3_3 NA 1 Y3 X1_3_4 NA 1 Y3 X1_3_5 NA 1 Y3 X1_3_6 NA 1 Y3 NA X2_3_1 1 Y3 NA X2_3_2 1 Y3 NA X2_3_3 1 Y3 NA X2_3_4 1 Y3 NA X2_3_5 1 Y3 NA X2_3_6 This is what I mean by "unpaired" â€“ $X1_{ij}$ and $X2_{ij}$ do not correspond with one another because they are measured during different trials. I could aggregate them (mean over $j$) to get $X1_i$ and $X2_i$ for a given $Y_i$, but then I lose out on a lot of information about uncertainty. I am not even sure that regression is the best approach. Another approach that I'd considered is permuting all combinations of $X1_{ij}$ and $X2_{ij}$ to get a "point cloud" around each $Y_i$, but I am also unsure if this approach is valid, or even best. I hope this clarifies!
