I don't see a problem with this, though it's a little bit heavy-weight for simply associating the data (you're only associating the data and not using data binding or update notification.) There's slightly less overhead with a simple Dictionary cache, but using a DP does give you the benefit of the DP going away if the ToolBarTray goes away (since the DependencyObject provides the storage.)
