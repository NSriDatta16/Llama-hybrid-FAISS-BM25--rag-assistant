I would take a look here as it seems to answer your question pretty well. Not the most elegant solution, but it does work: http://www.jakpsatweb.cz/css/css-vertical-center-solution.html EDIT: the horizontal centering can be accomplished either by setting the parent div's width to 100% with a "text-align: center" defined, or via auto margins.
