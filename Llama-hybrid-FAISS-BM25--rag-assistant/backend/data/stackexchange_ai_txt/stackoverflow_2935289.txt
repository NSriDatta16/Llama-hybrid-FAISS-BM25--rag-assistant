assuming a yield of 3 per hour, that's 83000 hours Given that there are only 18K unique tests, and 200 working days per person-year, then if you budget an entire day to develop each test, then a team of 9 full-time testers/people could develop 18K tests in 10 years (the KDE's KHTML and KJS projects began in 1998). These numbers are probably irrelevent (it may not take day to develop each new test case, and they may not have full-time/dedicated testers), but they do IMO illustrate that 18K tests over 10 years is feasible for a 'large' (or non-trivial), successful project. I'm using a similar test strategy in my project: not because I copied Webkit, but because it's the only way I think of to do automated-but-maintainable regression tests of a GUI. The following FYI is an example (one of the shortest/simplest examples) of one of my test cases. I generate it (and other like it) simply by manually exercising my browser's UI within a built-in test-case-generation framework. I can then run again later as an automated regression test (the framework replays the input and asserts that the output hasn't changed). I find that creating the test cases is not what takes a relatively long time. > clientSize 20 10 + screenDisplays lines 0 ---------- ---------- > loadDocument lines 5 ---------- Easy title Hello world.
