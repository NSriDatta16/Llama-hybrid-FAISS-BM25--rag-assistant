Rails 3, shallow routes

In rails 2.x I used shallow routes, but this seems to be missing from rails 3 (at least in the API http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/Resources/resources ). When I pass this option in rails 3 it doesn't throw any errors, but I'm also not getting all of the routes I expected. Rails 3 routes.rb resources :users, :shallow=>true do resources :recipe do resources :categories do resources :sections do resources :details do end end end end end The routes missing that were generated with the rails 2.x equivalent are (just a sample for the recipe resource): GET new_recipe (I only have new_user_recipe), and POST recipe (to create a new recipe, I only have POST user_recipe) It kind of makes sense that these routes wouldn't be generated, but my old code worked around it by passing the user_id in each form (less elegant, agreed). Question is: Is there documentation for 'shallow' routes in rails 3? Is there a way to generate the routes I'm missing from rails 2.x? Thanks, Mike
