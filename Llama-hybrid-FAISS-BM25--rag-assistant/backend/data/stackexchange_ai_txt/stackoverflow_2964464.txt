Number 2 is the best you can do for now and for the foreseeable future. First, the language attribute is deprecated in the HTML 4.01 specification and the draft HTML 5 specification , and omitted from XHTML 1.0 Strict , so options 1 and 3 are out. Second, do you need a type attribute at all? Yes. HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 specifies the type attribute as required while HTML5 has it as optional, defaulting to text/javascript . Therefore until HTML5 is finalised and widely implemented, you must have the type attribute if you want your HTML to be valid, which rules out the simple (I know this wasn't one of the original options, but it's something that I have seen recommended). Thirdly, what should go in the type attribute? As noted by Matthew Flaschen, the MIME type application/javascript registered in 2006 is intended to replace text/javascript . A quote from the relevant RFC : This document thus defines text/javascript and text/ecmascript but marks them as "obsolete". Use of experimental and unregistered media types, as listed in part above, is discouraged. The media types, * application/javascript * application/ecmascript which are also defined in this document, are intended for common use and should be used instead. However, IE (up to and including version 8) doesn't execute script inside a element with a type attribute of either application/javascript or application/ecmascript , so these are both unusable for the foreseeable future and we're stuck with text/javascript .
