There are two analogous areas in which you may be able to find pre-existing formulae. Water level measurements over time: it seems you are truly seeking a measurement similar to the most common water level over a given time period. Farming and geological sites will have loads of equations related to that for you to convert easily. The second one is network bandwidth billing. A common billing measure is to take the 90th %ile of of average usage as the billable amount. This allows for the exclusion of brief spikes throughout a given time period. Asking the web about water levels over time, or bandwidth utilization measurements should yield you a lot of substantial results.
