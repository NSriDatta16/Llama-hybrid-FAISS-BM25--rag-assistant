One possible approach is to use pretrained word embeddings like word2vec ( https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/ ), which map a word to a real-valued vector in a high-dimensional space, and then use clustering techniques (k-means, etc.) to assign words to categories.
