Is this evidence my random forest model is over fit?

I am investigating win probabilities in cricket and calculating the chances of winning a game depending at what stage the game is at. I created a logistic regression model and a random forest model. When I tested the models on a random game I got the following plot They both follow the same broad trend but the random forest is a lot more variable. I am just trying to understand the causes of this and what I can do to improve it?
