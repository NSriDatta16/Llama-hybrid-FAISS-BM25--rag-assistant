Finding correlated set in a basket of non-stationary series

Suppose I have 10 variables: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, all of which contain non-stationary data - say for example daily prices from 1 Jan 2020 until present. Now suppose I pick one of these variables at random - say D. I can look at the correlation matrix to tell me which pairs are correlated and I may find that D and H have a correlation of e.g. .55. Supposing I am not happy with this correlation and would like something more correlated > .70. My question is this: is there a way to find a combination of these sets so that their combination (either via addition or subtraction) taken together and correlated with D, gives a correlation >= .7. The combination should not include D or the variable in question. So for example correlation of D vs 2A+H-7J >= .7. What methodology would you adopt? Can you use factor analysis / PCA or any other method? Thanks.
