Ruby on Rails add_column does not add that column to existing rows

I have created this migration in Rails: class AddSocialSecurityNumberToContactTable In my development database, which is a SQLite3 database, all the old Contact records gained the ss_number field, just nil. However, whenever I deploy the code with migrations, the old, pre-migration Contact records do not have a ss_number field. I have restarted the server and logged into the console and verified it both ways on both a production database (MySQL) and a staging database (MySQL). If, however, I create a new record in the console, it does show a ss_number field for the Contact object. >> a = Contact.find(1) => # >> a.ss_number ActiveRecord::MissingAttributeError: missing attribute: ss_number from /srv/www/domain/releases/20100727004056/vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/association_proxy.rb:217:in `send' from /srv/www/domain/releases/20100727004056/vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/association_proxy.rb:217:in `method_missing' from (irb):4 >> a = Contact.new => # >> a.ss_number => nil How can I make it so that all existing Contact rows have nil as their value after I migrate?
