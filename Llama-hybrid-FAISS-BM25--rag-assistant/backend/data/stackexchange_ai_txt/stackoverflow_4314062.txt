Suppose the dictionary contains n words of average length k , and the matrix contains m ² characters. Preprocess the dictionary into a prefix tree (aka trie). — O( kn ) For each position in the matrix, look up the strings across and down in the trie. — O( m ³) Total time: O(max( kn , m ³)) In realistic word-searches, the average length of words found in the matrix is more like k than like m , so the time taken would be O( k max( n , m ²)).
