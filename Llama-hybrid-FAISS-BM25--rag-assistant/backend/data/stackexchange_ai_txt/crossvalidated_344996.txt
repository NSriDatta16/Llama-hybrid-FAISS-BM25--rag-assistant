What are supervised learning and unsupervised learning from a connectionist point of view

The general concept of supervised learning and unsupervised learning is very clear. In supervised learning , the decision on the unlabeled data is done after learning a classifier using available training samples, as examples of supervised classifiers we have decision tree, neural network, support vector machine(SVM). Whereas, in an unsupervised system , the classifier does not have any labeled sample. In this later case, the classification is done by exploiting some criteria like Euclidean distance, a common example of the unsupervised classification method is the k-means cluster classifier. But what are these learning algorithms in connectionist?
