You can get what you want by using mapcat . I believe putting it into an actual Clojure set is going to de-lazify it, as demonstrated by the fact that (take 10 (set (iterate inc 0))) tries to realize the whole set before taking 10. (distinct (mapcat get-origlabels (range *song-count*))) This will give you a lazy sequence. You can verify that by doing something like, starting with an infinite sequence: (->> (iterate inc 0) (mapcat vector) (distinct) (take 10)) You'll end up with a seq, rather than a set, but since it sounds like you really want laziness here, I think that's for the best.
