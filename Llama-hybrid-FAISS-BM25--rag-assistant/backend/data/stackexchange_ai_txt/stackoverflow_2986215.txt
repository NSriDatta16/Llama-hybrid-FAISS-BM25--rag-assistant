Ignoring the commented out recursion, I don't think this should be an infinite loop - you are just doing some for-loops over finite results sets. However, it does seem like this would be really slow. You're looping over entire tables and then doing more datastore queries in every nested loop. It seems unlikely that this sort of request would complete in a timely manner on GAE unless your tables are really, really small. Some rough numbers: If H = # of entities in DepedencyArcHead and T = average # of tails in each DependencyArcHead then: _getListArcTailsWithCourse is doing about H*T queries (understimate). In the "worst" case, the result returned from this function will have H*T elements. _traverseForwards loops over all these results H times, and thus does another H*(H*T) queries. Even if H and T are only on the order of 10s, you could be doing thousands of queries. If they're bigger, then ... (and this ignores any additional queries you'd do if you uncommented the recursive call). In short, I think you may want to try to organize your data a little differently if possible. I'd make a specific suggestion, but what exactly you're trying to do isn't clear to me.
