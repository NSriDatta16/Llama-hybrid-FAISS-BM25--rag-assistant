Code flow visualization software

Is there any tool, free or commercial, that can generate flow visualization graphs for a C# method? It should be able to deal with decision points (maybe represent them as vertices) and with sequential code fragments (maybe represent them as edges). I know there are similar C/C++ and Java related questions, but I'm interested in C#.
