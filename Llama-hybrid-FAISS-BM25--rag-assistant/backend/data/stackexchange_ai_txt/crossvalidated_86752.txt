Frequency with repeated measures

I did an experiment in which I group objects based on machine learning. I then tested whether people group them in the same way. Each subject (I had 30 subjects) watches 8 sets of 3 objects. In each set, 2 of the objects are grouped together according to ML, and one is not (subjects are unaware of this). For each set, subjects are asked to group 2 of the three objects that to them are the most similar. I guess I cannot use chi-squared, because the measure is repeated (8 times) for each subject. The McNemar's Test is usually used in different settings. What would be the most appropriate measure? According to this , I'd go for t-test, with $\text{mu}=\frac{1}{3}$, but: if the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test gives me that the distribution is not normal, I couldn't proceed with t-test; I don't know if there's something better suited to the problem.
