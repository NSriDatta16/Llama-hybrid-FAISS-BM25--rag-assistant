A HashTable is a really simple concept: it is an array in which key and value pairs are placed into, (like an associative array) by the following scheme: A hash function hashes the key to a (hopefully) unused index into the array. the value is then placed into the array at that particular index. Data retrieval is easy, as the index into the array can be calculated via the hash function, thus look up is ~ O(1). A problem arises when a hash function maps 2 different keys to the same index...there are many ways of handling this which I will not detail here... Hash tables are a fundamental way of storing and retrieving data quickly, and are "built in" in nearly all programming language libraries.
