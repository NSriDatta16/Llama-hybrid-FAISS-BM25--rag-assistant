My own answer to this, which I'll add to over time. Use BIDS Helper ( http://www.codeplex.com/bidshelper ) Remember that package configration settings read from the registry are taken from HKCU. This has an impact if you run the job from the SQL Agent, as you have to remember that these settings are applied against this user. For Bulk Data transfer of large volumes, ensure you select 'Table Or View - Fast Load' on the destination. In general for large volumes, read up further on settings on the destination to help you tune the performance. Package Storage - MSDB vs File System - Unless you intend to take advantage of the SSIS security options, its almost always better to use the File System (see http://pragmaticworks.com/community/blogs/nayanpatel/archive/2008/11/13/what-are-the-advantages-disadvantages-of-storing-ssis-packages-to-msdb-vs-file-system.aspx )
