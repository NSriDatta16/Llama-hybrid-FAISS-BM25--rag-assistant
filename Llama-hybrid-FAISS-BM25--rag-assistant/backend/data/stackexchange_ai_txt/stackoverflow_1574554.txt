How to utilize ASP.NET current user name in SqlParameter without code-behind

How do I get to the current users name without doing it in the code-behind, just using the aspx server tags? In code-behind I can just do this: Label4.Text = User.Identity.Name.ToString() But I'm trying to do it without code-behind like this: 1. "/> 2. "/> 3. "/> 4. "/> 5. ' /> 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. ' /> I get the username displayed for lines 6, 7, and 9 but I really want to set a property of a control to this value and not just display it on screen. Is it possible? Background: I was whipping up a quick app, dragging and dropping controls on the page, and it turned out that I did it with only having 1 line in code-behind of the page(s). That line was setting the value of a hidden field to the current users name in page load so I could pass the value of that control as a param of a sqlparameter. So I thought that since I was going this route (lots of stuff in aspx that maybe shouldn't be there) I should try to be consistent with it. I don't normally do it this way, but wanted to this time
