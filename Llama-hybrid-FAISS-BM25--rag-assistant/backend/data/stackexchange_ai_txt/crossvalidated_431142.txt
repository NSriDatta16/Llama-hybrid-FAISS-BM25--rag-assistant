The reference you included mentions this: The bootstrap is based roughly on the law of large numbers, which says, in short, that with enough data the empirical distribution will be a good approximation of the true distribution. Visually it says that the histogram of the data should approximate the density of the true distribution. This should give you the first hint that your example is probably not a good idea - the empirical distribution of a single data point is probably not a reasonable approximation to the "true" distribution, whatever that is. Rubin's wonderful The Bayesian Bootstrap is a little more specific about some assumptions of the classical and Bayesian bootstraps: ...is it reasonable to use a model specification that effectively assumes all possible distinct values of X have been observed? Both the [Bayesian Bootstrap] and the [classical] Boostrap operate under this assumption. (p.4, Section 5; "Discussion of Model Specifications") This should indicate in a straightforward way, I think, that your example is not a valid application of the bootstrap - unless the support of your random variable contains only $x_0$ , your inference is making some curious model assumptions. You may very reasonably point out that that's a surprising model specification - for example, it will never be satisfied for any continuous distribution! Rubin would, I think, agree with you, and point out that there's no quick fix here, along with the fact that blindly applying the bootstrap in all cases will hardly be a guarantee of good results. This assumption may be "close enough" for many cases, but a reasonable sample size and coverage over the support of the random variable are necessary to invoke a technique like this. He memorably concludes that article by noting that Serious data analyses should always include serious consideration of model constraints...although the bootstrap and the BB may be useful in many particular contexts, there are no general data analytic panaceas that allow us to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps. (p. 5).
