The final estimator (i.e. final step in the pipeline) may be a transformer, but it does not have to be. It could be a classifier instead. Hence the final step may transform , but it can predict . For the case of the last step being a transformer, pipelines support a method called fit_transform . See the referenced documentation and linked User Guide for more details.
