From everything that I've used, jQuery is by far the best tool for the job. It offers an easy-to-use syntax and a nearly endless supply of plugins that solve exactly the problem of dragging and dropping things around a website. A very good first base to check is jQuery UI . It enables a lot of functionality and very rarely is there a case that requires something more advanced than jQuery UI can offer. If you find one, there's probably a plugin already covering that too.
