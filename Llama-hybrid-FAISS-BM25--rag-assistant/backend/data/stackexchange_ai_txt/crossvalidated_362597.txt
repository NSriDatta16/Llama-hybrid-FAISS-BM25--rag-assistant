Computation complexity and processing of one image for object detection in Convolutional Neural Network

How do I relate compute complexity in Convolutional Neural Network to processing time of one image in object detection for a given CPU/GPU's processing power? Say my CNN architecture needs 'parameters to tuned': 20984, 'compute_complexity': 0.039456 GFLOPs, 'memory_req': 12.109375MB . Then I have a workstation with processor Intel® Xeon(R) CPU E5-1660 0 @ 3.30GHz × 12 and RAM 16G. Nvidia GPU is P4000 Quadro with 1792 GPU cores. If i use CPU only in detection, how can I ESTIMATE processing time for one image in object detection. If I use GPU, how can I ESTIMATE processing time for one image in object detection.
