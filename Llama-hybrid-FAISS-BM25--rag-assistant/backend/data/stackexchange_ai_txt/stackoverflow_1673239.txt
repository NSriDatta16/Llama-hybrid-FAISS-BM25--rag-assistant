It's up to LINQ to SQL to do the right thing here. I would expect it to convert two "where" clauses into a single SQL clause with the two parts joined together with "AND". Try both - but I very much doubt you'll see any difference in the generated SQL. IMO you should always look at the generated SQL for anything non-trivial, but the way that LINQ works certainly encourages you to build up a large query by composing it out of small clauses - so I'd really expect it to Just Work.
