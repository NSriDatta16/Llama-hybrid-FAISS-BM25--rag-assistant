To get a top navbar in Magento, you need to add categories to your site in Admin -> Catalog -> Manage Categories. Once you have a few categories in the system, the top nav bar will appear. The banner system is part of Magento Enterprise's Rich Merchandising Suite. I'm not sure there is an analog in Community Edition. Thanks, Joe
