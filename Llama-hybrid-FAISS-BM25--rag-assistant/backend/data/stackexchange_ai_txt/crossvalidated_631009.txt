I recommend "Empowering statistical methods for cellular and molecular biologists," Molecular Biology of the Cell, 30:1359, 2019 as a brief useful reference, written by biologists who appreciate statistical issues. With count data like yours, Figure 2 of that reference shows that a generalized linear model (for example, a Poisson or negative-binomial model for counts) might be most appropriate. That said, with this type of design, this particular data set, and some care you might be able to accomplish what you want with something close to ANOVA. Your 20 images for each combination of condition and biological replicate are simply technical replicates. For inference on the effects of treatments, what you care about is the variability among the biological replicates. Thus you could consider the sum of all infected cells across the 20 images for each combination of condition and biological replicate as the outcome variable. That would give you 18 net observations (3 biological replicates for each of 6 control/treatment classes). I think that's what you are getting at. For ANOVA or related linear models to be valid, what's important is the distribution of residuals about the modeled means. In your particular data set, it looks like 100-200 counts for each of those 18 observations. With so many counts per observation and reasonable agreement among the biological replicates under each treatment, normality of residuals might not be a bad assumption, either on the counts themselves or on some transformation of counts (log or square-root transformations of counts sometimes help). In practice, a test of normality based on only 18 observations isn't going to be very useful, although you should evaluate the distribution of residuals around the modeled values anyway. You do need to deal with the matching among biological replicates. That might be what you are thinking about with respect to a "mixed model," which could treat the biological replicates as "random effects." With only 3 biological replicates, however, you can simply treat the biological replicates as fixed effects in the model, adjusting for baseline (WT/control) differences in the number of infected cells among the biological replicates. That's a generalization of a paired t -test. (I think that in a simple case like this, a fixed-effect and random-effect treatment of the biological replicates will provide essentially the same results.) In R, the general form of the model then would be something like: outcome ~ bioReplicate + condition where outcome is an outcome measure, bioReplicate is a 3-level factor keeping track of the biological replicate, and condition is a 6-level factor (probably with "control" as the baseline level). You then decide whether to use the sum of counts across the 20 images or some transformation as the outcome . If you use the sum of counts, you would also have to choose between a standard linear regression ( lm() ) or a generalized linear model suitable for counts ( glm() with family=poisson ), although with this large number of counts that latter choice probably won't matter much. There are other approaches that don't depend on an assumption of normality, as the answer from Robert Long explains. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test is a special case of a semi-parametric proportional-odds ordinal regression model , which trades off the normality assumption for an assumption about the association of the log-odds of a higher outcome with the predictor values. In a more complicated situation than yours, ordinal regression has the advantage that it can handle continuous predictors. I find that ordinal regression also more readily lends to comparisons among multiple treatments, although in this situation you could do repeated pairwise Kruskal-Wallis tests with correction for multiple comparisons.
