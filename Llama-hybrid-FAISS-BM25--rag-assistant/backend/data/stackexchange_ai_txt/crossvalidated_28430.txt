If the time series consists of 0s and 1s, the simplest statistics to compute are Proportion of 1s Proportion of 1s that follow 0s Proportion of 0s that follow 0s There is no need, of course, for the corresponding proportions as they are simply calculated from these. The latter two define the transition matrix for the associated Markov chain, and roughly correspond to autocorrelation measures. You might also look at run lengths (e.g., number of "111" or "000" relative to length of the series).
