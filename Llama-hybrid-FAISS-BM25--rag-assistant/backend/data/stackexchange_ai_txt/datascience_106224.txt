Not exactly sure what you want to achieve and in what kind of setting. There are some well-known loss functions which you might have a look at. One option is the Huber-Loss which avoids very large residuals for "high" values and thus can lead to a more balanced prediction. It is a mix of L1 and L2 loss. Another more flexible loss function is the " fair loss ", which can be tuned to some extent as far as I remember (it is not well documented). If Huber is just the opposit of what you want, you could try to "flip it around" and assign L1 loss logic to "low values" and L2 to high values. I tried to implement both Huber Loss and Fair Loss in XGBoost.
