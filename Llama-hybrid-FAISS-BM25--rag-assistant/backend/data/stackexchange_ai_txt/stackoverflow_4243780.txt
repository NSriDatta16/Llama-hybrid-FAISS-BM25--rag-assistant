If I get it right, you want to get the total number of lines which contain a particular PO number (EBELN). One way you can do this (not very elegant) is by looping at the internal table only where your condition is met and then reading the SY-INDEX variable. LOOP AT itab TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS WHERE ebeln = 'your purchase order'. ENDLOOP. IF sy-subrc = 0. total_lines = sy-index. ENDIF. Another way is by moving the corresponding fields which meet your criteria to another internal table and using DESCRIBE TABLE to get the number of lines.
