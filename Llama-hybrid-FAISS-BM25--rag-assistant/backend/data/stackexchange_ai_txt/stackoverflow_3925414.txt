Here's what I went with: module Ratable def self.included base base.has_many :ratings, :as => :target, :dependent => :destroy base.named_scope :rated, :joins => :ratings, :group => 'target_id', :select => "#{base.table_name}.*, avg(ratings.opinion) as 'average_rating'", :order => 'average_rating desc' end end
