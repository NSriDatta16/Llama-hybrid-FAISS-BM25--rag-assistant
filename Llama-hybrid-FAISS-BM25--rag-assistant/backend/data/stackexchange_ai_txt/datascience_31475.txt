Interpolation in nlp - definition of O term

Reading definition of interpolation below how are the O terms defined? Is this a value that is set manually? Example P( Sam | I am ) = count( Sam I am ) / count(I am) = 1 / 2 Interpolation using N-grams We can combine knowledge from each of our n-grams by using interpolation. E.g. assuming we have calculated unigram, bigram, and trigram probabilities, we can do: P ( Sam | I am ) = Θ 1 x P( Sam ) + Θ 2 x P( Sam | am ) + Θ 3 x P( Sam | I am ) ( original problem statement image )
