Cross-validation is primarily a method to tell you how bad a model is likely to perform in new data from the same "stream". Note that the optimism bootstrap is better because it validates the full sample fit and not a 0.9 sample fit as with 10-fold CV. To be as accurate as the bootstrap you need to repeat 10-fold CV 100 times and average. CV is not intended for developing another final model but for estimating the likely future performance of your original model (or at least for a 0.9 approximation of it).
