As part of some early prototyping I did on a personal project, I wrote quite a bit of code to do something like this. It doesn't take strings -- x86 opcodes are methods on an X86Writer class. Its not documented at all, and has nowhere near complete coverage, but if it would be of interest, I would be willing to open-source it under the New BSD license. UPDATE: Ok, I've created that project -- Managed.X86
