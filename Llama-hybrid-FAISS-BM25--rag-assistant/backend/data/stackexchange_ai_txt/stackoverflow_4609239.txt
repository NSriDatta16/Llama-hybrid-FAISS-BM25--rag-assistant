UIPickerView inside UITableView.tableFooterView doesn't receive drag touches

I have a UIPickerView in the footer of a table (from which I plan to issue "pagination"-style requests for the table--the picker will list the pages available of the LARGE data set I'm navigating, and let the user jump straight to any "page" of the data). My picker receives taps; if I tap on a row of the picker that isn't the selected one, it rolls into the center space of the picker. But if I drag my finger on the picker, I scroll the TABLE, not the picker contents. I tried installing a UIView subclass in my tableFooterView to see if I could catch touches, and I can... but not touches on the picker. Touches AROUND the picker do in fact fire that UIView subclass's -touchesBegan . But not ones on the picker itself.
