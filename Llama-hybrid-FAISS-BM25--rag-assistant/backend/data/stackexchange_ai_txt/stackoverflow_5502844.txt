Yes it's possible - you can disable touch/contact visualizations for any control or surfacewindow by calling ContactVisualizer.SetShowsVisualizations(ctrl, false); or by adding the following attributes to the XAML: xmlns:s="http://schemas.microsoft.com/surface/2008" s:ContactVisualizer.ShowsVisualizations="False" If you'd like to disable it for the entire application, add the following line to the appsettings section of the application's config file: As Robert correctly pointed out, for surface 1.0 you need to use the ContactVisualizer , for WPF 4 the class has been renamed to TouchVisualizer . Examples for the second one on MSDN can easily be adapted for surface 1.0 by changing Touch to Contact .
