Correlation is a statistical measure of how two variables, $X$ and $Y$, move in relation to each other. If the two variables are correlated, they move either in tandem, when they are positively correlated, or opposing directions, when negatively correlated. For example, the prices of equity stocks and fixed interest bonds often move in opposite directions; when investors sell stocks, they often use the proceeds to buy bonds and vice versa. In this case, stocks and bonds are (negatively) correlated, not cointegrated . Cointegration only measures whether or not the distance between the two variables remains stable over time. It doesnâ€™t say anything about the movement of $Y$ given a change, increase or decrease, in $X$. What this means is that $X$ and $Y$, provided they are cointegrated, cannot move in opposite directions for very long without coming back to an average distance eventually. Think about a person walking their dog; the entities don't necessarily move in a predictable manner/direction, but their distance remains more or less same (long run equilibrium) over time. This scenario is an example of cointegration, not correlation.
