I'm updating this to put the correct answer in. According to Train (see esp. equations 4.4 and 4.5), this should be calculated in two levels. The first (upper) level is the probability of the respondent picking the degenerate branch vs. the hospital branch. Let $W_{nk}$ represent the deterministic portion of the decision-maker's utility for branch-specific characteristics (maybe average costs of the hospitals, average distances, etc). If $\lambda_i$ is the coefficient on the inclusive value for any non-degenerate branch, then the probability of individual $n$ choosing a branch $B_k$ is $$pB_{nk}=\frac{e^{W_{nk}+\lambda_{k}I_{nk}}}{\sum_{m=1}^{K}e^{W_{nm}+\lambda_{m}I_{nm}}}$$ Because we assume that $W_{nk}=0$ when $k$ is the Home branch, and because we only have two branches, then $$pB_{home}=\frac{1}{1+e^{W_{nm}+\lambda_{m}I_{nm}}}$$ where $B_m$ is the hospital branch. The inclusive value, $I_{nm}$ comes from the lower-level probability estimation equation within the hospital branch. That is: $$I_{nm}=\ln\sum_{j\in B_m}e^{V_{nj}/\lambda_m}$$ where $V_{nj}$ is the deterministic portion of the decision-maker's utility for each individual hospital within the hospital branch (as compared to $W$ which is the utility for the overall branch itself)
