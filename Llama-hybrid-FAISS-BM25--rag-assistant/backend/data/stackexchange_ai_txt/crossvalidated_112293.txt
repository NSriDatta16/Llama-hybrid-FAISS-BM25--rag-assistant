Maybe this is not an answer, but it is too long to go on the comment. I do not have reference, but in your case i will suggest $\frac{1}{\sigma_i^2} \sim G (a,b)$ (note that i use the precision and not the standard deviation) where G is the gamma distribution. IN this way you can easily compute the full conditional for all the $\sigma_i^2$. For the hyperparameters i would use $M \sim N()$ and $S \sim IG()$, again with this choice you have closed form for the full conditional, if you want them non informative you can use distribution with high variance. For the parameters $(a,b)$ you can use the distribution suggested in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior at the gamma section. All the full conditional distribution can be derived in closed form and maybe you can compute exactly the posterior without MCMC algorithm
