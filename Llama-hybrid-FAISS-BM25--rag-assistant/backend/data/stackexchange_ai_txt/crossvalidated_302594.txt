This sounds to me like Association Rules . As defined by Wikipedia and cited from [0]: Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. The "strength" that has been calculated for the rule is equivalent to the concept of confidence. Other measures of interestingness for an association rule {X}⇒{Y} include: Support [1], a measure of how frequently the itemset X appears in the dataset as the antecedent/left-hand-side; Confidence [1], a measure of how frequently the association rule {X}⇒{Y} is true in the dataset; Lift [1], a comparison of the observed support to what would be expected if X and Y were independent; all-confidence, coverage, entropy, interest, leverage, etc. [2, 3].
