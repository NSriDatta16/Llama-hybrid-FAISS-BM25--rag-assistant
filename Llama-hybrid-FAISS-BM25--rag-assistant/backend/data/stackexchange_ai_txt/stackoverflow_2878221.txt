One thing that comes to mind was a possible difference in allocations of small blocks of memory. I have a vague recollection that VC6 used the small-block heap by default for values under 1016 bytes. This MSDN article seems to indicate that it was OS-dependent. But I think that it was not OS-dependent with VC6. In any case, if your application is malloc/free/new/delete heavy, you might test to make sure it does not result in fragmentation over time. Aside from that, I am not aware of specific issues. In a MSVC6 to VS2008 conversion I did in the last year, the bulk of the work was getting the thing to build (lots of ATL changes). Once it built, the test suites ran cleanly. So you might want to make sure that in the conversion they are using a good warning level (at least /W3). Ignoring warnings would be a good way to invite problems.
