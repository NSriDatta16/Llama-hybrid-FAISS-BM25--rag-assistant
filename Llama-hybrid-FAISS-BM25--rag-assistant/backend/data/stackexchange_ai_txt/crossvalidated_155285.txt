A very simple solution would be to calculate a binomial confidence interval for the observations within each score bin. Naturally, if you'll increase the number of bins, you'll also increase your uncertainty regarding the probability of success within each bin, resulting with wider confidence intervals. If you prefer a continuous measure, I guess that you'll have to choose and fit a model such as logistic regression. Then the confidence interval would have to be derived from the standard error estimates of the model's parameters.
