How to get a file and move it out of the isolated storage?

I want to take a file that stored already in the isolated storage, and copy it out, somewhere on the disk. IsolatedStorageFile.CopyFile("storedFile.txt","c:\temp") That doesn't work. Throws IsolatedStorageException and says "Operation not permitted"
