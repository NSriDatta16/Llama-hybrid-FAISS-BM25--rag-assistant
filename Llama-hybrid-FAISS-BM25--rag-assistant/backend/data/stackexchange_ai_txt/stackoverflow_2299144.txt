The best thing to do is to define your own constant that you can reference from anywhere else in your app. For example, you can put something like this in MyAppDirectory/public_html/index.php: define('APPLICATION_PATH', realpath(dirname(__FILE__).'/..')); This will give you a consistent reference back to MyAppDirectory/ regardless of where index.php is called or included from. Defining your own constant not only allows you to call your application from cron or through the browser like you want, but will also allow you to change your storage structure in much larger ways with minimum changes to track down. Zend Framework uses this heavily with its Zend_Application bootstrap process, and googling for "php APPLICATION_PATH" will provide you with a variety of further references.
