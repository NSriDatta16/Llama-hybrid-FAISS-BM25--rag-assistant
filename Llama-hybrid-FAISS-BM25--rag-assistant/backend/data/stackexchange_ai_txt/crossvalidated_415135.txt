Think of it this way, there is a one-to-one correspondence between $$\sum_i^n y_i^2\quad \text{and}\quad \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n y_i^2$$ The latter is clearly the average of $y_i^2$ which measures the magnitude of each $y_i$ . Hence in some sense measures the measures the magnitude of the components of $\bf{y}$ . Since there is a one-to-one correspondence, $\bf{y^Ty}$ $=\sum_i^n y_i^2$ also measures the magnitude of the components of $\bf{y}$ . Since the components of $\bf{y}$ are not necessarily i.i.d we should note that the weak law of large numbers does not necessarily hold. This is simply a heuristic explanation.
