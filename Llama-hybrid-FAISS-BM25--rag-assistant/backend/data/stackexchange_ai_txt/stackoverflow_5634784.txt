C# MS Chart Control - highlight today's date in Gantt Chart

The title of this question says it all. I've got a gantt chart (RangeBar) made using the MS Chart Control, and at present I have some StripLines to highlight weekends and the start of each month, but I need one to appear on today's date only so the user can see where we are at the mo. Is this possible with this control, or am I fishing for unicorns? If it's possible, how? Cheers
