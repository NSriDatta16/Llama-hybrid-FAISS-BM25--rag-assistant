Normally the Java EE security model will not allow the retrieval of the user password, for security reasons. But it depends on the implementation. Some vendors provide methods to retrieve this kind of information, but if you rely on such implementations, be aware that the portability of the application will be compromised. One common approach is to write a servlet filter to intercept the login request and save a copy of the credentials, to be used later. If your application doesn't use the Java EE security infrastructure, this could be easily implemented. That's because some vendors prevent you from filtering an authentication servlet.
