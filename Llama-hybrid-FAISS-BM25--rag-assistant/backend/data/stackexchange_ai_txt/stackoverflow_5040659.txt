Alright, it seems a lot of whining about a simple issue that I still believe my old answer clarifies. Anyway, let me babysit you. :) First : I find out that you cannot really go to the "previous" page from the first page. Ideally, I should. So, here is a bug that I have filed you may want to follow: https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/391562790938294?browse=search_50fcac3ce094e7068176315 Second : If this is by design, you cannot go back to "previous" from the first page (because there is no previous), but you can surely go to "Next". However, since the API behaves as a cursor, and you have moved forward, now your "previous" page would work. The answer to the question: I'm getting a URL as previous page and I don't know how to make a javascript FB.api call from that URL. Any ideas? yes, you can make FB.api call. But I suggest you to make a HTTP GET call instead, because it's easier. Also, note that previous may return and empty array like {"data":[]} How to get previous/next page? Here, I am writing a small code that uses jQuery. In case you do not want to read the code, there are two ways: Use previous/next URL and make HTTP GET request. Which, if not empty, will come with next set of "previous", "next" link. Parse the URL, and get the query-string as JSON ans pass it to FB.api . I used jQuery BBQ pluging for parsing. Important Note: In the example, I am using "next" URL because on the first request if I use "previous" it gives empty JSON instead of giving posts from the past. However, I can use use "previous" URL once I have moved ahead a few pages. Like Google results, you can not go previous on page 1, but you can from any page > 1 (see Example 3 below). This is called pagination. Example 1: Code using HTTP GET (preferred): (I will load 3 posts/page and look three next-pages) var i =0; var getPosts = function (response){ for (element in response.data){ post = response.data[element] console.log(post.id + ": " +post.message); } // can i call FB.api(nextPage, getPosts); ?? if(i window.fbAsyncInit = function() { // init the FB JS SDK FB.init({ appId : 'XXXXXXXXXXXX', // FILL YOUR APP ID HERE! status : true, // check the login status upon init? cookie : true, // set sessions cookies to allow your server to access the session? }); // Additional initialization code such as adding Event Listeners goes here }; Load Posts Please open developer console to see what's happening.

Refer: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/ Paging When querying connections, there are several useful parameters that enable you to filter and page through connection data: limit, offset: https://graph.facebook.com/me/likes?limit=3 until, since (a unix timestamp or any date accepted by strtotime): https://graph.facebook.com/search?until=yesterday&q=orange The following should get all the posts since last week until yesterday from 21st - 30th message (basically, third page of 10 message per page pagination). FB.api( '/me/home', { 'since':'last week', 'limit': '10', 'offset': '20', 'until': 'yesterday' }, getPosts ); I've just tested, it works. I have used limit=4, which is page-size kind of thing. So, when I fetch data since Feb 02, 2011 (Unix Time Stamp: 1296626400) till today using this https://graph.facebook.com/me/home?access_token=[AUTH_TOKEN]&since=1296626400&limit=4 It returns the data, plus it also return URL to go to next page { "data": [ ], "paging": { "previous": "https://graph.facebook.com/me/home?access_token=[NEW_AUTH_TOKEN]&since=1298026753&limit=4", "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/me/home?access_token=[NEW_AUTH_TOKEN]&limit=4&until=1298023222" } } You can safely use previous and next attributes of the JSON object to jump to next page (or previous page). This seems to be the easiest way to do. By the way, \u00257C needed to be converted to | to get this to work.
