Calling doc.NewPage() doesn't do anything when there's nothing on the current page. There are at least 3 options: 1) Add something invisible to the current page. An empty paragraph, some white space to the PdfContentByte, whatever. 2) Tell your PDF document "no, its really not empty, take my word": PdfDocument.PageEmpty =false; 3) Don't throw when NewPage returns false. That's perfectly acceptable under the circumstances. I'd go with #3 personally.
