Update a single property of a record in Entity Framework Code First

How can I update a single property of a record without retrieving it first? I'm asking in the context of EF Code First 4.1 Says I have a class User, mapping to table Users in Database: class User { public int Id {get;set;} [Required] public string Name {get;set;} public DateTime LastActivity {get;set;} ... } Now I want to update LastActivity of a user. I have user id. I can easily do so by querying the user record, set new value to LastActivity, then call SaveChanges(). But this would result in a redundant query. I work around by using Attach method. But because EF throws a validation exception on Name if it's null, I set Name to a random string (will not be updated back to DB). But this doesn't seem a elegant solution: using (var entities = new MyEntities()) { User u = new User {Id = id, Name="this wont be updated" }; entities.Users.Attach(u); u.LastActivity = DateTime.Now; entities.SaveChanges(); } I would be very appriciate if someone can provide me a better solution. And forgive me for any mistake as this is the first time I've asked a question on SO.
