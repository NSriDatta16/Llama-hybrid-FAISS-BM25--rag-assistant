It is not possible if you want the divs to stay in their current x,y, (and most importantly) z - only the "top" layer is clickable. Addendum post OP edit: Think of CSS layout as if you were physically working with bits of paper (this is much easier to visualise if you give all your "layer" divs a different background colour). The rendering engine cuts out a bit of paper in the dimensions you give it (or it works out) for each element it finds. It does this in the order it encounters them putting each bit of paper on the page as it goes - the last item is going to be on top. Now you've told the rendering engine to put your 3rd div in a position where it overlaps the 2nd. And now you expect to be able to "see" the covered content. Wouldn't work with paper, won't work with HTML. Just because it's transparent doesn't mean it's not taking up space. So you have to change something. Looking at your CSS and markup (which honestly could be cleaned up, but I'll assume there's other mark-up you're not showing us which justifies it) there's a couple of easy win ways: 1). Set a z-index of -1 on Layer3 - z-index is how you can change the layering order from the default (as encountered). This just moves the entirety of Layer3 below the rest of the page so what was hidden becomes exposed, but also vice versa depending on content. 2). Change the width from 100% to e.g. 80%, or more likely given your use of pos:abs set left:0px and right:199px; (I'm guessing that padding-left on Layer2 is an intended column width?). The cost of this is that your Layer3 is no longer 100% width 3). Google "CSS column layout" and find a pattern that reflects what you need and adapt that. Every CSS layout which can be done has been done a million times already. Standard techniques exist which solve your problems. CSS is hard if you haven't built up the experience, so leverage the experience of others. Don't reinvent wheels.
