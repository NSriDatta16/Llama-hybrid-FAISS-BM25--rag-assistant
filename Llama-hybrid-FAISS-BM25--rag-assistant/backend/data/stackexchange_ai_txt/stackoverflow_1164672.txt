Almost certainly not Hibernate related but simply down to the precision of a double. There are numerous questions already on SO about this topic, but essentially you are trying to compare to 51.6371154785156, for example, and the internal storage of this value may not be exactly equal to this. If you want to store these coordinates to a fixed precision, consider a decimal data type which offers this capability, which will also then fix your select problems. Example: When should I use double instead of decimal?
