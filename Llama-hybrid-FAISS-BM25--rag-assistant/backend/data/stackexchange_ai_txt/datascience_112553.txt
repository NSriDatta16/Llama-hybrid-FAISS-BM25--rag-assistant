How does factoring probability distributions help?

I'm trying to make sense of machine learning and am reading Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. In section 3.14 they show an example of factoring a distribution then say "These factorizations can greatly reduce the number of parameters needed to describe the distribution." What does that mean? Equation 3.52 p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(b|a)p(c|b) still has all three variables on both sides. They say something about representation "reducing the cost of representing a distribution" but what representation are they talking about?
