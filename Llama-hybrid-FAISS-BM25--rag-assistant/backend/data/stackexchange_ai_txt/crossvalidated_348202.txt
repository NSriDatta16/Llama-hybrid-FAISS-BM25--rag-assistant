What is the use of the log of the sum of exponents in machine learning

I want to understand why somebody would use log sum exponent trick. I am reading this blog . But I don't really understand the first paragraph. It says Let's say we have an n-dimensional vector and want to calculate: $$y=\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}$$ But my question is why would you want to compute that value in the first place?
