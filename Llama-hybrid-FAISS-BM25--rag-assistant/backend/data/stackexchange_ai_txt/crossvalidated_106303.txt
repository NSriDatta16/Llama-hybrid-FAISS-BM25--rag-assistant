To deal more specifically with the "'battery' of univariate logistic regressions on all the variables" than @Michael's excellent answer: If the purpose of fitting a model is to make predictions, then it's unclear why you're so concerned with "significance" † - (validated) model performance is what's important, & this will rarely be improved by selecting a model based on a single predictor & ignoring all the others. If the purpose is to estimate individual coefficients for each predictor (perhaps for tentative identification of causes) then you want to control for the effects of other predictors, which you don't by looking at each in its own separate model. If the full model's too big for the data, then data reduction on the predictors prior to fitting & shrinkage methods such as ridge regression can improve its predictive power more reliably than stepwise. Read some good books on how to build predictive models: Harrell (2001), Regression Modelling Strategies Steyerberg (2009), Clinical Prediction Models Steyerberg et al. (2000), "Prognostic modelling with logistic regression analysis: a comparison of selection and estimation methods in small data sets", Statistics in Medicine , 19 , pp 1059-79 is especially relevant to the situation you describe. † And there's no sense at all in performing hypothesis tests after stepwise procedures.
