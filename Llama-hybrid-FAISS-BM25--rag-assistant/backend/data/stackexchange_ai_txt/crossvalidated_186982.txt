Bagging : parallel ensemble: each model is built independently aim to decrease variance , not bias suitable for high variance low bias models (complex models) an example of a tree based method is random forest , which develop fully grown trees (note that RF modifies the grown procedure to reduce the correlation between trees) Boosting : sequential ensemble: try to add new models that do well where previous models lack aim to decrease bias , not variance suitable for low variance high bias models an example of a tree based method is gradient boosting
