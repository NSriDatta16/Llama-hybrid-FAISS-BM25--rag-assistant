A "moderator" affects the regression coefficients of $Y$ against $X$: they might change as values of the moderator change. Thus, in full generality, the simple regression model of moderation is $$\mathbb{E}(Y) = \alpha(M) + \beta(M)X$$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are functions of the moderator $M$ rather than constants unaffected by values of $M$. In the same spirit in which regression is founded on a linear approximation of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, we may hope that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are--at least approximately--linear functions of $M$ throughout the range of values of $M$ in the data: $$\eqalign{ \mathbb{E}(Y) &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 M + O(M^2) + (\beta_0 + \beta_1 M + O(M^2))X \\ &= \alpha_0 + \beta_0 X + \alpha_1 M + \beta_1 MX + O(M^2) + O(M^2)X. }$$ Dropping the nonlinear ("big-O") terms, in the hope they are too small to matter, gives the multiplicative (bilinear) interaction model $$\mathbb{E}(Y) = \alpha_0 + \beta_0 X + \alpha_1 M + \beta_1 MX.\tag{1}$$ This derivation suggests an interesting interpretation of the coefficients: $\alpha_1$ is the rate at which $M$ changes the intercept while $\beta_1$ is the rate at which $M$ changes the slope . ($\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ are the slope and intercept when $M$ is (formally) set to zero.) $\beta_1$ is the coefficient of the "product term" $MX$. It answers the question in this way: We model the moderation with a product term $MX$ when we expect the moderator $M$ will (approximately, on average) have a linear relationship with the slope of $Y$ vs $X$. Of interest is that this derivation points the way towards a natural extension of the model, which might suggest ways to check goodness of fit. If you are not concerned with nonlinearity in $X$--you either know or assume that model $(1)$ is accurate--then you would want to extend the model to accommodate the terms that were dropped: $$ \mathbb{E}(Y) = \alpha_0 + \beta_0 X + \alpha_1 M + \beta_1 MX + \alpha_2M^2 + \beta_2 M^2X. $$ Testing the hypothesis $\alpha_2=\beta_2=0$ evaluates the goodness of fit. Estimating $\alpha_2$ and $\beta_2$ could indicate in what way model $(1)$ might need to be extended: to incorporate nonlinearity in $M$ (when $\alpha_2 \ne 0$) or a more complicated moderating relationship (when $\beta_2 \ne 0$) or possibly both. (Note that this test would not be suggested by a power series expansion of a generic function $f(X,M)$.) Finally, if you were to discover that the interaction coefficient $\beta_1$ were not significantly different from zero, but that the fit is nonlinear (as evidenced by a significant value of $\beta_2$), then you would conclude (a) there is moderation but (b) it is not modeled by an $MX$ term, but instead by some higher-order terms beginning with $M^2X$. This might be the kind of phenomenon to which Kenny was referring.
