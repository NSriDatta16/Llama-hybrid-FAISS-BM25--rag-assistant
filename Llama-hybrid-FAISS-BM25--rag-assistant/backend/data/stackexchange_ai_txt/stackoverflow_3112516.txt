Is ADO.NET Entity Framework (with ASP.NET MVC v2) a viable option when writing custom and contantly updated websites?

I've just finished going through the MvcMusicStore tutorial found here . It's an excellent tutorial with working source code. One of my favorite MVC v2 tutorials so far. That tutorial is my first introduction to using ADO.NET Entity Framework and I must admit that most of it was really quick and straight-forward. However, I am worried about maintainability. How customizable is this framework when the customer requests additional features to their site that require new fields, tables and relationships? I am very concerned about not being able to efficiently execute customer's change orders because the Entity models are basically drag-and-drop, computer generated code. My experience with code generators is not good. What if something goes haywire in the guts of the model and I'm unable to put humpty-dumpty back together? In the long run, I wonder if using hand typed models which human-beings can read and edit is a more efficient course than using Entity Framework. Has anyone worked enough with entity framework to say that they are comfortable using it in a very fluid development environment?
