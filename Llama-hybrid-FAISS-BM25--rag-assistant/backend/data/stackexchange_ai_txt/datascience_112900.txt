How can I implement classification for this problem?

I have been thinking about the problem of "predicting" damages awarded in legal cases. For specificity, let us be given a dataset of summaries of cases of a certain flavour (say discrimination cases) that have been binned in a fixed number of "bands" by ranges of damages awarded. Then is it possible to train a custom model to be able to read the facts of a case as reported by an aggrieved party and predict which bin it would fall into should the plaintiff win. My first thought is unsupervised text clustering via NLP. Is there something more efficient that can be used here?
