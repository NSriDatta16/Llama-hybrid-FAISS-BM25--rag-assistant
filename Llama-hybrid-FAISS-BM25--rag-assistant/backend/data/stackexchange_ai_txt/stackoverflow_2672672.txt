@Divya mohan Singh, you would like Cacti to detect your agent then you should go after Cacti itself. Once you know which OIDs are expected by Cacti, you can implement them in the agent and then everything should be ok. If you have time you may implement as many SNMP objects within the agent as possible, but if Cacti only relies on a few of them, you may take the easy way to implement on the few it asks for. Well, it may sound like that I am encouraging you to develop an SNMP agent that does not comply to the RFC words, but the truth is that many agents already break the rules, and yours will not be the last one. :)
