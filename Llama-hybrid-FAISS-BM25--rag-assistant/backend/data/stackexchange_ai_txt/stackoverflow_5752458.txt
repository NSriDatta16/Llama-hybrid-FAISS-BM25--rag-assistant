Prevent JWPlayer from loading JWPLAYER.SWF multiple times for multiple instances

I am using the JW Embedder with JWPlayer to embed 3 videos on a page. (I'm pretty sure the sitatuion would be the same if using SWFObject to do the embedding. To my horror (!) when looking in Fiddler I saw 3 downloads (HTTP Status 200) for jwplayer.swf which is an unnecessary 200kb. Obviously what's happening is that the javascript for the embedder just spews out the code to instantiate the flash object and then the browser initiates 3 requests for the 100kb jwplayer.swf file. It isn't clever enough to wait for jwplayer.swf to load and then use it for the 2 other players. How can I make sure that jwplayer.swf is only loaded once.
