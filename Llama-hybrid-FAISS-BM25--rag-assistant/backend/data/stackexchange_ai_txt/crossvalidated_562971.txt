My advice: Create regularly-spaced time series. Start with monthly. In some cases, there may be multiple price changes during the month and you can only use the last one. In other cases, there may be no price change in a month so its value will be the same as the previous month. This is all OK. Can do the same but with a weekly time series. Put aside xgboost for now and use and exponential time smoothing method that is able to select and fit terms for level, trend, and seasonality. I don't really recommend ARIMA. For the weekly time series, seasonality is a little more complex and you can try TBATS. Take a step back and decide if forecasting prices accomplishes what you need, and if you can provide alternative or additional value forecasting sales, or forecasting for a larger portfolio of products. Perspective and scope are critical.
