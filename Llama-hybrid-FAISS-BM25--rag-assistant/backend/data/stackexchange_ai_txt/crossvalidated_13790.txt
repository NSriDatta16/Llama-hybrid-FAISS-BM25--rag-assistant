The composite variable Your algorithm for calculating scale scores seems fairly standard. Do you have a question about it? In most cases whether you take the mean of all items in the scale or whether you create subscale means and then take the mean of the subscales, both options are likely to give similar answers where the number of items per subscale is similar. Estimating correlations between latent variables Structural equation modelling adjust estimates of correlations between latent variables for reliability of measurement estimated from the intercorrelation between the items and the model. Manually calculating scale scores (as you appear to be doing) and correlating these scale scores does not involve such an adjustment. As such you are correlating observed variables, you are not estimating the correlation between latent variables. Many researchers, probably the majority, report correlations between observed variables. So, if you adopt this statistically simpler approach, you would be in good company. However, if you are particularly interested in estimating correlations between latent variables, then I would encourage you to explore structural equation modelling approaches. An alternative approach is just to adjust the correlation based on some estimate of reliability of the two variables (see this discussion ). Correlations on scales based on likert scales See this answer by @chl on whether to treat likert scales as interval or ordinal . My opinion is that once you are summing over a reasonable number of items, treating the data as interval is typically useful.
