Finding most statistically distinct text across classes

I want to find the most statistically distinct phrases in texts across different classes, where the texts have already been classified. Suppose I have ~100,000 short text documents, where each document has a label. Let's say I have 100,000 text messages labeled with the gender of the author (male or female). I want to find what words are most associated with each gender. I am trying to do something similar to this. I have tried combining all classes into one document and running TF-IDF, but this doesn't work very well, as the total number of documents is just 2! My next plan is to try logistic regression with word counts as my features and look at the coefficients for each word. Are there standard techniques for this type of problem or are there other things to try?
