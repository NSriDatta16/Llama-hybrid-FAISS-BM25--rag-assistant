"which kind of trees are used?" This depends on implementation. Generally, any bootstrap-aggregated attribute-bagged learner based on trees (any of them) is called Random Forest. You get different flavors using different trees. "CART, C4.5 or C5.0 etc. or all of them?" Any of those can be used to grow a forest. On the last point, though ( "all of them" ), I can't see how much useful it would be. The point of Random Forests is aggregating nearly random generalizations to build a strongly informative one, and I don't think using different tree algorithms would improve this aspect of forests much.
