How do i update this textarea plugin with .live()?

i've been working on this for more than hours and hours and i cant figure it out. I've downloaded this textarea expansion plug in over here http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/07/29/build-auto-expanding-textarea-1/ and it works. But i am creating a dynamic page that adds textareas after the document is ready and i cant find a way to modify the plug-in so that it will apply to future textareas. I am fairly new to jQuery but i really need help. Thank you so much! Also, on a sidenote, i had some trouble with the textareas themselves. How do i make it so that the textarea is able to interpret line breaks when the user hits enter/return. So far it just parses out the text as a single string with no breaks. For jQuery, i was basically taking the value of the textboxt with .val() and placing on a paragraph somewhere. That paragraph happens to be only a single line with no line breaks. Any ideas?
