what is meant by minimizing and maximizing in GANs?

It is a subtle change that involves the generator maximizing the log of the discriminator probabilities for generated images instead of minimizing the log of the inverted discriminator probabilities for generated images. This is a very tricky and confusing line to understand GANs loss functions, it is taken from machine learning mastery blog. My question is about the terms minimizing the log of the inverted discriminator probabilities, isn't the subtraction of probabilities from 1 give you same thing (referring to the formula of this part of loss function). please clarify it with some kind of analogy or example of some sort.
