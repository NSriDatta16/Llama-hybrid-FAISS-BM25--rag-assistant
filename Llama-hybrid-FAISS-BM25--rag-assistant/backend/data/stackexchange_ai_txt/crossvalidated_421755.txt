Is there an algebra error in this derivation in a Coursera class of the posterior of a Normal with a Student-distributed mean?

This is a screenshot from Coursera's class "Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models", Week 1, "Non-conjugate models" lecture (any one can audit the class and access the materials for free): This is a repeat class, so there have been lots of eyeballs on it, and therefore I assume it is correct. However, the exponent in the last-but-one line is quadratic in $y$ , while in the last one it is linear in $y$ . How can this be correct? Did they just make an undetected mistake here or am I missing something really basic?
