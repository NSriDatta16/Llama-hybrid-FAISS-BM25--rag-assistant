How to analysis multiple measurements of the same process with MARSS package?

I'm trying to estimate the parameters for A multivariate time series using the MARSS package in R. The default model in MARSS is $$x_t = B x_{t-1} + w_t$$ $$y_t = Zx_t + v_t$$. The problem is that, instead of having the continuous measurement $y_t$ for $t\in(0,1000)$ , I only have continuous observation from two measuring sessions, that is, $t\in(0,400)$ and $t\in(600,1000)$. This means that I can not concatenate the data in a single MARSS model. However, I don't want to do the analysis using two independent models on each session and then average the results. So what should I do to share the model parameters across the two sessions such that I can simultaneously estimate the parameters using both data? Should the two sessions be the same length?
