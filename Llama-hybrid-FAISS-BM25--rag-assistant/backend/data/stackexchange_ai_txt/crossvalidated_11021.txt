Resume buzz words

It has come to my attention that companies will rank resumes based on buzz words and only look at those that have high scores assuming enough people submit for the position. I don't like this system but still want a job, so instead of inserting these meaningless terms into my actual resume I've compiled a list of such terms and am going to incorporate the list into my resume in a text box with white text. The problem is that I don't know how those scoring engines work (is there an application most employers use?) and so I can't be sure if I should maximize the terms I put in, if I should repeat terms, or if I should maximize the effective terms put in because number of words matter. I have entered my resume on Rezscore with and without the buzz word metadata and found my resume score significantly lowered with buzz words because it was so verbose. Does anyone have more knowledge of these resume ranking systems?
