In the paper, Page 4, it says: ...The detected cysts were then classified with texture descriptors based on Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Gabor filters and by using classifiers such as Naive-Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Random Forest (RF) with 10-fold cross validation . The comparative evaluation in [21] indicates that GLCM + SVM and Gabor + SVM have segmentation accuracies of 0.8293 and 0.8244, respectively... They do not specifically talk about it anywhere else in the paper, but the precision/recall mean/std values in the table you've shown were most probably calculated via these validation folds, i.e. an array of 10 precision values, and mean/std of them for example.
