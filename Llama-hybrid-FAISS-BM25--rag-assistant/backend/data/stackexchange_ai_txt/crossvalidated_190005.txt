Can I use linear model on each variable to determine which variables are important?

Suppose we have a n*p matrix X and a n*1 matrix Y, where n is the number of samples and p is the number of variables. p>>n. Also suppose this data is from a biology field experiment. My goal is to select the potential biomarkers (variables). I know there are a bunch of variable selection tools, such as stepwise procedure, criterion based methods and other methods that are nested with the algorithms (random forest, PLS, SVM etc.). But I think the aim of these methods is to build a model to make a good prediction accuracy, FOLLOWED by telling people in this model, which variables are relatively important. In my opinion, because my goal is not to predict but to select the possible biomarkers which will be confirmed in further experiments, can I simply do linear regression between each variable and Y and see which are significant and also have a high R^2 score? Thank you! I understand this is not a simple answer question. Please provide a relatively thorough description of your idea.
