Using Random Forest Probabilities for customer sensitivity

I am trying to build out a customer sensitivity model to price increase. My hypothesis is that as "Annual Fee" to a product subscription increases so will the probability of a customer to churn. I am planning to initially build out a classifier model with output as 0 - (Does not churn) and 1 (Churn). For each percent increase in annual fee the probability of churn should also increase. Can I use a classifiers proba function for this kind of analysis? For eg: If a customer is given 5% increase and the output of classifier is 1 and probability is 60% then for my next data point, keeping everything constant and just changing the increase from 5% to 10%, I want to see that output of the classifier is again 1 but has a higher probability (higher than 60%) I will really appreciate any help input on this!
