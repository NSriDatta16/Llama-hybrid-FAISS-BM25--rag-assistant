Endogeneity and omitted variables

Assume you observe the time series x and construct the time-series a, b and c. Then, you argue that x causes y = f(a,b,c), where f is known and non-linear. The relation in contemporaneous. You regress y on x and get high correlation. How do you support the causality hypothesis? Does it make sense to regress y on x, a, b, and c? What does it mean if you get R2 close to one and x is significant?
