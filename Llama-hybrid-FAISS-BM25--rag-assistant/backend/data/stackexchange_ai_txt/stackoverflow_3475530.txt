The fragment cannot be seen from the server-side, it can only be accessed by client-side scripts. The way it's usually done is that the server-side generates a non-parameterized page, which is then modified by scripts in accordance with the fragment parameters. The scripts could make AJAX requests with query parameters, where the AJAX responses are generated by JSF using beans controlled by the parameters. If you absolutely want the server-side to have access to the fragment parameters when rendering the page itself, you need to reload the page with the parameters as query parameters instead. EDIT: To reload the page you could use this code: if (window.location.hash != '') { var newsearch = window.location.search; if(newsearch != '') { newsearch += '&'; } newsearch += window.location.hash.match(/#?(.*)/)[1]; window.location.hash = ''; window.location.search = newsearch; }
