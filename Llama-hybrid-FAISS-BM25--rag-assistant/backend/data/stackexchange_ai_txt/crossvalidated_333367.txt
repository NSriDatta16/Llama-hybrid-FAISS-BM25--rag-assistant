I think in the setting of MCMC the term transition probability refers to the probability of transitioning from one point to another, which should be the $P(\theta'|\theta)$ term in your fist equation and the $Q(\theta'|\theta)=P(\theta'|\theta)\alpha(\theta'|\theta)$ term in the second. The goal of sampling algorithms is to generate samples from a known (unnormalized) distribution. As you said $Q(\theta'|\theta)$ should be easy to compute, however it's usually not easy to be sampled from. That's why we need a proposal distribution (to be easy to sample from) and an acceptance probability (to satisfy the detailed balance).
