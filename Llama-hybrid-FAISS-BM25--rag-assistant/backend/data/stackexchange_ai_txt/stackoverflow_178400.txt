I've relied heavily on Billy McCafferty's NHibernate Best Practices article / sample code for many Web / WinForms applications now. It's a wonderfully written article that will provide you with a good solid sample architecture -- in addition to teaching you basic NHibernate and TDD. He tries to give you an overview of his architecture and design decisions. He creates a very elegant DAL using generic DataAccessObjects which you can extend for each domain object -- and its very loosely coupled to the BL using interfaces and a DAOFactory. I would recommend looking at the BasicSample first, especially if you haven't worked with NHibernate before. Note, this article relies heavily on NHibernate, but I think the general approach it could be easily altered to suit other ORMs.
