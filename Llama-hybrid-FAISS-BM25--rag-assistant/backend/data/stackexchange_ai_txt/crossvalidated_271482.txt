I would like to use an example to answer your question. Suppose We have some data points, $(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),\cdots, (1000,1000)$, can we (now we use human learning not machine learning...) learn a function from them?, We may say, yes, it should may be $y=x$. Now, do we have infinite data points and learned a function? No, we only have very limited number of data points, but we learned a function from it. We may also feel our approximation is pretty accurate, since all the data we have seen is perfectly fit our approximation. From the example we learned, sometimes, the function we want to learn in real world may not be super complicated and few data points are sufficient. An other example, suppose we want to learn a function to describe human height and weight, do we need all human's data? or some sample should be good enough?
