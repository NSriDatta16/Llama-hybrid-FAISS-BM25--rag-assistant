Your approach is basically how I would do it. I would just remove the setter for the Status property: public StatusEnum Status { get { return _Status; } // set { _Status = value; } } and instead add a function public SetStatusClean() { _Status = StatusEnum.Clean; } As well as SetStatusDeleted() and SetStatusPurged() , because I find it better indicates the intention. Edit Having read the answer by Jon Skeet , I need to reconsider my approach ;-) For simple objects I would stick with my way, but if it gets more complex, his proposal would lead to much better organised code.
