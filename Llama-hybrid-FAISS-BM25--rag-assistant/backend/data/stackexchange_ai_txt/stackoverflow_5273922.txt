I had this exact same issue, however setting my browsers user agent to Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_6; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.127 Safari/534.16 did the trick for me. I'd try again if I were you, the "Access Denied" error may just have been a coincidence?
