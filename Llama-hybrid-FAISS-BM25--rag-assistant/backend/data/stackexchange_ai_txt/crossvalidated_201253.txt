value of discrete items when only have their value when sold in groups

I'm doing an analysis for my job and would greatly appreciate any help you can offer! My company sells pallets full of items. Each item has a category (1 category per item, many items per category) and each item has a retail value. We are liquidators so the pallets get sold for much less than the sum of the retail values they contain. In the model I'm building, the sale price of an item predicted by its retail value ($V$) and it's recovery rate ($R$, the percentage of retail for which the item sells). This means that a pallet sale price ($P$) should be $P = \sum{V_i \times R_i}$ where the index $i$ is iterated over every item in the pallet. Given a large data set with a large number of $P$, and also the $V_i$ that correspond to each $P$, I am trying to find some average $R_i$ for each category - or some way of measuring this $R_i$ or even describing it at all. Any ideas?
