Embedded interactive shell in IPython

Before switching to IPython v0.11 (using Python 2.6.1), it was possible to embed an interactive IPython shell using for example this , e.g. from IPython.Shell import IPShellEmbed ipshell = IPShellEmbed() ipshell() # this call anywhere in your program will start IPython "The embedded shell has been refactored into a truly standalone subclass of InteractiveShell called InteractiveShellEmbed . All embedding logic has been taken out of the base class and put into the embedded subclass" (see here and here ). The way I understand it you should now be able to simply start a console by import IPython IPython.embed() However, this raises TraitError: The 'exit_msg' trait of an InteractiveShellEmbed instance must be a string, but a value of u'' was specified. If we pass a string for exit_msg by IPython.embed(exit_msg='Whatever') Then it raises a different error AttributeError: 'InteractiveShellEmbed' object has no attribute 'set_completer' Did anybody else encounter this problem? Otherwise this might be a bug since it is a developer version after all.
