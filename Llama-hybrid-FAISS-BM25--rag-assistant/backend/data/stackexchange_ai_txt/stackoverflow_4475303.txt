Yes. Person.organization_set.all() should return the list of organisations to which the Person in question belongs. For each organisation in that set, you can then return their position, so: p = Person.objects.get(id=personid) for o in p.organization_set.all(): # you have o and p, you should be able to find a unique m. m = Membership.objects.get(Person=p, Organization=o) See the documentation here .
