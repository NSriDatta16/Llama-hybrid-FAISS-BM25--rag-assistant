What does "stochastic" mean in RBM networks?

I am learning about restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). It is still unclear to me why it is a stochastic algorithm. I was wondering if some one can explain it with comparison to deterministic ones (like autoencoders). For example, here says RBM shares a similar idea, but it uses stochastic units with particular distribution instead of deterministic distribution.
