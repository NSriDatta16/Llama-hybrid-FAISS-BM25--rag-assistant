Magento DataFlow Integration and Module Development Resources?

Does anyone have any good resources for developing Magento Modules that integrate with their DataFlow component? I need to build a product/inventory/order synchronization system and am finding it difficult to dive into. I've done quite a bit of digging, but can't seem to find much in terms of documentation, tutorials, examples, etc. What resources did you other Magento development gurus utilize when learning the platform?
