There are 2 points which I found in favor of not using mean square error : We donâ€™t use linear regression approach in logistic regression but a probabilistic one because linear regression simply does not fulfill the same role. The least squares criterion for fitting a linear regression does not respect the role of the predictions as conditional probabilities, while logistic regression maximizes the likelihood of the training data with respect to the predicted conditional probabilities. Additionally, the predictions from linear regression can be any real number, which negates their use as probabilities. We cannot use the same cost function that we use for linear regression because the Logistic Function will cause the output to be wavy, causing many local optima. In other words, it will not be a convex function eg: Instead, if our cost function for logistic regression uses log-likelihood then it becomes convex: Source: https://www.internalpointers.com/post/cost-function-logistic-regression
