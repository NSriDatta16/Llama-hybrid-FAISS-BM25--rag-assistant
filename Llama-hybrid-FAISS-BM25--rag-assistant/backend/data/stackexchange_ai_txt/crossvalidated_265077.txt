To add to the discussion here, it is useful to ask what exactly is conditioned on in this "conditional" likelihood. The Fisher test differs from other categorical analyses in that it considers all margins of the table to be fixed whereas the logistic regression model (and corresponding Pearson chi-square test which is the score test of the logistic model) only consider one margin to be fixed. The Fisher test then considers the hypergeometric distribution as a probability model for the counts observed in each of the 4 cells. The hypergeometric distribution has the peculiarity that, since the distribution of the originating odds ratio is not continuous, you often obtain a different OR as a maximum likelihood estimate.
