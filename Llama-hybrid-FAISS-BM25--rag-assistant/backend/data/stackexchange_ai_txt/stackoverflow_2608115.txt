Gothic Medieval font that you can embed With Cufón?

I'm looking for a font in Gothic Medieval style that I can embed with Cufón . I tried with the Cloister Black .ttf file but the generator responded with: The file you uploaded could not be converted. Currently only TrueType (TTF), OpenType (OTF), Printer Font Binary (PFB) and PostScript fonts are supported. If you're sure the font is valid, it is likely that the author of the font has decided to not allow modification and/or embedding of the font. This can happen quite often especially with "freeware" TrueType fonts. You must contact the author of the font for a less restricted version.
