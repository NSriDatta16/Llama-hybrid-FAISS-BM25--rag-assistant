Are there methods for quantifying certainty in a non-logistic regression model?

I've been looking into certainty and how to calibrate classification models such that their predicted probability correlates well with their actual accuracy. I was wondering if such methods existed for continuous regression models. Is there a way to get a prediction from a cont regression model and also get the model's certainty?
