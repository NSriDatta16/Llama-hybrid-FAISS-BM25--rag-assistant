Javascript on Rails

Just started to experiment with HTML5 features and really like the localStorage. And now I wonder if it makes sense to create some libraries which make life easier. Something which easily persists objects from the localStorage to the server-DB. Something like a object.findAllByAttribute(Attribute) etc. So my question is: is there already something out there which helps me to write offline html5 applications? If not, would it make sense or am I thinking the wrong way?
