Bayesian is a sensible approach. However, if you're frequentists the intensity is still not zero even if you didn't observe any events. Suppose, your'e asked what is the probability of Sun not rising tomorrow ? You've been on Earth for 40 years, and it has always risen. So, from frequentist point of view the intensity is 1 in 40 years, as Laplace would suggest . Next year it will be 1 in 41 years and so on. Hence, you should set the intensity to 1 in whatever the scale is. For instance, if the scale is the lines of code, then $\lambda =\frac 1 {\text{lines of code}}$
