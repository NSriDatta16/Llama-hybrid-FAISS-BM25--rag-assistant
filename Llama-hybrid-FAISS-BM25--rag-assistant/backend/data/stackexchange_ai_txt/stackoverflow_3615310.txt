It's more so a degree of corruption of the terms. A byte is not inherently numeric in any form, it's simply a unit of storage. However, bytes, characters, and 8-bit signed/unsigned integers have had their names used interchangeably where they probably should not have: Byte denotes 8 bits of data, says nothing about the format of the data. Character denotes some data that stores a representation of a single text character. "UINT8"/"INT8" denotes 8 bits of data, in signed or unsigned format, storing numeric integer values.
