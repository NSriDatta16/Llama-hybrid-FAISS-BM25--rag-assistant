How to apply TFIDF in structured dataset in Python?

I know that TFIDF is an NLP method for feature extraction. and I know that there are libraries that calculate TFIDF directly from the text. This is not what I want though In my case, my text dataset has been converted into Bag of words The original dataset that I "DO NOT" have access to, looks like this RepID RepText ------------------ 1 Doctor sys patient has diabetes and needs rest for ... 2 Patients history: broken arm, and ... 3 A dose of Metformin 2 times a day ... 4 Xray needed for the chest... 5 Covid-19 expectation and patient should have a rest ... But my dataset looks like this RepID Word BOW ------------------------- 1 Doctor 3 1 diabetes 4 1 patient 1 . . . . . . 2 patient 2 2 arm 7 . . . . . . 5684 cough 9 5684 Xray 3 5684 Covid 5 . . . . . . What I want is to find TFIDF for each word in my dataset. I was thinking of converting my dataset into a unstructured format so it would look like this RepID RepText ------------------ 1 Doctor Doctor Doctor diabetes diabetes diabetes diabetes ... 2 Patients patients arm arm arm arm arm arm arm ... . . 5684 cough cough cough cough cough cough cough cough cough Xray Xray so each word repeated the same number of BOW but I do not think this is the best way to do as I convert a structured dataset into an unstructured one.. How to find the TFIDF from the structured dataset? is there a library or algorithm for that? Note : Dataset stored in MS SQL Server, and I am using Python code.
