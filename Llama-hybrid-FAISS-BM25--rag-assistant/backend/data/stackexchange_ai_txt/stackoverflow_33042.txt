How can I measure CppUnit test coverage (on win32 and Unix)?

I have a very large code base that contains extensive unit tests (using CppUnit). I need to work out what percentage of the code is exercised by these tests , and (ideally) generate some sort of report that tells me on a per-library or per-file basis, how much of the code was exercised. Here's the kicker: this has to run completely unnatended (eventually inside a continuous integration build), and has to be cross platform (well, WIN32 and *nix at least). Can anyone suggest a tool, or set of tools that can help me do this? I can't change away from CppUnit (nor would I want to - it kicks ass), but otherwise I'm eager to hear any recommendations you might have. Cheers,
