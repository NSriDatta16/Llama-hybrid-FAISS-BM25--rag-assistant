ARIMA(1,0,1) would be $$(1-\phi_1 L)x_t=(1+\theta_1 L)\varepsilon_t.$$ Then add the seasonal part to obtain SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1) $$(1-\Phi_1 L^{\text{freq}})(1-\phi_1 L)x_t=(1+\Theta_1 L^{\text{freq}})(1+\theta_1 L)\varepsilon_t$$ where $\text{freq}$ is the frequency of the time series (e.g. 4 for quarterly data, 12 for monthly data). Also look here for the general case and here as well.
