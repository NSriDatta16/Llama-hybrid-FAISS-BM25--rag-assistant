You can consider this a regularization technique and in general it is a great idea to reduce your feature space to reduce overfitting. Moreover, since you are using random forests it increases the chances that each individual tree will get some important feature instead of "garbage" one which can be important if you don't construct a large number of trees. This is, however, a balancing act and you might want to experiment with number of top features you keep.
