Start program on a second monitor?

Is there a way to specify which monitor a application appears on in Delphi or C++Builder? I am developing a simple program for a customer, which displays kitchen orders on a secondary monitor, generated by a hospitality system. Currently they need to manually drag the window onto the second monitor after it starts.
