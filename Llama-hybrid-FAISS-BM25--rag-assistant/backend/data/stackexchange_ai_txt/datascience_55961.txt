How can I arrange data in different columns (for different constituents) from one?

I have a data file that has all the values for various constituents at different dates in same column. I want different constituents in different columns. Following is the example data format. I want Aluminium, Berrylium and other variables in that column to be in different columns. The data file is attached. SITE_NAME SAMP_DATE_TIME SAMPLE Value Units METHOD_CATEGORY SITE-7-1 10/04/1988 00:00:00 Aluminum 150 ug/L INORGANIC SITE-7-1 10/04/1988 00:00:00 Aluminum 150 ug/L INORGANIC SITE-7-1 10/04/1988 00:00:00 Beryllium 5 ug/L INORGANIC SITE-7-1 10/04/1988 00:00:00 Beryllium 5 ug/L INORGANIC Data : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SUhYd21U5iQmilABNwoaIXLfsc7Mo6dW The output I am trying to get is: SITE_NAME SAMP_DATE_TIME Aluminum Beryllium Bromide Bromomethane Chloride Hexachlorobenzene Isosafrole Zinc SITE-7-1 10/4/1988 0:00 150 5 10 7250 10 10 75 SITE-7-1 12/29/1988 0:00 150 5 10 8100 10 10 16 SITE-7-1 5/10/1989 0:00 150 5 1000 10 8100 10 10 16
