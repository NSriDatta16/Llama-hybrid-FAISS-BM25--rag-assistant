drag drop mysql web form builder

I would like to have a tool with which I can easily develop(dragNdrop) front-end for mysql table and publish it to web. I am not sure whether I can try oracle forms, as my database is MySQL. Even if I can use Oracle forms to connect to MySQL, I would like to know any other third party tool which can do the job easily & quickly.
