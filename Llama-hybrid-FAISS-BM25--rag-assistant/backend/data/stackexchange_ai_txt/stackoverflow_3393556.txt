Well, for all intents and purposes you may want to consider upping your storage space rather than deleting. Another option would be to take a full repo snapshot where it is at a point where you probably will never revert, and delete the repository and create a new one, then dump the snapshot right back in and it will start at revision 1. I did this route for a couple projects, but only because we had a major file structure reorganization happen
