To answer very specifically, no, there isn't a built-in PropertyGrid-like control in WPF; there are some open-source efforts to provide one (but last time I looked they were woefully underdeveloped... all I looked at anyway... good efforts though! keep going!). Also, Silverlight has the DataForm which is a neat way of editing generic objects, but that's missing from WPF as well. There have been some efforts to port the Silverlight one, but a lot of functionality went missing and I haven't seen any activity in that direction lately. So to summarize... there isn't an easy, drag-and-drop way of doing it right now. However, if the business objects are restricted in their design (a very cohesive domain model), it's fairly easy to roll your own, semi-generic editor, using of course MVVM like Wonko suggested.
