There are a few things you can do with a distribution: a. write it down as an unsolved integral, b. write it down as a solved integral, c. evaluate its normalized version on a computer at different inputs, d. sample from its distribution, e. approximate expectations of its distribution, and f. evaluate exactly expectations of its distribution. These are all different things. To answer your questions. Yes if $R$ is nonnegative, $0$ on the negatives, and integrable (you didn't mention these assumptions). And yes if by "create" you mean write it down on paper. Sometimes the normalizing constant integral is difficult or impossible to compute. Indeed, this is one of the main selling points for MCMC and other sampling-based strategies--they accomplish task (e) without requiring task (c). Monte Carlo is aimed at task (e) not task (b). It requires you to be able to do task (d)...but, the first sentence suggests that you are interested in task (d).
