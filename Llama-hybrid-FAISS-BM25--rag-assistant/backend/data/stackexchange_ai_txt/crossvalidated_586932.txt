I'm not confident I followed all the details, so I summarize my understanding first: The experiment involves one 3x5 plate with 15 wells: 5 cell lines with 3 replicates. Fluorescence is measured at 0° separately in each well, then the plate is heated to 45° and fluorescence is measured again. The hypothesis is that one cell line gets shinier when heated. And there are two questions: What is the proper order of operations: compute statistic (comparing fluorescence at 0° and 45°) and then average (across replicates). Or average first and then compute statistic? What is the appropriate statistic: ratio or differences of fluorescence values? If this is the correct setup, then the measurements before and after heating are paired since the data comes from the same wells. Then averaging first and making a comparison second is not the right approach; instead make comparison first (between the before and after fluorescence values within a well) and then average. We observe the same wells under two different conditions, so we make a pre-post comparison of paired measurements. Now about what you should compare: ratios (value after heating divided by value before heating) or differences (value after heating minus value before heating). This is best determined by domain knowledge: do you expect the effect of heating on shininess to be multiplicative or additive? If the multiplicative, then you can look at the logs rather than the raw values, so let's assume that you want to compare differences of fluorescence values. We've abstracted the problem to the following analysis: we want to determine if there are differences in post-heating fluorescence between groups (columns) given the pre-heating fluoresence. I think it's reasonable to contrast only two groups: the first and the second column on the left because they are comparable before heating: the cell lines express the same fluorescence protein. The most straightforward analysis is to compare change scores (post-fluoresence - pre-fluoresence) by cell line (column in plate). This you can do it with a two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. Better but requires more statistics, is to use ordinal regression to analyze post-fluoresence as a function of pre-fluorescence and cell lines. Comments about the fine print: We don't accept the alternative hypothesis. We reject the null hypothesis. It's not very meaningful to compute the standard deviation of 3 numbers (3 wells). I'm confused by the "ice bath" values for DTELF and DTOM. Aren't these cell lines supposed to be comparable at 0° because they express the same fluorenscence protein?
