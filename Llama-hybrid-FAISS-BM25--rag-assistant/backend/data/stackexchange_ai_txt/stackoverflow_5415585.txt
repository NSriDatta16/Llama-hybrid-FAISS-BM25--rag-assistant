If you're creating a user, you need to create a grant too. The grant implicitly creates a user if it doesn't exist (which is why you are encouraged to include the password when creating a grant, just in case they don't exist). see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html So an option is to just create the grant (with the password) and the user is implicitly created. E.g: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db_name.* TO 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
