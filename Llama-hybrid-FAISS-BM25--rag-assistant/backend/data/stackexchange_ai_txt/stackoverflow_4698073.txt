I got a similar error after upgrading my iPhone to iOS4.2.1(8C148a). The situation is as following. I was using Xcode 3.2.4, but it does not support iOS4.2.1. So I downloaded Xcode_3.2.5_and_ios-sdk_4.2_final.dmg which is 3.78GB requiring 9.53GB to install. Then I ran my ap with Xcode 3.2.5. That is where I got the above error message. Now it is ok. I solve this based on Geowar's answer: For the official answer: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa2010/qa1701.html Please be noted that if you have done as Geowar said and the message is still there. Try to close Xcode 3.2.5 and restart it. That is how it works for me. Another thing is that if you have just upgraded to iOS4.2.1 like me. When you try to load the a/p from Xcode 3.2.5 the first time. Xcode 3.2.5 may still give you "No provision iOS device connected". Please try to go to organizer and click on your iPhone under DEVICES on the left bar. Wait for a while to let Xcode in sync with your iPhone with iOS4.2.1. Then it will work. At least it work for me.
