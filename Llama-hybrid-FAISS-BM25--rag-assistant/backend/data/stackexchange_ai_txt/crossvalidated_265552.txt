One good place to start is Eamonn Keogh pubs . Pay attention to this paper found there: Thanawin Rakthanmanon, Eamonn Keogh, Stefano Lonardi, and Scott Evans (2011).

ICDM 2011 I would look at it first because it points out a pitfall in Time Series Clustering you should keep in mind. This next paper may be what you are looking for: Liudmila Ulanova, Nurjahan Begum, Mohammad Shokoohi-Yekta and Eamonn Keogh (2016). Clustering in the Face of Fast Changing Streams. SDM (2016) A web search on "Time Series Clustering" will yield many resources. It is a rich and evolving field with lots of techniques, and much code and datasets.
