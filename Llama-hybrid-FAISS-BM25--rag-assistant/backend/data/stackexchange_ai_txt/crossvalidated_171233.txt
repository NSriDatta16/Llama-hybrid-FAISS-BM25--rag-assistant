@ebony1 gives the key point (+1), I was a co-author of a paper discussing how to kernelize generalised linear models, e.g. logistic regression and Poisson regression, it is pretty straightforward. G. C. Cawley, G. J. Janacek and N. L. C. Talbot, Generalised kernel machines, in Proceedings of the IEEE/INNS International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN-2007), pages 1732-1737, Orlando, Florida, USA, August 12-17, 2007. ( www , pdf ) I also wrote a (research quality) MATLAB toolbox (sadly no instructions), which you can find here . Being able to model the target distribution is pretty useful in uncertainty quantification etc. so it is a useful (if fairly incremental) addition to kernel learning methods.
