Welcome to this forum, @statq! I'll give you some suggestions you can use to make model interpretation easier. Typically, beta regression is used with a logit link, so I will assume the same in my answer. (You are currently using a log link.) With a logit link in place, it sounds like your beta regression model is of the following form: logit(mean UR) = beta_0+ beta_1 x age + beta_2 x sexmale + beta_3 x marriedyes + beta_4 x log(statemb) + beta_5 x age x log(statemb) + beta_6 x sexmale x log(statemb) + beta_7 x marriedyes x log(statemb) + beta_8 x sexmale x marriedyes + beta_9 x sexmale x marriedyes x log(statemb) where unemployment rate (UR) is expresses as a proportion. Now, let's say you want to interpret the effect of sex on the logit-transformed mean unemployment rate, adjusted for the effects of the other predictor variables in your model. To this end, you can re-arrange your model so that all terms involving the dummy variable sexmale (which is used to encode the effect of sex) are grouped together: logit(mean UR) = beta_0 + beta_1 x age + [beta_2 + beta_6 x log(statemb) + beta_8 x marriedyes + beta_9 x marriedyes x log(statemb)] x sexmale + beta_3 x marriedyes + beta_4 x log(statemb) + beta_5 x age x log(statemb) + beta_7 x marriedyes x log(statemb) This model re-arrangement makes it easier to see that the effect of sex in the model depends on both log(statemb) and marriedyes. To tease out what the effect looks like, you could consider breaking it down into manageable pieces. How you break it down will depend on what the distribution of log(statemb) looks like. Let's say the distribution of log(statemb) is unimodal and (approximately) symmetric . Then you can consider its obseverd mean value (M) as well as M - SD and M + SD as 3 values for which you want to express the effect of sex. (Here, SD is the observed standard deviation of the distribution of log(statemb).) Considering that marriedyes takes two possible values (i.e., 1 for married and 0 for unmarried), this will give you 6 possible scenarios for which you can express the effect of sex at particular values of age: Effect of sex when log(statemb) is equal to M and marriedyes = 1; Effect of sex when log(statemb) is equal to M and marriedyes = 0; Effect of sex when log(statemb) is equal to M - SD and marriedyes = 1; Effect of sex when log(statemb) is equal to M - SD and marriedyes = 0; Effect of sex when log(statemb) is equal to M + SD and marriedyes = 1; Effect of sex when log(statemb) is equal to M + SD and marriedyes = 0. For the first of these scenarios, the estimated effect of sex on the logit-transformed mean UR is therefore: b_2 + b_6 x M + b_8 + b_9 x M where the b's are the estimated values of the unknown coefficients beta's. Among people having an average value for log(statemb) and the same age, the mean UR of males differs from the mean UR of females by a multiplicative factor of exp(b_2 + b_6 x M + b_8 + b_9 x M). If you know how to set up and tests linear contrasts of model coefficients in a beta regression model (on the logit scale), you can easily derive a confidence interval to go with the point estimate b_2 + b_6 x M + b_8 + b_9 x M. Note that effect plots are also a great way to visualize the effects I described above.
