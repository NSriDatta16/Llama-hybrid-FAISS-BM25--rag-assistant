Optimality in Hierarchy of Machines (HAM Framework)

How is it that the HAM framework provides the Hierarchically Optimal solution while the MAXQ framework provides the recursively optimal solution? The above statement is based on Section 4.3 here and Section 2 here . The following are the quotes respectively. SMDP DP or RL methods applied to HAMs, or to MDPs with options whose policies are fixed apriori, yield hierarchically optimal policies Using HAMQ learning [10], HAM can also converge to a hierarchical optimal solution
