Does input to GAN discriminator have to be differentiable output of generator?

I understand the basic of how GANs work with the min-max game, etc. However, I don't fully understand how the error backpropagates to the generator. Let's say I have an input vector $x$ to the generator. The generator computes some output $G(x)$. If I perform some non-differentiable function on $G(x)$, call it $h(G(x))$, can this be the input to my discriminator? For example, maybe $h(z)$ is a clustering function, that clusters elements of $z$ into groups. My ground truth sample for the discriminator might be existing clusters $\hat{h}(x)$. Could my generator produce $G(x)$, but my discriminator see as input $\left(h\left(G(x)\right), \hat{h}(x)\right)$? If so, how does the backpropagation work, given that $h(z)$ is not differentiable?
