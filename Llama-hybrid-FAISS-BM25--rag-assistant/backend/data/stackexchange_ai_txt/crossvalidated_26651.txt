If there's a possible constant trend (horizontal line across your data that fits within the confidence intervals), then it's likely that there's no statistically significant change. From glancing at your graph, It's difficult to tell if that's the case, but if you want some quick R code, try this (replace AirPassengers with your data, assumes your data is in the ts format): AP.fit Which gives you something like:
