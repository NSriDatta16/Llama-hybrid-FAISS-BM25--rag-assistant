Hmmm one solution that came up in my mind... maybe it's a little bit odd, but I think it should work: let your Web app. read the HTTP UserAgent and save it as a hidden HTML input field. Then you can access it from your Selenium tests and decide whether you want to continue running them or not. Maybe there's a better solution, I don't know.
