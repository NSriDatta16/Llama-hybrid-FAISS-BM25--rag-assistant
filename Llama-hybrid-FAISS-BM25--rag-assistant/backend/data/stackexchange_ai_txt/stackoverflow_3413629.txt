Emulate IE7 for IE8 but not for IE9 using "X-UA-Compatible"

I have a website depending on vector drawing, for Internet Explorer I'm using VML and for other browsers I'm using SVG . IE8 however, doesn't have support for neither without falling back to IE7-mode which has VML. Therefore I'm including . The problem (well, actually a good thing) is that IE9 now has support for SVG so I don't want it to fall back to IE7-mode which has much worse performance and compatibility. How do I tell only IE8 to fall back to IE7-mode but let IE9 stay in IE9-mode? Right now I'm doing a server side check on the agent whether to include the EmulateIE7-string in the head or not but I want to avoid this as far as it's possible.
