Antimalarials as confounding variables in a prevalence study

I am performing a multi-level logistic regression analysis of cross-sectional survey data, and I am curious as to whether " taking antimalarials " is a confounding variable in the following situation: The exposure is " sprayed insecticide in the house ", and the outcome is " infected with malaria ". Given the complex relationship between "taking drugs", being "infected with malaria" (the outcome) and "spraying insecticide" (the exposure), I am wondering if I should control for "taking drugs" as a confounder: as curative drugs, malaria causes a person to take the drugs; as prophylactics, they are preventative, as is insecticide spraying. Also, after getting malaria, a person is more likely to start taking preventative measures,i.e, taking prophylactics or spraying insecticide. So, I am confused, are "drugs" confounding the relationship between exposure and outcome? Drugs and insecticide both seem to be associated. Not spraying could certainly cause infection with malaria. Taking prophylactics could certainly prevent you from being infected with malaria. Malaria could certainly cause you to take the curative drugs. Yet drugs are not on the causal pathway in any of these paths. Confused!
