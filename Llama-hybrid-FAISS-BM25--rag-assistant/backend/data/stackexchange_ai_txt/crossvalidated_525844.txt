binary variable sample values to population distribution

What seems like a very basic stats question, but yet I wouldn't know the answer and its quite hard to find. Here we go: Say I have a population of 30 organizations. I want to know whether within this group the value of one binary variable tends to be A or B. Say that I pick 5 organizations at random and find that for all these organizations the value of my binary variable is A. What does this tell me about, say, the likelihood that the value for all 30 organizations is A? Or that A is the value for at least some percentage (say, more than 50%) of the organizations? Is there a simple formula to calculate this? Essentially I need a tool to help me determine: my sample size is big enough now to infer confidently (controversial choice of words, perhaps) that A is the rule, B the exception.
