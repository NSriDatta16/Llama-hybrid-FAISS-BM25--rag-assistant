Allocating builtins on the stack shouldn't result in fragmentation. However if you allocate something like string on the stack, while the stack itself won't get fragmented the string allocates memory on the heap which could wind up fragmented. Generally the stack is extremely small compared to the heap - something like 1-64MB depending on your platform.
