you can take an image of pointer and the use pointer pressed and pointer released method which will give u the cordinates which pointer had pointer.For using this pointer presse method you have to extend Game canvas or Canvas class into your class. example:-- public class Example extends GameCanvas { public Example() { super(false); } public void keyPressed(int keycode) { } protected void pointerPressed(int X,int Y) { } protected void pointerDrageed(int X,int Y) { } protected void pointerReleased(int X,int Y) { } By using above methods i think you can get the solution of your problem.
