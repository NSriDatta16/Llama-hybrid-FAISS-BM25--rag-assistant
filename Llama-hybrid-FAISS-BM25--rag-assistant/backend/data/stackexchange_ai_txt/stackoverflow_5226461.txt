44100/8000=5.5125 so you can try to take 5.5125 samples and calculate the average value and so reduce the sample rate I think this should work although Im sure the result will be noisy but ist worth trying you can also take every 5.5125 sample maybe this can help you http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downsampling
