Can reinforcement learning be used for a complete coverage navigation application?

I have a complete coverage of a 3D space problem. Most complete coverage navigation solutions use different algorithms to give the most appropriate path that covers the area, however I wish to use previous navigation data to learn the best path that covers similar areas. I thought of using reinforcement learning where the transition matrix can be obtained from the data. However, most applications in RL are formulated in manner where a goal needs to be reached. Does it mean the RL is not suitable for this sort of problems, unless the reward of being in each states can be changed once the state has been visited?
