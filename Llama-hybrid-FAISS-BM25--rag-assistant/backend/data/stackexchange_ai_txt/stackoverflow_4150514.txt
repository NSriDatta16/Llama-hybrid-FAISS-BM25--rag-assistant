Suggesting to let the IDE "do it its own way" implies that the IDE is employing some kind of intelligence to the way it generates code for creating forms and data modules. It isn't. It's just creating what you told it to create, and in the order you told it to use. If you didn't explicitly tell it what to do via the project-options dialog, then it's just creating things in the order you added them to your project. The IDE does not know any better than you do. Using auto-created forms and data modules encourages the use of the global variables that the IDE declares for you to refer to those objects. You don't need them. Auto-create only your main form. When you need anything else, create it yourself using the typical way of creating objects: Call the constructor, and store references to the objects in local variables or fields of your other objects, not the IDE-provided globals, which you should delete. Don't bother with CreateForm . I wrote an article explaining why.
