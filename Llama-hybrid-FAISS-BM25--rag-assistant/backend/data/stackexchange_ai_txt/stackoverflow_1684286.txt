I've hit similar issues, what seems to happen is the iPhone is optimizing the drawing which occurs in the same function. What you can try doing is splitting the function up and performSelector. For example [self performSelector:@selector(hideMessage) withObject:self afterDelay:1.0]; I've used this a few times with good results. If you want to see an excellent write up on doing great game style effects check out the Formic example code in iPhone cool projects. Wolfgang really pushes views for very pleasing game style effects. Google books has it, but the book overall has some really great techniques.
