Is there any shortcuts in J2EE/Java to "find all dependencies", apps anybody knows to analyze code and find dependencies or anything like that? I'd start by having another go at getting documentation ... or help ... from the original developers, if you can find them. [IMO, people who develop / provide software without any documentation deserve to be bugged incessantly by people asking silly questions.] But I guess you've already tried that. Then there are the jarfinder.com and other services as mentioned in another answer. (New to me!) If that fails, I'd try doing a Google search on the FQNs. The chances are that if the missing classes are part of a commonly used library you will hit the Javadocs ... or a posting from someone else with a similar problem to yours. If the "Google it" approach fails, use the clues in the package naming for the missing classes to try and find where they come from. If they follow the Sun recommendations, the names should map to a company or (real or pseudo-) organization that you can locate by a web search.
