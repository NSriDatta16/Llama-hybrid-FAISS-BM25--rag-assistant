Time series like this - integer-valued with "many" zeros - are called intermittent demand . For forecasting: The classical approach is crostons-method , which exponentially smoothes the inter-demand interval and nonzero demands separately, forecasts them out and uses the ratio as a mean demand forecast. You can read about Croston's method in pretty much every business or demand forecasting textbook. Alternatively, you could simply run an overall average. Or use a seasonal method if you suspect seasonality (e.g., within days), e.g., seasonal exponential smoothing. If you suspect multiple-seasonalities (e.g., intra-daily and intra-weekly), a tbats model may be possible, even if the (often tacit) assumptions of conditionally normally distributed observations do not hold. Or you could run a Poisson or Negative Binomial regression, potentially with periodic dummies to account for seasonalities. Note that you should not use the Mean Absolute Error ( mae ) for intermittent demands, because it will be minimized by biased forecasts, probably the flat zero forecast . Use the Mean Squared Error ( mse ) instead. Or even better: calculate full predictive densities and use proper scoring-rules . In terms of literature, Morlidge (2015, Foresight ) discusses the shortcomings of the mae . Kolassa (2016, International Journal of Forecasting ) does the same, presents Poisson and NB regression (and other models) and uses scoring-rules . A textbook on intermittent demand forecasting by Boylan and Syntetos is in preparation and should hopefully appear in the next few months.
