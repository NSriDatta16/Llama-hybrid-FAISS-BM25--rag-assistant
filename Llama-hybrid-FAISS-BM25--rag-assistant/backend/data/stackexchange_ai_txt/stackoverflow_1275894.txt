Check if Mouse LButton is down?

How do I check if the Left button of my mouse is currently pressed down/dragging something(I preffer the first possibility). I tried Mouse.IsDraging,but no result. NOTE: I handle mouse messages in my application so its no problem if its a WM,just share a way to accomplish my task.
