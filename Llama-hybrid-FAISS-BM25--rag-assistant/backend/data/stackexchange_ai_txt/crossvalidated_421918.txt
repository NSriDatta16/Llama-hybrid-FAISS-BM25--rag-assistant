My initial reaction is that 0.03 vs. 0.07 is quite a small difference in such a noisy random variable as a p-value - even if we assume the particular dichotomization was pre-specified (it is certainly true that shopping around for the optimal cutpoints dichotomizing will have a lower "p-value" - except that it will be invalid). In any case, power is an average long-run property, not something one can judge from a single dataset. With a single pre-specified set of cut-offs - even if it is the optimal choices - you would expect more power with a continuous variable. You can of course try this and do a simulation.
