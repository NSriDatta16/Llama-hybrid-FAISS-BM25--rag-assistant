I came across what seems to be a similar problem. The user moves the pointer on top of an image, and a div floats above the page at the pointer's position while showing another image. There didn't seem to be a problem with IE, but the entire div flickered with Firefox. What Shree said about the pointer being above the tooltip helped me fix this. What I did was, instead of setting the x and y of the div to the exact location of the pointer, I placed it off by 2 or 3 pixels. This way the mouse can be prevented from going over the div and thus triggering the mouseout event. Not a very elegant way of fixing it, but it works if you can live with your tooltip being 2-3 pixels too high.
