I start off with a single dll, and as it gets larger and begins to contain some fairly independent components, I may choose to factor them out as separate dll's. For me, it's primarily an issue of aesthetics - I like to keep things independent and orthogonal and well-organized. There is nothing wrong with one large dll, given the amount of memory, diskspace available nowadays.
