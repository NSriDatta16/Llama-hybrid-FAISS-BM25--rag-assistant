From the vector documentation (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/~vector/): Vector destructor Destructs the container object. This calls each of the contained element's destructors, and deallocates all the storage capacity allocated by the vector. delete[] won't be called, so it'll leak. And as other commenters pointed out, there are more STL ways to do it.
