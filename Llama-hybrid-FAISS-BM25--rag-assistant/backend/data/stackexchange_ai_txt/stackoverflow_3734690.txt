Jython 2.2.1 is (AFAIK) equivalent to Cpython 2.2.1 as far as syntax is concerned. The line that causes the problem uses the ternary operator which was introduced later. the solution is to replace it with an if statement. if not html: html = download(url, user_agent).read() That should take care of that syntax error. There is also a with clause that you will need to replace. with open(output, 'wb') as fp: chunk = True while chunk: chunk = req.read(CHUNK_SIZE) if chunk: fp.write(chunk) #fp.flush() print '.', sys.stdout.flush() You can replace this with try: fp = open(output, 'w') chunk = True while chunk: chunk = req.read(CHUNK_SIZE) if chunk: fp.write(chunk) #fp.flush() print '.', sys.stdout.flush() finally: fp.close()
