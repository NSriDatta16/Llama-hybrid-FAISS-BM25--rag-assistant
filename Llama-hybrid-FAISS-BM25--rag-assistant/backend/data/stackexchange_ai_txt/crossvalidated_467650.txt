Derivative of all the parameters in Logistic Regression

$\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function, $\mathcal{L} = y_i \text{log} \sigma(z) + (1-y_i) \text{log} (1-\sigma(z))$ , where $z = \sum_i w_ix_i$ , with $w_i$ representing the weights and $x_i$ the features. Typically, it is required to take a derivative of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $w_1$ or $w_2$ . But I am required to provide derivative with respect to parameters which includes all weights. Could anyone please recommend a solution or some tutorials? Thanks
