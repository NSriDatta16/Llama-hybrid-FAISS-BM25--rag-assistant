I have spoken with Dr Campbell and many others about this. The whole notion of advocating for a demonstration of type I error control is ill-defined. In the Bayesian context there is officially no such thing as type I error, and it makes us less rational and more confused to even consider it. You could say that type I error is in direct conflict with a prior that does not have a discontinuity at the null. This is a political, educational, and inertial battle. To make matters worse, to compute type I error you have to design a sample space, e.g., you have to specify the times of intended looks at the data. This is an anathema to Bayesians.
