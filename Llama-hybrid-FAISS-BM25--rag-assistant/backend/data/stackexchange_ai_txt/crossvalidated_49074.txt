Pearson correlation vs. logistic regression coefficients

From a bunch of data points which look like: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 I get correlation coefficients as: 1 -0.301511345 0.204124145 -0.301511345 1 -0.287213479 0.204124145 -0.287213479 1 and after paired logistic regression the non-constant coefficients look like the following: xx -1.258 0.8473 -1.258 xx -1.204 0.8473 -1.204 xx In above, by regressing column 1 on column 2 I get non-constant coeff as -1.258 and after regression column 1 on column 3, I get 0.8473 and so on. How do I interpret the above numbers? Edit: I have a system which sends signal to 3 locations every 10 seconds. It gathers information about whether they are active or not. I am trying to understand if there is any relation between those systems in terms of when they are alive. I calculated correlation matrix using the corr function in matlab. Thanks
