JTextPane in a JScrollPane doesn't react to mouse wheel

I used the following structure in my (SWT) java app: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite contains a org.eclipse.swt.custom.CTabFolder.CTabFolder contains zero to n org.eclipse.swt.custom.CTabItem contains a org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite.Composite contains a java.awt.Frame (created by SWT_AWT.new_Frame()) contains a javax.swing.JTextPane and a javax.swing.JScrollPane Everything works just fine, the text in the text pane scrolls when I drag the scroll bar and is drawn just fine, but the mouse wheel just doesn't move the scroll bar. If I add a mouse wheel listener to the text pane, the event never reaches my code. Do I miss something?
