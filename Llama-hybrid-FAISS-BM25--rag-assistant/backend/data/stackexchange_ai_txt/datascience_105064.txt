Finding global optimum of unknown and expensive function

I would like to find optimal combination of parameters for the algorithm affecting the disk space used by some storage. Therefore, several algorithm parameters ( x1, x2, x3 , where 0 ) are used as an input for the model, and the disk space occupied by storage S(x1, x2, x3) is the cost function I'd like to minimize. The problem is that every function call S(x1, x2, x3) is very expensive, and it may take minutes or even hours to end up, so it's almost infeasible to prepare the training set. Instead, I would like ML library to suggest, which combination of (x1, x2, x3) values to use to estimate S on every next optimization step. I believe this task is quite common for the major ML frameworks, but I wasn't able to find anything suitable yet. So what is the name for this class of problems, and which ML framework provide the routines to solve it?
