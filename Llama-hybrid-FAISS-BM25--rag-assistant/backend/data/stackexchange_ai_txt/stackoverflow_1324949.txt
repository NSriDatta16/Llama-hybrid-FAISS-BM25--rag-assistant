Match database output (balanced parentheses, table & rows structure) and output as a list?

How would I parse the following input (either going line by line or via regex... or combination of both): Table[ Row[ C_ID[Data:12345.0][Sec:12345.0][Type:Double] F_ID[Data:17660][Sec:17660][Type:Long] NAME[Data:Mike Jones][Sec:Mike Jones][Type:String] ] Row[ C_ID[Data:2560.0][Sec:2560.0][Type:Double] ... ] ] there is indentation in there, of course, so it can be split by \n\t (and then cleaned up for the extra tabs \t in C_ID, F_ID lines and such... The desired output is something more usable in python: {'C_ID': 12345, 'F_ID': 17660, 'NAME': 'Mike Jones',....} {'C_ID': 2560, ....} I've tried going line by line, and then using multiple splits() to throw away what I don't need and keep what I do need, but I'm sure there is a much more elegant and faster way of doing it...
