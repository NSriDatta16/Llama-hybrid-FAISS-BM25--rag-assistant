Categorical Principal Component Analysis - using Count, Continuous, Ordinal variables together

I have some variables and I want to reduce their number for further analysis. I initially thought of combining them using factor analysis. But since the variables are of all kinds (rating, count, ordinal, continuous dollar amount) I am thinking about using CATPCA for it. However, I have some questions about the technique - Is CATPCA the right approach or Latent Class Factor Analysis would be the better one? By using the different kinds of variables together - how will the object scores be interpreted? For example - The rating question is on a 10 point scale but the dollar amount ranges from 0 to 1000s, so what will the object score obtained after CATPCA represent? And is it comparable to the Factor Score obtained from traditional PCA? For ordinal variables - Do all of them need to be in the same form, e.g. 1 meaning lowest and 10 meaning highest? Or can they be used in whatever form they are? Is it good to categorize the count and continuous variables based on their distribution and then treat then as ordinal/categorical variables? I would highly appreciate any help you can provide!
