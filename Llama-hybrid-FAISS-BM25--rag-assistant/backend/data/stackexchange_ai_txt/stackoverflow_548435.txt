The basic principles for creating a good desktop are the same for creating web or enterprise applications. So the core of Spring or other frameworks such as OSGi or PicoContainer can easily be used outside of J2EE. For example, Eclipse uses OSGi as its internal framework. The original use of the Model-View-Presenter (MVC) pattern was for Smalltalk GUI widgets. In fact, for myself, I first found and worked with "IoC" frameworks (long before Spring) precisely because I was looking for a framework and organizing principles for desktop application development. Update on RCP I see some people are recommending Eclipse RCP or Netbeans. I've done quite a bit of Eclipse RCP development and for certain classes of applications, it's great. However, the learning curve is very steep and the feature set may be way more than you need. Keep that in mind for any framework you investigate.
