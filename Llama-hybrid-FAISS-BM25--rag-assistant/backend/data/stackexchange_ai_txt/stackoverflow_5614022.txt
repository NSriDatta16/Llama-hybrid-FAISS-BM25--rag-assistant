Like StompChicken says it is unclear that the Hamming distance is a valid kernel. Unless I'm missing something, I think it is a valid kernel, because it is an inner product in the following space: K("aab","baa") = [0,1,0,1,1,0] \dot [1,0,0,1,0,1]. After understanding this "encoding" you can really use any SVM library that supports a linear kernel, an encode your strings like in the previous example.
