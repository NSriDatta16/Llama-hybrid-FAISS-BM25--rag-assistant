Is the data you retrieve from the database page specific, user specific or global to the entire application? If the data is user specific you can use Session State . If the data is global to the entire application you could use Application State . Whichever you use, you can implement the data retrieval in the Session_Start (will be called only once for each user) or Application_Start (will be called only once when the web app starts) events in a Global.asax file.
