In regression, why does having D=N-1 parameters in a model(N is the number of data points) mean that we can perfectly Interpolate the data points?

Reading through Murphy’s Machine Learning: An introduction. Example provides some data and a polynomial regression model of the standard form $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{w})= \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{\phi{(x})}$ is used where $\phi{x}=[1,x,x^2,...,x^D]$ . He then states the following: “D=2 results in a much better fit. We can keep increasing D,and hence the number of parameters in the model, until $D = N-1$ . In this case we have one parameter per data point, so we can perfectly interpolate the data.” My questions are the following: 1)what does it mean to perfectly interpolate the data in this context? (How would we know that we’ve perfectly interpolated the data?) 2)why does having D=N-1 parameters mean that we can perfectly interpolate the data? 3)Why do we have to stop at D=N-1 parameters?
