How to compare two data sets sampled at different time?

I have two time series $X$ and $Y$. These two time series contain features, $x_i \in R^{n \times 1}, i = 1...n_x$ and $y_j \in R^{n \times 1}, j=1,...,n_y$ sampled from two subjects($x_i$ are extracted from subject $A$, and $y_j$ are extracted from subject $B$). These features are extracted using the same method, but at different time indices and from different subjects. For example,$X=[x_1, x_2, x_3]$, $Y=[y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4]$, $x_i,y_j\in R^{n \times 1}$ and the sampling time indices for $X$ and $Y$ are $t_x = [10,20,30]$ and $t_y = [12,24,36,48]$ respectively. I would like to calculate distance between $X$ and $Y$. If $n_x = n_y$ and $t_x=t_y$, this is simple. However, $n_x \neq n_y$ and $t_x\neq t_y$ for my data. Is there any method to solve this problem?
