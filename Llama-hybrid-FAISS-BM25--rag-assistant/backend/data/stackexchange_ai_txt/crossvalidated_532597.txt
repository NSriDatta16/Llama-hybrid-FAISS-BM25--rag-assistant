Measure for how much a data deviates from "perfectly symmetric/ideally distributed" in data's units?

Measure for how much a data deviates from "perfectly symmetric/ideally distributed" in data's units? How do I produce a skewness/asymmetry/something measure that's in the same units as the data may be in, e.g. metres? So if I e.g. want to know "how many metres is this metric data 'skewed' to left/right" (compared to if it was perfectly symmetric), then what's such measure? PCA may be able to produce one such measure by comparing the first PC to a perfectly straight line. This would approximate e.g. how much the possible "top" of the data is "off" from perfectly symmetric data. But PCA does not describe how the asymmetry is distributed, whereas https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness does. But skewness does not give a deviation in e.g. metres does it? Product of inertia is also possibly related.
