What should I do with the NaN values on this stock quote data?

I concatenated 3 stock quote data-frames all with date-time indexes. However, they differ in starting dates so the resulting data-frame contains NaN values for the stock quotes with more recent starting dates. Should I just drop the rows with NaN and start the new data frame with the row where all have values or is there a way to fill them up? I'm planning on using the data to train a neural network that predicts future stock quotes.
