Evaluation and optimization in machine learning

I am reading the article "A few useful things to know about machine learning" by P. Domingos. Now, I am confused about two of the three components of learning, i.e., the evaluation and optimization. From the article, the evaluation function is the one used to distinguish good classifiers from bad ones, while the optimization is the method to search among all the classifiers for the highest-scoring one. So, they are kind of similar, right? Am I misunderstanding something here? Many thanks for your time and attention.
