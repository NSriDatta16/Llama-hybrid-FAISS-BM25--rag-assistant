Is your code setting the ID value explicitely to 0? (instead of leaving it untouched). Update 1: As you posted on the updated version, linq2sql is clearly passing the value to the db. Here is one I haven't had any trouble with: [Column(Storage="_CustomerID", AutoSync=AutoSync.Always, DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsDbGenerated=true)] public int CustomerID I just saw another one, and it has the same exact definition of the one you are using. [Column(Storage="_TestID", AutoSync=AutoSync.OnInsert, DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsPrimaryKey=true, IsDbGenerated=true)] public int TestID Update 2: Regarding updates, you are not supposed to do InsertOnSubmit for that. Just update the values and call .SubmitChanges (should be throwing an exception). On the insert it is really weird, as the property attributes you posted seems to be correct, so the Insert method linq2sql generates should be correct as well. I would try, re-adding the table on the designer again and verifying all the properties are correct. Note that the generated insert method should look like (with a matchingRig_Insert): private void InsertRig(Rig obj) { System.Nullable p1 = obj.Id; this.Rig_Insert(/* bunch of values */, ref p1); obj.Id = p1.GetValueOrDefault(); }
