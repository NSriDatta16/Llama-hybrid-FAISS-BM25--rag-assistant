KL loss in VAE is similar to regularization strength - in Bayesian terms it could be weighted with how strong is your belief that the prior distribution is actually what you chose (normal distribution in VAE). With that in mind, if your model fares worse using KL loss, you might just decrease its contribution to total loss: Instead of $$\mathcal{L} = MSE + KL$$ use $$\mathcal{L'} = MSE + \beta KL$$ For some $\beta$ $\beta$ -VAE, for example you can check out this blogpost .
