I need to understand how anti-alias algorithms work Anti-aliasing works by rendering the image at a higher resolution before it is down-sampled to the output resolution. In the down-sampling process the higher resolution pixels are averaged to create lower resolution pixels. This will create smoother color changes in the rendered image. Consider this very simple example where a block outline is rendered on a white background. It is then down-sampled to half the resolution in the process creating pixels having shades of gray: Here is a more realistic demonstration of anti-aliasing used to render the letter S:
