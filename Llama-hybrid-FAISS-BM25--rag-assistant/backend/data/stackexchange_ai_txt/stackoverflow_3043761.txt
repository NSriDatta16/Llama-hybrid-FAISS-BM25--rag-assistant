Replace XML bullet points found in feed in classic ASP

Hey I am currently reading in a XML file which contains bullet list in the following container i.e. ï‚Ÿ the average pension contribution rate for executive directors . I am having a problem with symbol directly before the text of each bullet point I want to remove it i.e Replace(text,"old","new") but i cant seem to find what value that bullet point actually is to replace of that makes sense. Thanks
