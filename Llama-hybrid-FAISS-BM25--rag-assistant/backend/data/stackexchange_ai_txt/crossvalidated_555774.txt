If the unknown fixed true parameter such as $r$ is a real number, then the interval using the identity link as you have constructed will work well. If the unknown fixed true parameter such as $r$ must be a non-negative real number, then you might benefit from using a log link function. In your example your 95% CI for $r$ was $\hat{r}\pm 1.96\cdot\hat{\text{se}}=(1.09, 1.15)$ . This approximates the sampling distribution of $\hat{r}$ using a normal distribution and inverts a Wald hypothesis test. A log link function would approximate the sampling distribution of $\text{log}\{\hat{r}\}$ using a normal distribution. The resulting 95% CI for $r$ would be $\text{exp}[\text{log}\{\hat{r}\}\pm 1.96\cdot\hat{\text{se}}/\hat{r}]=(1.09, 1.15)$ . Because the standard error is so small these intervals agree quite nicely. If the sample size was smaller so that the standard error was bigger the interval based on the log link would be different and should have better coverage probability compared to the interval using the identity link. For instance, if the standard error was 40 times larger, i.e. 0.6, the Wald interval using an identity link would be (-0.06, 2.30) whereas the interval using a log link function would be (0.39, 3.20).
