I was discussing this with a friend over the weekend and it seems like the gains you make on ease of storage are lost if you need to be able to query the database outside of the application. My understanding is that these databases work by storing your object data in a de-normalized fashion. This makes it fast to retrieve entire sets of objects, but if you need to select data from a perspective that doesn't match your object model, the odbms might have a hard time getting at the particular data you want.
