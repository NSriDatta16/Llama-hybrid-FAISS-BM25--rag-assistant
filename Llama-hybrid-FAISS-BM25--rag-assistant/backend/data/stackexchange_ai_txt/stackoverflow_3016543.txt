This is the example on the W3schools site adapted for floating text. Changes are on lines 4 and 20. div { float:right; border:1px dotted black; margin:0px 0px 15px 20px; } In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image. We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image: 0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the image. This is floated text. This is floated text. This is floated text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.

Edit: To get the floating text halfway down the page, you just stick This is an annotation right in the middle of the block.
