For interest, note that you could leave the array alone and concentrate on modifying the strings themselves. Like this: lines.each do |e| e.strip! e.upcase! e.replace(e.sanitize_element) end In a quick benchmark on random data this looked like it ran in about 2/3rds the time of the multiple- map! version, although obviously you'd want to verify this on your actual data and operations.
