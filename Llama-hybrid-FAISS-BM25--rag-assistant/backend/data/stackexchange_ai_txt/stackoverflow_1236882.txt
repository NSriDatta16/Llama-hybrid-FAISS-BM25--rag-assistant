Update : The links below were updated to point to web.archive.org -- unfortunately, IDEALLIANCE has made all Exteme Markup Languages conference proceedings unavailable... In due time, I will find a more permanent place for these two articles. This is implemented in FXSL . There are good explanations of the main principles of FXSL. See the following two articles: " Functional programming in XSLT using the FXSL library " (for XSLT 1.0), (PDF) at: http://web.archive.org/web/20070710091236/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/extreme/proceedings/xslfo-pdf/2003/Novatchev01/EML2003Novatchev01.pdf (HTML) at: http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2003/Novatchev01/EML2003Novatchev01.html " Higher-Order Functional Programming with XSLT 2.0 and FXSL " (PDF) at: http://web.archive.org/web/20070222111927/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/extreme/proceedings/xslfo-pdf/2006/Novatchev01/EML2006Novatchev01.pdf (HTML) at: http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2006/Novatchev01/EML2006Novatchev01.html Using FXSL I have been able to solve easily and elegantly many problems, that seem "impossible for XSLT". One can find a lot of examples here .
