Use cross-validation to get the parameters of the Random forests (RF) model. The important parameters in an RF model are the number of trees, the maximum depth of trees and the minimum size of a leaf. Use a portion (may be 50%) of the dataset for this. Now after finding the optimal parameters, use them to develop RF model via cross-validation. Report the results from this cross validated setting. The change between the runs will be very small and wont be significant. You may also run the cross-validation multiple times and report the average result.
