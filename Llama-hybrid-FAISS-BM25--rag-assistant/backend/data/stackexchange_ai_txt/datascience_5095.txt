While @Ben's answer is nice and partially introduces what should be done first with a newly cleaned data set, I feel that the approach is important enough to have its name presented loud and clear: exploratory data analysis (EDA) . Therefore, the short answer to your question is that the first step should be EDA . This suggestion is supported by most researchers, regardless of their knowledge domain or type of study. Here is how the father of EDA presents his thoughts on the subject (Tukey, 1977, p. 1-3; emphasis mine): Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is detective work – numerical detective work – or counting detective work – or graphical detective work ... unless exploratory data analysis uncovers indications, usually quantitative ones, there is likely to be nothing for confirmatory data analysis to consider ... [it] can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone - as the first step . There is an enormous amount of information on approaches, guidelines and procedures for performing EDA. Potential starting points might include EDA page on the NIST's Engineering Statistics Handbook website, EDA pages on the EPA's website, corresponding chapter from the book "Experimental Design for Behavioral and Social Sciences" and a survey research paper on EDA by Begrens (1997), among many others. It is interesting to note that some sources include less traditional methods into EDA toolset, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering (for example, see the description of this research seminar ). While some of the EDA approaches and methods are relatively simple, overall EDA is both art and science , as it combines unstructured (creative) and structured approaches . This aspect is especially important to recognize, as big data exponentially increases complexity of data analyses, including EDA. References Behrens, J. T. (1997). Principles and procedures of exploratory data analysis. Psychological Methods, 2 (2), 131-160. Tukey, J. W. (1977). Exploratory Data Analysis. Addison-Wesley. NOTES: For those interested in the Tukey's classic, it is available on Amazon . Various MOOCs on EDA are also available, for example this one and this one (both are R-focused).
