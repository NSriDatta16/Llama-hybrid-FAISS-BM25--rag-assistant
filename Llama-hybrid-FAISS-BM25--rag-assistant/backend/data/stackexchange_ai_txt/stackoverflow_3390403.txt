Help using SOAP for login

I'm designing a website for an organization that's a state chapter of a national organization. The national organization has implemented a member login that I need to use for the state website. My website is in PHP, and it looks like the server for the national organization is using SOAP and ColdFusion. I'm a total newbie to using SOAP, so I'm probably missing a bunch of things. The national organization sent me this information: Fields to collect on a form mausername mapassword Static variables componenttype Value: Chapter components Value: NM authusername Value: NMChap authpassword Value: USA authpagealias Value: Login The webservice is located here: https://www.apta.org/AM/APTAAPPS/ComponentAuthWebService/aptamemberauthorize.cfc?WSDL The following fields will be returned: Email, FirstName, LastName, LoggedIn, Phone_Release, UserName If LoggedIn returns “true,” the member has been authenticated as a member of the component. This has been implemented and tested here: http://aptadevisg.apta.org/am/aptaapps/test/NM_Chap_test_form.cfm Based on this information and reading the SOAP documentation, this is what I came up with: $apta_server = 'https://www.apta.org/AM/APTAAPPS/ComponentAuthWebService/aptamemberauthorize.cfc?WSDL'; $post_data['mausername'] = '107150'; $post_data['mapassword'] = 'barnes'; $post_data['componenttype'] = 'Chapter'; $post_data['components'] = 'NM'; $post_data['authusername'] = 'NMChap'; $post_data['authpassword'] = 'USA'; $post_data['authpagealias'] = 'Login'; $options = array('trace' => 1, 'exceptions' => 0); $options['location'] = 'https://www.apta.org/AM/APTAAPPS/ComponentAuthWebService/MemberAuth'; try { $client = new soapclient($apta_server, $options); } catch (Exception $e) { } $client->debug_flag = 1; try { $result = $client->__soapCall('MemberAuth', array($post_data)); echo ' Soap Result '; print_r($result); echo ' '; } catch (SoapFault $fault) { echo ' Soap Fault '; print_r($fault); echo ' '; } echo ' getFunctions '; print_r($client->__getFunctions()); echo ' '; echo ' getTypes '; print_r($client->__getTypes()); echo ' '; echo ' getLastResponseHeaders '; print_r($client->__getLastResponseHeaders()); echo ' '; echo ' getLastResponse '; print_r($client->__getLastResponse()); echo ' '; When I print out the result of the __soapCall(), I get a message of: "looks like we got no XML document." I really don't know what I'm doing regarding SOAP, so any help would be greatly appreciated. You can view the results of the test login attempt at: http://rc19.info/test_login.php
