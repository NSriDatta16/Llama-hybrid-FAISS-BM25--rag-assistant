Is it possible to determine the probabilities that the observation belongs in population A or population B? I would then compare each probability to determine which case is more likely. The basic idea would be to compare how many members of Population A with value .85 with members of Population B with value .85. Assuming that the process that generated the lost data point is the same as the one that generated your other data, you can look at how many observations of Population A have value .85, versus Population B. However, you'll have to decide how wide of a window around .85 to take; you probably won't have any data points that are exactly .85000000. A narrow window will have a smaller sample size, but a larger window will be affected by data further and further away from .85. This is the variance/bias tradeoff. Instead of looking at how many data points there actually are at .85, you can also look at how many there "should" be. For this, you need to make an assumption about the type of distribution, and estimate the parameters. For instance, if you assume that the distribution is normal, then you can use the mean and standard deviation to calculated the probability of .85. However, you should look at your data and see whether the distribution is actually normal. If you calculate how many observations "should" be at .85 for A vs. B, this will give a Bayesian calculation of the probability that it is from A vs. B. However, to be truly rigorous, you have to do a meta-Bayesian analysis that, given your prior beliefs about the distributions, finds the probability distribution of the observed sample statistics of mean and standard deviation. If the standard deviation is .268, then the two-tailed p-value for the sample means differing by .002 is about 60%. That is, the probability of seeing as large, or larger, difference in the means purely by chance is about 60%. Thus, this data does not give a solid basis for thinking that the true means for A and B are actually different. Also, keep in mind that sample statistics generally have roughly half the significant figures as the sample size; the sample size of 9939 has four significant figures, so the statistics have only two. Twenty digits of precision is definitely overkill. The two-tailed p-value for getting a sample mean of .49646, given an actual mean of .5 and std of .268, is about 20%, which is still far from statistically significant. So the data is consistent with both means actually being .5.
