You certainly should encrypt/decrypt data on user side - otherwise there is no point in encrypted storage, as tracks of private data still there somewhere - in network cache, in swapfiles of different kind etc. Moreover, data can be sniffed with Man-In-The-Middle attack. So what you probably want is javascript-based client-side encryption. Topic is greatly covered in http://javascript.about.com/library/blencrypt.htm (Rijndael encryption algorithm), and there is great AES implementation library on http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/aes.html You should encrypt data before submission of form (with onClick callback of "Submit" button f. e.), and then pass to server and process as usual. Drawback is that you can't use any Rails with such data - only client-side javascript.
