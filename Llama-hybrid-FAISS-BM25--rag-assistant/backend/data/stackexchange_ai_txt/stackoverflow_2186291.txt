I'm trying to figure out the "best practices" for deciding whether or not to add an auto-incrementing integer as the primary key to a table. Use it as a unique identifier with a dataset where the PKey is not part of user managed data. Let's say I have a table containing data about the chemical elements. The atomic number of each element is unique and will never change. So rather than using an auto-incrementing integer for each column, it would probably make more sense to just use the atomic number, correct? Yes. Would the same be true if I had a table of books? Should I use the ISBN or an auto-incrementing integer for the primary key? Or a table of employees containing each person's SSN? ISBNs/SS#s are assigned by third-parties and because of their large storage size would be a highly inefficient way to uniquely identify a row. Remember, PKeys are useful when you join tables. Why use a large data format like an ISBN which would be numerous textual characters as the Unique identifier when a small and compact format like Integer is available?
