You don't need to standardize for normal logistic regression as long as one keeps units in mind when interpreting the coefficients. Standardizing can help with interpreting feature importance because then the coefficients should be apples to apples. (ie if your two standardized continuous variables have coeff of 0.01 and 0.7 then you know that the 2nd one is much more important.) However for regularized logistic regression continuous variables should be standardized for best results. Is standardisation before Lasso really necessary?
