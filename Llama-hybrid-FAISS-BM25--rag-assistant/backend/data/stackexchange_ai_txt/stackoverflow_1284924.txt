Yes. When you compile your application it is code signed with the *.mobileprovision you have selected for the current build configuration. Each time you add a new device, it changes the *.mobileprovision file to allow for that unique UDID, so you need to both recompile AND reinstall your *.mobileprovision (by dragging into iTunes again) in order for the new devices to run the Ad Hoc distro.
