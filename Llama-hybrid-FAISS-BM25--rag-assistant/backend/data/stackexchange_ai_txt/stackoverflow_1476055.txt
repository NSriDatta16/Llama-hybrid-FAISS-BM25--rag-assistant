Web TWAIN scanning solution for ASP.Net?

I know some of you will discourage scanning through a web page, unfortunately, it is a requirement. I want to view my options in the situation, and maybe, some of you may have already gone through this and had a workable solution. Problem is, we need to have a universal approach in scanning documents through the webpage without any external helper apps that does this for us. I know this is a tall order, I would simply want to know the best next thing. Thank you!
