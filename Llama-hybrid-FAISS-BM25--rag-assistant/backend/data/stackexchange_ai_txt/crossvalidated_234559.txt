With 318 cases in each group you can examine about 20 predictors without too much risk of overfitting. Your second and third sets of variables combine for 23; a big problem is counting each of your neighborhoods in variable set 1 as a fixed effect, using up another 29 degrees of freedom. The simplest short-term solution might be to treat neighborhoods as random effects instead of as fixed effects in your logistic regression, using for example the glmer function in the R lme4 package. That takes into account the differences among neighborhoods, as you have been instructed, but only uses up 1 degree of freedom in the analysis as you are modeling the distribution of effects among neighborhoods rather than the individual neighborhood effects. That might allow a straightforward analysis of all the other variables in a single model without the dangers of stepwise selection. LASSO would certainly be a useful way to further select among the remaining predictors if necessary. You also, however, must be open to the possibility that the predictors you measured bear no relation to the choice of participation.
