@Sean However, factoring out common finctionality into a base class, then reusing that in other descendant classes is a deeply elegant thing, IMHO! But "procedural" developers have been doing that for decades anyway. The syntax and terminology might differ, but the effect is identical. There is more to OOP than "reusing common functionality in a base class", and I might even go so far as to say that that is hard to describe as OOP at all; calling the same function from different bits of code is a technique as old as the subprocedure itself.
