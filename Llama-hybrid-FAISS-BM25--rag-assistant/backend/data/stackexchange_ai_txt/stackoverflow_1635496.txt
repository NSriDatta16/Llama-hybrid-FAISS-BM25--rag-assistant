Use something like Fiddler to expose the exact HTTP response coming from the servers. Fudge the client's User-Agent string to match the iPhone browser (or just use Safari?) and compare the output from IIS 5.1 and 7.5. Obviously the response streams are not identical or it would be working on both. You could also use NetMon, which is a great tool... and would allow you to test with the iPhone itself. Sorry I don't have a specific answer for you, but I think you're going to have to get your hands dirty with this one.
