It sounds to me like you've found a good solution. I'm not so sure you should try to have duplicate values for SKU for two reasons. First the whole point of SKU is that it is a unique identifier. That's its only reason for existing. If you're going to have duplicate values, then it's not a unique identifier; it's just another attribute. But of course Magento still needs a unique identifier to work, which means that this is an extra field, which takes us exactly where you are now. That said we come to my second point which is this... I'm not exactly a Magento guru, but I've built my share of e-commerce sites and one thing I've learned is that they depend on certain unbreakable rules to work properly. One of them is that unique identifiers are unique , both on the database and application level. As such, a large part of the website depends on this to function correctly. Which I'm pretty sure goes for Magento too. So trying to change such a basic premise in something so complicated will only lead to horrors and a slow descent into madness.
