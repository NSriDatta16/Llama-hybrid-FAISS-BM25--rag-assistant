You need to perform Group By The linq you need is something like: var query = from item in inputTable group item by new { Group = item.Group, TimePoint = item.TimePoint } into grouped select new { Group = grouped.Key.Group, TimePoint = grouped.Key.TimePoint, AverageValue = grouped.Average(x => x.Value) } ; For more Linq samples, I highly recommend the 101 Linq samples page - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336747#avgGrouped
