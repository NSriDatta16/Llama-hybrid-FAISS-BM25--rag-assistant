Think of a matrix control as a 'design time pivot table' Once it has been designed and it has rendered the data, the output is fixed - you cannot drag and drop like you would with a pivot table. The matrix control can have dynamic row/column groupings which will grow with your data. It's pretty easy to use once you get your head around the concept of 'inscope' To create dynamic columns, you just need to create a column grouping (towards the top right section of the matrix control once you have dragged it on to the form) Just tell it which field to use as a grouping.
