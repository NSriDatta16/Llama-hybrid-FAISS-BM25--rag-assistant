This looks like a binary classification to me, so you can google binary classification on Google. There're many possibilities, however, I don't think the decision boundary will be linear, so a simple linear model should not work (but you can check). Bioinformaticians have used support-vector machine very effectively. For example, SVM has been successfully in breast cancer diagnostic. Your problem is even easier because your output will have just two states. SVM has also been used for genetic variants; the outputs are also two possibilities; true variant or false variant , the inputs are also biological data, so you might want to take a quick look.
