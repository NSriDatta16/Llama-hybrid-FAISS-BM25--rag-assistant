You should test everything that you can test. Apart from Views (aspx and ascx files) that pretty much includes all the rest of your code. These days, the "M" in MVC is usually understood as a ViewModel , which is a dumb data structure with limited (and self-contained) behavior. Part of the Controller's responsibility is to map back and forth from the underlying Domain Model to ViewModels. You can use ordinary unit testing frameworks to unit test your Domain Model as well. Test-Driven Development gives you the best assurance that you get as high a Test Coverage as possible.
