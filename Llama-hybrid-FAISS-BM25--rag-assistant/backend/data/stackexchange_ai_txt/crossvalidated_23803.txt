Grid search and tolerance in libsvm

I'm using libsvm and the 3-fold cross validation to select the best C and gamma, but I'm not sure for the range to use in the grid search. Is there any standard way to choose this range? I used: log2c =(-10:3:4) and log2g=exp(-10:3:4) If I change the tolerance -e , the result change, can any one clarify tis point for me? thank you.
