OpenCV - Error C2244

I'm currently on vacation far away from my desktop, however I wanted to practice my c++ in particular with openCV, so I brought my laptop along. Given time and family constraints I didn't get everything set up in time with the libraries before flying. I've set everything up with regards to VS 2010 as I recall doing on my desktop a while ago, but on compiling the test example on the openCV website (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/VisualC%2B%2B) I receive the following errors: Error 3 error C2244: 'cv::Matx ::diag' : unable to match function definition to an existing declaration C:\Program Files\OpenCV2.2\include\opencv2\core\operations.hpp 372 Error 4 error C2244: 'cv::Matx ::diag' : unable to match function definition to an existing declaration C:\Program Files\OpenCV2.2\include\opencv2\core\operations.hpp 448 which in turn shows me: template inline Matx Matx ::diag(const Matx & d) { Matx M; for(int i = 0; i template inline Matx Matx ::diag() const { diag_type d; for( int i = 0; i I've looked into this error on the msdn and have looked on the openCV forums, but I couldn't find record of this specific error and I'm not sure how to resolve it. Is it also problematic that I'm running the 64 bit version of Windows 7? I read that openCV2.2 is compatible however previously while the programs would compile, it kept on saying the .dll files were missing even though the PATH variable and directories were correct. Thanks, Jean-Pierre
