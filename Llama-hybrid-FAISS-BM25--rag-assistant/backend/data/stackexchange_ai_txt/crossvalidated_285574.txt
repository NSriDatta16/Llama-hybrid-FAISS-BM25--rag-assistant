Why do parametric models learn more slowly by design?

Quoting from this paper, second paragraph: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04080.pdf [Deep] learning is still slow and based on large datasets...this, in our view, is mostly due to the parametric aspect of the model, in which training examples need to be slowly learnt by the model into its parameters. Assuming the claim here is valid, I'm not quite sure that I understand it -- what does it mean that "examples need to be learnt into its parameters," and why does this cause parametric models to learn more slowly? Don't non-parametric models depend more on data, in some sense, because their structure isn't specified a priori?
