File Uploads Not Working When Deployed To Server

I recently embarked on the endeavor of creating my own asynchronous file upload components for ASP.NET. I took lessons learned form Darren Johnstone's FileUpload project and created an HttpModule for extracting the files from the submitted data. I got everything working as it should in testing with VS 2008 using the Development Server. I even went so far during my testing to ensure that the request was being intercepted by the module before the files began uploading. After I was satisfied with things, I deployed the project to our web server (Win 2008 w/ IIS 7). I was horrified to learn that the controls were not functioning when deployed. After some remote debugging, I found that the HttpApplication.AuthenticateRequest event (my location for hooking in to the process) was not being invoked until the files were completely uploaded. I have checked everything that I can think of, and still have been unable to find a reason for this change in behavior. Any ideas?
