Looks like that you have unstructured, or at best semi-structured data. Classic relational DB tables are not ideal for this, unless you use XML as storage. You may consider coming up with an intermediate report-definition language and then storing that in a DB, usually as XML. MS SQL server, Oracle, and DB2 support storage and query of XML data. After some thinking.. You could also look into the observation pattern and see if you could adapt it to this example. Although the pattern is OO, it can be done in SQL. It is a bit long explanation, but I have published a simplified model here ; hope you find this useful.
