If the web server has regular network access to that share and can read the image files, you can create a new MVC controller Image with default action Index that takes one string parameter called fn . The action would create a new FileResult from the parameter. Then, when you generate the tag, set the url to something like /image/?fn=\\share\image.png . (Don't forget to add the proper route for it, of course) If the web server has no access to that share, but the page user has access, you can try setting the tag to the file:// URL for the image. However, this is going to be fragile and might or might not work, depending on the user's OS and browser configuration. Update: Do read the security implications @blowdart mentioned in his answer.
