Bad idea. Basically you should use your relational database as a relational database. Key/value pairs ordinarily aren't the advised storage method but at least single rows with a single key and a single value are "correct". If you put multiple pairs in one row, it raises a number of issues: How do you find a particular key? Can that key be in k1, k2 or k3? Or is it always in a specific column? How do you enforce that? How do you make it performant? Model your entities as entities with known attributes. That's what databases are for.
