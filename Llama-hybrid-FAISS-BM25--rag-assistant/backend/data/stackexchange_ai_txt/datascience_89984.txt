The distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens model is the DistilBERT base model for natural language inference (NLI) using the MEAN pooling strategy for CLS tokens. For more information on the DistilBERT base model, have a look at the original paper . The pooling strategy is simply the way the model combines the different embeddings (and thus information) from the different layers.
