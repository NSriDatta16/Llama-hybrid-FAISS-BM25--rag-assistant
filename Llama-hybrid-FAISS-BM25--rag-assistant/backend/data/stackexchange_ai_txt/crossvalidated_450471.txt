Missing data is always tough to deal with, and there is no definitive right answer. There are multiple ways to perform data imputation, from nearest-neighbors (take the average of the closest data points with non-null value in the relevant field), to global max/average. Each of these have application-specific pros and cons, and I'd try to look at your data or experiment to see which one of these methods is most appropriate. It is also possible to use the email subscription date and simply copy/replace that feature, but again, it depends on the application, and I don't think there's a single right answer. As an added point, I would also ask yourself if k-means is really the best way to cluster this data given the features that you have. A good way to validate this assumption is to see if the similarity metric of k-means (intra-cluster variance) would result in a "good" cluster for your data, especially since you have missing values. In other words, think about what points "should" be close together and what points "shouldn't" be close, and work backwards from there to find an appropriate algorithm. For example, here's a decent survey of a few other clustering algorithms. K-means, however, is a great starting point.
