LSTM with input of actual time step

I'm working on an implementation of LSTM neural network to forecast energy consumption. I have a dataset with load, series of weather parameters and indicator of it's bank holiday or not. I first did a network with input of 24 lag (using function from this tutorial ). So I have a dataset like this, but with 18 variables and from ( $t_{-24}$ ) var1(t-1) var2(t-1) var1(t) var2(t) 1 0.0 50.0 1 51 2 1.0 51.0 2 52 3 2.0 52.0 3 53 4 3.0 53.0 4 54 5 4.0 54.0 5 55 6 5.0 55.0 6 56 7 6.0 56.0 7 57 8 7.0 57.0 8 58 9 8.0 58.0 9 59 And I have my LSTM network: model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(train_X.shape[1], train_X.shape[2]))) model.add(Dense(1)) model.compile(loss='mae', optimizer='Adam') And currently I use var1(t-1) and var2(t-1) to predict var2(t) value. But var2 is correlated with value of var1 . I have value var1(t) and I want to use it to predict var2(t) , but I don't know how to do that. I tried to fit my neural network with var1(t-1) , var2(t-1) and var1(t) but it don't match with then input matrix which is (value, lagged hours, number of variables)
