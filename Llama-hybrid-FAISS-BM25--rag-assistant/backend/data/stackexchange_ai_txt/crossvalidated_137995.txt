Is there a way to allow seasonality in regression coefficients?

Say I have a time series, G t , and a covariate B t . I want to find the relationship between them by the ARMA model: G t = Z t + β 0 + β 1 B t where the residual Z t follows some ARMA process. The problem is: I know for sure that β 0 and β 1 varies with the time of the year. Yet I do not want to fit a separate model to each month because that introduces discontinuity into my time series, which means I cannot calculate the autocorrelation function of the final residuals. So, is there a time series model (or family of models, I wonder) that allows the correlation coefficients of its covariates to change seasonally? ======================== Edit: Thank you for those who replied here. I decided to just use seasonal dummies, but got busy so failed to reply in time.
