Two independent ListViews on the same screen + TextView header

I have two ListViews, each of them containing a String[] that I created locally. I wanted to show both of them on the same screen, but still maintaining their properties (List 1 having its background color, while List 2 has its). Can this be accomplished? Also, I'm trying to add a locally created TextView to the screen; I've tried addHeaderView() but it throws a Source not Found exception, with a BlockLayoutRequest set to false. I don't know what this means nor what's causing the error, can anyone point out what's wrong? Here's my code: Resources r = getResources(); String[] horarios_ida = r.getStringArray(R.array.horarios_b_1_dragao); String[] aplicaveis_ida = HorariosAplicaveis(horarios_ida); String[] horarios_volta = r.getStringArray(R.array.horarios_b_2_dragao); String[] aplicaveis_volta = HorariosAplicaveis(horarios_volta); ListView ida = new ListView(this); ListView volta = new ListView(this); TextView header = new TextView(this); header.setText("DASS"); ida.addHeaderView(header); //throws error //displays the first array correctly, but I don't know what to do for the 2nd one if(aplicaveis_ida.length>0) { setListAdapter(new ArrayAdapter (this, R.layout.b_dragao, aplicaveis_ida)); } ida = getListView(); ida.setTextFilterEnabled(true); setContentView(ida);
