Modelling rare outcome in treatment evaluation

This question is related to my previous question . I am conducting a treatment evaluation in a retrospective cohort study. My dataset has 2000+ cases, each with 48 monthly observations (24 pre- and 24 post-treatment). Treatment was delivered individually and the study has been conceptualised using a multiple baseline design. I would like to assess the change (rates) in the outcome pre- / post-treatment and compare it to the change in the outcome among non-treated patients over the same period. The outcome occurs rarely in both treated and non-treated cases (the vast majority of cases do not experience the outcome at any point). I am seeking guidance on modelling techniques that may be appropriate. I have considered multilevel modelling (time within patient) and interrupted time series; however, given the outcome occurs rarely, I am unclear whether the data should be modelled at the group or individual level. I have also considered using conditional poisson regression, but I am unsure how to implement this in R. Assistance required Would anyone be able to provide some guidance on modelling techniques that are appropriate for use when the outcome is rare? Also, would anyone be able to suggest how to implement conditional poisson regression in R? I have attached a mock (case-level) dataset below. I am aware it is not in the correct format for longitudinal analyses, but I am hoping my question can be answered without needing access to data. structure(list(id = 1:20, tx = structure(c(1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L), .Label = c("No", "Yes"), class = "factor"), preNbr = c(0L, 0L, 4L, 2L, 10L, 2L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 2L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 9L, 0L, 1L, 4L, 5L, 0L), postNbr = c(2L, 0L, 0L, 4L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 5L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L)), .Names = c("id", "tx", "preNbr", "postNbr"), row.names = c(4L, 31L, 32L, 33L, 34L, 35L, 36L, 37L, 38L, 40L, 41L, 42L, 43L, 46L, 47L, 48L, 49L, 51L, 52L, 56L), class = "data.frame")
