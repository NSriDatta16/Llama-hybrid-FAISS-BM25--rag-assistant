What is the hypothesis space used by this AND gate Perceptron?

Per this post The hypothesis space used by a machine learning system is the set of all hypotheses that might possibly be returned by it. Per this post , the Perceptron algorithm makes prediction $$ \begin{equation} \hat y = \begin{cases} 1 & wx+b >= 0\\ 0 & wx+b we can conclude that the model to achieve an AND gate, using the Perceptron algorithm is $x_1 + x_2 â€“ 1.5$ In this case, what is the hypothesis space used by this AND gate Perceptron?
