Trying to get rid of a c++ boost warning

Whenever I include boost in my project I get a million of these warnings. Does anyone know how I can get rid of the warnings? ../depends\boost/config/abi_prefix.hpp(19) : warning C4103: 'depends\boost\config\abi_prefix.hpp' : alignment changed after including header, may be due to missing #pragma pack(pop) I know I can do a #pragma to disable the warning, but I'd like to know the reason for these warnings.
