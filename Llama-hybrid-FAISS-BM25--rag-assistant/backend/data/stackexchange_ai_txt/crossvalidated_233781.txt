Estimate time for mean reversion of two time series

The objective is to identify if two time series are cointegrated and then calculate their time for mean reversion using half life of mean reversion. How is half life of mean reversion related to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process ? Which R package would you suggest to perform the above experiments (cointegration and half life of mean reversion)?
