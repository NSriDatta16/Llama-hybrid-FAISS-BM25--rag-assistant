How to copy a file to output folder without modifications? Visual C#

I would like to publish a project with a mp3 file in the application folder, so that I can use it when app is running. Is there some way to do it? My current attempt is to click on the mp3 and drag it to the "Solution Explorer". When the program is published, the output folder does have a "play.mp3" file, but it is named "play.mp3.deploy", which turns it unusable
