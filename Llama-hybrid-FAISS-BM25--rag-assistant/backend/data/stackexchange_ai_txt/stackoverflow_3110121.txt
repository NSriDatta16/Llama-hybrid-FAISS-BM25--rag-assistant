Is there a way to copy a source code build of Qt to another location?

We're building a Windows and Mac app using a commercial licence of Qt, which we're building from a git clone. We've got a build setup using Hudson with potentially several build agents, and what I'd like to do for Windows at least is build once then deploy the build Qt to each agent (rather than have to build Qt on each agent). It seems, however, that the built Qt doesn't like to be moved or copied. Is there a way around this? One thought we had was whether there was some setting that would build Qt so it resembled their binary distribution, but I can't see a way to do this.
