How do i force the cxf-codegen-plugin (CXF wsdltojava) Maven plugin to generate for Javaee 5?

whilst using Maven and the cxf-codegen-plugin from apache it seems to generate code for Java ee 6. I can tell by the error message ../generated-sources/cxf/.../cxf/gen/prod/IProd.java: cannot find symbol symbol : class Action location: interface ....IProd Action is only in jee6++ How can i force it to generate for Javaee 5? Are there any flags - cant find any. Everything is set to Java 1.5 on computer,Java_Home and java -version gives 1.5.. i have the java EE 5 api on compilepath. The plugin in maven is set to 1.5. Still... EDIT: Solved, see comments.
