TeamCity stopped working once I added NUnit to the mix

I'm struggling a lot trying to get our build server going. I am currently running tests in a Windows XP virtual machine, and have installed TeamCity v5.0.3, build 10821. I am using NUnit v2.5.3. I finished the initial setup with TeamCity without any issues at all, provided that I use the sln2008 build runner that makes the entire process almost brainless. It's really quite nice that way, and very satisfying to see your first successful automated build. Now it's time to kick it up a notch and I wanted to get NUnit working. I keep the NUnit 2.5.3 assemblies in an external libs folder in SVN, so I checked that out onto the test system. I selected NUnit 2.5.3 from the build runner options, as the online instructions had recommended. But when I build, I get the following error: Window1.xaml.cs(14,7): error CS0246: The type or namespace name ‘NUnit’ could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) Window1.xaml.cs(28,10): error CS0246: The type or namespace name ‘Test’ could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) Window1.xaml.cs(28,10): error CS0246: The type or namespace name ‘TestAttribute’ could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) Everything compiles great in the IDE. From finding blog posts and submitting comments, I got some advice and confirmed the following: I have the HintPath value set properly in my project file (points to the external lib) I can also do a full Release and Debug build from the command line using msbuild I have tried do use the NUnit installer so nunit.framework.dll gets registered into the GAC I have changed the build agent's logon account to be a user on the test system, rather than LOCAL SYSTEM. Nothing seems to help... can anyone else here offer me some advice on what to try next?
