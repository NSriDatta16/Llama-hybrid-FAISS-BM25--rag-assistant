Anytime I need to integrate with an external entity using NAnt I either end up using the exec task or writing a custom task . Given the information you posted it would seem that writing your own would indeed be a good solution, However you state you're not happy with it. Can you elaborate a bit on why you don't think you current solution is an elegant one? Update Not knowing internal details it seems like you've solved it pretty well with a custom task. From what I've heard, that's how I would have done it. Maybe a new solution will show itself in time, but for now be light on yourself!
