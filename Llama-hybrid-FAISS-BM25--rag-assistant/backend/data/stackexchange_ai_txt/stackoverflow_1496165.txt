HTML5 has no limits on the length of attribute values. As the spec says, "This version of HTML thus returns to a non-SGML basis." Later on, when describing how to parse HTML5, the following passage appears ( emphasis added): The algorithm described below places no limit on the depth of the DOM tree generated, or on the length of tag names, attribute names, attribute values , text nodes, etc. While implementors are encouraged to avoid arbitrary limits, it is recognized that practical concerns will likely force user agents to impose nesting depth constraints. Therefore, (theoretically) there is no limit to the length/size of HTML5 attributes . See revision history for original answer covering HTML4.
