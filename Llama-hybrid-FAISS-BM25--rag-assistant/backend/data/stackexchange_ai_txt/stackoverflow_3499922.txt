You can also test the boolean returned by compress() to tell if the compression succeeded or not. As for getting it to succeed, I don't know if there is enough information here to do that. Specifically I am curious as to the true location of the OutputStream as I assume the byteArrayOutputStream is not the actual stream used to save the icon for later use. Since they are on 1.5 devices, I have a hunch that you are trying to store this icon to either your cache dir or a directory located on phone storage. I mean it could range from a faulty I/O device to insufficient storage space. My hunch from it happening on 1.5 devices is that there is not enough space on the physical device as most (not all) phones on 1.5 do not ship with much internal storage. Also I don't think changing the compression quality on PNG format will matter as PNG is lossless.
