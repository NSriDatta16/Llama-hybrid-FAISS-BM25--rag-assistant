The above is correct, but what the cheatsheet does not show is that you need to open the file. This may seem obvious, but I neglected to do it because the cheatsheet didn't say I had to. here is the code that will allow you to write to the files correctly ---------- code: // write Mat objects to the freakin file FileStorage fs("CamModel.yml", FileStorage::WRITE); if (!fs.isOpened()){ fs.open("CamModel.yml", FileStorage::WRITE); fs > cameraMatrix; fs["mtxDist"] >> distCoeffs; fs.release(); } Nevermind, this still doesn't work. sorry for the wasted post.
