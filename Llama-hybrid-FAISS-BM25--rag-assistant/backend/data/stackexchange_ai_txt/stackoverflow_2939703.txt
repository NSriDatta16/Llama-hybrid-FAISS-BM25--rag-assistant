Okay, I took a crack at this, I really don't think there's any elegant way without using a custom query; $attachment_IDs = $wpdb->get_col( "SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_parent > 0 AND post_type = 'attachment' GROUP BY post_parent ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT 5" ); if ($attachment_IDs) { $attachments = get_posts(array('include' => implode(',', $attachment_IDs))); // do what you like! } The query gets the five most recent attachments whereby each attachment has a unique parent. UPDATE: Sorry, just realised you wanted to query by category too - add this big old join in after the SELECT; INNER JOIN $wpdb->term_relationships ON ($wpdb->posts.ID = $wpdb->term_relationships.object_id) INNER JOIN $wpdb->term_taxonomy ON ($wpdb->term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id = $wpdb->term_taxonomy.term_taxonomy_id) And add this to the WHERE clause; AND $wpdb->term_taxonomy.term_id IN (YOUR_CATEGORY_ID)
