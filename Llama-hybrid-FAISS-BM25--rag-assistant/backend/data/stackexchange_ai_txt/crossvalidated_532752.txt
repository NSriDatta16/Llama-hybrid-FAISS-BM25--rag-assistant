Think Bayes Chapter 7: Prediction

Page 72, Think Bayes by Allen B. Downey. Author introduces the Boston Bruins problem where we are supposed to determine the posterior distribution of λ, where λ is the long-term average goals per game. In section 7.2 he proceeds to compute the distribution of goals for each team. I have trouble understanding why this is done. Are these two not the same?
