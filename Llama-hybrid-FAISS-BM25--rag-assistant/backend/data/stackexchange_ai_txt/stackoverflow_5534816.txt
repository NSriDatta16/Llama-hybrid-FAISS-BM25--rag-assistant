MVC is a way of keeping your three main parts of the application separate for the purposes of increasing maintainability and usually with it, performance. For example, if you're using PHP 5.3 (you should be, late static binding, namespaces etc are very useful!), you can use a namespace for each of the sections of your application. Then, when you have an error in your application logic, you know exactly that you need to go to the model for a particular action and fix it. Views allow us to keep display logic separate from the business logic of the application. Some might use XHTML with inline kind of things, while some may prefer templates. This means when you edit the GUI or other outward facing part of your application, it will never have any impact on your business. It means all your code is organized and increases maintainability, while also modularizing your application. It's even better if you use an autoloader (always use spl_autoload_register('myAutoloader') rather than function __autoload($className) as this can be overriden by libraries and things) so your app only loads what's needed, when it's needed.
