I've tested it, with a home-made server and a simple response. Not sure if the response is well-formed because no browser understands it 100% OK. But here are the results: Firefox 67.0.1 (64-bit) : Renders only the last part, others are ignored. IE 11.503 : Saves all the content in a single file (including the boundaries), nothing is rendered. Chrome May 2019 : Saves all the content in a single file, nothing is rendered. Safari 4 : Saves all the content in a single file, nothing is rendered. Opera 10.10 : Something weird. Starts rendering the first part as plain/text, and then clears everything. The loading progress bar hangs on 31%. Here's the complete response, if anyone finds any error, please tell me and I'll try again: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 01 Dec 2009 23:27:30 GMT Vary: Accept-Encoding,User-Agent Content-Length: 681 Content-Type: Multipart/mixed; boundary="sample_boundary"; Multipart not supported :( --sample_boundary Content-Type: text/css; charset=utf-8 Content-Location: http://localhost:2080/file.css body { background-color: yellow; } --sample_boundary Content-Type: application/x-javascript; charset=utf-8 Content-Location: http://localhost:2080/file.js alert("Hello from a javascript!!!"); --sample_boundary Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Base: http://localhost:2080/ Hello from a html --sample_boundary--
