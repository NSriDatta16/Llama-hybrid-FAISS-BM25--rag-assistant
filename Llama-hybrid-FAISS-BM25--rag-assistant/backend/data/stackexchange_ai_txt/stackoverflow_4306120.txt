SurfaceView: ClassCastException, unable to start activity

Trying to get an Android 2.2 application to start up with a SurfaceView as the base view with a button placed atop it located near the bottom of the screen. So far, no luck. It crashes every time it attempts to launch. I've checked to make sure that the activity is registered in the manifest. Here's my java code: public class Dragable extends Activity { /** Called when the activity is first created. */ @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); } and here's my main.xml : and my manifest: and here's my error: 11-29 11:58:52.620: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(512): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.example/com.example.Dragable}: java.lang.ClassCastException: android.view.SurfaceView Can't seem to find anything related doing searches on SO. My appologies if this has been asked before.
