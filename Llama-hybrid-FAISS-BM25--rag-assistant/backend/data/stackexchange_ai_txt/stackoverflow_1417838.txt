iPhone fonts for Windows

I would like to support the default fonts provided by iPhone on my Windows server. Some of the fonts exist by default but others, such as "Zapfino" and "MarkerFelt" are not. The idea is to create PDF files on iPhone and render them on a Windows machine. Since there is no (known-to-me) way for embedding fonts in a PDF created using the iPhone SDK, I would like to install these fonts on my Windows machine. Is there an iPhone font package I could use?
