Change Point Analysis for Environmental Data

Does anyone know of somewhere with resources on using change point analysis for determining environmental threshold values? Let me emphasize that this is NOT time series data. Change point analysis is often used in ecology to determine a point along a gradient (let's say temperature) at which ecology changes drastically. So let's say a fish species dies out if water temp rises above 25C; using change point analysis would identify this point in an x-y relationship of temperature and fish counts. I know this can be done but am having trouble finding suitable instructions for doing it myself. I use R and have the changepoint package but cannot figure out how to get it to work. Am I using the right package? Should I try something else? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
