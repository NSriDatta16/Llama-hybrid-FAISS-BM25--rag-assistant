Not a lot of info to go off from, but a few things to note: OP mentions the marginal distribution is roughly symmetric and discrete. I've surmised this from their mention of a KDE plot. OP mentions "To me it doesn't seem to make sense to use a Poisson because the variance doesn't equal the mean". Now, since OP mentions examining the marginal distribution I will assume OP has computed the sample mean and variance of the outcome and noticed they are not equal. The size of the discrepancy is not mentioned, but let's assume for now they are so different that sampling variability could not reasonably explain the difference. OP doesn't mention any covariates so I'm inclined to think they are only looking at the marginal distribution. There is no mention of what kind of predictions OP would like to make. Let's assume for now that they are interested mostly in the posterior and they could make predictions of many types from there. Perhaps OP's data looks like set.seed(0) n The data are roughly symmetric, discrete, and the mean is not equal to the variance. Can we model this with Bayesian statistics? Sure, why not. Let's assume a Gamma prior on the rate parameter and use a Poisson likelihood. I'll assume OP has enough data so that the prior is negligible. Our model will be $$ y_i \sim \mbox{Poisson}(\lambda_i) $$ $$ \lambda_i \sim \mbox{Gamma}(1, 1) $$ Because the prior is conjugate, we have a posterior we can easily sample from (its a negative binomial distribution, but let's pretend we don't know that for a moment). I will simulate 1000 datasets from the posterior predictive distribution and compare them to my y (again, pretending we don't know the x I've used). Here are some histograms from the posterior predictive, real data in dark blue. The replications look fine, nothing too different Additionally, we can look at the means and variances of the generated data. While the data are more variable than the replicates, it could be argued that the posterior predictive generates data that looks like the real data. Anyway, I'm not saying OP should use this model. I'm trying to show OP how you can use Bayesian statistics with a discrete likelihood even though the mean and variance are not equal. I'm under the impression OP is being too restrictive with their modelling assumptions.
