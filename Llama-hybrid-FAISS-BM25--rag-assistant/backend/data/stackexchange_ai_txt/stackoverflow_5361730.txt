Skip for loop when if statement is met inside for loop

I have an if statement inside a for loop. When the the condition in if statement is true, I want to break out of the for loop. here is what exactly I have if (data 260 && data 260 && data2 voltage || average2 > voltage) { digitalWrite(pump, LOW); digitalWrite(valve, LOW); digitalWrite(valve2, LOW); } sum = 0; sum2 = 0; lcd.clear(); } It seams not going throw the whole conditions.
