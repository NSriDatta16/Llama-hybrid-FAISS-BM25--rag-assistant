Why do you think MANOVA will answer your question? It will give you the (linear) combination of the m variables that maximize the difference between the centroids ( k = 2, in your case) assuming that dispersion is the same (and that everything is multi-normal...). So that seems almost the opposite of your interest of testing for differences in dispersion (as you commented below your question). By the way, as far as I know you need m (per group) > n to get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Without m >> n you won't have enough power for significance tests. If what you want to resume what all those variables have to say about describing your observations, then PCA may be useful as an indirect method (i.e., first resume those variables in independent components that maximize the explanation of samples heterogeneity, then compare groups based on those components) and linear correlation among variables is not a problem there (is what the components are all about). The particular solution (e.g., important variables on the first component) will be very unstable, anyway, because n m .
