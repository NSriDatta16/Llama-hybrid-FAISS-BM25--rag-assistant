If you want to interlace Spanish and English paragraphs, and have them line up approximately correctly, then what you want is to write your translations word-by-word (or several words by several words), and use a gloss package that can wrap long sentences. I've done this before using gloss.sty . An example of its use(the goal was to gloss each word with its part of speech): \gloss Both knowledge and wisdom extend man's reach. Knowledge led to cjc nn0 cjc nn0 vvb {nn0 pos} {nn0 pun} nn0 vvd prp \gloss computers, wisdom to chopsticks. Unfortunately our association is {nn2 pun} nn0 prp {nn2 pun} av0 dps nn1 vbz \gloss overinvolved with the former. The latter will have to wait for a ad0 prp at0 {nn0 pun} at0 nn0 vm0 vhb to0 vvb avp at0 \gloss more sublime day. av0 aj0 {nn1 pun} \unhbox\gline The package lines things up words from the first language with words from the second "language" using spaces. To line up multiple words in one language with a single word (or multiple words) from the other language, use braces to group the multiple words. Though the lines here are interlaced, this is just for my editing convenence. You could write really long lines if you wanted to, and the gloss algorithm will wrap them properly. I've also used a two-column paragraph-by-paragraph approach using the parallel package.
