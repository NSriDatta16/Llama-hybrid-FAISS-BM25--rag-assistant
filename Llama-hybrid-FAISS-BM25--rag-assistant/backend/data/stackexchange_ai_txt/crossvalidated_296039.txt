We also know that logistic regression assigns a datasample to class y=1 if the posterior probability p of class y=1 is bigger than 0.5. This is not true; logistic regression is not a classifier . But the notation here is a little confusing because $p$ does not appear in your expression for the loss. The term $y^{i}\log(h(x^i))$ quantifies the case where the true label is "$y=1$", but the prediction is "$y=0$". This is not true. The way to think about the log-loss function is that $y^i$ works as a "switch." If $y^i=1$, then the term $\log(h(x^i))$ is added to the loss; if $y^i=0$, the term $\log(1-h(x^i))$ is added to the loss. The prediction "$y=0$" is however only done when $h(x) When we're considering the log-loss, at no point do we consider whether or not $h(x^i)>0.5$. If $y^i=1$ but $h(x^i)
