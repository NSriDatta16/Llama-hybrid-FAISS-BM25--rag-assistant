How can I forecast using a covariate of different length?

I have a time series of 100 observations, and I want to make forecasts for the next 2 values. time series: Y(t) = Y(1), Y(2), ... Y(100) forecast: Y(101), Y(102) I have to use an arima (2,0,0) model in order to make prediction. Secondly, a covariate of length 50 may helps to improve accuracy, but it relates only to the last 50 values of the time series. covariate: X(t) = X(1), X(2), ... X(50) time series: Y(t) = Y(1), ... Y(51), ... Y(100) It means that X(1) has influence on Y(51) , X(2) on Y(51) , ... and X(50) on Y(100) . I have no values of X prior to 1, so I can not take a covariate of length 100 to cover the entire time series. The main concerns are: I don't want to dismiss the covariate, since it improves the accuracy. I don't want to start the time series at Y(51) since it reduces the accuracy. I don't know how to use covariates of different length. How can I solve this issue, and make the most precise forecast of all? Thanks in advance
