1) Not that I know of, and this probably isn't the best way to approach it. 2) Assuming you have the object you want flicked and the path at design-time, I've previously implemented dragging and flicking along a path by creating a timeline animation that represents the movement across the entire path. At runtime, I capture contacts on that object, feed them to a Affine2DManipulationProcessor, and seek the animation based on the manipulation events. So in my case I was creating a drawer. When the user touched the drawer, I start the animation and pause it immediately. If the user drags it open, I seek the animation the appropriate amount forward based on how far the manipulation processor tells me they've moved. To get the flick behavior, you just hand off the manipulation to the Affine2DInertiaProcessor and continue handling the delta events. This all works surprisingly well.
