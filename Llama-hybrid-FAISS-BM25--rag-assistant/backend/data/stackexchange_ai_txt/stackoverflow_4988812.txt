I figured it out! Dragging the slider changes the run loop mode. I was maximizing my split view using an animation which has an NSTimer as it's backbone. I was adding the timer to the default run loop mode, when i should have been doing this: [[NSRunLoop mainRunLoop] addTimer:timer forMode:NSRunLoopCommonModes];
