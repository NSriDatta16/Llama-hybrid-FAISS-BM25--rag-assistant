Regarding samples gotten from MCMC

In one article explaining MCMC, I once read the following statement. The idea of sampling methods is the following. Letâ€™s assume first that we have a way (MCMC) to draw samples from a probability distribution defined up to a factor. Then, instead of trying to deal with intractable computations involving the posterior, we can get samples from this distribution (using only the not normalised part definition) and use these samples to compute various punctual statistics such as mean and variance or even to approximate the distribution by Kernel Density Estimation. Based on this above explanation, my understanding is that MCMC get samples from unnormalized distribution, but these samples can be used to compute the functional statistics of the corresponding normalized distribution. Is my understanding correct? How to prove the functional statistics calculated using samples from unnormalized distribution will be the same as the one from normalized distribution?
