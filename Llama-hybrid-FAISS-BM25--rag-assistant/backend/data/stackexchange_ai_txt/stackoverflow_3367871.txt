In principle service layers are a good idea but if you're simply introducing one for the sake of it then it's a lot of effort for no return. The main benefit you will get from a service layer is that you will have a lot more flexibility in the type of clients you can connect to it. At the moment it's likely that the only application that can use your DAL is your ASP.Net app by adding a service layer and exposing it using WCF end points you'll have the option of connecting other SOAP or REST clients which is a good thing for future enhancement. However if you're only ever planning on using your DAL with your existing ASP.Net app then there's no guarantee that you will gain anything and in fact could make your life harder by adding a service layer. If you do all your data retrieval server-side, i.e. don't use AJAX, then a service layer would be pretty pointless.
