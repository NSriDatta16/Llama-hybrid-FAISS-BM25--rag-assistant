What you're looking for is link_to_remote or link_to_function . link_to_remote will be fetching the rest of the article from your controller and replacing/appending to a DOM element with a partial via RJS. This allows you to minimize unnecessary data being sent, and facilitates handling users that have javascript disabled. With link_to_function, the entire article will be served when the page is loaded, but the everything beyond the first 300 characters will be hidden by CSS. This is easier to set up but sends a lot more data, it also relies on the user having javascript enabled. Without looking at the source the average user probably couldn't distinguish between the two methods. Which choice you go with is up to you. Sorry, I haven't got time to provide code examples, but the internet is full of them.
