It's unlikely to cause problems as VS 2010 is primarily designed for developing with the .NET 4.0 framework (although multi-targeting is implemented, like it was in VS 2008, just in a better manner). I (and no one I work with) ever had a problem with VS 2005 & VS 2008 installed side-by-side. In fact, it was strongly encouraged as we had legacy projects which were built in VS 2005 and although the upgrade to VS 2008 was minor (if staying with the .NET 2.0 framework for the projects) it was safer to not risk it. If you're really concerned about conflicts or potential issues using beta software may not be for you. If you do want to try it and still have reservations I'd suggest that you do use a separate VM with VS 2010 on it. I myself will be installing it side-by-side with VS 2008 on Vista (after backing up my VM) so if there are any problems I'll edit this post and report them.
