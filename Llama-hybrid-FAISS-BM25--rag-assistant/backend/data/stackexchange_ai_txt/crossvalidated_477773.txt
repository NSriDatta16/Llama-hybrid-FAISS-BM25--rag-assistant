In other words, your model is: $$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_3+\epsilon$$ Sure, each $x_i$ is constructed by some nonlinear function of observations, but by the time the model sees those values, the model is forming a linear combination of numbers. The model does not care about the source. That model is linear and can be fitted through the usual OLS $\hat{\beta}=(X^TX)^{-1}X^T Y$ . You then can calculate your PRESS statistic the usual way. You’re using the nonlinear basic functions that Jeff Miller talks about in this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=rVviNyIR-fI . Thus, your regression is linear. Also, I would encourage you to make a small example where you calculate the PRESS statistic as well as the results from LOOCV to confirm and convince yourself that the methods are the same. Since you’re working with financial data, you might have issues with time series, but that is for a separate question (perhaps one that will get more attention on quant.SE but would be totally on-topic here).
