No, it takes 1609 milliseconds of CPU in total. What is the duration? I bet the same or slighty more because I doubt SQL Agent queries use parallelism. Are you trying to reduce background processes using CPU? If so, then you reduce functionality by disabling SQL Agent (no backups then for example) and restarting SQL Server with switch -x You also can not stop "Audit logout" events... this is what happens when you disconnect or close a connection. However, are you maxing the processors? If so, you'll need to differentiate between "user" memory for queries and "system" memory used for paging or (god forbid) generating your parity on RAID 5 disks. High CPU can often be solved by more RAM and a better disk config.
