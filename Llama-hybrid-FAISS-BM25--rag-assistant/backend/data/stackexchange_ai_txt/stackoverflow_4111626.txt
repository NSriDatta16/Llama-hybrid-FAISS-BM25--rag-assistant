[touch hash] returns a hash code uniquely identifying the touch. Using it, you can track a specific touch through multiple events (ie Down, Move and Up) to distinqush multiple touches. So for example, when you get the "down" event, record the hash for each touch with the sprite it is associated with. Then on the subsequent move and up events, use the hashed of these events to find which sprite each refers to. Example: I got two touches, (1,1) touched sprite "A" and (2,2) touched sprite "B". The next event tells me I have two touches that were dragged to (3,3) and (4,4). The question is, did "A" get dragged to (3,3) and "B" to (4,4) or visa-versa? If you recorded the bashes for the original touches and recorded them with the sprites, the bashes for the new touches can point you back to their corresponding sprites.
