Find the kth PCA component by substract the k-1 first components

I'm trying to understand the PCA algorithm. I read that once I subtract the first component from the data, and then execute the algorithm again. The first PC I'll get in the second round is equivalent to the PC2 from the first PCA. Source for that is in Link1- Eq 7.11 , but it appears in many other places. I can't replicate the property in R, #Scale the data USArrests.1 Am I missing something?
