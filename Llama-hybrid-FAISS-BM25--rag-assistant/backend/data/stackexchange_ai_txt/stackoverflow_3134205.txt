Expand and Collapse Paragraphs with JQuery Inside of a Loop

I am attempting to write some jQuery code that will expand a paragraph when a link is clicked and once expanded present another link that will allow the paragraph to be collapsed. These paragraphs are all generated within a foreach loop and I am having trouble selecting the correct paragraph because I am not sure of the best way to create unique IDs to pass back to jQuery because there in a loop. Here is my view code: Show More Show Less And here is what I have so far with jQuery: $(document).ready(function() { $("p.expanded").hide(); $("a.expand").click(function() { $(this).parent().hide(); return false; }); }); I am able to hide the correct when clicking "Show More", however I am lost as to choosing the correct "expanded" paragraph and then implementing the opposite for collapsing. My thoughts so far are that I need to somehow make the elements in question have unique ideas. The $comment array does have an 'id' value that code be appended to an id name for each attribute making them unique, but I am still confused about how to properly select things with jQuery.
