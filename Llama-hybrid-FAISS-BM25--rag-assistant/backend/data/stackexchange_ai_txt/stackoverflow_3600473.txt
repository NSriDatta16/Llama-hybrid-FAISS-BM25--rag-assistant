jQuery.post() refreshing page in Firefox despite async: true

This is my first post and I have the feeling that this is something stupid. I have already been to this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/511947?tab=newest#tab-top although that still did not really help. I have 3 PHP pages. The main page is the one with all the jQuery on it: $(document).ready(function() { // for each trade, load the current comparisons $("# Div").load("functions/loadPriceSurveyComparisons.php", { trade: " " }); $("#addComp ").click(function() { $.post("functions/addPriceSurveyComparisons.php", { trade: " ", alb: $("#albProd ").val(), comp: $("#compProd ").val() }, function(data) { $("# Div").load("functions/loadPriceSurveyComparisons.php", { trade: " " }); }, "xml"); }); }); This page basically loads a list of items into div elements on load. $.load is used for this. The $.load has a callback which assigns click event handlers to 3 different HTML elements (hence the PHP echo of $trade). These click handlers basically do an AJAX request using $.post. The page being posted to is as follows: \n"; ?> This jquery.post() request for some reason refreshes the page in Firefox and I'm not seeing any errors generated. I can't even view the request with firebug in the Net tab as when the page refreshes this is cleared. What's also interesting is that no javascript at all is appearing in the script tab? But that's another headache I'm not gonna pay attention to right now. Please note that I am pretty much a noob when it comes to jQuery.
