Flex 3: Embedding MovieClip Symbol to Image Control programmatically

I've reviewed all the documentation and Google results surrounding this and I think I have everything setup correctly. My problem is that the symbol is not appearing in my app. I have a MovieClip symbol that I've embedded to my Flex Component. I need to create a new Image control for each item from my dataProvider and assign this embedded symbol as the Image's source. I thought it was simple but apparently not. Here's a stub of the code: [Embed(source="../assets/assetLib.swf", symbol="StarMC")] private var StarClass:Class; protected function rebuildChildren():void { iterator.seek( CursorBookmark.FIRST ); while ( !iterator.afterLast ) { child = new Image(); var asset:MovieClipAsset = new StarClass() as MovieClipAsset; (child as Image).source = asset; } } I know the child is being created because I can draw a shape and and that appears. Am I doing something wrong? Thank you!
