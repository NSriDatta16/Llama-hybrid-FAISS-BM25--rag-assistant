From your latest edit we can see that the estimated coefficients (which you call weights ) have changed. They must, since their role is to be multiplied with the $x$ 's, which was changed with the normalization (which I would have called standardization ). But the models are equivalent, in the sense that the fitted probabilities (logistic regression is a regression for probabilities) will be the same. To check that, ask your software for the fitted probabilities, and compare them. A simple way is to get the two sets of fitted probabilities and plot them against each other. I don't know how you do that in matlab, but it should be simple.
