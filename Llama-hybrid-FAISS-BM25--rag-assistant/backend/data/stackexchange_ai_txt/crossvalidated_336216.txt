TIme series features using tsfresh - vector similarity

I have a dataset where there exists 16 different classes. Each class has about 400 rows of 12 attributes(iowait, read_bytes, write_bytes, etc). Using tsfresh, I have generated about 45 features(iowait_mean, iowait_max, iowait_variance, etc) for each class, so I ended up with 16 rows where each row corresponds to a vector of features where the label belongs to one of the 16 classes. These are the details about the data I am working with. My question is: a)My test instance is another 400 data points comprising of 12 features, so I plan to pass this test data to tsfresh to generate a vector. The new vector will be compared with all the 16 unique vectors given in the image and the cosine similarity should give which class the test instance belongs to. When I tried this, the accuracy was poor. How can I improve my chances to classify better? b)Does a neural network help in solving this problem? Please let me know if you need additional information. It is assumed that all the records in the test instance, belong to the same class. Thank you
