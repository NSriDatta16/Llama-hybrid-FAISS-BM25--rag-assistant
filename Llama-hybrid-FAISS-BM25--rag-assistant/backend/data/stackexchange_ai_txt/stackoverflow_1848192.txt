From Starting MySQL as a Windows Service (3.x, 4.x): Before MySQL 4.0.2, no command-line arguments can be given following the --install option. MySQL 4.0.2 and up offers limited support for additional arguments: You can specify a service name immediately following the --install option. The default service name is MySQL. As of MySQL 4.0.3, if a service name is given, it can be followed by a single option. By convention, this should be --defaults-file=file_name to specify the name of an option file from which the server should read options when it starts. The use of a single option other than --defaults-file is possible but discouraged. --defaults-file is more flexible because it enables you to specify multiple startup options for the server by placing them in the named option file. For 5.x , it seems to be the same.
