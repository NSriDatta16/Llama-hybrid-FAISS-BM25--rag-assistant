Estimating effort is one of the hardest things to do in development and testing. In our company when a developer submits an update (complete with the formal documentation) to the Testing gang, it is the responsability of the developer to estimate the amount of testing required. I do not see how that could be otherwise. The estimates that I give to Testing are always a bit of a guess, but in general if I develop something for a week then I would estimate 2 days testing. Obviously, this does not need work well in a ll examples and need to be adapted based on the change in question. For example, I might spend a week working on an update that can be tested very quickly.
