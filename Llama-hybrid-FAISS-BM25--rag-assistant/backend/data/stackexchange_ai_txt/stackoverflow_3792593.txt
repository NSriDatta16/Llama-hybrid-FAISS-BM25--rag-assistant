If you want to go from idea to running software at speed of light, I recommend Python. Cross platform, mature, with a powerful and strong community, tons of tutorials, tested across industries, innumerable libraries and, most of all, a beautiful language. Now, if you want to understand computers and develop slower, but write killer cross platform applications, then the only answer is C. If you are metrosexual learn Haskell. ( just kidding - it is actually very elegant, sophisticated, and smart though) Good luck. Ps. In reality, it all depends what you want to do. C is awesome but it won't help you make a website in a reasonable amount of time. Python is beautiful, but I dont do large scale math in it. Haskell is a nut I'm yet to crack.
