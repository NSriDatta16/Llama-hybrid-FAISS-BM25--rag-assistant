How to account for NFL divisions for predicting playoff chances?

I'm trying to run logistic regression to find whether or not a team will make the playoffs based on their previous year stats, player awards, W-L record, etc. In the NFL, there are 2 conferences and 4 divisions within each conference. Every division winner makes the playoffs, plus 3 wildcard teams (the 3 wildcard teams are the 3 teams with the best record from the remaining non-division winners). This makes 7 teams making the playoffs from each Conference. The problem is, I do not know how to account for this in a logistic regression model. Theoretically, my model could predict 10 teams making the playoffs from one conference, and only 4 teams from the second conference, even though that is not possible. Does anyone know how I could go about accounting for these variables?
