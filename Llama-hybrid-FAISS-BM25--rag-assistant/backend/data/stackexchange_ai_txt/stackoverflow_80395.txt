explode() is for pansies. This is a job for regular expressions ! Totally untested, but something like that ought to work. Note that this code assumes that the hour fragment will always be two digits (eg, a three-hour video would be 03:00:00 instead of 3:00:00 ). EDIT: In retrospect, using regular expressions for this is probably a case of over-engineering; explode() will do the job just as well and probably even be faster in this case. But it was the first method to come to mind when I read the question.
