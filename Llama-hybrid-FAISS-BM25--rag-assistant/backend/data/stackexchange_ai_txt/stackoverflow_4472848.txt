Is there a shorthand for assigning from $1...$n after matching in ruby

I am looking for a shorthand for the following ruby fragment: var = 'foo 123 456 789 bar'; var =~ /^foo +(\d+) +(\d+) +(\d+) +bar$/; first=$1 second=$2 third=$3 It seems to me that there is certainly something like (first, second, third) = .... but I have no idea with what term I could go looking for it.
