How to speed up hyperparameter optimization?

For my application, I am classifying sensor signals. I wrote a 'Rapid Prototyping' script to quickly build machine learning models and return their cross validation performance. My pipeline is the following: feature computation, feature selection, training a model, compute cross-validation score. So far the tunable hyperparameters include: parameters for the classifier, parameters for the feature selection algorithm (how many features to keep and k for kNN in relief algorithm), and a window length (from which the feature vector is computed). In total I have 8 hyperparameters maximum, so the the maximum number of parameter combinations is bounded by $B^8$. ($B$ is maximum number of possible parameters for a hyperparameter type). The major problem is, it takes 15 minuntes to build a model. Even for small $B$, it is way to slow. Is there some way to speed up this process ?
