The question mark represents a parameter that will later be replaced. Using parameterized queries is more secure than embedding the parameters right into the query. SQL Server calls this parameterize queries, and Oracle calls it bind variables. The usage varies with the language that you are executing the query from. Here is an example of how it is used from PHP. assuming that $mysqli is a database connection and people is a table with 4 columns. $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO People VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"); $stmt->bind_param('sssd', $firstName, $lastName, $email, $age); The 'sssd' is a flag identifying the rest of the parameters, where s represents string and d represents digits.
