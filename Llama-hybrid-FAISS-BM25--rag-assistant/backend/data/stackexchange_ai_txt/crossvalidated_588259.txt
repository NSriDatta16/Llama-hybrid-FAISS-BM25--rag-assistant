In principle, yes , since FWL is "just" OLS regression algebra and hence does not "care" if the underlying model is cross-sectional, time series, panel etc. Indeed, fixed effects (which you do not seem to have in your model) is one key motivation (at least in my courses...) of the FWL, see e.g. Utility of the Frisch-Waugh theorem ... but not exactly how you describe it, as far as I can see: What pooled OLS (which is what you state) does is run an OLS regression of the stacked data of $Y$ on stacked data of $X_1$ and $X_2$ . What FWL says is that it is equivalent to first collect the residuals from regressing both stacked $Y$ and stacked $X_1$ on stacked $X_2$ and regress these residuals onto each other. Your notation however suggests to produce these residuals for each unit $i$ , which is not equivalent. Here is a numerical illustration: library(plm) # create some artificial panel data set.seed(324) m = 8 n = 12 beta1 = -1 beta2 = 2 y = X1 = X2 = r.y = r.X1 = matrix(NA, nrow=m, ncol=n) for (i in 1:n) { X1[,i] = rnorm(m,i) X2[,i] = rnorm(m,i) y[,i] = X1[,i]*beta1 + X2[,i]*beta2 + rnorm(m,sd=.75) # already collect residuals for "your" approach (I suppress a constant in all regressions for simplicity) r.y[,i] = resid(lm(y[,i]~X2[,i]-1)) r.X1[,i] = resid(lm(X1[,i]~X2[,i]-1)) } stackX1 = as.vector(X1) stackX2 = as.vector(X2) stackY = as.vector(y) unit = rep(1:n,each=m) # first two columns are for plm to understand the panel structure paneldata = data.frame(unit, rep(1:m,n), stackY , stackX1, stackX2) # estimators coef(plm(stackY~stackX1+stackX2-1, data = paneldata, model = "pooling")) # same as pooled OLS in the line below coef(lm(stackY~stackX1+stackX2-1)) res.y Your approach appears to be a mixture of pooled OLS (in that it runs a single regression to produce $\tilde\beta_1$ ) and what is known as a mean group estimator \begin{align*} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\tilde\beta_{1,i}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(X_{1,i}'M_{2,i}X_{1,i})^{-1}X_{1,i}'M_{2,i}Y_i, \end{align*} (in that it runs separate regressions to produce the FWL residuals).
