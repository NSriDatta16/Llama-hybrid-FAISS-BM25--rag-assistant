I have resolved issue without major modifications. Firstly I tried by setting header as you people suggested. Before redirecting for file to download I tried to set header for cache-control, but it doesn't work at all. So I stretch my mind more and find simple solution by setting headers in .htaccess file which is located in folder where all downloadable files are located. That means cache-control header is set to download files response. But still one thing in mind why above solutions not working. And one more thing Pragma: "no-cache" not working for IE. that is it gives error while downloading requested file as "requested site is unavailable or cannot be found". So I have set it to Pragma: public. But I doubt whether it is secure.
