What type of matching should I use?

I am conducting a retrospective cohort analysis looking at major psych diagnosis (exposure) on outcomes following traumatic injury using a large registry. n exposed = 36,000 ; n unexposed = 3.5 million. I want to use matching so that my computer doesn't blow up running logistic regressions in SAS (I'd prefer to control for covariates in regression...). A recent paper used the same registry that I will be using and used propensity score matching (link http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24368375 ) but I think their use of propensity score matching was inappropriate because their outcome was not a treatment and some of the variables they used for matching (i.e. Injury severity score) has absolutely nothing to do with the risk of being obese... am I wrong or am I missing something? Should I use case-control matching?
