Embedding a Ruby interpreter in a C++ app

I'm hoping to use Ruby as a scripting language for my game engine. I've found the usual articles describing how to call Ruby classes from C++ code and vice versa (e.g. here ) but I can't quite see how to do what I want with that way of working... My engine currently uses a little language I wrote myself with Flex and Bison, and a little stack based virtual machine. Scripts don't always run right through from start to finish, for instance they sometimes includes commands like "sleep for 2 seconds" or "wait until character has finished walking", so the scheduler keeps tabs on the status of each script and an instruction pointer, and knows when to resume them, and so on. So it seems that I really need some kind of embedded Ruby interpreter that I can exercise a certain degree of control over, rather than simply calling Ruby methods. Or am I just being obtuse and missing something? I'm working in Microsoft Visual C++, so ideally any solution would compile nice and easily in that.
