Interpretation of empirical frequency of null hypothesis rejections

assume I know a theoretical distribution that is quite non-normal. I simulate many (N) samples of given size (T). Then for each sample I test if the sample average is equal to the theoretical one (t-test). Then I look at the frequency of rejections as a function of T. Let T* the smallest T such that the rejection frequency equals the significance level used in the test. Does it make sense to say that T* is the minimum sample size such that a random sample is informative about the mean of the theoretical distribution? In general, what is the most appropriate way to identify the minimum size of a random sample such that I can consider it informative, given a non-normal theoretical distribution? Thanks a lot
