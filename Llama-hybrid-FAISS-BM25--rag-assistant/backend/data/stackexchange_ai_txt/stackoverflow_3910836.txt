Personally, I havent tried log4net but seen the specs and examples for winforms, but my organization coded our own logging mechanism that reports and logs errors that are caught in the global.asax that reports everything we need to know about the stack trace, session (if exists), form's NVC, version of the app, URL that originated the error with querystring, and HTTP headers. Though I noticed that not all errors get logged there; such as forms authentication expiration or application pool restart/shutdown or anything reported by IIS that was not thrown by the application executing.
