Logistic regression: Absolute values for P

I am stuck with a problem (actually two problems). I have a dataset of about 150 cases and 30 or so dichotonous (yes/no) parameters. I selected 6 parameters (after literature study and crosstabs) for which I want to do a logistic regression analysis. Problem 1 1 of the independent variables if true, has a 100% effect on the outcome. So if this variable is 1 (true), then the dependent variable is always also 1 (true). If the independent variable is false, then the dependent variable is about 50/50 true/false. Using these 5 variables in a logistic regression gives me this: Variables in the Equation B S.E. Wald df Sig. Exp(B) Step 1a variable_1 4,030 ,990 16,567 1 ,000 56,273 variable_2 3,097 ,858 13,030 1 ,000 22,133 variable_3 3,565 1,394 6,538 1 ,011 35,324 variable_4 3,010 1,135 7,036 1 ,008 20,290 variable_5 21,485 4184,125 ,000 1 ,996 2142215354,293 Constant -3,278 ,742 19,509 1 ,000 ,038 a Variable(s) entered on step 1: Foreseeability_foreseeability_1n2, D_Norm_Violation, D_Competence_1, D_Context_1, Bad_faith. How should I interpret these results? I can understand the B value for variable 5: if P(x)=1/(1-exp(-logit(x))), with logit(x)=b0+b1*x1+..+bn*xn, then for P(x) to be 1, exp(-logit) needs to be 0, so logit needs to approximate infinity. SPSS only does 20 interations, so finds 21.485 "infinite" enough. I do not understand why (according to literature) this variable has no value to the model because of the high Sig. My guess was to remove all cases where variable_5=1 (sort of making a flowchart model) and doing the logistic regression on the other 4 variables. Is this the right course? What do the numbers in above table tell me about my model? Anyway, using the 4 variables, we come to my second problem. The logistic regression for the 4 variables turns out fine: Variables in the Equation B S.E. Wald df Sig. Exp(B) Step 1a variable_1 4,713 ,797 34,970 1 ,000 111,399 variable_2 3,101 ,668 21,585 1 ,000 22,228 variable_3 1,989 1,384 2,065 1 ,151 7,308 variable_4 2,575 ,993 6,721 1 ,010 13,130 Constant -2,566 ,543 22,337 1 ,000 ,077 a Variable(s) entered on step 1: Foreseeability_foreseeability_1n2, D_Norm_Violation, D_Competence_1, D_Context_1. However, when looking at the residuals, I have 1 outlier. This case, which is a actually a data error, has 0's for all independent variables, yes the dependent variable is 1. Ok, great, data error, thank you for pointing it out, dear SPSS, let's remove the case and rerun the logistic regression. The result is that for all values for B (including the contant) I get values of over 30, and for all B, the Sig is in the 0.99's. I understand all the high B values: If, in all cases where all 4 independent variables are 0, and the dependent variable is also 0, for that to be the outcome P(x) needs to be 0. For P(x) to be 0, logit(x) needs to approximate -∞ (a very large negative number). Because all x are 0, only b0 (the constant) can contribute to logit approaching -∞. Because the number of iterations SPSS can do is limited, SPSS finds a large negative number (-30, or -40) is a close enough approximation. P(0) with b0 ≈ -30 is 4x10-18 (very, very small). In this case, other values of bn need to be of the same magnitude as b0 to “compete” in cases where some or all independent variables are not 0. This will result in the outcome of P(x) either being 0 (in case all xn are 0), or 1 in case 2 or more xn are 1, or, in case of only one xn being 1, inaccurate results for P(x). So my understanding is, that logistic regression cannot cope with something happening with either 100% change of it happening (problem 1) or 0% chance of it happening (problem 1). How should I proceed? In problem 1, should I indeed use a flowchart (if variable_5 is true, then outcome is true, if variable_5 is not true, then continue to model with 4 variables) In problem 2, should I not delete the outlier (data error), so my model seems to have a nice outcome? If so, how do I explain that? If not, what then?
