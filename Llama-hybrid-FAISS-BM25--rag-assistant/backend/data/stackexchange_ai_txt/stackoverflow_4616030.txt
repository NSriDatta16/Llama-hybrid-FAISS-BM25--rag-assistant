Per the specification The order in which attributes are specified in such a list, and the order in which sections attached to the same program entity are arranged, is not significant. For instance, the attribute specifications [A][B], [B][A], [A, B], and [B, A] are equivalent. That doesn't quite say that there is nothing that can be done to maintain the order, but it does say that the compiler doesn't have to pay attention to the ordering of the attributes and thus is free to reorder as it see fit. If you want to guarantee the ordering, you are probably going to have to modify the assembly post-build. There is probably a simpler way to solve your problem.
