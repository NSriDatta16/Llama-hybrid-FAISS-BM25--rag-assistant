bayesian problem using inverse gamma: negative initial values

My study involves a dependent variable measuring reading times (minimum value = 0.3) and two categorical variables (y = "quick" or "slow"; t = "cute" or "ugly") that are used to define conditions. The design is nested. I have determined that my dependent variable fits very well into an inverse gamma distribution. However, I encountered issues with homogeneity of variances assumption and the normality of residues when running models using glmer, besides the model prediction was a bad fit. As a result, I decided to use a brm model instead. During the process, I received a warning message that read gamma_lpdf: Inverse scale parameter[1] is -xxx, but must be >0! and Initialization between (-2, 2) failed after 100 attempts. I attempted to address the issue by setting init=0.1 , but it did not work. Although using the log link instead of the inverse link resolved the issue, I want to use the inverse family. Therefore, I am wondering how I can instruct the model to only use positive values during initialization. The model prediction looks good, but I don't want to use it if it gives these warnings. install.packages("VGAM") library(VGAM) set.seed(123) df
