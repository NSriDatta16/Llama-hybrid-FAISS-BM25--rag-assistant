How do I determine that an instance of org.apache.poi.hwpf.model.ListData belongs to a numbered list or bulleted list?

Is there a way to determine if an instance of a org.apache.poi.hwpf.model.ListData belongs to a numbered list or bulleted list? I am using Apache Poi's org.apache.poi.hwpf.HWPFDocument class to read the contents of a word document in order to generate HTML. I can identify the list items in the document by checking to see that the paragraph I am working with is an instance of org.apache.poi.hwpf.model.ListData . I can not find a way to determine if ListData belongs to a bulleted list or a numbered list.
