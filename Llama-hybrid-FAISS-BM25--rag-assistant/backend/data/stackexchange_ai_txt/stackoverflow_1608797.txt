Don't forget to add a reference to the ADOX assembly in your project. Once you've done that, the C# code would look like this: using System; using ADOX; namespace ConsoleProgram1 { public class ConsoleProgram1 { public static void Main(string[] args) { Catalog cat = new Catalog(); cat.Create("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;" & _ "Data Source=D:\AccessDB\NewMDB.mdb;" & _ "Jet OLEDB:Engine Type=5"); Console.WriteLine("Database Created Successfully") } } } Although my exposure to ADOX is limited to this question, the code snippets I saw at your link aren't encouraging. Things like the cat = Nothing line demonstrates a misunderstanding of how .Net changed things when from VB6. Hopefully that doesn't extend to the library.
