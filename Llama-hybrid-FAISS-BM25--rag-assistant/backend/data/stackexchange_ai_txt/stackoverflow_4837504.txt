Add some shortcuts to ESS jags mode

I'm relatively new to emacs and bayesian data analysis and the JAGS software. I would like to modify the ess jags-d.el file in order to have the F8 shortcut for ,as in the R-mode using ESS. IS it possible ? I hope that my question it's clear, and sorry for my poor english.
