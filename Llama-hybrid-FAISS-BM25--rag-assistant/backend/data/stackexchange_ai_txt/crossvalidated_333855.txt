Structural breaks and residuals analysis for ARIMA models

I have two question regarding ARIMA modeling. 1) When I work with ARIMA models should I test for the absence of structural breaks? If the answer is yes, what function of R could I use to detect a structural break and eventually fix it? 2) Since an ARIMA model takes into account autocorrelation in a time series, and that heteroscedasticity can be embedded via arch/garch, what are the consequences of non-normality of residuals over an ARIMA model (with log-transformed data that follow heavy tails distribution) and solutions to the problem (preferably via the software R)?
