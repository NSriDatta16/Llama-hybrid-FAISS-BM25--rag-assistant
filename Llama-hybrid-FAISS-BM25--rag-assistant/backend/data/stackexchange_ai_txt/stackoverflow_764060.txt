I think this is one of the biggest reasons that DVD and BluRay were cracked so quickly. I think the only way that they could really stop the average person from being able to digitally copy home movies is if they created a medium that wasn't licensed for use on computers, and could only be used on certified players. Would cut out the part of the market that wanted to watch movies on their computers and laptops, but would probably stop from having perfect digital rips for a little longer, and would stop the average person from being able to do it.
