Is it possible to get code coverage data for a GWT web app running tests from the web browser?

I am not sure if this is possible but I would like some way to get code coverage information for tests that are written in Quick Test for our GWT based web app. It does not seem like there is any solution because the Quick Test Pro tests are testing against the GWT compiled app and not the original java code in which the app was written. I suppose I could get coverage data on the javascript that the GWT compiler creates, but there would be no way for me (that I know of) to map this information back to the original java code. Is there some way to do this?
