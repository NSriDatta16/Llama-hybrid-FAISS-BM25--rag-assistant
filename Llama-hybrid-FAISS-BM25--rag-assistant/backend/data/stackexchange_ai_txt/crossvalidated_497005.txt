A method to avoid running several regression models?

Sometimes I have a research question where I have maybe 10 different outcomes and I am interested in whether any of these 10 outcomes are associated with several other variables, such as weight, height, age, sex, alcohol use, symptoms etc. Now the only way I can answer the question "does any of these 10 outcomes correlate with any of these predictors?" is by running 10 regression models, one for each outcome. Is there a more elegant way? I've thought of multivariate regression but I'm not sure if it's fitting here?
