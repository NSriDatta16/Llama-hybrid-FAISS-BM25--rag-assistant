OOP Design - Where/When do you Validate properties?

I have read a few books on OOP DDD/PoEAA/Gang of Four and none of them seem to cover the topic of validation - it seems to be always assumed that data is valid. I gather from the answers to this post ( OOP Design Question - Validating properties ) that a client should only attempt to set a valid property value on a domain object. This person has asked a similar question that remains unanswered: http://bytes.com/topic/php/answers/789086-php-oop-setters-getters-data-validation#post3136182 So how do you ensure it is valid? Do you have a 'validator method' alongside every getter and setter? isValidName() setName() getName() I seem to be missing some key basic knowledge about OOP data validation - can you point me to a book that covers this topic in detail? - ie. covering different types of validation / invariants/ handling feedback / to use Exceptions or not etc
