two-sided moving average?

how to get two sided "moving average" that is a function that averages n numbers from right and left of a vector and gives them weights according to their distance from center value ? I tried to use TTR but its moving averages works only from left to right and set leftmost values as NA. So I cannot use that smoothed vector as a input to smooth.spline
