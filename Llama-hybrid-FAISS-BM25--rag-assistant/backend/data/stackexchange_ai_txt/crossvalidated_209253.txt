What can cause a "wrong" sign coefficient in a logistic regression?

I have the variable AGE in my logistic regression to explain the probability of default of a customer. I'm trying to explain the probability of a customer not paying us. I know that I have 100,000 customers in each range. This is my historical information: Among customers more than 18 years old and less or equal then 21 years old 30,000 paid us, and 70,000 didn't paid us. Among customers more than 21 years old and less or equal then 23 years old 40,000 paid us, and 60,000 didn't paid us. Among customers more than 23 years old and less or equal then 26 years old 60,000 paid us, and 40,000 didn't paid us. Among customers more than 26 years old and less or equal then 29 years old 80,000 paid us, and 20,000 didn't paid us. However, when I run the regression, I have positive coefficients for all ranges. Even though the coefficients decrease when ranges have higher limits, they are still positive. I don't have any significant correlation. Are the coefficients wrong? What could be happening? My dependent variable, is the event of default(customer does not pay).
