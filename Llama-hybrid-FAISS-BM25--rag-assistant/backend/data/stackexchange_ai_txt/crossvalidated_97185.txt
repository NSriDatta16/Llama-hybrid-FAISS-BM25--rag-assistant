Difference of unequal sample size

I am a newbie in statistics. I have two columns of numerical data of unequal length, motion data. I need difference of the two columns, by shortening the longer column. 766.5 543.8 764.9 544.3 764.0 544.0 765.5 543.7 764.0 543.2 764.4 765.3 765.8 Now I want a third column of data which is the subtraction of column two from column one. So I want to re-size column one data to the length of column two, either by deleting some values or something like that. i.e there are 8 values in first column and 5 values in second column. So I want to resize column one to length 5, with minimal loss in the SD and other parameters. I want to use the results of the difference of two columns as a input to neural network and try to build a predictive model with this data. Are there any methods / algorithms which can help me achieve this, while keeping the accuracy of the shortened column good enough?
