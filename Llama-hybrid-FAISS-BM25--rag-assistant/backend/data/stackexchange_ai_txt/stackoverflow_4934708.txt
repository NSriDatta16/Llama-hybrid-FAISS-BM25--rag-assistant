SELECT NEW with a potentially null field using LINQ and Entity Framework

I want to quickly select some rows, format it nicely for a dropdownlist/selectlist or something like that - but I have a field in the db, that is nullable (DateOfBirth). var athletes = (from at in _db.Athletes select new{ Name = at.Name + " " + at.DateOfBirth, Id = at.AthleteId }).ToList(); Is there a way to handle nullable types inside the LINQ in a case like this? Edit: I was not paying attention to the fact, that since this is using entity framework, methods that work with standard LINQ cannot be used unless they have a SQL translation. DateOfBirth is a Nullable Source is Entity Framework 4
