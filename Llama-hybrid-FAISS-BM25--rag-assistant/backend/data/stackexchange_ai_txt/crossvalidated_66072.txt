A question on Bayesian Search

I chanced on this article on wikipedia on Bayesian search . In the mathematics section, it states how the posteriors are estimated. While I understand how $p^{'}$ is calculated, I can't seem to figure out how the $r^{'}$ are updated. How does the posterior on other cells on the grid change given a no-find on a given grid cell? If someone could give any pointers it would be helpful. Thanks
