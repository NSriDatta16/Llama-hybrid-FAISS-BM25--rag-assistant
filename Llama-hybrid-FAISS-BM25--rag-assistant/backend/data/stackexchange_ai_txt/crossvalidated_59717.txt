Outline of benefits/costs of using Bayesian rather than Frequentist OLS and time-series?

I'm reading up on Bayesian techniques for Linear models and time series. While the texts are great at teaching the theory I would like to get a better handle on the pro's/con's of Bayesian analysis vs their frequentist equivalents. I can't find an article or even articles that do this. I really want it as a fairly high level rather than getting caught up in the technical detail right away. Ideally highlighting where and in what situations Bayesian is better and vice versa. Most just hint that the frequestist approaches also rely on prior information but are less honest about this, but it didn't go into much detail.
