There is a nice story in Cressie & Wickle Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data , Wiley, about the (bayesian) search of the USS Scorpion, a submarine that was lost in 1968. We tell this story to our students and have them perform a (simplified) search using a simulator . Similar examples could be constructed around the story of the lost flight MH370; you might want to look at Davey et al., Bayesian Methods in the Search for MH370 , Springer-Verlag.
