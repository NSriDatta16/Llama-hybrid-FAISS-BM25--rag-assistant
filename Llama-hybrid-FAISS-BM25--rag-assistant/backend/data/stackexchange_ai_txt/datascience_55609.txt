Deep Neural Network and Activation Function

I want to know why we need Activation function in DNN hidden layers. I know a bit, like it will help us in, Increasing model complexity and introduce non-linearity Avoiding Gradient Vanishing problem. Still I'm not able to map its requirement. An illustrative example will be definitely helpful.
