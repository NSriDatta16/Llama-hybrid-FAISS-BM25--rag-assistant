In Xcode, expand the "Targets" node and find your target. Given what I've seen, it'll be the only one there. Next, right-click on your project and add a new "Copy Files" build phase. When the dialog box comes up, make sure you set the Destination to "Products Directory". The new build phase will appear beneath your target with whatever name you gave it. Drag your in_file and out_file there. Compile and run.
