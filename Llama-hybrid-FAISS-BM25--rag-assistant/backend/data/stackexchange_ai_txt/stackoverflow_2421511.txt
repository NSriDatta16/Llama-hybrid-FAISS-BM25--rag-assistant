BDK has about half the answer (+1 for him). A large part of the problem is that every message comes with 40 bytes of overhead. Its actually a little worse than that though. Another issue is that there is actually minimum packet size specified by IP. (This is not MTU. MTU is a M aximum before it will start fragmenting. Different issue entirely) The minimum is pretty small (I think 46 bytes, including your 24 byte TCP header), but if you don't use that much, it still sends that much. Another issue is protocol overhead. Each packet sent by TCP causes an ACK packet to be sent back by the recipient as part of the protocol. The result is that is you do something silly, like send one TCP packet every time the user hits a key, you could easily end up with a tremendous amount of wasted overhead data floating around.
