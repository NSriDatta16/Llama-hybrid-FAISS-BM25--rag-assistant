I've recently finished a similar project using this open-sourced model which is based on the DeBERTaV3-base. https://huggingface.co/knowledgator/comprehend_it-base It performs well in the zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. There is a framework for fine-tuning, which makes this model efficient in training using nearly 8 training examples/label. https://github.com/Knowledgator/LiqFit
