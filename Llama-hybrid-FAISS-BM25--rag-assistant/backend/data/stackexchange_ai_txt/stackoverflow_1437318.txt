Based on your examples, there's definitely an ISP and a SRP and probably a Law of Demeter (not SOLID but...) violation going on at the very least. IMNSHO You're far better off reading articles on SOLID (or buying Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C# by Robert C. Martin and Micah Martin which is excellent throughout and one of the most useful books I've read in recent years) than asking for piecemeal advice on the interwebs for this type of thing. If you want a shortcut (you don't though - the books and PDFs have examples that explain things very well!), these Hanselminutes podcasts with Uncle Bob are very good: Hanselminutes Podcast 145 - SOLID Principles with Uncle Bob - Robert C. Martin Hanselminutes Podcast 171 - The Return of Uncle Bob edit: Nabbed the SRP from Jon Limjap and ppiotrowicz
