Detecting the onset of unusual activity is the subject of outlier detection and nearly about every answer that i have recently made. A model reflecting period to period dependency and/or day-to=day dependency can be developed using Transfer Function/Dynamic Regression while "unusual" innovation can be detected when typical rules fail. If you wish to post your data I would be happy to take a look at it and hopefully other readers would do the same. Following is a very good thread with respect to anomaly (intervention) detection. Detecting Outliers in Time Series (LS/AO/TC) using tsoutliers package in R. How to represent outliers in equation format? . Read all the answers and comments and particularly closely follow the Tsay 1986 article http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf
