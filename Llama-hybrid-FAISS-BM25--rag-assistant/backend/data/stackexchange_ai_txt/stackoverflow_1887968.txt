Embed pickle (or arbitrary) data in python script

In Perl, the interpreter kind of stops when it encounters a line with __END__ in it. This is often used to embed arbitrary data at the end of a perl script. In this way the perl script can fetch and store data that it stores 'in itself', which allows for quite nice opportunities. In my case I have a pickled object that I want to store somewhere. While I can use a file.pickle file just fine, I was looking for a more compact approach (to distribute the script more easily). Is there a mechanism that allows for embedding arbitrary data inside a python script somehow?
