AFAIK, the manifest is the only means of initiating an update. The HTML5 Rocks web site has an article that talks about programmatically updating the cache (after a manifest update) by immediately calling applicationCache.swapCache() after listening for an UPDATEREADY state in appCache.status . I'm not sure if that will suffice, but its a good read (scroll down to "Updating the Cache") -- http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/appcache/beginner/
