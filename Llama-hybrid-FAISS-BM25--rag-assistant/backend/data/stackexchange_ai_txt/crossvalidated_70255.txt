How do i compare NDCG values?

I want to compare different ranking models using the NDCG metric. I average the NDCG of the models, then use the difference between the avg. NDCGs to compare the models. My questions: What does it mean for a ranker to have 0.1 (avg.) NDCG more than another ranker? Can i say more than: "It ranks a little better"? Especially, how big a difference in NDCG would be "significant" in absolute terms? Can i say something about statistical significance of the difference of the average NDCG w.r.t the 0-Hypothesis? I'm quite unsure about whether normality assumption holds here... Especially since i'm not looking at the average of the differences, but the difference of the averages.
