You have sufficient math background, in my opinion. I would suggest Shumway & Stoffer's book on time series. It comes with R package, complete with code examples and data. There is not a lot of math involved. I'm sure you'll enjoy the book. It is most important to start working with statistical packages and data. Once you build intuition, you can later on dive into the depth of statistics.
