Bayesian CI - isn't it by definition a bootstrapped or robust enough confidence interval? or should it be optimized?

As the title said, I've been wondering about bayesian methods, particularly MCMC, which seems to rely on sampling of the sample via chained iterations. Do we need an optimized/robust CI when running brms in r or does the CI by definition is already robust enough since it's a resultant from a resampling process?
