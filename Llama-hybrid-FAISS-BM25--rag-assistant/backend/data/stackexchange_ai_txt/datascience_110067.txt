How to balance sensitivity(sn) and specificity(sp) of an Artificial Neural Network model?

I have been working on a binary classification problem of protein sequences. I have used a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers. I have the training and validation accuracy/loss curves that the model has trained pretty well without overfitting/underfitting. Then, while testing on independent dataset, I have following results: Accuracy: 0.7672583826429981, MCC: 0.5401163645598229, Sensitivity: 0.8379446640316206, Specificity: 0.6968503937007874, Confusion matrix: [[177 77] [ 41 212]] The results are already pretty impressive for this particular problem in terms of Accuracy and MCC , but there is a high imbalance between Sn and Sp . The threshold I have taken to separate the positive and negative classes is 0.5. The question is, can we change the threshold value to balance the Sp and Sn ? If yes, how can we find the best threshold before touching the independent test set? If not, what are the other ways to improve the balance between Sp and Sn ? (Please ask me if additional information (Network architecture, dataset, etc.) is needed to answer the question.) Edit: My training dataset is balanced.
