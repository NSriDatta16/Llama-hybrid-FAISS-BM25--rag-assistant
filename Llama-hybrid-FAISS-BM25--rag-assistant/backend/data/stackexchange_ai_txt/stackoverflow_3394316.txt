Whats the best way of persisting data to Isolated Storage on Windows Phone 7?

I want to persist objects into Isolated Storage, so far I could think of these ways: Serialize them into an xml file when saving and then serialize them back when saving. Use an Object DB. Doubt abounds about a good or recommended one (Examples are Perst , winphone7db and Sterling DB ) Anyone can suggest some best practices?
