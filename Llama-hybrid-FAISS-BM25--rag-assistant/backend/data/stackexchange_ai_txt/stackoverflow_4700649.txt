Because this question's sat, 'unanswered 1 ,' for a while I thought I'd expand my comments as an answer: The table element, and its valid child elements ( thead , tbody , tfoot , tr , th and td ), presumably due to the inherent nature of a table (though I have no reference to support, or explain, that assumption) refuse to accept or apply the border-radius property: JS Fiddle demo, tested in Chrome 8.x and Firefox 3.6.x on Ubuntu 10.10 . To get around this, as @Pekka suggests, it's possible to wrap the table in a div and apply border-radius to that , along with overflow: hidden; to prevent the corners of the table appearing outside of the curved borders of the div itself. In the demo I put together for this I used a heavier border for the containing div to reduce the antialiasing artefacts where the curved border meets the table border, but, obviously, used the same colour for both elements. html: Name Age Family First Age information from Wikipedia Freeman Martin 39 Freeman Morgan 73 css: #container { border-radius: 1em; border: 2px solid #ccc; min-width: 30%; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; } th, td { border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 0.3em 1em; font-family: sans-serif; } th { vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold; } JS Fiddle Demo . Outside of those posted in the comments to the question (above).
