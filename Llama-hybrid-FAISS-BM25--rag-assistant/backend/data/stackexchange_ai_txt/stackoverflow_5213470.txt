On your array-of-records use the 'Length attribute; this has the advantage of always working even if your bounds are somewhat odd, like -18..3, or an enumeration, like cheeses..fruits. Something like: Function Average( Input : In Array_of_Records ) Return float is -- You say you already have a summation function, so... Sum : Natural:= Summation( Input ); Begin Return Sum / Input'Length; End Average; You may need to convert the numeric types, by saying Float(Sum) or the like, as Ada does no automatic type "promotions."
