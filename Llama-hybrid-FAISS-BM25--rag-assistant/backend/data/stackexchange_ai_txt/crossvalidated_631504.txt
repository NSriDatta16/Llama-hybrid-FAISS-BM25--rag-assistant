With logistic regression, how does one choose a number of predictors when preregistering a study?

Harrell's Regression Modelling Strategies suggests that the number of predictors should not exceed $m/10$ , $m/15$ or $m/20$ .* For logistic regression $m$ is $\textrm{min}(n_1, n_2)$ , where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the numbers in the two categories you are predicting. (E.g. number of deaths, number of survivals.) If you are preregistering a study, so that you do not actually know $n_1$ and $n_2$ , how should you proceed? Should you use domain knowledge to take a guess? What about cases where the study is the first of its kind, so that all previous knowledge is anecdotal? *Presumably 10, 15 or 20 depending on how careful you want to be to avoid overfitting, although it's not spelled out. Edit: actually, how is it even legitimate to look at $n_1$ and $n_2$ ? Surely this contributes to the forking paths problem ?
