Research on heterogeneous neural networks

Is there a sound theoretical reason why there's relatively little research on heterogeneous neural networks? By this I mean neural nets with non-homogeneous activation functions. So far most of the papers I've read analyse neural networks with at most two types of activation function. One type for the hidden layers(ex. ReLU) and one for the output layer(ex. softmax). Is there a sound theoretical reason for the relatively small number of papers on this subject?
