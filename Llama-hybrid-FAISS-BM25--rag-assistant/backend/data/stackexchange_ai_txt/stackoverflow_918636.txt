One way to do this sort of thing is to route your requests to classes and if the $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST' then call the post() method on that class. This would mean that the action on your form would map directly to some class which had a post method. // routed from URL: /users class Users implements Resource { public function post() { // do your post here } public function get() { // do it for GET requests too } } While this is essentially the same thing as what you were doing before, it can let you organize your code a little better in that you can deal with requests in a generic way: $resource = $resourceFactory->getResource($url); $method = strtolower($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']); $response = $resource->$method(); // eg: $resource->post(); $response->respond(); Have a look at the recess framework which takes this idea a long way.
