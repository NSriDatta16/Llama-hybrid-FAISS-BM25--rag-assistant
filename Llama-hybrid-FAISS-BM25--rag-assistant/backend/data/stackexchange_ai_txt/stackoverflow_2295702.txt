I think you could argue that your hits are distributed according to a poisson distribution where the average and variation vary with the time of day. To get a good idea of the peak load I'd start with just a scatterplot with the time of the hit on the horizontal axis and the time between that hit and the next hit on the vertical axis. This should give you a good idea of the height and duration of your peaks. Then you can estimate the parameters of the poisson distribution for a sliding window of a length similar to that duration for every moment of the day. Sort of like a moving average. The area's where mean and variance are lowest will give you a good basis for estimating expected future peak load.
