Also for TDD continuos regression of test cases are also necessary. So Continuos integration with Coverage tools(as mentioned above) are necessary. So that small changes(i.e Refactoring) can be regressed easily and whether any code path which are missed can be found easily. Also I feel that if tests were not written previously, time should not be wasted to think whether to write tests or not. Tests should be written immediately.
