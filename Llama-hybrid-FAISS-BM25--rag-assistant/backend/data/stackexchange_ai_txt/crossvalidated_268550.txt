How to test the increase is notable

Here is my case. There are like 1000 monitoring sites which measure CO2 concentration continuously. I define two period: 1950 - 1970; 1971 - 1991 and compute the average concentration of these period. Since the variation of all sites are different (some increase, some decrease)? How to ensure the increase of CO2 concentration is notable in statistic method?
