Problem with embedding activemq to jboss application server

I'm totally a newbie in Java Enterprise and I have a lot stuff yet to learn. Right now I'm working which involves JMS using JBoss and ActiveMQ. An application sends messages to queues in JBoss and my goal is to access those messages using any message broker (in this case I tried to use ActiveMQ). So I think it's better for me to embed ActiveMQ to JBoss. I used the link below as the guidance : http://activemq.apache.org/integrating-apache-activemq-with-jboss.html I followed every single steps in the guide except that I used JBoss 4.2.3 and ActiveMQ 5.1.1. If this problem results from the different version of the tools, I think I can't help it out because other versions seem does not work on my machine. When I run JBoss to test whether the embedding is working or not, I can't see anything running on port localhost:61616 which is the default port for ActiveMQ, although JBoss seems run well. My question is : Is any one know how to fix this? Or has anyone ever experienced such problem? Is there any way to access queue in Jboss? If this question is pretty ambiguous or need more details, let me know. Thanks in advance for any help.
