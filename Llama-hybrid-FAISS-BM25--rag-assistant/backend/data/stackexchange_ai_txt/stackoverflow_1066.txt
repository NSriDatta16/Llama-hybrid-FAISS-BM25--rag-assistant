Sven , you reached the same conclusion as I did: I found the Shockwave Flash Object, all be it from a slightly different route, but was stumped on how to load the files from somewhere other than file on disk/URL. The F-IN-BOX , although just a wrapper of the Shockwave Flash Object seems to provide much more functionality, which may just help me! Shooting flys with bazookas may be fun, but an embeded web brower is not the path that I am looking for. :) There was a link on Adobe's site that talked about "Embedding and Communicating with the Macromedia Flash Player in C# Windows Applications" but they seem to have removed it :(
