view .doc, .docx, .rtf, .ppt file in iphone using Webview

I want to view .doc, .docx, .rtf, .ppt file in iphone. But I guess something is going wrong at my side and its not working for the above formats but my code is working fine for .txt and .pdf files. I have the read the document regarding Webview it states it supports viewing of the above document. below is my snippet for .doc [webView loadData:requestData MIMEType:@"application/msword" textEncodingName:@"UTF-8" baseURL:nil]; for .ppt I am using MIME type as "application/vnd.ms-powerpoint" Note: If I am making MIME type as "text/html" for .doc/.rtf then it displays some garbage data So I think there is something missing in MIME type from my side. Any help is highly appreciated. Waiting for your reply. Update :........ It seems there is some issue with NSData for opening these type of file formats. My data is encrypted so I cannot use requestWithURL directly and other thing is I need to pass credentials to get the file and the credentials doesnt work proplerly if I save the credentials using [[NSURLCredentialStorage sharedCredentialStorage] setDefaultCredential:credential forProtectionSpace:protectionSpace]; and then make the request using below [webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:[urlStr stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]]] ] Is there any way I can use NSData for the above formats so that I can make async call and pass my credentials and then decrypt the data and show it in WebView.
