Somewhere on this playlist of lectures by Geoff Hinton (from his Coursera course on neural networks), there's a segment where he talks about two classes of problems: Problems where noise is the key feature, Problems where signal is the key feature. I remember the explanation that while neural nets thrive in this latter space, traditional statistical methods are often better suited to the former. Analyzing high-res digital photographs of actual things in the world, a place where deep convolutional nets excel, clearly constitutes the latter. On the other hand, when noise is the dominant feature, for example, in a medical case-control study with 50 cases and 50 controls, traditional statistical methods may be better suited to the problem. If anybody finds that video, please comment and I'll update.
