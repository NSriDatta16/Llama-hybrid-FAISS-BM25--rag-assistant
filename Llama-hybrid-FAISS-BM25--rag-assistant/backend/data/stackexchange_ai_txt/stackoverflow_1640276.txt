The summation of x from 1 to n is simply (n + 1) * (n / 2) . The number of elements being summed is n . Do a little simplification and your new function is def average(n): return (n + 1) / 2.0 You'll have to adjust this if you actually wanted Python's behavior of an exclusive upper-bound for range() (i.e., having average(10) return the average of the sum of values 1 - 9 instead of 1 - 10).
