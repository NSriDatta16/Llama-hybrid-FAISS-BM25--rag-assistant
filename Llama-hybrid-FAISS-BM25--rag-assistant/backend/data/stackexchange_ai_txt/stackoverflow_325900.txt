I frequently find myself using De Morgan's theorem when as well as general Boolean algebra when trying to simplify conditionals I've also occasionally written out truth tables to verify changes, as in the example below (found during a recent code review) ( showAll and s.ShowToUser are both of type bool .) // Before (showAll ? (s.ShowToUser || s.ShowToUser == false) : s.ShowToUser) // After! showAll || s.ShowToUser I also used some basic right-angle trigonometry a few years ago when working on some simple graphics - I had to rotate and centre a text string along a line that could be at any angle. Not revolutionary...but certainly maths.
