You should use forecast and not predict to forecast your web visitors. Here an example based on simulated data (I have no access to your data). You may adapt this example to your data. Hope this may be of help. Time series with daily data Data simulation data Use ts() to create time series series Plot the data plot(series, col ="aquamarine") The accuracy of forecasts can only be determined by considering how well a model performs on new data that were not used when fitting the model. The size of the test set is typically about 20% of the total sample Training set Use data from 1919 to 1926 for forecasting sr = window(series, start=c(1919,1), end=c(1926,365)) Test set Use remaining data from 1927 to 1928 to test accuracy ser = window(series, start=c(1927,1), end=c(1928, 365)) Herewith enclosed is an exercise I've done on the basis of the online book of Hyndman and Athanasopoulos: "Forecasting: principles and practice", a very good reading.You may find the book here: https://www.otexts.org/fpp Since this is a very simply simulation, there is no real trend in it, so the two models produce similar forecasting of a linera trend. Your data in all likelihood will have a seasonal component. Assign the data to a vector of convenience trainData Auto-arima without stepwise (more precise) library(fpp) The default value in auto.arima() is test="kpss". A KPSS test has a null hypothesis of stationarity In general, all the defaults are set to the values that give the best forecasts on average. Caution, takes a while to compute arimaMod Plot of the prediction and the test set plot(arimaMod.Fr, plot.conf=FALSE) lines(testData, col="red") legend("topleft",lty=1,bty = "n",col=c("red","blue"),c("testData","ARIMAPred")) Only the prediction Plot the test set plot(ser, main="Daily data", ylab="", xlab="Months", col = "red") Plot the forecast on the training set lines(arimaMod.Fr$mean, col="blue", lwd=3) Accuracy Accuracy for forecasting of sr (forecasted data) on ser (original data used as test set) The best model had the lowest error (particularly the MAPE, Mean absolute percentage error) accuracy(arimaMod.Fr,testData) Test residues of arima tsdisplay(residuals(arimaMod)) ETS fit.ets Compare accuracy of ETS vs ARIMA There is an overlap between the ETS and the ARIMA forecasting, So I've plotted the ETS forecasting with a wider line plot(testData) lines(fr.ets$mean, col="red", lwd=5) lines(arimaMod.Fr$mean, col="green") legend("topleft",lty=1,cex=1,y.intersp=0.6,bty = "n",col=c("black","red","green"),c("data","ETS","ARIMA")) Accuracy test accuracy(fr.ets,testData) accuracy(arimaMod.Fr,testData)
