A pragmatic answer is that a meaningful mode is surprisingly hard to estimate in real data. Say we get all distinct point estimates in the bootstrap samples, then all estimated coefficients are the mode, which is probably not what we want. We could smooth the distribution, but then the number of modes is dependent on the smoothing parameter, etc. etc.
