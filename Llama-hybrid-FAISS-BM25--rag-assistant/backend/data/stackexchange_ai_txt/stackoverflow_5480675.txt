jQuery draggable sortable input elements

I use the jQuery UI library to drag and sort elements: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable This works fine but I can't drag input elements such as a textarea. These textarea's are disabled so no need to be able to write in them. I googled around a bit and noticed that I ain't the only one with this problem. There are some semi-solutions for this but they are all dated it seems. (jQuery develops quickly).
