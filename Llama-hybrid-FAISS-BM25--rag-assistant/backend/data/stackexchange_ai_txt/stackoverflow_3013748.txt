The best you could probably do would be to find out what the browser is and from that, see what it's capable of. I suggest you start looking at $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] but you can go quite a bit deeper with get_browser() . Either way, as long as your markup makes sense (eg you use headers, hrs, paragraphs, em and strong, etc instead of meaningless CSS classes) a css-less browser should be able to render your content sensibly.
