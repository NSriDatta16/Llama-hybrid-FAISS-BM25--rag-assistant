Funny. Currently I'm sitting in the office and trying to run a static checker on Linux Kernel drivers :) Static checkers have a hard time processing linux kernel, because C dialect used in kernel code is broader than the one commonly understood as "C language". It sometimes happens that C front-end of a checker just can't parse ever-changing constructs used in the code. As I could understand, you simply use an outdated version of the checker ( 03 Nov 2006 ), but your kernel version is outdated too, and I don't know which is older. What may help is updating the checker to its current version, or using up-to-date C front-end, if the checker supports switching it. Moreover, if a checker can process Linux kernel, the fact outright becomes being bragged about on the checker's homepage. So, pick one that claims it and do your checks.
