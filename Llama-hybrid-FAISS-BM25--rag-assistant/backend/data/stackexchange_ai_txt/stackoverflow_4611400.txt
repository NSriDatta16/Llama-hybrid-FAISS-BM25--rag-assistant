PhpStorm - I used Intellij Idea for Java development so this came naturally, The biggest thing I love about this that I have been wanting for PHP is conditional break points. Huge for Magento when you are trying to debug something in autoload or something where there are hundreds of calls to a method. Netbeans - I used to use this before PhpStorm, I feel its much faster to learn and configure then Eclipse, I know most people I work with use Ecplise and SVN I think sucks in it compared to these last two and other tools such as find usages and what not I'm on a Mac but on 10.5 so I used Entropy php, but when others in on Snow Leopard come to work I suggest they use Mamp Pro , very powerful for local environment setup. Super quick to get virtual hosts and what not setup, can even use multiple ports and everything. Navicat Premium - For database management Textmate for quick edits and other types of projects Transmit for quick ftp if not using command line, probably the best FTP client ever created
