How to divide my transactions

I have a stored procedure which deletes a couple of million records and then re-inserts changed ones. Right now I have organized my transactions thus: begin tran - delete records - commit tran begin tran - insert records - commit tran I was wondering though whether the following might not be faster: begin tran - delete records - insert records - commit tran Because then it might recognize that the new records can take the place of the old ones, and thus be faster?
