Faking SQL Server

I have application that requires SQL Server 2000 as database storage. I do not really want to use SQL Server 2000, but I can user MySQL Server instead. Application uses ODBC to connect to SQL Server Database. I would like to know if it is possible to make fake SQL Server which will send and receive data to/from MySQL Server application odbc manager fake SQL Server driver mysql server Any one if such thing is possible to make?
