VAR stands for Vectorautoregression - i.e., the lags of several variables depend on their own past as well as on the past of the others. In a univariate autoregression, a single variable only depends on its own past. Granger causality indeed measures whether the past of one variable helps predicting another. But your interpretation of a p-value as p-value as measuring "how much a time series is likely to contribute to a better prediction of the other" is wrong. P-values cannot be interpreted that way. As for 3.-5., I indeed agree the question is rather broad.
