Your approach might work, but it’s unnecessarily complicated. Python allows a very simple syntax to check whether something is contained in a list: censor = [ 'bugger', 'nickle' ] word = 'bugger' if word in censor: print 'CENSORED' With that approach, simply walk over your list of words and test for each words whether it’s in the censor list. To walk over your list of words, you can use the for loop. Since you might need to modify the current word, use an index, like so: for index in len(words)): print index, words[index] Now all you need to do is put the two code fragments together.
