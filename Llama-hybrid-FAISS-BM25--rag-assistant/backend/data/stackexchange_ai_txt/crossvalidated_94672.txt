Two types of clustering are mentioned in the question. The first, grouping genes into pathways, is variable clustering. The second, clustering patients by cancer type, is clustering by observation. In both cases, you should standardize the gene variables, not standardize within each individual. In variable clustering, the correlation between the variables is of interest (you want to cluster variables that are highly correlated with each other). One way of performing variable clustering that may provide some intuition into your problem is to perform PCA on your data and then cluster variables that are grouped together by the PCA loadings. Intuitively, one could say that they are highly correlated with the same dimension of the PCA subspace (perhaps a pathway) and therefore with each other - thus they should be clustered. The point here is that as the papers you read allude to, before performing PCA and other similar procedures, one should standardize the variables. This R package may provide more insight into the considerations for variable clustering. When you cluster patients by cancer type, you are performing the most familiar type of clustering; grouping individuals into intuitive clusters. As alluded to here and here (this paper might be the most helpful), you should standardize the variables (still the genes) before performing this type of analysis. That said, if the expression of your genes are all on the same scale, you may not want to standardize them, since this can cause you to lose valuable information. Furthermore, the standardization you describe will give all variables equal weight; this is probably what you want, but perhaps it is worth considering if this true.
