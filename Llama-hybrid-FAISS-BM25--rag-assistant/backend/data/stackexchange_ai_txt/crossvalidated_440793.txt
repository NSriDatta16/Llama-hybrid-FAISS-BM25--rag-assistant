Does candidate feature means the point in feature space?

The CMU professor is using the term "attribute" here They are 1 2 3 4 5 6 attributes to describe TABLE 2.1 in Tom M. Mitchell. Machine Learning (free) usually, those 6 columns are also called features, so, there are 6 features in that table. That professor uses the term "candidate feature" here Every potential binary function is a candidate feature obviously, "candidate feature" is different to "feature". Does candidate feature means the point in feature space? Note: There are 6 features while the number of candidate features in this example is $2^{96}$
