Does running a bayesian model multiple times require multiple comparisons correction?

I'm working with a set of data where the outcome of interest is a length 4 vector. If I instead model this as four different univariate outcomes, and run the same bayesian model four times (once for each position of the vector outcome), is it then necessary to adjust for multiple comparisons somehow?
