What do the residuals in a logistic regression mean?

In answering this question John Christie suggested that the fit of logistic regression models should be assessed by evaluating the residuals. I'm familiar with how to interpret residuals in OLS, they are in the same scale as the DV and very clearly the difference between y and the y predicted by the model. However for logistic regression, in the past I've typically just examined estimates of model fit, e.g. AIC, because I wasn't sure what a residual would mean for a logistic regression. After looking into R's help files a little bit I see that in R there are five types of glm residuals available, c("deviance", "pearson", "working","response", "partial") . The help file refers to: Davison, A. C. and Snell, E. J. (1991) Residuals and diagnostics. In: Statistical Theory and Modelling. In Honour of Sir David Cox, FRS , eds. Hinkley, D. V., Reid, N. and Snell, E. J., Chapman & Hall. I do not have a copy of that. Is there a short way to describe how to interpret each of these types? In a logistic context will sum of squared residuals provide a meaningful measure of model fit or is one better off with an Information Criterion?
