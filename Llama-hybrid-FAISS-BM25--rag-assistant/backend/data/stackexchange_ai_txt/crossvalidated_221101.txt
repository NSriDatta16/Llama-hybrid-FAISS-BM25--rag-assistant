lateral collinearity

Is there somebody who could, in a reasonably general way, explain "lateral collinearity" and its practical implication in logistic regression? Does lateral collinearity necessarily imply strong correlation? I have a binary outcome variable and four binary explanatory variables, of which one is very similar to the outcome variable (outcome: "interest" (yes/no) explanatory: "enthusiasm" (yes/no)
