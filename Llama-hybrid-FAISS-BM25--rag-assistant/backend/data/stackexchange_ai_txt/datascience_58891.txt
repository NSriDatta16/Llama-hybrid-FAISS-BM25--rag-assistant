Tread wear detection

I have an assignment in which I have to provide a solution to measure the tread depth of a tire using a single rgb image. I thought of two possible solutions: Using CNN to measure the image similarity between a tire image and an image of a known depth. Using a regression model to predict the tread depth. Is there any other method I could try that can work over a large dataset? Any suggestions would be helpful.
