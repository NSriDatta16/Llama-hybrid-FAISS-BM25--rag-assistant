You can use Fiddler . It captures all port 80 traffic between you and the server for later review. In it you can then look at all the headers, cookies, parameters, etc.. all in Raw or organized forms for each and every request (both normal and ajax calls). It has proven to be invaluable to me in debugging my ajax heavy web app.
