I would suggest using basic statistics. Look at box plots. If a value falls outside of the IQR, then remove it as an outlier. There is also a new algorithm available through scikit-learn called isolation forest, which is variation of random forest. However, it will identify values that can be classified as outliers in an unsupervised fashion. You problem seems fairly straight forward, although, and I would highly suggest trying to use the IQR.
