Setting up Shoulda under Test/Unit in Rails 3 (3.0.3)

I have posted this in other places but no response. Trying to get Shoulda working inside Test/Unit in Rails 3.0.3 (1.9.2). When I try to run the test (copied below), I get this error: test/unit/practice_member_test.rb:4:in ': undefined method context' for PracticeMemberTest:Class (NoMethodError) Note that I have another Rails 3 project with Rspec including Shoulda also and it works fine via Rspec. In the failing project I tried placing "require 'shoulda'" in test helper to no avail, but when I run the debugger and type Shoulda, the object is found, so the library is being loaded. Here is my test: require 'test_helper' class PracticeMemberTest should "get global practice member count not including Demo Practice" do assert_equal PracticeMember.practice_members_global_count, 0 practice = Factory.create(:practice_one) practice_member = Factory.create(:practice_member) practice_member.practice_id = practice.id practice_member.save practice_member = Factory.create(:practice_member) practice_member.practice_id = practice.id practice_member.save assert_equal PracticeMember.practice_members_global_count, 2 end end end Must be something I am overlooking as I have not seen anyone with this same issue.
