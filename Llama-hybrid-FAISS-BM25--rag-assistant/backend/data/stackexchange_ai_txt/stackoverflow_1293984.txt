How will you use the C# 4 dynamic type?

C# 4 will contain a new dynamic keyword that will bring dynamic language features into C#. How do you plan to use it in your own code, what pattern would you propose ? In which part of your current project will it make your code cleaner or simpler, or enable things you could simply not do (outside of the obvious interop with dynamic languages like IronRuby or IronPython)? PS : Please if you don't like this C# 4 addition, avoid to bloat comments negatively. Edit : refocussing the question. The classic usages of dynamic are well known by most of stackoverflow C# users. What I want to know is if you think of specific new C# patterns where dynamic can be usefully leveraged without losing too much of C# spirit.
