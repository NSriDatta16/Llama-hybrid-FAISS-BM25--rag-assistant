Is it unwise to create a predictive model based off 20 independent variables when only 10 variables will be available for future observations?

I've created a predictive model which is based off a historical dataset and has 20 independent variables as the dataset set is comprised of completed projects, so have full information and dataset of the project. In the future, when used to predict outcomes, only 14 variables will be available as the project will be at an early stage, so those variables will be the only ones to change in the predictive formula. While I can do this, I'm not sure if it is wise or viable, or if it would be better to create a predictive model from the historical dataset that will use only the 14 variables available at that time? Also, what kind of predictive model would you recommend? I've tried boosted tree, neural networks and partial least squares. My historical project dataset is 67 projects with around 114 variables
