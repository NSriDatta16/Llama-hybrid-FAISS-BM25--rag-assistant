The emulator is not smart about screen size however, and may be too large for some monitors. If you have this problem, start the emulator instead using "SDK setup" program from the main Android SDK directory before you run a program. It will give you a dialog to set the size or scale. Setting the height to 8" works well on 768-pixel high monitors. You should check out this wiki site by UC Berkeley. Does a great job explaining and walking one through to setting up Android dev for Windows, Macs, etc. but only on Eclipse FYI. The above snippet is the last paragraph in the first section "Android Quickstart": http://bid.berkeley.edu/cs160-fall10/index.php/Tips_and_Tricks
