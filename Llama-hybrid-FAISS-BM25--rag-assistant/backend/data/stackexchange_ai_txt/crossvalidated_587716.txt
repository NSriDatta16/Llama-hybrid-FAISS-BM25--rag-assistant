What are exactly QSAR models?

I'm reading on the internet about QSAR models and I don't really understand what they are. I see some webs in which some data mining techniques like random forest, CART, etc., are mentioned. What are QSAR models? Is it a specific technique to create a dataset and has nothing to do with classification/regression models, o is a type of models that are created from the data? In addition to your answer, could you post a website or article where this is clearly explained? Thanks in advance.
