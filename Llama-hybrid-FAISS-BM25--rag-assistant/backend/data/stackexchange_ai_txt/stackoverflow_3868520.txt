ASP.NET MVC 2 - best implementation of status / update / generic message delivery and JavaScript modal display

For an MVC 2 app that relies on many partial views and almost exclusively uses Ajax for POSTs/GETs, what would be the best way to implement the setting, passing, retrieval and display (using a JavaScript modal) of these messages? My forms all POST (by way of jQuery $.ajax) to actions that return partial views (html) that are used to update a in the "success:" part of the $.ajax function. I was hoping for some sort of mechanism in the master view that could "listen" for any messages that any of these partial views might be "delivering"--through their ViewData, for instance. Thanks. Edit: After lots more searching, I found similar people trying to achieve the same thing as me, but none of the questions had a good answer. This one states the question best.
