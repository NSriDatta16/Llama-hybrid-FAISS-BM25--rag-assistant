It really depends on the UI you are catering for. If you want a single screen where you can basically directly edit rows in the database (edit values, delete records, add records) your probably looking for a GridView It also depends on your comfort level/experience with ASP.NET Web Forms. Web Forms is great in the "drag and drop" sense (which IMO is also it's downfall). Meaning you can chuck a control on a page and be ready to go. But sometimes it's overkill. I prefer to use the web controls only when absolutely necessary. I would be keeping with a simple form, basic form fields, then constructing the entity on the server and passed onto the business tier for validation and persistence. Have full control over the process. By the way, i don't see in your question how any of your solutions so far is N-Tier? If you want N-Tier, you should be communicating with your data tier (which would be on a seperate computer to your web tier) via some sort of web service (ie WCF), no directly calling OrdersDB
