Fixed it. It turns out that I have to set the onmousedown and onselectstart functions. I assume this is the same as placing onmousedown='...' in the tag. Anyway, it is fixed now. Just go to the fiddle page. This is basically the code that fixed it. $('div.draggable').attribute().onselectstart = function () { return false; } $('div.draggable').attribute().onmousedown = function () { return false; } It stops the default action of selecting the element as text in Firefox and IE.
