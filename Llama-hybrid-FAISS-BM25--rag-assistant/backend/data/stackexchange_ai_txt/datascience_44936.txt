Keras decision threshold for Multiple Label prediction

I'm training a Neural Network to predict multiple labels for a given input. My input is a 200 sized vector of integers and the output should be a boolean vector of size 28. My y has a 1 on the corresponding classes the example corresponds to, i.e. the y should look like: [0, 0, 1, 0, ... 1, 0, 0] . Now, I've used a sigmoid function on my final layer, and I'm training with binary crossentropy since I want my model to treat each class as independent from each other. When I fit my model, I get a pretty decent categorical accuracy, i.e. ~75%, but I'm wondering which is the threshold that Keras uses to say a class is or isn't present on the example, I mean, which is the threshold where it decides: prediction[prediction >= threshold] = 1 prediction[prediction
