Pearson correlation with overlapping data

I have a financial time series and I want to calculate correlation between past and future returns. First I select look back and holding periods, say l and h respectively. Then I calculate past returns, which is current value divided by the value l points ago and future returns which is the value h points ahead divided by the current value. And then I calculate Pearson correlation. The problem is these returns obviously overlap. I found some solutions for linear regression, but not really for correlation. One suggestion is to calculate n = min(l, h) and pick every n-th point. This eliminates some overlapping, but not all of it. Another idea would be to calculate n = max(l, h) , which eliminates overlapping, but also leaves me with very little points for long periods. Some variations are e.g. selecting every h-th point. Every method produces different results. Is there any way to deal with this problem?
