Possible to update a row without pulling down and updating every column?

For examples sake, lets say I have a table containing these columns ID (primary key, auto increment) FirstName (32 characters) LastName (32 characters) Picture (binary JPEG data containing on average 10k of data) Using SubSonic and/or LINQ how can I update only the FirstName column of a record and not try to get the Picture column or try to update the picture column? Right now the only way I see of doing it is something like this: var p=Data.People(x=>x.ID==SomeID); p.FirstName="Foobar"; p.Save(); What happens over the line from what I can tell though is that it completely loads the object and completely saves the object. I don't want to have to transfer over 10k of data for such a simple operation though. How do I fix this?
