One solution that works in some situations is to : Have the code on your local disk, on the physical computer running windows This code is the one you're modifying with your IDE So, IDE is working as fast as possible : no SMB access for each file. Also have the code on the Linux server So Apache runs fast : the code is present on the server Use some kind of synchronisation mecanism, to push every modification made on a file on the Windows machine to the Linux server, via the SMB share. Using Eclipse, the FileSync plugin does a good job, over the SMB share. WinSCP can also be used, to keep a remote and local folder synchronized, over an SSH connexion Advantages : All local operations are fast All server operations are fast Drawbacks : You must always use the tool that ensures synchronisation (For instance, with FileSync, everything must be done in Eclipse -- and nothing in any other software) Note : for SVN, no need to use Tortoise : there are plugins that integrate into Eclipse (Subversive, for example) Not sure about debugging Modifications done directly on the Linux machine might not (depending on the solution) get synchronized to the windows desktop. Still, the best (fastest and most powerful) solution is generally to use only one computer -- that would run Linux, in your case, and not Windows. Your tools will most likely work under Linux If needed, you can install Windows in a Virtual Machine, for some software that don't run on Linux It'll encourage everyone in your team to know Linux better ; which is always useful, when your production environment is not Windows ;-)
