Personally, it's my opinion that all C++ IDEs suck. When I write C or C++, I tend to use some sort of powerful programmer's text editor along with command line compilation. If I'm just messing around and have a couple source files, I'll just invoke gcc -g -o myprog *.c on the command line myself. If I have a more involved project, I'll just write a simple makefile. You could also look into gmakemake if you don't want to bother learning makefile syntax just to compile your programs. On the Mac side, I have always been a fan of both BBEdit and TextMate , but much more so of the latter, especially given its lesser price tag and more modern feel. Both have project organization features. On Windows, I'd stick with either e (which is basically a port of TextMate to Windows) or Notepad++ . The downside of Notepad++ is that it doesn't have any project organization features, whereas e does. You could also look at SciTE , but like Notepad++, it has no project org features. As for Linux, I'm personally unsure. I'd stick with other people's answers covering that platform for recommendations there.
