No, these are somewhat different problems. If you have an improper flat prior and you don't have a unique MLE, you will often not have a unique posterior mode, so neither MLE nor MAP estimation will be useful without some additional thought/constraints. But you can easily have a proper posterior. Some examples: Mixture models, where there is non-identifiability because of relabelling. There will still be relabelling in the posterior, but the posterior will be proper as long as the mixing probabilities are bounded away from zero 'Flat' or nearly flat regions in the likelihood: if you have $2\times 2$ table where you only observe the margins, the odds ratio is non-identifiable and the likelihood is nearly flat over some range of values. Given a flat prior, you'd get a flat posterior over that range. However, the flat range will typically be bounded so that the posterior is proper. it's quite possible to have non-identifiability with bounded parameter spaces, so even a flat posterior would be proper. Suppose $Y\sim Binomial(1,p_1)$ and you have a flat prior over $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ for $(p_1,p_2)$ . The posterior for $p_2$ (about which you have no data ) will still be flat, but it will not be improper. Conversely, you can get an improper posterior without non-identifiability. Hobert and Casella discuss this for linear mixed models here . They don't explicitly use flat priors, but their improper priors could be regarded as flat for some transformed parameter. One situation where you can get an improper posterior from non-identifiability is when the likelihood is flat on a unbounded subspace of the parameter space. Suppose you have a model $Y\sim N(\alpha+\beta,1)$ . The data only tell you about $\alpha+\beta$ and your posterior for $\alpha-\beta$ will be flat if the prior is flat.
