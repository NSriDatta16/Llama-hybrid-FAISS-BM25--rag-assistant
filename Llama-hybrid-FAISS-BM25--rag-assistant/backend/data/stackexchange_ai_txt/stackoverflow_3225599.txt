How this technique works is that instead of finding and creating views directly let wpf find the view through data templates. so when you have the following in your application resources. This drives the UI based on what ViewModel you want to display and don't have to worry about coding up the view. Note: vm: and ui: are just xml namespaces declared in the top element of the resource file. you can then just create a generic window that will 'find' the view via a ContentControl var window = new Window(); window.DataContext = new MyViewModel(); window.Show(); This will display the window embedding MyView as the content of the window. Provided you have your bindings set in your view pointing to properties in your viewmodel the wire up succeed. No need to 'new' up a view. The main window can be reused simply by reassigning a different view model to the data context. Also if you let us know what specific issues you are having we will be able to provide a more specific answer if the above is not what you are looking for. HTH
