I did this in a Java program a few years back, and the way I did it was to PUT a VCALENDAR document into the folder. One quirk is that the VCALENDAR had to be enclosed within an RFC822 message. It's a bizarre combination of WebDAV, email, and iCAL/VCAL, but it worked at the time on Exchange 2003 hosted at Link2Exchange. I'm sure there is an easier way, but this is what worked for me. Below I show a tcpdump packet trace of what happened. You should probably use ngrep/tcpdump on your own Outlook/Entourage client to see what it does. Note that "Cal2" is the name of my test calendar folder. You'd use "Calendar" for the main calendar folder.
