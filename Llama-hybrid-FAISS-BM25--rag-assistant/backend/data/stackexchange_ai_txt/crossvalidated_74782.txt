Linear regression from data that don't represent a function

I have $(x,\ y)$ pairs with a strongly suspected linear correlation. So I want to fit the "best" linear function in order to make predictions for unknown $x$'s. These pairs don't represent a function, i.e. there are many different values of $y$ for some $x$. I want to know if there is an issue with that considering this as a machine learning problem. Should I use some unique "representative" (average, maximum, minimum, most frequent, etc.) and convert the input data in a function or it is OK to work with the data as it is?
