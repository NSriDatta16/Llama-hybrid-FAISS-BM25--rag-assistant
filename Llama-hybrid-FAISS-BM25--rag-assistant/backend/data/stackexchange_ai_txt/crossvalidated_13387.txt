Is there a way to continue a R/JAGS MCMC chain that did not converge?

I'm building a series of hierarchical models using R and JAGS, linked using the R2jags library. The runs are fairly long -- from several hours to several days. I've had the sad experience of running some chains that did not converge. In that case, is there a way to extend the chain, rather than starting over?
