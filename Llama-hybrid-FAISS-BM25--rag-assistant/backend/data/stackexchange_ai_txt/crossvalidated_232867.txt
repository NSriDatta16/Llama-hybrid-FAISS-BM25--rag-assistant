Yes, XGBoost (and in general decision trees) is invariant under features scaling (monotone transformations of individual ordered variables) if you set the booster parameter to gbtree (to tell XGBoost to use a decision tree model). The XGBoost objective parameter refers to the function to be me minimised and not to the model. 'reg:linear' tells XGBoost to minimize the mean square error.
