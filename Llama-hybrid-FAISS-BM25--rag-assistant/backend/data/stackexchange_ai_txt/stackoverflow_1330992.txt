I recommend the following book: Microsoft® .NET: Architecting Applications for the Enterprise by Dino Esposito; Andrea Saltarello. They are discussing architecture in a pragmatic way (Yes there are code examples). Many of the things you have mentioned will be described in the book. You will probably not get all the answers but it will inspire you. (They have made a book about Ajax/ASP.NET arch too but I have not read that one) You want to use a lot of new cool technology, that’s cool. But most important is why do you want to use it, what business value will it add? Ask yourself what do you want to with your product in the future? To be able to figure out today and tomorrows requirement will be the best thing to help you build “loosely coupled and configurable architecture” it will help you more then any of the techs you have choosen.
