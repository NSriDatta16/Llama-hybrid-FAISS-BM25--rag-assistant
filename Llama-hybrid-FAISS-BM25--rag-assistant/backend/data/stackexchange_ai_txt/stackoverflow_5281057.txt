As of 1.2 the event list was curated on the Magento Wiki. You can find that list here: http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/_media/magento_events_v1.2.0.2.xls However, since then various events have been deprecated. There is a list here but it's only current as of 1.4 http://masteringmagento.com/2010/06/events-list-in-magento-community-1-4/ If you're handy, you can execute grep -R dispatchEvent in your Magento working directory and parse through the dearth of dispatch calls. These are the actual definitons of all Magento events in your particular version. Edit 2/14/2013: This list, being a couple of years old, is no longer valid. I suggest that you use the following resource as it is not only a better answer but gives you many examples and sources of finding better event hooks. https://magento.stackexchange.com/a/167/336
