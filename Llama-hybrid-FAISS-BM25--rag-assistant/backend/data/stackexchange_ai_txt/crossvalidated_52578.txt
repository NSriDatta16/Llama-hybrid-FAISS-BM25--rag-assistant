About the "a prior over the parameters" why always Gaussian distribution?

I have the following problem. I'm reading through the Gaussian Process book http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf . In the bayesian linear regression it is suggested to use the Gaussian prior over the parameters. For the Gaussian process regression we also don't know the distribution of the process, it can be not gaussian. Can GPR always work well? I just don't understand why should we use gaussian distribution? Is there any paper or book?
