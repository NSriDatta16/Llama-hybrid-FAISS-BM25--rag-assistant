Logistic regression models output a probability of belonging to the positive class. So all you need to do to translate from these probabilities to classes is decide a cut off value. Many default algorithms use the value of .5. Therefore if you have a probability value greater than .5 it is predicting it to be a 1. to find out how many observations you have classified correctly you just compare the original to the predicted class, not the predict probability. EDIT: The cutoff value can definitely be different per data set. There isn't really a definitive answer to what is best. I would experiment with different cutoff values and try and optimize the AUC value. Since this is a rare event classification problem I would definitely check your model on training and testing sets. If you see a drastic decrease in performance from your training set to your testing set you know that your model is not generalizing the data well.
