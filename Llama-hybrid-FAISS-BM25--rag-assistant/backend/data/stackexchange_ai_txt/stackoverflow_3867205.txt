jQuery allows you to store data against DOM objects in a much more elegant way. See the data() api here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ Another way that is used often but can make your X/HTML non compliant is creating your own attributes. eg. ... and then in your jQuery you can get the value by doing $('myDiv').attr('someattr')
