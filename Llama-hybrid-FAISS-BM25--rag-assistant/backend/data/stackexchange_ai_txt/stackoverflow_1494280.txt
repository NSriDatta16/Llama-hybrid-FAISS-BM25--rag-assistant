Do you have the web-based "Crystal Management Console" installed? This is the web-app you'll use to add reports that you have created with Crystal Reports (Crystal Reports XI Second Release SP5 is the newest version, still available for download from SAP's website). Through the management console, you can determine the datasource and the credentials to be used by the Report. Those can be stored on the server, and every user will be able to run the report (because required credentials are already stored on server). You can also use the management console to organize your reports into folders for each departments. Hope it helps.
