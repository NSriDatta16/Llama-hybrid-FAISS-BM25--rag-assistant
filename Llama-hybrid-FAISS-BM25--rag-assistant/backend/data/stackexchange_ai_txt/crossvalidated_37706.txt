Logistic regression: fixed effects for firms, countries & years

I am trying to use logistic regression on a sample of 20,000+ firms across 50+ countries, from 2000-2010. Do I need to use logistic regression with fixed effects for year and firm + dummy variables for countries? Firm Failure (fail = 1, otherwise 0) = $f(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5, X_6)$ $X_1$ and $X_2$ are country-level independent variables $X_3$ and $X_4$ are firm-level independent variables $X_5$ is a country-level independent variables variable (control variable) $X_6$ is a firm-level independent variable (control variable) Logistic regression model for sample firms $i$ and country $c$: $$\text{Fit} = β_0 + β_1X_1c + β_2X_2c + β_3X_{3i} + β_4X_{4i} + β_5X_5c + β_6X_{6i} + ε$$
