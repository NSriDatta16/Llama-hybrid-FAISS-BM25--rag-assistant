The big comment kinda answers your question. The CSS Zen Garden is built as a novelty with tons of no-semantic-value tags and attributes to allow for infinite stylings. It's not meant as a model of how a real webpage should organize itself. Using this sort of HTML in parts of your document where it's necessary is fine, since you're in charge of the CSS. Don't use this kind of markup where you don't need it, but it's perfectly acceptable in small amounts. The Zen Garden just puts it everywhere, just in case.
