The result of durbinWatsonTest is an object of class durbinWatsonTest . I cannot find the description of the durbinWatsonTest class, but I guess Autocorrelation is the point estimate of first-order autocorrelation of the time series, since the test statistic $$ DW\approx 2(1-\hat\rho), $$ (see "Understanding the Durbin Watson test" ) and we have $1.904856\approx 2(1-0.04757039)$ . The test works well asymptotically when its assumptions are satisfied. If you do not believe the answer, then either your sample is atypical for the data generating process (DGP) or some of the assumptions have been violated, e.g. perhaps your DGP is changing over time? Also, mind the difference between statistical and subject-matter significance. Perhaps the autocorrelation is truly present in the DGP, but it is small enough so that you can judge it negligible from the subject-matter viewpoint.
