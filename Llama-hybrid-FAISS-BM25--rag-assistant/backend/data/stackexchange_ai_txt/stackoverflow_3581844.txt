NULL is a value that is valid for any pointer type. It represents the absence of a value. A void pointer is a type. Any pointer type is convertible to a void pointer hence it can point to any value. This makes it good for general storage but bad for use. By itself it cannot be used to access a value. The program must have extra context to understand the type of value the void pointer refers to before it can access the value.
