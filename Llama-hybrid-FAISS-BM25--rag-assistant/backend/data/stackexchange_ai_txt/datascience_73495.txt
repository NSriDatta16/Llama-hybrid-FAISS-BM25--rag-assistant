What stands behind "Data Science"?

I would like to become a data scientist, the person who uses statistical modelling, MLs methods, and other techniques to solve problems. I real good one. I mean the person who fully understands the techniques, and ideas one is using. my question is how can I achieve this deep understanding? Should I take many advanced statistical classes? Or maybe just basic statistics and is enough to understand statistical modeling and deep learning? What is the core of being an excellent data scientist? Generally, my dream is to have an interesting and challenging job in business and I'm not sure what path is best for achieving my goal.
