It looks like the list of valid rsid entries is held in word/settings.xml in the entry. XWPF should be able to give you access to that already. You'd probably want to generate a 8 hex digit long random number, check if that's in there, and re-generate if it is. Once you have a unique one, add it into that list, then tag your paragraphs with it. What I'd suggest is that you join the poi dev list (mailing list details) , and we can give you a hand on working up a patch for it. I think the things to do are: Wrapper around the RSids entry in word/settings.xml, to let you easily fetch the list and generate a new (unique one) A wrapper around the different RSid entries on a paragraph and a run Methods on paragraphs and runs to get the RSid wrapper, add a new one, or clear the existing one We should take this to the dev list though :)
