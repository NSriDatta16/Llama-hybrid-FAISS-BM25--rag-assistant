As far as for the code, I think there is only one error which is the generation of random numbers according to Laplace distribution. Replace y = laplace(randn(1), b, x(i-1)); by (See the Laplace distribution wiki to learn how to generate random Laplace distributed numbers before seeing my answer.) u = rand()-0.5; uu = b / sqrt(2); y = mu - uu * sign(u).* log(1- 2* abs(u)); One more thing, Laplace distribution is symmetric, so laplace(x(i-1), b, y))=laplace(y, b, x(i-1)) . Therefore, when calculating your alpha , you can omit laplace(x(i-1), b, y))/laplace(y, b, x(i-1))=1 . There are a lot of books on MCMC approaches. But for a quick start, maybe this paper and this note is good enough.
