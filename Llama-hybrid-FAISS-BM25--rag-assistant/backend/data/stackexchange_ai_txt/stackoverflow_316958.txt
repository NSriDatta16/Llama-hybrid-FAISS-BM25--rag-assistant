"The tight coupling of the persistence infrastructure to the entity classes largely eliminates the ability to efficiently use very tight feedback cycles on the business logic with automated testing. In its current state, EF entity classes cannot be effectively unit tested independently of the database. The efficiency of automated unit testing of behavioral objects is largely a matter of how easy the mechanics of test data setup are and how quickly the tests can be executed. Using the actual database will make test data setup more laborious, introduce data to satisfy relational constraints that are not germane to the test, and make test execution an order of magnitude slower. A team’s ability to do evolutionary design and incremental delivery is damaged by the Entity Framework’s inattention to fundamental software design principles like Separation of Concerns."
