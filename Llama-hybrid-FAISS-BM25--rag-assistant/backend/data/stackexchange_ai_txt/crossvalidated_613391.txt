Understanding predicted values for clogit() model via predict.coxph(); calculating survival probability?

Main questions I'm using conditional logistic regression for a resource selection function (RSF) in an ecology study (more details below). I have no trouble implementing the code but I'm having difficulty grasping what the fitted values represent and how I can ultimately calculate probability of an event for given conditions. I understand that clogit() is actually a Cox Proportional Hazard model with constant time, and I have read up on these models, the help files, and a number of related posts, but so far I have not been able to find answers detailed enough for me to fully understand: What does type "survival" return when using predict.coxph? It is not discussed in the help file. My assumption is that it is the probability of an event not occurring for a given row in the hypothetical next time step (as this is a constant time model), but I don't know if that is accurate? How can I calculate predicted probability of event occurrence? I have seen it suggested that 1-survival should give me this value (which makes sense to me if I'm correct above), but I've also seen it stated that risk/1 + risk would provide this as well, which I do not understand. More generally, when predicting from a stratified Cox, my understanding is that all predictions are relative? For example, with type "risk", I'd be getting the average change hazard ratio within each strata for given predictor values. Is that understanding correct? I would greatly appreciate any help. Thank you! Additional details if needed My goal is to compare nest locations (cases) to random points (controls) for bird species with several continuous predictors and ultimately predict the probability of nest occurrence based on predictors. I use "nest_id" as a strata with the clogit() function from the survival package. The reason for this is that not all random points were available to all birds because of territoriality etc., and so traditional logistic regression would not be appropriate. Each strata consists of a known nest location and 5 random points within the territory that could have theoretically been selected by that nesting pair. Thus, in my case, the "event" would be nest occurrence, not mortality. Here is my code to illustrate: # My data (rwbl.rsf) # A tibble: 6 Ã— 5 nest_id status ndvi_pix veg_pix wood_pix 1 aml0032022 1 0.235 1.39 231. 2 aml0032022 0 0.00778 1.06 232. 3 aml0032022 0 0.174 1.01 201. 4 aml0032022 0 0.306 1.42 207. 5 aml0032022 0 -0.0670 1.22 230. 6 aml0032022 0 -0.228 0.963 228. # My model model = clogit(status ~ scale(ndvi_pix) + scale(veg_pix) + scale(wood_pix) + strata(nest_id), rwbl.rsf, method = "exact") # Predictions preds = predict(model, se.fit = T, type = "survival") preds$fit[1:5] 1 2 3 4 5 0.7315548 0.9185614 0.8761767 0.6907805 0.9302214
