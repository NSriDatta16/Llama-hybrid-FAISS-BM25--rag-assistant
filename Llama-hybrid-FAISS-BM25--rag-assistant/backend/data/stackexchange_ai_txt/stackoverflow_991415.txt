I'm often confronted with a quite similar problem. However I take a slight different approach: First of all, why should I care about static content at all? I mean of course it's important for the user, if it takes 2 minutes or 2 seconds for an image, but that's not my problem AFTER I fully developed the page. These things are problems while developing and after deployment it's not the static content, but it's the dynamic stuff that normally slows things down (like you said in your last paragraph). The next thing is, why do you trust that so many things stay constant? If someone on your network fires up a p2p program, the routing goes wrong or your ISP has some issues your server-stats will certainly go down. And what does your benchmark say for a user living across the globe or just using a different ISP? All I'm saying is, that you are benchmarking YOUR point of view, but that doesn't say much about the servers performance, does it? Why not let the site/server itself determine how long it took to load? Here is a small example written in PHP: function microtime_float() { list($usec, $sec) = explode(" ", microtime()); return ((float)$usec + (float)$sec); } function benchmark($finish) { if($finish == FALSE){ /* benchmark start*/ $GLOBALS["time_start"] = microtime_float(); }else{ /* benchmark end */ $time = microtime_float() - $GLOBALS["time_start"]; echo ' '.$time.' '; } } It adds at the end of the page the time it took to build (hidden with css). Every couple of minutes I grep this with a regular expression and parse it. If this time goes up I know that there something wrong (including the static content!) and via a RSS-Feed I get informed and I can act. With firebug we know the "normal" performance of a site loading all content (development phase). With the benchmark we get the current server situation (even on our cell phone). OK. What next? We have to make certain that all/most visitors are getting a good connection. I find this part really difficult and are open to suggestions. However I try to take the log files and ping a couple of IPs to see how long it takes to reach this network. Additionally before I decide for a specific ISP I try to read about the connectivity and user opinions...
