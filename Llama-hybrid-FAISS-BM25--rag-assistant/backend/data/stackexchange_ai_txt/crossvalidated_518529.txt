What is the 'feature function'?

The term 'feature function' is very frequently used in the context of machine learning, but I'm still not sure what it really is. Could anyone give the precise definition? Can it be understood as a function that maps from the data-points to the feature vector? What would be the feature function e.g. in the logistic regression?
