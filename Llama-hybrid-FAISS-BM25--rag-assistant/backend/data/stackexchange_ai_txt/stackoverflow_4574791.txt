How to animate a draggable pushpin

I'm looking for a way to show the motion of a push-pin being dragged over the map. I've tried to modify an example proposed here: http://peteohanlon.wordpress.com/2010/10/10/draggable-pushpins/ by updating the AssociatedObject.Location in delegate added to MouseMove event handler, but this makes no results. The push-pin remains at it's place till the moment when the mouse button is released. Then it jumps to the new location. Any idea how can I force the MapLayer to keep track of the push-pin location during the drag and redraw it properly as mouse moves?
