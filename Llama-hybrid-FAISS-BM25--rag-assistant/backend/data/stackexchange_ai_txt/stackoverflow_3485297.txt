After over 2 days without any answer, I suspected that I didn't ask this question the right way. So, I asked differntly and got an answer . I'll then answer myself this question in case someone have the same problem. The whole thing was about not prefixing keys when the model is a composite one. For instance, in my case: public class FormViewModel { public OrganizationData organizationData { get; set; } } And OrganizationData is defined by public class OrganizationData { public string OrganizationName { get; set; } } So I should have done this if(string.NullOrEmpty(formViewModel.organizationData.OrganizationName)) ModelState.AddModelError("organizationData.OrganizationName", "Name can't be empty") But, I omitted the prefix organizationData and rather did ModelState.AddModelError("OrganizationName", "Name can't be empty") On the view, the Html helper will check the ModelState to know if there is error associate to his key. So, if that's the cae, it highlights itself. In that case, organizationData.OrganizationName and OrganizationName are different . So the textbox doesn't highlight itself. One more thing. I didn't experience the same with TryUpdateModel() because, not only it uses AddModelError() internally, but also uses an algorithm that can figure out the right key. I guess I got the lesson. I was able to solve some other pending problem just by knowing this mechanism. Thanks to Darin Dimitrov and Ian Galloway.
