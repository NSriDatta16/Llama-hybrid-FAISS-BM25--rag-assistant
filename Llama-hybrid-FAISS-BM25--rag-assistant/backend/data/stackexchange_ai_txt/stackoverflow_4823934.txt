You can certainly define a selector to use as a background that has three entries. The question is what button attributes you can use for the selector. You can have two boolean attributes, say A and B, and define the selector in terms of A, B, and default. (A && B will satisfy A, so more properly they could be thought of as A, !A && B, and !A && !B.) You can overload existing attributes (selected, focused, etc.) or, more elegantly, define your own custom attributes using the recipe described in this thread .
