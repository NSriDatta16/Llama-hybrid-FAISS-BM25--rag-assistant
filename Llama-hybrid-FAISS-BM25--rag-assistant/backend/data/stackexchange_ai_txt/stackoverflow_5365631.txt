Why do you think there would be any drawbacks?? Quite the contrary! It's good to see you're enforcing referential integrity as everyone should! No drawbacks - just good practice to do this! I don't see any functional difference or any problems/issues with referencing a unique index vs. referencing a primary key. Update: since you're not interested in performance- or datatype-related issues, this last paragraph probably doesn't add any additional value. The only minor thing I see is that your OfficeCode is both a VARCHAR and thus you might run into issues with collation and/or casing (upper-/lower-case, depending on your collation), and JOIN's on a fairly large (up to 50 bytes) and varying length field are probably not quite as efficient as JOIN conditions based on a small, fixed-length INT column.
