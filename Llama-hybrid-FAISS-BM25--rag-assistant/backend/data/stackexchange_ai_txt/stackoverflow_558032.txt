I'd seriously reconsider the licensing requirements, because enforcing them will lose you legitimate customers. If you're a huge company, you can afford that, but if you're a startup or an individual you can't. One way out is to offer an individual license - good for all machines the individual uses. This, for better or for worse, is how people think software "should" be sold. If you make them pay for each machine they use they'll feel like you're taking advantage, and that's when they start trolling the web for someone else's license key. If appropriate, you could also offer a corporate license, or 10-packs of licenses, or whatever, for a discount over buying them separately. This gives both individuals and organizations ways to use your software legally that don't make them feel like you're squeezing them unreasonably.
