How do I retrieve and set user_version in SQLite DB with EF

What I am trying to do is load in and set the user_version (PRAGMA user_version) from my SQLite database. I am using entity framework, but if I can't do it through that, then I need to be able to do it some other way possible within C# 4.0. I tried: this.DatabaseConnection.Connection.Open(); System.Data.Common.DbCommand cmd = this.DatabaseConnection.Connection.CreateCommand(); cmd.CommandText = "PRAGMA user_version"; cmd.CommandType = System.Data.CommandType.Text; System.Data.Common.DbDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(); where DatabaseConnection is my EF context and Connection is the DbConnection object within the context, but I get an exception: The query syntax is not valid. Near identifier 'user_version', line 1, column 8.
