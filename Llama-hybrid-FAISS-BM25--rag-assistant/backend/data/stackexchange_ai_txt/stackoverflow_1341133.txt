For modern web browsers (After IE9) See the Duplicate listed at the top of the page for correct information! See answer here: How to control web page caching, across all browsers? For IE9 and before Do not blindly copy paste this! The list is just examples of different techniques, it's not for direct insertion. If copied, the second would overwrite the first and the fourth would overwrite the third because of the http-equiv declarations AND fail with the W3C validator. At most, one could have one of each http-equiv declarations; pragma, cache-control and expires. These are completely outdated when using modern up to date browsers. After IE9 anyway. Chrome and Firefox specifically does not work with these as you would expect, if at all. Actually do not use these at all! Caching headers are unreliable in meta elements; for one, any web proxies between the site and the user will completely ignore them. You should always use a real HTTP header for headers such as Cache-Control and Pragma.
