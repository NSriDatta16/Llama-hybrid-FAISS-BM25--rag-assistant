The thing you're looking for is called single sign-on (abbreviated SSO) and it is a hard problem to solve correctly. There are lots and lots of SSO schemes , all of which suck horribly in their own special way. A major obstacle in the way of your goal is how we normally keep track of logins on the web: cookies. In particular, one domain can only set cookies that belong to it. This means that if your three web sites are on three different domains, you can not have one site set a cookie for the others. A common way around this is to actually place the authentication service on yet another domain name. Whenever you need to check that a user is logged in, you direct them to that authentication service. A popular unified sign-on mechanism, OpenID , uses this technique. OpenID is what StackOverflow uses. (If you use the various StackExchange sites, you may have noticed that you can sometimes be automatically logged in to the others after loading a page. I'm still not sure how this works, and haven't investigated yet.) From what you've described, you'd be well-served by central authentication. You may even find that implementing a system based on OpenID could even work well for your sites... though if you do that, I encourage you to hide the complexity of the whole URIs-as-identities thing, normal end-users are unlikely to understand the concept.
