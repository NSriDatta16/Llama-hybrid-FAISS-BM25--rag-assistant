Naive Bayesian for Topic detection using "Bag of Words" approach

I am trying to implement a naive bayseian approach to find the topic of a given document or stream of words. Is there are Naive Bayesian approach that i might be able to look up for this ? Also, i am trying to improve my dictionary as i go along. Initially, i have a bunch of words that map to a topics (hard-coded). Depending on the occurrence of the words other than the ones that are already mapped. And depending on the occurrences of these words i want to add them to the mappings, hence improving and learning about new words that map to topic. And also changing the probabilities of words. How should i go about doing this ? Is my approach the right one ? Which programming language would be best suited for the implementation ?
