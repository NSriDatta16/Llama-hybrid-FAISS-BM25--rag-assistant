WPF Datagrid binding to DataTable with complex type

I have a class that contains data from some model. This class has metadata along with the actual value. class ServerValue { public int SomeId {get;} public int SomeOtherId {get;} public DateTime LastChanged {get;} public object Value {get;set;} // this lets me show the value, but how do i update it from the grid? public override string ToString(){ return Value.ToString(); } } Now I also have a class MyDataTable that derives from DataTable that has all kind of logic. It calls the server, gets a bunch of ServerValues and puts them into Rows and Columns. Finally I have a WPF DataGrid that I bind to the MyDataTable and the data are displayed, because the DataGrid calls ToString on each ServerValue and gets back the value for display. Hurray so far. Now, I want to have two way databinding, so input on the grid is written back to the ServerValue. So I want to bind the grid cells to the Value property of the ServerValue instead of the ServerValue itself. Right now the ServerValue of the DataGrid cell is just replaced with a string. I could work around this and all but I'd to try the elegant route first. So I have a datatable with a complex type in cells and i want two-way databinding to a specific property of that type. Is this possible? I've been googling on this and i can't anything on this. Thanks in advance, John
