Redis will use a bit more RAM than disk. The dumpfile format is probably a bit more densely packed. This is some numbers from a real production system (a 64 bit EC2 large instance running Redis 2.0.4 on Ubuntu 10.04): $ redis-cli info | grep used_memory_human used_memory_human:1.36G $ du -sh /mnt/data/redis/dump.rdb 950M /mnt/data/redis/dump.rdb As you can see, the dumpfile is a few hundred megs smaller than the memory usage. In the end it depends on what you store in the database. I have mainly hashes in mine, with only a few (perhaps less than 1%) sets. None of the keys contain very large objects, the average object size is 889 bytes.
