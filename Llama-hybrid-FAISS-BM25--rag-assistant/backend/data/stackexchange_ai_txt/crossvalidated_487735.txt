Which metrics should be used in preprocessing in continual learning?

So my idea is to train an LSTM - autoencoder for anomaly detection by continual learning, i.e., I want to update the model after each 10 time steps. Firstly I will train it on source data, then re-train on first batch of new data and then re-train on second batch of new data and so on. My question is: how to preprocess these data? Should the metrics computed on source data be used for each new batch or should these metrics be updated somehow?
