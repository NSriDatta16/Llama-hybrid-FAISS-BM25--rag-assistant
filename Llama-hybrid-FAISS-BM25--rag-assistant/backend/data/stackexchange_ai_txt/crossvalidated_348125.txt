Why fully connected neural network cannot learn to count

I am writing some educational material, and I am actually trying to find some proof for something. Consider the following case: you generate random vectors of length (let's say 20) containing only 0 and 1. I have developed and tested succesfully LSTM that can easily learn to count the number of 1 in each vector. Now I know that a standard fully connected neural network (let's say one layer with 15 neurons) cannot learn this. Can someone point me to a proof (at least an intuitive one). I have my intuitive understanding, but would love to see something more.
