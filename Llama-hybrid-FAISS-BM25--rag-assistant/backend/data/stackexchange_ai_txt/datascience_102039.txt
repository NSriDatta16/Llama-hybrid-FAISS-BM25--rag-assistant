Maybe you could use Matrix Profile (see Matrix Profile Foundation ) to solve your problem. A Matrix Profile is a new time series that measures the similarity of one time series to another, or a "self similarity" measure of parts of a time series to other parts of the same series. There is a parameter, usually called sub_len, which could be adjusted for you use case, or alternatively you could use what's called a Pan Matrix Profile to investigate different length sub_len in one go. The main claim by Matrix Profile proponents is that, given a Matrix Profile, other time series tasks then become (trivially?) easy. The above linked page has links to a Github with Python code.
