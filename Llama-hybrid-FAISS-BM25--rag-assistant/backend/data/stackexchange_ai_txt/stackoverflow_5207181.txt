Why is C++ compatible with C?

After reading an amount of C++ articles and tutorials, I often see the phrase "C++ is not C!" or some variant. If this is true, why is C++ trying to be compatible with C? Surely this just encourages C programmers to write bad C++ code? I'm only a newb in the field, so feel free to bombard me with reasons why I'm wrong in thinking that C++ should just make it's mind up and forget C. Ell.
