What I want to do (with javascript) is basically extract out the 'John Doe' from any tag with the ID of "auth". You can't have the same id ( auth ) for more than one element. An id should be assigned once per element per page. If, however, you assign a class of auth to elements, you can go about something like this assuming we are dealing with paragraph elements: // find all paragraphs var elms = document.getElementsByTagName('p'); for(var i = 0; i
