Rails 3, too many ways to test?

If you were just starting out in rails which path would you encourage new users to go down with regards to Testing . Anything I read about regarding Rails 3, tells me I should be using Rspec 2 . But Rspec comes with a whole whack of other things I need to learn like gem 'capybara' gem 'database_cleaner' gem 'cucumber-rails' gem 'cucumber' gem 'spork' gem 'launchy' And then one of my friends just told me that I should just stick to the testing framework that comes with rails, and maybe just integrate 'shoulda' into the test process because it has a nice syntax. When it comes to testing it seems like we have way too many options and too many ways of doing something. Maybe this is a good thing, but I always thought rails was about creating common conventions and avoiding doing the same thing in different ways. I'm fairly new to rails. I'm unsure where to start. I feel overwhelmed. Is this normal?
