Cross-platform development. Yes Mono exists, and Java's somewhat more predictable to have it function EXACTLY the same on more platforms, you can find a C/C++ compiler for just about any platform out there, where you can't with C#. Also linking into 3rd-party libraries, while I'm sure there's a way to leverage them in C#, you'll be able to take advantage of them without interop (Marshaling, etc) in C++. Edit: one last thing: RELIABLE memory management. Yes you can use dispose() , and try-finally , but there's nothing quite like KNOWING the memory is gone when it's popped off of the stack. Through techniques like RAII, when you use well-constructed classes, you will KNOW when your classes release resources, and not waiting around for the GC to happen.
