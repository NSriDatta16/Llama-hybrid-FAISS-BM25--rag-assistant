I'd start with a good introduction to time series analysis and go from there. If you're interested in finding patterns then the interesting term is "1D-Pattern Matching". But for that you need nice features, so google for "Feature extraction in time series" . Remember GiGo . So make sure you have error-free stock price data for a sufficiently long timeperiod before you start.
