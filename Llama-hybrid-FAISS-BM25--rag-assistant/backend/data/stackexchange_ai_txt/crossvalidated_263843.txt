Highly correlated residuals from auto.arima

I am using auto.arima for a simple sine time series where freq = 3 . The series is plotted as follows: I use the following code for model fitting: data = ts(x,frequency=3,start = 1) model = auto.arima(data,stepwise=FALSE, approximation=FALSE) plot(data$residuals,type='l') When I check the residuals of the fitted model, they are highly correlated like a sine time series (the p-value of the Ljung-Box test is zero). The following plot depicts the residuals: Can anybody help me to find out the reason of bad fitted model and not having random residuals?
