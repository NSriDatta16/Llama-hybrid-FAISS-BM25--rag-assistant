Artificial Neural Network Used to Compile Source Code

Would it be plausible to have an ANN that, when trained on millions of source code examples and the results from compiling them, that could compile source code into the correct output? For example, a ANN trained on Python source code and the resulting Python bytecode, that when given a Python program, could compile it to bytecode correctly.
