Deal with quarterly or monthly seasonality in forecasting a year ahead

Assume a time series with a clear seasonality with observations every quarter. If you want to use that time series and make predictions four steps ahead, but you are only interested in what the forecast say on an annual level (mean of the four quarters for example). Is it in this case important to remove seasonality before modeling?
