You need to make sure the p tag wraps around the image so that other paragraphs are above and below it. I can´t test it right now, but I usually use overflow:hidden on the surrounding block (the paragraph) and I think for IE you need something like zoom:1 . By the way , can´t you get rid of the inline 'align:left' and replace it by css in an external style sheet like: #center-column p img { float: none; // if still necessary... } #wide_column p img { // I don´t know what the id of the wide column is... float: left; } (I don´t know if you need the p selector, I'm only trying to target the right images without seeing your code)
