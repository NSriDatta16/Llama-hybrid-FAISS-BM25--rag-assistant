The solution is TLF (text Layout Framework). With TLF you can use TLF markup to send formatted text and images to a TextFlow. It's very powerful, but also complex. Here is a list of the tags you can use: http://blogs.adobe.com/tlf/2009/09/tlf-markup-overview.html I created a HTML Editor using it, and I'm impress with it. It supports image resizing, drag-n-drop, advanced formatting, etc. Hope this helps!
