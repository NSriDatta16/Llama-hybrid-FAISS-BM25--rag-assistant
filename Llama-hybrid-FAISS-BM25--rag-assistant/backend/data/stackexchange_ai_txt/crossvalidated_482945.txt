Paraphrasing substantially from Bishop (see chapters 3 and 7): Linear basis function models extend linear regression models by allowing combinations of non-linear functions, $$y(x,w) = \sum w\Phi(x)$$ where w are the weights and $\Phi$ are the basis functions. The output of $y(x,w) $ is therefore a non-linear function of $x$ , but these are still called linear models because the model is linear in the parameters $w$ . If I understand the maximum margin classifiers section correctly, SVMs are using linear basis function models to map the data to a higher space, as you note, and are then also incorporating a decision boundary to separate the classes.
