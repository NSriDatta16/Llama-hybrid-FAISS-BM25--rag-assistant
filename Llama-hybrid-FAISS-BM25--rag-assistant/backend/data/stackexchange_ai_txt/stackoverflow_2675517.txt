In R, How to add Row for Information:

I'm trying to add a Row to my data.frame to spit out the average of the column. This is my data frame: Weight Response 1 Control 59 0.0 2 Treatment 90 0.8 3 Treatment 47 0.1 4 Treamment 106 0.1 5 Control 85 0.7 6 Treatment 73 0.6 7 Control 61 0.2 I'd like it to become: Weight Response 1 Control 59 0.0 2 Treatment 90 0.8 3 Treatment 47 0.1 4 Treamment 106 0.1 5 Control 85 0.7 6 Treatment 73 0.6 7 Control 61 0.2 8 AVERAGES 74 0.3 Thanks!
