I know this question was posted 2 months ago but it might still help the OP or someone else. First, I am not sure to understand which question you are trying to answer with your second model. But if I understood correctly, you have the mean and standard error estimates of the jumping distances and are trying to get the effect of the other parameters: arena, stimuli,... If this is correct, the intra-specific variation (or standard deviation) of the jump is not a fixed or random effect, it should rather be the error variance ( units ) of your model with every other factor accounted for. In other terms it is the variance that is neither accounted for by your fixed effects nor by your random effects. So if you add microhabitat to your first model and fix the residual variance to $se^2$ in the priors using fix=1 , you should have the correct model. prior For reference a similar model is treated at p130 of the "Course Notes" vignette for the MCMCglmm package . Second, irrespective of the correctness of your model on a statistical point of view, if you add random effects, you need to specify priors for them; either by adding a G2 list with a proper V matrix, if it is a new random intercept, or making G1$V a 2x2 matrix, if you are adding a random slope to a preexisting random intercept. That is what the error message is telling you.
