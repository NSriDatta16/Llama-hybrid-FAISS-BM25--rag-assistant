According to Wikipedia it's a Hybrid kernel . Which may or may not be just marketing speak for about the same as a monolithic one. The graphic on the latter page does make some things clearer, though. Most importantly, almost no program on Windows uses the kernel API directly. And the complete Windows API subsystem resides in user space which is a rather large part of the OS as we see it. And in more recent versions Microsoft began to pull more and more device drivers from kernel space into user space (which is especially a good idea with certain drivers, such as for video cards which are probably as complex as an operating system on their own).
