Get any book about "accessibility" and you should have plenty of suggestions. They will more or less boil down to a simple principle: do not bind any information to color solely. That is, color should just be accompanying the information, which should never be conveyed by color only. I used Linux to develop one such application, and I used Compiz filters to simulate color blindness: very handy. As a side note, there are more types of color blindness out there, so pay attention to that too.
