MATLAB: Extract multiple parts of a matrix without using loops

I have a huge 2D matrix and I would like to extract 15 different 100x100 parts out of it. I have two vectors x and y where the top left indices of the parts are saved. I have used something like this: result = cam1(x(1:end):(x(1:end)+99), y(1:end):(y(1:end)+99)); but the result is just a 100x100 matrix instead of a 15x100x100. Why? I know it could easily be done using a loop but we are not allowed to use loops (it's part of an image processing exercise). Another possbility would be to write all the 15 lines but that is kind of ugly. Do you have any elegant solution? Thanks.
