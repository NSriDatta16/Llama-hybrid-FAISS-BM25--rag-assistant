The requirement of exactly 1 "death" per day provides a defined ordering of the events over time. A survival model that assumes independence among event times, like typical fully parametric models, doesn't seem appropriate. Any method that can evaluate sequential outcomes (event times) while handling censoring at the highest outcome value would, however, seem to work. This could be modeled by any such method that can assess probability of an event at a given time as a function of (potentially time-dependent) covariate values. A Cox model can do this under a proportional-hazards assumption. Although Cox models are usually thought about as working in continuous time, they are based on covariate values in place at discrete event times; the actual timing between events does not enter into the calculations. Ordinal logistic regression can model the log-odds of surviving beyond a certain time point. Those still surviving at the end of the study would just be in the highest-outcome group. The orm() function in the R rms package efficiently handles cases with effectively continuous outcomes like this. I think that would work OK with your large number of non-event cases as the highest outcome level, although I don't have experience with your type of data. If covariates aren't time-varying and you are willing to make assumptions similar to linear regression, you might consider a Buckley-James model as implemented in the bj() function of the rms package. (If there aren't censored outcome observations it's identical to ordinary least squares multiple regression.) I haven't thought through whether those assumptions make sense in this situation, however. For further reference, Tutz and Schmid discuss several non-parametric and parametric approaches in Modeling Discrete Time-to-Event Data .
