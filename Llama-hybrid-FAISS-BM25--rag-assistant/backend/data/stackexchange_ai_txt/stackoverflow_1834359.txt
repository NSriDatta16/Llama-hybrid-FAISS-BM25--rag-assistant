It is feesible to move content from Enterprise to Standard, however, you will certainly receive import or restore errors and in my experience you are going to spend quite a bit of time hunting these errors down. For example, when you attempt to export and import a site, the source and target versions must have the same features; if a feature is not available on the target the import will fail. In the long run you can work around this by disabling or even uninstalling features on the source subwebs, however, you might disable an Excel Service or Forms component that you were using. Also, any third party products will most likely still behave in Standard Vs Enterprise but you will need to install them prior to importing to old sites. The comparison chart is useful but what I usually tell clients is that they will lose InfoPath Forms Services, the BDC, and Excel Services. Some are willing to take the loss and others are not. With more and more companies leveraging workflow, they very often want to take advantage of Forms Services as the web front end so this is often the downgrade blocker.
