It's not a hyperparameter. If you pick some value $k$ for the dimension of the result, it simply means that you would be ignoring the remaining components. Training the model multiple times for the different values of $k$ would give the same results for all the components $ . So this is not something to tune in the regular sense. What you would do is to fit PCA to the data and then see how much variability is explained for different values of $k$ for the fitted model.
