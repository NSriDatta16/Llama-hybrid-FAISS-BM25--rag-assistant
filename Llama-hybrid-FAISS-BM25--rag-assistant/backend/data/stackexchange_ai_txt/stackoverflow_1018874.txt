Converting a company from SVN to Hg?

We're a heavy user of SVN here. While the advantages of GIT over SVN made us want to change, the advantages of Hg over SVN mean it's now time to change and we need to start doing so very soon. I'm not so worried on the client side, but here are my questions. There are some excellent books on setting file metaproperties, properly organizing projects, etc on SVN. What is that book(s) for Hg? Is there a way to convert an SVN repository (that you've used) and can report how well it went? We don't want to lose years of commit logs if possible. When you DO convert, how did you split up the old code? Did you commit trunk as one project, and tags/forks as another? If you used SVN for legacy work, did you check in updates to SVN or something else?
