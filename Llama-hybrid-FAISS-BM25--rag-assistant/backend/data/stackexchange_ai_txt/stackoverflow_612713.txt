If you're refering to USB storage devices, according to the Tiger Security Configuartion Manual (pdf): 6 To remove support for mass storage devices (e.g. USB flash drives, external USB hard drives, external FireWire Hard Drives), drag the following files to the Trash: IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext IOFireWireSerialBusProtocolTransport.kext 7 Open the /System/Library folder. 8 Drag the following files to the Trash: Extensions.kextcache Extensions.mkext 9 Choose Finder > Secure Empty Trash to delete the file. 10 Restart the system.
