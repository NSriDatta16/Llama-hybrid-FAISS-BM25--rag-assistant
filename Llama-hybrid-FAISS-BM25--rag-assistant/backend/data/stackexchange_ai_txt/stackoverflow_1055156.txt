Having a bit of trouble with self-learning from Cormen et al's algo book

I started reading Intro to Algorithms by Cormen et al like 3 weeks ago on my free time. I finished the second chapter and have been trying out the exercises for quite a while. I find them a bit difficult. Is this normal? Should I finish all the exercises before moving on? Or is it alright if I solve the ones I can and move on to the next chapters, possibly coming back to the exercises I can't figure out right now? If anyone out there has had experience with this book, can you tell me how it was for you? I'm a bit discouraged on not being able to solve quite a few of the exercises here.
