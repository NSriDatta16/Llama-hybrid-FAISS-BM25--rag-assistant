I am no expert in this topic, but there seem to be dedicated unit root tests developed for seasonal data. See for example: Ghysels, Eric, Hahn S. Lee, and Jaesum Noh. " Testing for unit roots in seasonal time series: some theoretical extensions and a Monte Carlo investigation. " Journal of Econometrics 62, No. 2 (1994): 415-442. While we find the procedure proposed by Hylleberg, Engle, Granger, and Yoo (1990) the most useful among the alternative procedures, we caution users of many remaining serious obstacles when testing for unit roots in seasonal time series. The Hylleberg, Engle, Granger, and Yoo (1990) approach is also included in the uroot package in R, see here for the Vignette . According to the ADF test, Dickey et al. (1984) obtained the critical values of $\phi$ under the following data generating process. $(1 − L^S)\,y_t = \Phi y_{t−S} + \epsilon_t$ , $\epsilon_t ∼ iid (0, \sigma_{\epsilon^2})$ where $S$ is peridocity of the data: 4 in the case of quarterly series and 12 for monthly series. Under the null hypothesis $\Phi$ is equal to 1 and the process contains all the roots in Table (2), page 7. In practice, however, it may be some, but not all, seasonal unit roots. Hence, it would be convenient to specify a model in which the regressors allow to test for individual roots. That is what Hylleberg et al. (1990) achieve in the case of quarterly series.The seasonal operator can be decomposed into the following polynomials: $(1 − L^4) = (1 − L)(1 + L)(1 − iL)(1 + iL)$ , where the roots are $(±1, ±i)$ . Assuming $y_t$ is generated by an AR(p) process, Hylleberg et al. (1990) show that $y_t$ can be represented as $\phi (L) \Delta^4 y_t = \pi_1 y_{1,t−1} + \pi_2 y_{2,t−1} + \pi_3 y_{3,t−2} + \pi_4 y_{3,t−1} + \epsilon_t$ , Hylleberg, Svend, Robert F. Engle, Clive WJ Granger, and Byung Sam Yoo. " Seasonal integration and cointegration ." Journal of Econometrics 44, No. 1-2 (1990): 215-238.
