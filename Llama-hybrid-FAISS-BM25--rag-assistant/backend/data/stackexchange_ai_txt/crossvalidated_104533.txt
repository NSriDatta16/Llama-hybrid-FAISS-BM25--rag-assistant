I agree with everything that's been said. What stands out for me are: How few machine learning "experts" are really interested in the subject matter to which they want to apply ML How few truly understand predictive accuracy and proper scoring rules How few understand principles of validation How few know when to use a black box vs. a traditional regression model How none of the "experts" seem to have ever studied Bayes optimum decision or loss/utility/cost functions [this lack of understanding is displayed almost any time someone uses classification instead of predicted risk]
