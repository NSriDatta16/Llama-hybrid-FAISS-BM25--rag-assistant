Multiple stores and multiple admins with different roles

I have no doubt magento can handle multiple stores, but I was wondering if each stores can handle with such specific user wherein they can access their catalog, sales, inventory, etc like administrator, but limited only on their specific store. Here's my sample representation: Magento website: ->Store Categories -->Store1 --->Product Categories ----->Products --->Store Owner -------- Who can logged in the backend to see all their products, sales, inventory, etc.. Only access their store. -->Store2 --->Product Categories ----->Products --->Store Owner2 ------ Who can logged in the backend to see all their products, sales, inventory, etc.. Only access their store.
