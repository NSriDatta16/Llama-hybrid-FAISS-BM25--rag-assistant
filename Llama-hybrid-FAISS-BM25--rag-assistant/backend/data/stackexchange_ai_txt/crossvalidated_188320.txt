Selecting "main" variables from PCA

I am trying to reduce a high dimensional data using FactomineR. I created a training and test data set and did a PCA. `bound From my understanding, the first 5/6 components are the variables that "matter" the most. I know this is a silly question, but how do I get the names of these (comp1, comp2, etc..? If my understanding please let me know. Or any other suggestions on how I would reduce the data (to find the most 'important' variables) which I will then use to do a cluster analysis. Some notes from data It includes many 0's and thus Inf when PCA is done. The data set is goal keeper (player) performance (it was match by match but I aggregrate it to make more sense) There are many variables compared to obervations (40 obs 196 Variables) GKPCA$loadings=null couldnt do princomp function
