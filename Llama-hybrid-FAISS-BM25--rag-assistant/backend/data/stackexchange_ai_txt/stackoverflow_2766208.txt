I try keep these monkey-patches to a minimum, only when they are very clearly in the best interest of my code. Lately I have preferred to keep the files organized in folders such as lib/monkey/string.rb, lib/monkey/hash.rb, etc. I then require all files in the lib/monkey folder in my environment.rb file. # Load all monkey-patches. Dir["lib/monkey/*.rb"].each {|monkeyfile| require monkeyfile} This keeps all of my class modifying code isolated to one location, should a problem arise. I also enjoy the somewhat goofy naming, because it makes it stand out as something to be mindful of. Someone may have a better system, if so ... I'd love to hear about it!
