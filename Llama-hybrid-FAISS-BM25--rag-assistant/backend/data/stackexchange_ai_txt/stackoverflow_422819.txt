Learn how to catch the keydown events using wxWidgets api, maybe here: http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_eventhandlingoverview.html#eventhandlingoverview pay attention to key events . Implement a switch in C++ to see what key combination was pressed, and set the text to the edit accordingly. What I'm thinking about here is to convert a CTRL-SHIFT-A keypress to a text like Ctrl-Shift-a in a edit box. If you are thinking of converting a combination of characters to other character, for example kanji or hiragana, the algorithm could be longer and more data structures required.
