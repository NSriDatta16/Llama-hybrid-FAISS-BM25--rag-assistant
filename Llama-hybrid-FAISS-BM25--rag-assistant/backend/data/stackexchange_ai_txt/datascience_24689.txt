What is the rationale to use weights and biases in a neural network?

Searched a lot of research papers, blogs and videos but couldnt find an acceptable answer for choosing the weights and biases in neural network. Few people have mentioned to use weights randomly but if that is the case isnt that is uncertain (fuzzy)?
