OpenSessionInViewInterceptor is designed to hold the session open for the duration of a single request. It is not designed to keep sessions open across multiple requests. Indeed, doing such a thing is strongly discouraged. Sessions should be released once the request is complete. If you're trying to re-attach a Hibernate object to a new session, as part of a new request, then you need to use something like reattach() , merge() , etc, on the Hibernate Session or EntitymManager . OpenSessionInViewInterceptor won't help you out here.
