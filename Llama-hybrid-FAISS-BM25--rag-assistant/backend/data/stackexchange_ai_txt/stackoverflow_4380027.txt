Best way to handle Braintree timeouts

I have an app in ruby that process payments through Braintree but We have experienced stalled Braintree responses. This is our minimum viable product so a lot of things are not fully implemented and we are not leveraging the Braintree API at full. Well basically a few customers have complained that the browser hangs and It is definitely a Braintree not responding issue. I haven't found any info on timeout handling on the BT docs. Hope the question isn't too broad. My main concern is Braintree processing the payment and the app not being notified.
