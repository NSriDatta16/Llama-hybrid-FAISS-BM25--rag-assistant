Appropriateness of Hierarchical Cluster Analysis with Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Matrix

I am looking at a zooplankton community assemblages using hierarchical cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. My input is a species abundance (log10(n+0.01)+1 transformed) by sample matrix. My question relates to the input for the hierarchical cluster analysis. Can I use the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity output for my hierarchical cluster analysis with Ward’s (ward.D2) as the method or does the fact that Bray-Curtis is non Euclidean violate a list of assumptions I haven’t gotten my head wrapped around yet? Using Bray-Curtis with the HCA and ISV produces results that make quite a bit of ecological sense, but I want to make sure I haven't tricked myself into thinking I know something I don't actually know (a la Pirsig). Here is my R code. # Get dissimilarity matrix from vegan's Bray-Curtis d Thank you for your time and suggestions.
