Bayesian exercise

I struggle to understand the following example... A new breast cancer screening method is tested to see if it performs better than existing methods in detecting breast cancer. To measure the sensitivity of the test, a total of 10,000 patients known to have various stages of breast cancer are testing using the new method. Of those 10,000 patients, 9,942 are identified by the new method to have breast cancer. Given that the sensitivity of the best current test is 99.3%, is there significant evidence at the α=0.05 level to conclude that the new method has higher sensitivity than existing methods? Hint - H0:p=0.993 and H1:p>0.993 The possible answers below: No, since the p-value under H0 of no difference is approximately equal to 0.081, which is greater than α=0.05 No, since the p-value under H0 of no difference is approximately equal to 0.063, which is greater than α=0.05 Yes, since the p-value under H0 of no difference is approximately equal to 0.048, which is less than α=0.05 Yes, since the p-value under H0 of no difference is approximately equal to 0.033, which is less than α=0.05 I would be very grateful for an explaination as I stuggle to grasp the concept. Many thanks! Markus
