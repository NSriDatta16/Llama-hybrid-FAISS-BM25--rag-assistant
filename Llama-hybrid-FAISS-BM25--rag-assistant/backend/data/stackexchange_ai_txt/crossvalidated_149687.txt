It's not that the dimensionality of the data (more precisely, the statistical process at work) is smaller than the coordinate space, it's that there is often not enough available data to get statistically significant results in every direction. This is a manifestation of the famed curse of dimensionality . PCA is an attempt to determine the directions in which you have the best shot at getting reliable and stable results - it does this by finding the directions in which the data is most spread out. Of course there are random processes that do only occur in a low dimensional subspace of the feature space, but in general it's best not to assume this is so without evidence. Nonetheless, in any situation, you are bound to do the best you can with the data you have, and the data you have can only support a finite number of inferences.
