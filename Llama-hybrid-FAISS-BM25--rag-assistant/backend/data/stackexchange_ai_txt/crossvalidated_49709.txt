Test for significance in a time series using R

I've got a time series data set that looks at population numbers on a yearly basis, and I would like to know if there is a significant difference between certain years, and if so- which years are statistically similar to each other. I'm using R, so I'm hoping to get some advice on R code to do this. Here is simplified example time series looking at a population by year: Year So given the above data, ideally I would hope for some method that would calculate if there is a significant trend over time (p value) and which years are statistically different from each other (I'm guessing 2001-04 would be in one grouping and 2005-06 would be in a second).
