I've started writing a wrapper class library in .NET 4.0 for the Mercurial command line client. It's far far too early to use for anything yet, but you might want to keep an eye on it. Hopefully it'll prove useful to more people than just me. The code is released as open source on bitbucket, here: http://bitbucket.org/lassevk/mercurial.net At the moment you can do basic log retrieval. The full syntax support for specying revsets is not in place, but you can do things like: var repo = new Repository(@"c:\dev\some\project\repo"); var log = repo.Log(verbose: true, set: RevisionSet.FromRevision(10)); // 10:tip var changesByMeThatModifiesIgnoreFile = from changeset in log where changeset.AuthorName == "Lasse V. Karlsen" && changeset.PathActions.Any(pa => pa.Path == ".hgignore" && pa.Action == PathActionType.Modify) select changeset; I plan on supporting all built-in commands so that you can commit, update, push, pull, check incoming and outgoing, clone, etc.
