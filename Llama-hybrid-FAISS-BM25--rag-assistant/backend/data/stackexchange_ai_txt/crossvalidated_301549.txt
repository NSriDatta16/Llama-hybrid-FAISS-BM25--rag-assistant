How to obtain covariance matrix eigenvalues from singular values?

I would like to implement closed form of PPCA ( Bishop, Tipping, 1999, Appendix A ). In this paper they calculate $W$ in formula (15) : $W=U_q(K_q-\sigma^2I)^{1/2}R$ where $K_q$ is a matrix from eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of covariance matrix as defined in formula (5) . On one hand I read here , that it is possible to calculate eigenvalues with $\lambda_i = \frac{s_i^2}{n-1}$ Is it true, that principal values depend on number of samples $n$? On other hand I found python implementation of closed PPCA on github, function __fit_ml , where it is written mu = np.mean(self.y, 1)[:, np.newaxis] [u, s, v] = np.linalg.svd(self.y - mu) ... else: ss = s[:self.q] ss = np.sqrt(np.maximum(0, ss**2 - self.prior_sigma)) w = u[:, :self.q].dot(np.diag(ss)) where author is apparently calculating with $\lambda_i = s_i^2$ which is completely different. UPDATE Here $s_i$ is diagonal element of singular values matrix. UPDATE 2 I have tried numeric example X = np.float64(np.array([ [-1, -1], [-2, -1], [-3, -2], [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 2]])) n_samples = np.shape(X)[0] X -= np.mean(X, axis=0) pca = PCA(n_components=2) pca.fit(X) cov_matrix = np.dot(X.T, X) / n_samples singularvalues = pca.singular_values_ for i in range(len(pca.components_)): eigenvector = pca.components_[i] eigenvalue = np.dot(eigenvector.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, eigenvector)) singularvalue = singularvalues[i] eigenvalue2 = singularvalue**2 / n_samples print("%f\t%f;\t%f" % (eigenvalue, singularvalue, eigenvalue2)) output 6.616286 6.300612; 6.616286 0.050381 0.549804; 0.050381 and found that answer depends on covariance matrix normalization. UPDATE 3 In the other hand it is written in Python's SVD documentation : The rows of v are the eigenvectors of a.H a. The columns of u are the eigenvectors of a a.H. For row i in v and column i in u, the corresponding eigenvalue is s[i]**2. UPDATE 4 Ah, sure, a.H a is "scatter matrix", i.e. covariance matrix w/o normalization.
