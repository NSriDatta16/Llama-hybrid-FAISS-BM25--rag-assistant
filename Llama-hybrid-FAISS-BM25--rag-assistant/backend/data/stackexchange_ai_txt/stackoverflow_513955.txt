I think you have covered the approaches I have thought of, there's no absolute "best" way to do it, what matters are your requirements and priorities. Personally I like the elegance of the SqlDependency class; and what does database independence matter in the real world for most applications anyway? But if it's a priority for you to have database independence then you can't use that. Polling is my second favourite because it keeps the database clean from triggers and application logic; it really isn't a bad option anyway because as you say it's simple. If application B can wait a few minutes at a time before "noticing" database changes, it would be a good option. So my answer is: it depends. :) Good luck!
