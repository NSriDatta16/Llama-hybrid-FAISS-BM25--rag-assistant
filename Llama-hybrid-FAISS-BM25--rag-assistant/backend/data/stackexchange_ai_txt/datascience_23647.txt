Curiously, a half way authoritative answer is possible. I too wanted to know this answer. Googling found very little until I stumbled across a Data Scientist job posting on amazon's web site. At least as of August 28, 2017 they were looking for: Solid background in statistical learning techniques for NLP (HMMs, CRFs, SVMs, LDA, LSI, MRFs etc) So this isn't an exhaustive list, in particular there could be interesting technologies that they don't want to advertise, but the above list is at least a subset of what techniques they use.
