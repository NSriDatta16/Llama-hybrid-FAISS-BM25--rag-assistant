Objective performance measures for PCA?

How can I measure how good my PCA was ? Of course, it depends A LOT on context, or even maybe subjectivity sometimes. But what objective measures can I use to measure how good my PCA was? It doesn't make sense to use sum of squared distances from original data points to projected points, because by PCA'S definition, I already know that was minimized. Also, it does not make sense to measure variance, because I already know by PCA's definition that it was maximized. Can you suggest other ways?
