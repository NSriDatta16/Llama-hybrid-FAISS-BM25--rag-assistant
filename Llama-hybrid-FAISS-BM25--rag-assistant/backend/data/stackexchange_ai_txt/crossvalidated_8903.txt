Comparing cosine similarities for tf-idf vectors for documents with different length

I'm computing cosine similarities between 2 vectors. These vectors are information retrieval query and document representations respectively. They have been computed using tf-idf weights. Since my documents have different length, tf-idf weights are theoretically unbounded. The question is: is cosine similarity still a valid measure? Can I compare several cosine similarities for each doc?
