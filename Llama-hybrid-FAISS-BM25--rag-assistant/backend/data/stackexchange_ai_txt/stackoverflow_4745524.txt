I have a product with Unit price and case price radio button set in the custom options I want the Unit price to be selected as default in the view.phtml page how can I do this? I have checked the function getValuesHtml() in core\Mage\Catalog\Block\Product\View\Options\Type\select.php Where can I change it ?
