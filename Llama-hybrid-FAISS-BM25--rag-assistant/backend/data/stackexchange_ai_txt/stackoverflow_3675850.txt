It may be a combination of several factors: A real memory leak. ( Objects are still referenced by accident) More objects, or maybe a different distribution of the objects between the gc-pools. The heap is larger. Plot the gc-time and the heap size. Memory fragmentation. On OS level and/or the java heap, depending on the jvm. Why don't you plot the number of objects, heap size and gc-time. (using a tool, or by quering MBeans) A plot should tell you the trend; increasing, decreasing or linear, and will help you to determine if there is a leak. If possible, also dump some statistics from your program, like the number of processed messages or active sessions etc. Is it a real problem since your messages are not processed during gc?. Try the concurrent mark and sweep gc... * -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC
