The topic you explain is frequently called overdispersion . In my work I saw a possible solution to such topic: Using a Bayesian approach, and estimating a Beta-Binomial distribution. This has the great advantage to other distributions (induced by other priors), to have a closed form solution. References: Beta-binomial distribution Peter Hoff Bayes estimators notes ( pdf )
