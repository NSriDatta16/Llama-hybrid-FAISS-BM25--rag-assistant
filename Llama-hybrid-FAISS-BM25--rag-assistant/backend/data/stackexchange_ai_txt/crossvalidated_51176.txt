Are the statistical assumptions the same between generalized linear models and boosted regression trees?

Do machine learning algorithms like Boosted Regression Trees (in the R package (gbm)) follow the same statistical assumptions of not including correlated predictor variables in GLM? i.e. If I have two correlated predictors (rsq=.7) should I be including both into my BRT model? Any input or thoughts on this question would be greatly appreciated.
