How to compare turnover rates across three facilities over a period of 5 years?

I need to compare the turnover rates between 3 facilities (turnover calculated as number of voluntary & involuntary terminations divided by the average number of staff multiplied by 100). In particular, I'm interested in whether one of these facilities demonstrates a lower turnover rate than the other two over a time period of 5 years. I have average turnover rates for 5 years (2014-2018) for each of these facilities. I'm guessing a repeated measures would do the trick, but I'm struggling with how to set the dataset up properly and executing the GLM procedure. I should say that I'm not so much interested in whether there were differences between these facilities in each particular year, but whether there were differences across the entire 5 year time period. I'm working with SPSS 24.
