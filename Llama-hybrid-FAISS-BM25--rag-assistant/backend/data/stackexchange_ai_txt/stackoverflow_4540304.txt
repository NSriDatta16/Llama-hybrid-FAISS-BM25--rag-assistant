I want to remove a paragraph which has specific class (PHP/Regex)

I think this won't count much combinations please, I need to remove from string a paragraph that has specific class (It is consistent) Example: Some content I want to remove the content of every paragraph which has special_class only. So I would like to run a regex that returns empty. I do not want to use a parser to do this please, i am using this in very little function inside my script. Thank you :)
