I assume you are considering a single pre-specified interaction hypothesis, as these tests do not apply if the factors to test are "found" by inspecting relationships with $Y$ . You've described the situation well, and since confidence intervals (or better: Bayesian credible intervals) are often preferred over hypothesis tests, I would mainly compute an uncertainty interval for the interaction effect (which represents a double difference if both factors are dichotomous) and interpret that in most cases. But that doesn't answer the question of reversal of an effect; it just estimates how different are the effects across levels of the interacting factor. When there is reversal, the interaction effect will tend to be large, but it can also be large due to a major change in effect that does not make the effect change directions. Hence there is a need for the Gail-Simon test. The Bayesian approach would involve computing the posterior probability that the effects change sign when comparing two levels of an interacting factor. When the interacting factor is not dichotomous, e.g. is continuous, one needs to model this more generally. For example, if treatment and age interact and the age effect is not linear, one can see differently shaped age effects for the two treatments. One can test nonlinear interactions by simultaneously testing all the interaction terms in a regression spline of age, for example. I discuss this in my RMS book and course notes .
