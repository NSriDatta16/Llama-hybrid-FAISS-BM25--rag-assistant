You do have to pay attention to the ordering, but libraries like JQuery make it easy to do it right. At the end of the page, include all the .JS files you need, and then, either in a separate file or in the page itself, put the Jquery calls to act on the page contents. Because JQ deals with css-style selectors, it's very easy to avoid any Javascript in the main body of the page - instead you attach them to IDs and classes. This is called Unobtrusive Javascript
