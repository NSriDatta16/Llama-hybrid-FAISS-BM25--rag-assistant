I hate to discourage you, but modern sound card drivers are extremely complicated, and as you probably know, OS-specific. This is one of the difficult challenges in OS development - driver support. It's not something that can be achieved with a simple code snippet. In order to load a file, you need a file system. Have you implemented that yet? The fact that you used the "kernel" flag suggests that your OS is still in its infancy. I'm not sure I would want to put sound support into the kernel of an operating system. That being said, there is a good emulator called Bochs that has Sound Blaster 16 emulation . And some really old documentation for how to program it. This might be your best bet. Accessing sound hardware was much easier back in the day.
