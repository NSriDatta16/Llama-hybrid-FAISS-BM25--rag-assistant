There are two ways that I organize the extension methods which I use, 1) If the extension is specific to the project I am working on, then I keep it in the same project/assembly, but in its own namespace. 2) If the extension is of a kind so that I may or is using it in other projects too, then I separate them in a common assembly for extensions. The most important thing to keep in mind is, what is the scope which I will be using these in? Organizing them isn't hard if I just keep this in mind.
