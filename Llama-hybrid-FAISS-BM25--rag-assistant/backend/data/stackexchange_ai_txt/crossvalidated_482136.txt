Is there any seasonal VAR or VARMA algorithm?

As I understand, VAR algorithms doesn't work with seasonal data. I mean, seasonal components are not in the autoregression equation. But, if I want find dependencies between several time series, that have seasonality, what should I do? Sure, I can use RNN. But I want to know, is there a solution for VAR or VARMA. Also I know, that there's a sVARMA in R. But I can't understand its documentation and how to predict values.
