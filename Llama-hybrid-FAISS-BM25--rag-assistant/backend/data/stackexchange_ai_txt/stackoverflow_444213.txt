In firefox, how to change color of text in a treecell using javascript

BACKGROUND: I have the following XUL fragment and the following css fragment tree { font-size: 120%; color: green;} This causes my column data to be displayed in green text. I have many such tree objects on the XUL page QUESTION: In firefox, in response to a click event, which calls a javascript routine, how do I set the data for the object "treeToChange" in column 1 red and the data in column blue?
