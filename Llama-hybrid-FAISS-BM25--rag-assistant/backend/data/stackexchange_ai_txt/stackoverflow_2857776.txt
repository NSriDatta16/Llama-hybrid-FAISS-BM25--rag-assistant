Flex 4 descendant pseudo selectors with CSS

Flex 4 offers descendant css selectors and pseudo-selectors like: s|DropDownList:open { font-size: 11; } s|DropDownList #labelDisplay { font-size: 12; } However, if I combine these two an wanted to do something like this, it doesn't seem to work: s|DropDownList:open #labelDisplay { font-size: 13; } Is this possible with descendant pseudo-selectors? (Of course I could use a styleName.open property on labelDisplay , but I think using pseudo-selectors is a more elegant solution)
