Parsing string variable with jstl

Here's my problem. I need to set up a process, preferably with jstl/jsp, that depending on what a client enters in a URL parameter, a certain URL will be returned, with the same parameters passed on, and opened via javascript pop up function. Problem I am having, is that the choose statement is not finding one of the parameters unless its one of the beginning parameters. (Now your thinking, 'huh?') The list of parameters the client is passing, looks like this... ?name=personsname&email=personsemail&tmplatecde=7&legalid=20266998&photoURL=%2Favmedia%2Fweb%2Findex%2F25505893822%2EJPG&agentNumber=047666&FWSType=FR&des=,+CLU%AE,+ChFC%AE&postto=thenetwork.nmfn.com&agentnumber=047666&formname=FWSContactForm2&attr=FRSite Out of that parameter, I only really need the 'formname.' However if I put the query string in like that, which is what the client is expecting to do, it won't find the formname. Move the formname parameter to before the 'name' parameter, it works. At my company we built a custom JSP tag that can simply take that query string and attach it to a specified URL, but to determine that URL I need to check what the formname is equal too. Does anyone have any ideas of an appropriate way to parse the string to get that formname value? So far, the code that I have that matters to this issue is Any help would be greatly appreciated.
