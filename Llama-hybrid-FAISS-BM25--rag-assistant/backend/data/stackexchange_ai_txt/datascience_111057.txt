I think, you are misusing MachineLearning & Deep Learning when trying to predict tomorrow... - any statistical Approximations of the chaos can show just averaged Tendency & its borders (variance) according probability distributions, but not the obligations of the evaluated system to be determined exactly one way (because social systems and their derivatives are rather volatile) and of course not tomorrow -- all predictions according existing Tendency can be realized in time - TILL something will change this Tendency ... and recall once again: calculations in ProbabilityTheory cannot give prediction of exact event, but the range of possible events - each of them having their own probabilities, but still having these probabilities (even if being low) in a very volatile environment of social needs, habits, laws, the daily routine & regulations in each country & etc. influencing financial markets
