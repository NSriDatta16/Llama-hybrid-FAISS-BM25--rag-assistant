Is a Restricted Boltzmann Machine appropriate for predicting a vector?

I have a very large set of animal migration data, consisting of many series of vectors - each series is basically a path of a single animal. The dataset I'm using consists of 244 of these series. I want to train a generative algorithm so that when it is given a collection of these series and a map of environmental variables, such as a map of ocean surface temperature, it can develop a model of how an animal reacts to these variables; when I feed it new variables, it would generate a new set of vectors. My question is which machine learning algorithm would be optimal for this kind of prediction - I was looking into multinomial logistic regression, but that is for categorical data. I want the algorithm to develop a model that thinks "at a point with an ocean surface temperature of 20˚C, an animal will travel along a vector with a magnitude of 35km and an angle of 34˚". Can a Restricted Boltzmann Machine be used to develop this kind of model? I would train the RBM with a set of vectors, each with environmental variables coupled to the head and tail of the vector - would the RBM be able to create a new set of vectors if I then fed in different environmental variables?
