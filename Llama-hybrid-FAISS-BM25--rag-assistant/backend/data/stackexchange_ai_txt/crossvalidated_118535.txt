Relative importance of categorical variable in logistic regression

I would like to rank variables of a logistic regression model on the basis of their predictive importance. The model has both categorical and continuous variables. For this purpose, is it okay to assign say 1,2,3,4..... values to categories of a categorical variable and treat it as a continuous variable and then standardize it along with other continuous variables and get standardised estimates from logistic regression using the standardized variables as input to the model? If the purpose is to find relative importance of variables of an already built model, is this approach alright?
