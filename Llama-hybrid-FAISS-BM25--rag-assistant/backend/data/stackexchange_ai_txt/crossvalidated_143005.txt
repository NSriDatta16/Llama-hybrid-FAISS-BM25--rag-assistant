Beside the important factors that have been pointed by Katherine S, I would like to add some more. First, you did not conduct the wrong reliability test. Cronbach Alpha is often used to test the reliability in questionnaires like this in disciplines such as marketing, organizational behavior, etc. I want to remind you that Cronbach Alpha is based on the interrelation of items. So the items have to be closely related to one another for a good Cronbach Alpha. For example, what are the chances that people who answered totally agree ("5") in Layout item 1 (The menu has clear dish classification) would also give the same answer in Layout item 2 (I am attracted to big pictures on the top or left upper corner)? Another example, what are the chances that people who answered totally agree ("5") in Menu Information item 1 (The dish description is too complicated) would also give the same answer in Menu Information item 3 (I am aware with the price given)? If you think, hmm.. not so much, then you have a problem. Because that means that the items are not "measuring the same construct" and Cronbach Alpha would automatically become low. Cronbach Alpha can also be low due to the low number of items. You can simply boost your Cronbach Alpha with more items. Lots of luck!
