It's not functions but array members. It's not IP address they output but HTTP headers (Note HTTP_ in them) The only one contains IP address is $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] Why the other functions dont output anything? Because these HTTP headers are optional. Are there any other cool functions Sure print_r($_SERVER); will show you them all Note get_browser() function which helps you to get more structured info out of User-Agent header.
