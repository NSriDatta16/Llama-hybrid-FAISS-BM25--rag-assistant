advantage of variational autoencoder

I know that VAE is generative model. However it is also used as a dimensionality reduction method. In this case, what are advantages of VAE?? Also I saw that well-applied vae on mnist, and it was more adjusted to mnist data than SAE(Stacked Auto Encoder). In this case, what makes it more effective on mnist data than SAE?
