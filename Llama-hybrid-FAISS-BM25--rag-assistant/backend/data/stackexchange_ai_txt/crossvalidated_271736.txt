K-Means clustering visualization & evaluation

I want to know after running K-means algorithm on a data set of say 10 variables and getting optimal clusters through Elbow curve--how do I to evaluate the goodness of these clusters (I mean apart from visual review), how do I say quantitatively that these are decently spaced out clusters? Since algorithm will anyway form clusters but what's the measure to say that these are well formed distinct clusters or 'natural groups' like a comparison to standard measure of distance? And what's the best way to visualize K-means done on multidimensional data? Is it something like TSNE or first doing PCA and then visualizing?
