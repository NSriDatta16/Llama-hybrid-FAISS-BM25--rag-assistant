Not sure of a perfect answer, but there is a Unicode range for katakana and hiragana listed on Wikipedia. (Which I would expect are also available from unicode.org as well.) Hiragana: Unicode: 3040-309F Katakana: Unicode: 30A0â€“30FF Checking those ranges against the input should work as a validation for hiragana or katakana for Unicode in a language-agnostic manner. For kanji, I would expect it to be a little more complicated, as I expect that the Chinese characters used in Chinese and Japanese are both included in the same range, but then again, I may be wrong here. (I can't expect that Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese to be included in the same range...)
