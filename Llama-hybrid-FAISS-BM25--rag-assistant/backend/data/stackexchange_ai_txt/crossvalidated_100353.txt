Minimum number of observations needed to perform PCA or FA

I read in this paper (page 3) comparing principal component analysis (PCA) to factor analysis (FA) that both methods need a number of observations about 5 times the number of variables. Why? and how would you reduce the number of variables if you have few observations only?
