Forget the arguments about DB Size, it is an uninformed reason to shift to a client-server platform in 90% of the cases I hear it brought up. Your best arguments are based on features explained at a low tech level: (1) You can backup and perform maintenance on the DB without kicking out the users (which introduces costly downtime). (2) Faster recovery if data is accidentally deleted/mangled or corrupted. Again, less risk and less downtime. This is always a good foundation for a business case. (3) If (and only if) you anticipate the need to scale quite a bit, the upgrade will better allow that. (4) If you need to run automated jobs/updates, SQL can do this much more elegantly. Remember the contra-indications for SQL, it is easy to get on your technical high-horse about this platform versus that, but you have to balance the benefits against the costs. SQL is a Helluva lot more expensive to maintain as it requires dedicated hardware, expensive licenses (Server OS and DB) and usually at least a part time DBA that is going to cost you a bare minimum of $75K (if you get luck AND work out of Podunk Iowa).
