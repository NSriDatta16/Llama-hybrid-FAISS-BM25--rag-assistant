The short and best advice is for you to learn Bayesian inference. The linked paper makes some very good points and gives some good recommendations, but those are not the only possible recommendations. Rejecting any use of confidence intervals based on the paper is like "throwing out the baby with the bathwater". There are definite problems with how some confidence intervals are interpreted, and using the wrong confidence interval procedure can lead to meaningless intervals (but using the wrong Bayesian credible interval procedure can also lead to meaningless inference). The common approximation methods for confidence intervals for a proportion do not work very well when the true proportion is near 0 or 1. My preferred interval in that case (and even when not near 0 or 1) is a Bayesian credible interval (or even full posterior), but you should understand what assumptions are being made and what the interval means, not just plug numbers into a formula. You can investigate the various confidence/credible/compatibility interval procedures that work well for your likely situation and choose the one that works best (but understand what they are really saying, what assumptions are being made, and what their limitations are).
