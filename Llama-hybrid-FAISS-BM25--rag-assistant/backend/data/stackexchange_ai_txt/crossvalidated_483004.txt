Instrument Variable Approach for a system of 6 endogenous variables

I am working on an econometric model that features 6 endogenous variables and several exogenous variables. The data is in panel form, that is, we are observing 130 countries over 17 years. Our endogenous variables are things like democracy and income per capita. The issue arises in trying to identify reverse causality. FInding 6 different instruments, especially for variables like income per capita, seems like an impossible task. Is there any way to establish casuality/deal with the endogeneity issues? If not, are there any classical instruments for income per capita? Edit: The variables are as follows: Endogenous: Statehood: a measure of state fragility EIU: The Economist's measure of democracy Corruption Income per capita Average years of education GINI: A measure on inequality Exogenous: Location Geographical features (landlocked, access to resources, etc) colonial history demographic make up
