Rescaling logistic regression coefficients such that variance remains constant

I'm reading " A Modern Maximum-Likelihood Theory for High-dimensional Logistic Regression " by Pragya Sur, and trying to recreate Figure 2, for my own edification. The covariates, $X$ , are i.i.d. $N(0,1/n)$ , where $n=4000$ and there are $p=800$ predictors. I put together a python simulation to sample from that distribution, assign the true $\beta$ 's as indicated in the paper (the first $100$ $\beta$ 's are equal to $10$ , the next $100$ are equal to $-10$ , and the remaining 600 are equal to $0$ . I then get the responses according to a logistic model and do a logistic regression to compare the estimated coefficients to the true coefficients. My results are off by a bit and I think it's because in the paper they say to scale the coefficients in such a way that $$Var(\textbf{X}_{i}'\boldsymbol{\beta})=5.$$ And I'm able to find that $$Var(\textbf{X}_{i}'\boldsymbol{\beta})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^p {\beta}_{j}^2$$ . So, in order for that expression to equal $5$ , I should replace $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ with $$\boldsymbol{\beta}^*=\boldsymbol{\beta}\sqrt{5n/(\sum_{j=1}^p {\beta}_{j}^2)}.$$ So then $Var(\textbf{X}_{i}'\boldsymbol{\beta}^*)=5$ . If this is not correct, how exactly do I rescale the coefficients and how should I implement it? I am currently replacing $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ with $\boldsymbol{\beta}^*$ when computing the true response values. I'm also not sure if I need to scale the estimates $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$ computed by the logistic regression.
