Treating ordered categorical predictors as continuous is discussed extensively on this page . With a fairly large number of ordered levels for your trial numbers you have the following two extreme approaches: Treating trial number as a continuous predictor will only use up one degree of freedom in the analysis, but at the cost of assuming that a 1-unit change in trial number has the same effect on outcome (continuous for ordinary linear regression, log-odds for logistic regression), regardless of trial number (other things being equal). That is the critical issue with respect to "validity" of that approach, although you can test that linearity assumption in the same way you test the linearity assumption about any predictor in a regression. At the other extreme, treating trial number as a categorical (albeit ordered) predictor will use up a large number of degrees of freedom: for 16 trial numbers, 15 degrees of freedom. That can reduce the power of your analysis substantially and runs a risk of overfitting unless you have very many subjects. There are, however, useful intermediate choices you could make. These are compatible with mixed models of the type you wish to build. You could use a restricted cubic spline to fit a reasonably smooth function of trial number as part of the regression. That provides flexibility in the relationship between outcome and trial number while only using up a few degrees of freedom, depending on the number of knots you specify. A quick search shows a MATLAB implementation of this approach. Another intermediate choice, discussed on this page with several references, is to penalize the coefficients for the ordered categorical variable in a way that effectively reduces the number of degrees of freedom used up and thus the danger of overfitting when you have a large number of categories. That's implemented in the ordPens package in R, with some background to the approach described in this paper . So to answer your question: yes, treating trial number as a continuous predictor could lose some information. How much that matters, and whether other alternatives to full categorical coding could be useful, will depend on your data and on your study design. Remember: "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
