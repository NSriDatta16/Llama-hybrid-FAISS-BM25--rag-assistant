"SVD did not converge" while using statsmodel.timeseriesanalysis.MarkovRegression

I am trying to fit a MarkovRegression model sm.tsa.MarkovRegression(spread, k_regimes=2, switching_variance=True) to a time series of price spread. This is the error that I get: raise LinAlgError("SVD did not converge") numpy.linalg.LinAlgError: SVD did not converge . I have checked the data for nans and removed them. The price series is on an intraday basis and has a length of 6729. Any help on dealing with this error is much appreciated.
