Planning on Trying out Oracle ADF Technology

I'd like to try the Oracle ADF technology and have tried a sample step by step tutorials on the oracle sites. Judging from what I have seen, here's my personal comments. Drag and Drop operations. Makes me feel that I am programming Desktop application for the web. I havent done any Javascript or CSS coding but I was able to create a simple AJAX functionality I didnt bother about cross browser problems. The business component mapping are awesome JDeveloper made everything quick Professional looking site without you not being a CSS/AJAX guru. With all of these, can I say that Oracle already polish this new technology? Is this the next big thing in J2EE dev? Is it worth investing time studying this and will learning this technology allows me greater opportunity? Is there a fair market share on these technologies now? I have tried doing Web programs using Servlet/JSP only. Then I tried with Struts and Spring but I often took a long time doing a simple search/update page with these technologies. I cannot say any Cons for now as I havent done serious web projects with ADF. What do you think guys? Thanks
