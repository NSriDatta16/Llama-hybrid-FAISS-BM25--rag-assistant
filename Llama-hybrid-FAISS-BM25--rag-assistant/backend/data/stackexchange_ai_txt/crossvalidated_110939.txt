Short answer: yes, you can interpret them in the exact same way as for the un-regularized Lasso. Longer answer - a nice interpretation of Lasso logistic regression is a generalized linear model where the parameters have a Laplacian prior - so the relationship between $E[y]$ and $\vec{x}$ is still the same as in the simple logistic regression model.
