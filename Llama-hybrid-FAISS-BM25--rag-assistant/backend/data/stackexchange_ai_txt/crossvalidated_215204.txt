How can I find the field which most affects or contributes to decision making in a machine learning algorithm?

Consider the example below. On a larger dataset, it would be fairly obvious that name and gender are not a good indicator of whether a person is an adult or a kid, and that it's age which best decides the class. How can I use statistics or an algorithm or a function / parameter in say, R to understand which column / field most affects the class I'm trying to predict. gender = c('M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M') name = c('John', 'Anthony', 'Mark', 'Joe', 'Will') age = c(10, 20, 30, 20, 17); class = c('Kid', 'Adult', 'Adult', 'Adult', 'Kid') > df = data.frame(age, gender, name, class) > df age gender name class 1 10 M John Kid 2 20 F Anthony Adult 3 30 M Mark Adult 4 20 F Joe Adult 5 17 M Will Kid
