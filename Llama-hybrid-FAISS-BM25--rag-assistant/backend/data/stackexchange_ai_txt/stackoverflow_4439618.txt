JFrame is an indirect subclass of Container that implements method public Component[] getComponents() . Once you have reference to you JFrame you can iterate over its components and create XML if you need. Pay attention that if one of the components is instance of Container you should go inside recursively. I believe that this is what you should implement into your CreateXML class.
