I feel people are trying to answer the question from a technical point of view, but the issue here is process. Why oh why? Your client is insisting on entering data like that? That is completely ridiculous. You will have a nightmare even validating it. Let alone parsing it properly. Tell him/her you roll a decent user interface for them, choose your own storage mechanism and it will alleviate all the problems/issues and incorrect formatting that users will have by entering it like that. It is madness . Another completely different thing to note is that it seems that children come from one parent. I wasn't aware homo sapiens was autogamous.
