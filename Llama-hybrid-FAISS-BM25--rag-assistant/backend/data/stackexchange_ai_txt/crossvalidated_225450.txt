The Fisher information you present in the first formula is for a single observation . The Hessian is for a sum of $n$ terms . Consequently the Hessian and the corresponding information for the entire sample incorporate $n$ terms - when you invert it effectively has a $\frac{1}{n}$ in it, multiplied by the inverse of the "average" of those $n$ terms.
