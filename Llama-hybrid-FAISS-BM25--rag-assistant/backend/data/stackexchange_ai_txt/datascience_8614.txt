You could start by learning R or Python and Machine Learning in one of those languages. Some other free options for books are The LION Way: Machine Learning plus Intelligent Optimization and Learning Deep Architectures for AI , which are both freely available online. There's also the free and open Artificial Intelligence course by Berkeley at edX. I have listed all the free books I could find on machine learning and artificial intelligence books at LearnDataSci, if you're interested.
