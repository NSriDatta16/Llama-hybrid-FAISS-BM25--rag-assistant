What is the minimum number of data points required to use ARIMA(p,d,q)?

I'm using the $\mathrm{ARIMA}$ $(p,d,q)$ model to predict future time series data in R (see also R's ARIMA documentation ). Q : What is the minimum the number of data points we must have in the time series before using $\mathrm{ARIMA}(p,d,q)$ ? I originally thought it would be $\max(p,q)$ , based on the model's description. But this doesn't seem to work in R. E.g. for the lh dataset, we need $4$ data points for it to work when $(p,d,q)=(1,1,1)$ : arima(lh[1:3],c(1,1,1)) Error in optim(init[mask], armaCSS, method = optim.method, hessian = FALSE, : initial value in 'vmmin' is not finite > arima(lh[1:4],c(1,1,1)) Call: arima(x = lh[1:4], order = c(1, 1, 1)) Coefficients: ar1 ma1 0.000 0.0000 s.e. 707.273 707.2718 sigma^2 estimated as 0.01333: log likelihood = 2.22, aic = 1.56 I suspect this is complicated by the method for finding the model's coefficients. (I'm seeking the minimum number mostly for coding reasons: I want to get a feel for how good the ARIMA prediction is as (a) the number of data points vary, and (b) as p,d,q vary. So I'm plotting a lot of estimates (to see what is and what isn't meaningful). But if R returns "Error" then I need to fix it manually.)
