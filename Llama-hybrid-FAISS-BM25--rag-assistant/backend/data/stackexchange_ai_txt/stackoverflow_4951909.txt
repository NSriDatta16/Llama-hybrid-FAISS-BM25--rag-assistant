I think you can't just join these monthly tables, because they are not really related in that way. They share the same merchant address, but that's all. Using UNION ALL, you can combine the results of multiple queries. That way you can get the value of all monthly records in a subquery and sum them in a parent. I took the liberty of adding some aliasing in your queries. SELECT m.`Rep Number`, SUM(m.vol10) as VOL_2010_10, SUM(m.vol11) as VOL_2010_11, SUM(m.vol12) as VOL_2010_12, m.First, m.Last FROM ( SELECT ma.`Rep Number`, r10.`Qual Cr Vol` + r10.`Qual Ch Vol` AS vol10, null as vol11, null as vol12 FROM MerchantAddresses ma INNER JOIN RESIDUALS_2010_10 as r10 on r10.MID = ma.MID UNION ALL SELECT ma.`Rep Number`, null as vol10, r11.`Qual Cr Vol` + r11.`Qual Ch Vol` AS vol11, null as vol12 FROM MerchantAddresses ma INNER JOIN RESIDUALS_2010_11 as r11 on r11.MID = ma.MID UNION ALL SELECT ma.`Rep Number`, null as vol10, null as vol11, r12.`Qual Cr Vol` + r12.`Qual Ch Vol` AS vol12 FROM MerchantAddresses ma INNER JOIN RESIDUALS_2010_12 as r12 on r12.MID = ma.MID ) m INNER JOIN Reps r ON r.ID = m.`Rep Number` GROUP BY m.`Rep Number` ORDER BY SUM(m.vol12) DESC
