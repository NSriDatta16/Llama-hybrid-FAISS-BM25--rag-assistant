Feature engineering for fraud detection

I'm doing some research into fraud detection for academic purposes. I' d like to know specifically about techniques for feature selection\engeneering from a transactional dataset. In more details, given a dataset of transactions (credit card for example), what kind of features are selected to be used on the model and how are they engineered? All the papers I've come across focus on the model itself (SVM, NN, ...) not really touching on this subject. Also, if anyone knows of public datasets that are not anonymized - that would also help. Btw I've already been through this answer Thanks
