In Bayesian Linear Regression, do I need to take multiple samples of the Posterior for prediction?

Given $$\begin {align} \beta&\sim\mathcal N(1.5,1)\\ y&\sim\mathcal N(\beta x,5.5) \end{align} $$ I have 10,000 samples from the posterior $\beta_S\sim P(\beta|x)$ Is it enough to get the prediction posterior samples by computing $\hat \mu_s=\beta_s x$ for $s=1\cdots10,000$ ? And getting a Single sample with dimension $(10000,1)$ from $ \mathcal N(\hat\mu,5.5) $ ? Or do I still need to take N samples of the above and get a sample dimension $(N,10000,1)$ ? I need the prediction distribution samples and I don't know how to properly get the posterior predictive samples.
