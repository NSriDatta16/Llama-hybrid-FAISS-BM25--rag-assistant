Scene graph for 2D engine

For my experimental 2D engine, I want to include a scene graph implementation to, with good performance, determine which objects have to be rendered (are visible for the camera). Unfortunately, I don't know much about the further details on how that would work. A scene graph, as far as I know, is at its core a tree-based structure which can be used to organize child-parent relationships better. How should one implement a 2D scene graph when aiming for the determination of what should be rendered in a single frame?
