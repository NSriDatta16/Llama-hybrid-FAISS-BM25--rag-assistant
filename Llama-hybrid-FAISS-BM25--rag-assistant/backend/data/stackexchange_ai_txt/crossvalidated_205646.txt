[Reproducing a blog entry I wrote a while ago:] It is indeed a popular belief that something needs to be done to counteract restricted supports. However, there is no mathematical reason for doing so! If we look at the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability $$\rho(x_t,y_{t+1})= \text{min} (1, \pi(y_{t+1})q(x_t|y_{t+1})\big/ \pi(x_t)q(y_{t+1}|x_{t}) )$$ (duplicated from the mcmc tag wiki ), with $y_t\sim q(y_{t+1}|x_{t})$, if $y_t$ is outside the support of $\pi$, we can extend the support by defining $\pi(y)=0$ outside the original support. Hence, if $\pi(y_{t+1})=0$, $\rho(x_t,y_{t+1})=0$, which means the proposed value is rejected and $x_{t+1}=x_t$. Consider the following illustration. target=function(x) (x>0)*(x that is targeting a truncated normal distribution using a Gaussian random walk proposal with support the entire real line. Then the algorithm is properly converging as shown by the fit below:
