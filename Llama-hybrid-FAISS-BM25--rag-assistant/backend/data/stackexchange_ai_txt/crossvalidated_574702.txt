Analysis on repeated measurements with only one follow-up outcome

I would like to analyze the association between dietary intake and a specific health outcome. Now suppose I have 100 subjects, each having 10 repeated measurements of dietary intake collected from the following 10 weeks (i.e. the data shape is 100*10). And in the 11th week, I have acquired the follow-up outcome of the health status (diseased/not diseased) for each subject. Then, how can I achieve my goal for the analysis? I am thinking of some simple regression models, but perhaps it would be better to make the best use of the repeated measurements of dietary intake. This seems like a longitudinal design, but I only have one outcome variable at one time point. Is it okay for just calculating the average intake across the ten time points and regressing the average intake on the binary outcome using logistic regression? Or maybe is there a better choice to construct a one-dimension indicator from the repeated measurements, so that I can include it in a regression model?
