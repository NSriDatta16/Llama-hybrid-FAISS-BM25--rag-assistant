Could a unique variable such as invoice_id be used as a target variable?

I am trying to create a machine learning algorithm that will match invoice numbers with un-applied accounts receivable receipts. un-applied receipts are just receipts that do not match the details we have in our database such as the amount. My problem is that I do not know what the target variable should be. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.
