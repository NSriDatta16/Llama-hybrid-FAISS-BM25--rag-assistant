Ideally, you should change the name of one of the header files! Although you can certainly have same-named files in different folders within a project-- and in some cases, such as when you pull in third-party libraries, it'll just happen-- headers that you reference from Interface Builder should be a small subset that are under your control as your UI pieces. You should just rename one of the classes. (There may be a way to get IB to differentiate, but even if there is, it seems like a fragile setup.)
