Analyst's answer is in fact correct. If p>n you end up with an underdetermined system and can use pseudo-inverse to solve it. When you have more parameters than equations as in this case, using pseudo-inverse finds the minimum euclidian norm solution. This is the best assumption you can do since this solution has the lowest variance. That is also what you achieve with ridge regression but in a different way. We want this since, given a model $Y=Xb$, if there is noise in measurement $X$ i.e $X_n=X+n$, then estimate $Y=X_n b$ will have an error of $nb$ that its value depends on norm of $b$. I ignored the constant parameter because one can set it equal to the average of samples and use the above model to estimate the rest.
