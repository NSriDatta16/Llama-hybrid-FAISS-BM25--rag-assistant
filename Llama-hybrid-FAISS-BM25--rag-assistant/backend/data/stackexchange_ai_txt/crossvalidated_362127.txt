Dealing with missing data in Time Series or non-constant time intervals for forecasting in R (ARIMA, Holt Winters, Theta)

I have a time series of sensor data from a machine. This machine is sometimes moved and thus there are big chunks of missing data, here is a plot of the data points: My goal is to try to start building some basic forecasting models, I thought I would try Holt Winters, ARIMA, and Theta methods. However I have noticed that the way these methods work (at least in R), is they expect a time series with constant time intervals instead of what I have: > glimpse(test_df) Observations: 19,086 Variables: 2 $ System_Time 2018-02-01 13:26:00, 2018-02-01 13:31:00,... $ System_Variable 1240, 1400, 1210, 1270, 1230, 1170, 1180,... I am fairly new to this and unsure how to proceed, as I can't use any functions like ts() without fixing this. My time series also says it has frequency = 1 even though it spans over several months. I have tried running auto.arima just to see what happens and it just spits out a flat static line: Trying to use holt winters is even worse, it just goes straight up. I am unsure of what to do, I am guessing I could do something like interpolate? But that seems dodgy at best.
