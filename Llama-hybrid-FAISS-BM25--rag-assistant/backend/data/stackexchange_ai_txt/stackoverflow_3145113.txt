I just found out something about the expect module. There is an undef option that can be used with expect like $exp->expect(undef). This will wait indefinitely and lets all commands finish their processing. But the problem is that, it does not return back the control to the host machine. There is one more option of using expect with eof which will wait until it encounters an eof and then returns to the host machine. Although no idea precisely how to use it. An elegant solution that I found is to use ssh to run commands on remote machine rather than using expect in which case we do not have to deal with timeouts. :)
