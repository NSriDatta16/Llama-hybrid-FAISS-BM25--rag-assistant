Not sure if it'll help, but my "PanelManager" might make things a little easier (if you're not already using a larger framework with similar functionality): DP_PanelManager "Panels" are just normal DOM elements with extensions for common actions/modifications (moving, resizing, etc). Panels can exist within one or more "PanelManagers" which allow you to treat them as a single unit (sorting, looping, etc). Look at the example "Drag-and-Drop with Ordering" for a simplified example of (what I think) you're looking for. You would then need to do the same kind of looping to save whatever information you want (probably just name and position). In any case there might be some code there you can rip out - feel free to fold, spindle and/or mutilate.
