Time series and survival analysis are both possible options. Time series would be used to find temporal patterns, while survival analysis would help predict the time until a user is blocked. You could also use anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns or you could treat it as a classification problem , if you have labeled events. Regardless of the method, you'd have to do some feature engineering first (e.g., calculating the number of comments by each user given a time frame). Also, ideally, you'd like to periodically review some of the model's decisions to check whether it's performing well. As for frameworks, your choice will depend on the model, but some of the most popular ones are scikit-learn, statsmodels, and prophet.
