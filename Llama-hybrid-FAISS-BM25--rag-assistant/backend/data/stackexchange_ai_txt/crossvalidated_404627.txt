Is it better to estimate a population parameter directly or via a proportion?

Situation I'll describe the situation through a made-up example. Suppose there is a village of 1,000 households where people collectively bought $F$ kg of food over some period of time, and ended up wasting some proportion of it ( $W$ ) equal to $F_w$ kg (where $F_w = F \times W$ ). Assume we know there are no households that bought no food ( $F_i$ is always positive). Imagine I am the Secretary of State for the Environment who wants to charge the village mayor a fixed penalty for each kg of food wasted. The total amount, $F$ , is known, but $F_w$ is unknown and needs to be estimated. I can't survey every household so I need to take a sample. I select $n$ random households and for each household record the amount of food bought ( $F_i$ ) and wasted ( $F_{wi}$ ). I now have two options for estimating the total $F_w$ from the sample. Option 1: direct estimation Here, the estimate would be based on the average per household extrapolated to all 1,000 households: $$1000\times\left(\overline{F}_w\pm \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$ where $s$ is the sample standard deviation. Option 2: estimation via the proportion Here, the average proportion wasted would be worked out from the two measures: $\overline{W} = \frac{\sum F_{wi}}{\sum F_i}$ and extrapolated to the total population parameter $F$ : $$F\left( \overline{W} \pm \text{std. err.} \right)$$ The standard error above is not specified as there are several definitions of it for a proportion estimate. It could be based, for example, on the Wilson or the Agresti-Coull method. Question Which method would be most appropriate and recommended for this type of situation?
