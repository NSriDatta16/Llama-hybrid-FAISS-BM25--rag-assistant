How to track users across domains?

We got pitched this idea yesterday. A user visits our site and are marked. Then when they visit other sites like CNN they are targeted with adds for our site. So once they are exposed to us, they start to see us everywhere, creating the illusion we are bigger than we are. The person pitching it said it was done by cookies. I was very skeptical since I don't believe there to be anyway to see what cookies a different domain has set. So I wanted to try an figure out how it was accomplished. The salesman called this technology pixel tracking . I have never heard of pixel tracking but from my research I have found that it is placing a 1 pixel image that references a script on another domain with parameters to be executed. My first thought was, OK maybe its possible this way.. But I still don't know how? Can anyone explain how they are able to mark you as visited our site, and then see this mark on another site? Is it from your IP?
