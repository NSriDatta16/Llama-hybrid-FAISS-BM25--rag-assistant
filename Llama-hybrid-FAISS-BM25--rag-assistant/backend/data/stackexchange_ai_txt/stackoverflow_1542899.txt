Which Tab Control does Visual Studio 2008 use?

Which tab control does VS 2008 use and is it possible to reference and use it in C# projects? I have not been able to find anything on the web about it, but admittedly "VS2008 Tab Control" is a bit generic. It's a great tab control and I would love to leverage it in my own projects.
