Need blog and shopping cart to contain same login

Hello and thank you in advance! I am setting up a site and it needs both a blog and a shopping cart. I would prefer to have them both have the same user database and session, so that if they log-in to one they log-in to the other. I was wondering if anyone has had experience with this and if they found that two specific platforms that worked well together or a single platform that fulfilled both roles well. The shopping cart doesn't need to be more than basic. I was thinking of using magento and phpBB or Magento and wordPress but I am impartial to any specific platform. Thanks again! Oh and obviously it must use PHP and MySQL ;-)
