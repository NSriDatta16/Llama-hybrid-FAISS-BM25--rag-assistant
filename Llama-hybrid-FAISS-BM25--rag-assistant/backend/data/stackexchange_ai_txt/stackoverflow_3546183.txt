The server must be generating a different PH1 value based on some request parameters. You'll have to trace out the HTTP headers from both requests to see what causes the difference, e.g. setting up a local proxy such as http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/ and making both requests through that. It could be some combination of the user agent, accepts headers, cookies or the IP or country you're connecting from that's makign the difference - without knowing what the server logic is (or understanding what the different PH1 values mean) we can't really help you sorry.
