There are a large number of possible candidates for multiclass classification. Logit (as multinominal logit) is one option of many. What type of classifier works best usually is a matter of the problem at hand and depends on many different things (including the amount and nature of the data as well as class balance). To my best knowledge, there is no classifier for which one can say that it generally works well with many classes. However, you may try a random forest or boosting, as tree based estimators are easy to apply and tend to be rather „robust“. The sklearn page provides a helpful overview of multiclass classifiers supported by sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html
