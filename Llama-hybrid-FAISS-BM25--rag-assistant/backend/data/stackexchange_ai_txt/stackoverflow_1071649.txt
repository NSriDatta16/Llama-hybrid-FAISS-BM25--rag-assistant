Yes, it's true, SQL Server 2008 just implemented a feature like the one you mention, it's called a filestream. And it's a good argument indeed for storing blobs in a DB, if you are certain you will only want to use SQL Server for your app (or are willing to pay the price in either performance or in developing a similar layer on top of the new DB server). Although I expect similar layers will start to appear if they don't already exist for different DB servers. As always what would the real benefits be depend on the particular scenario. If you will serve lots of relatively static, big files, then this scenario plus caching will probably be the best option considering a performance/manageability combo. This white paper describes the FILESTREAM feature of SQL Server 2008, which allows storage of and efficient access to BLOB data using a combination of SQL Server 2008 and the NTFS file system. It covers choices for BLOB storage, configuring Windows and SQL Server for using FILESTREAM data, considerations for combining FILESTREAM with other features, and implementation details such as partitioning and performance.
