This is a terrible idea... you should just make it an inline function. However, the problem is that you have surrounded your definition in parentheses which makes it incorrect. Remove the parentheses and also remove the semicolon at the end (so that you can place a semicolon after it), and it should work. In other words, change your definition to: #define PrintDigit(c, d) \ for (int i = 0; i You can make this a little bit less fragile by putting it in an inner scope: #define PrintDigit(c,d) \ do{\ for (int i = 0; i
