The PHP version requirements listed on Magento's site for PHP (5.2.13+) should be used for the latest releases. As far as the Web Services, as long as the PHP version requirements are met, and the SOAP module is installed and enabled you shouldn't have any problems. For previous versions like 1.4.x.x, the last entry from way back machine shows 5.2.0+ So it would safe to assume the latest 5.2.x of PHP will work.
