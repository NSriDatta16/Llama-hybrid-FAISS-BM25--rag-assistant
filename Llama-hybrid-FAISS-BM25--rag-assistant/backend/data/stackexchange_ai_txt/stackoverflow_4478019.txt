enterprise (and maybe professional) edition has the feature you are talking about, separating admin users by store. If you need to restrict that in admin level with community edition you can set up multiple software versions from same development branch with different databases (git is awesome on version tool for that). Lots of different ways to do so if Enterprise is out of reach regarding of performance i guess you will need a powerful VPS or dedicated machine if you are serious about it and as the traffic grows you then should think about load balancing. Look for magento dedicated host companies for that and it won't run in $5 or $20 per month hosts
