A log-linear model from the nnet package (function ?multinom ) can estimate the 4 simultaneous logistic regression models comparing the risk of opting for products B, C, D, or E vs A (as a referent). This will also give rise to absolute probabilistic predictions for each of the 5 products. The space of all possible log-linear models might be too large. You describe 5 possible features: aside from age, gender, and marital status, we know nothing of geographic area or occupation. If each factor has over, say, 20 levels, then the number of parameters in the saturated model could be as large as $2^{(20 \times 20)} - 1$ which is probably singular. Even feature selection techniques like LASSO are ignorant to the fact that, say, "statistician" and "biostatistician" are somehow related careers. If I were presented with this data analysis problem, I would first consider using some statistical or by-hand methods to aggregate down these factors into usable data.
