The collection display takes the dates from the catalog metadata as strings and interprets those as DateTime instances. The event edit form works with the actual DateTime instances. Clearly something goes wrong with the catalog storage of the start and end dates, and/or with the display. You could check the timezone on your indexed events. Go to the ZMI, find the portal_catalog object, and navigate to it's Catalog tab. Find any ATEvent there (you can use the path filter to narrow down results), and click on it's hyperlinked path. It'll open a new window with the catalog information for that specific object. The top table holds the catalog metadata on that object, and collections will use the start and end fields to render event info. Note that these should include timezone info; in my test setup I see date-time strings like 2011/07/05 22:45:00 GMT+2 . If these dates look off to you (missing or incorrect timezone), do a full reindex of your site. Use the Advanced tab of the portal_catalog object, there is a Update Catalog button there. I'd set the Log progress of reindexing value to 1000 objects or so so you get to see the progress in the Zope event log.
