Combine the results of two distinct Get-ChildItem calls into single variable to do the same processing on them

I'm trying to write a PowerShell script to build a list of files, from several directories. After all directories have been added to the main list, I'd like to do the same processing on all files. This is what I have: $items = New-Object Collections.Generic.List[IO.FileInfo] $loc1 = @(Get-ChildItem -Path "\\server\C$\Program Files (x86)\Data1\" -Recurse) $loc2 = @(Get-ChildItem -Path "\\server\C$\Web\DataStorage\" -Recurse) $items.Add($loc1) # This line fails (the next also fails) $items.Add($loc2) # Processing code is here which fails with this error: Cannot convert argument "0", with value: "System.Object[]", for "Add" to type "System.IO.FileInfo": "Cannot convert the "System.Object[]" va lue of type "System.Object[]" to type "System.IO.FileInfo"." I am mostly interested in what is the correct approach for this type of situation. I realize that my code is a very C way of doing it -- if there is a more PowerShell way to acomplish the same task, I'm all for it. The key, is that the number of $loc#'s may change over time, so adding and removing one or two should be easy in the resulting code.
