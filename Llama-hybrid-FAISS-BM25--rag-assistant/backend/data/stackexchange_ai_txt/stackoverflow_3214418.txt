Is locale setting global in perl?

I'm debugging a perl script which looks like this (simplified): #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use Evil::Module; printf "%.3f\n", 0.1; This script outputs 0,100 (note , instead of . ). If I comment out the use Evil::Module statement, the output will be 0.100 . I believe that this is related to locale setting in the module. But locale is a lexical pragma (according to the manpage), and it's not used within the script. What's happening here?
