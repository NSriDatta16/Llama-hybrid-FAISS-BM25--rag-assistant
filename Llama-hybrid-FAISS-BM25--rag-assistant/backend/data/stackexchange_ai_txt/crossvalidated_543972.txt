Difference between discriminant analysis and neural network (one layer)

So I am doing some research on this topic and I "hit a wall" with this question. I managed to find some papers on using DA vs NN on data but i didn't find anything math related. Maybe someone could help me understand the difference between them mathematically? Also I have a side question: What does a second layer give to a neural network?
