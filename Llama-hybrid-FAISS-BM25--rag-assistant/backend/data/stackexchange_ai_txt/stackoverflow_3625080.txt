Apache Tapestry is a Java web application framework that is organized around building pages from reusable components. It has some similarities to Apache Wicket (which it predates), but embraces a meta-programming approach to make end-user code as simple and concise as possible. Tapestry is a component-based framework, attempting to structure web applications into small, manageable and re-useable parts. Components consist of a component class file and often a component template file; also, components can have their own JavaScript and CSS. Tapestry template files are XHTML files, so they can be edited in any XML editor and require no special IDE plugins. Tapestry supports live reloading of components during development, so the need to restart the application server arises only seldomly. Tapestry integrates rather nicely with Hibernate (through Tapestry-Hibernate ) and Spring (via Tapestry-Spring ). Tapestry favors convention over configuration, so there are no XML files to maintain, but this unfortunately means that there are a quite a few non-obvious concepts a developer must understand to really be effective. The getting started page on the Tapestry website is a good place to get started. References: Wiki
