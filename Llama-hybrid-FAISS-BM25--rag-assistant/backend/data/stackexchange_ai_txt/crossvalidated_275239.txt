One way to think about it would be the marginal effects: Here you have estimated the expected value of y, given a and b $E[y|a,b] = -1.5a + -1.4b + .5ab$ If you take the derivative of the above expression with respect to a: $\frac{\partial E[y|a,b]}{\partial a} = -1.5 + .5b$ This expression is increasing in b. You could then set b to "interesting" values for interpretation. I put interesting in quotes because this will depend on the application. For some applications b=0 might be interesting. The sample mean may also be interesting. A better way would be calculate what is called the Average Partial Effects. Suppose there were n data points in your sample the average Partial Effects would be as follows: $$APE_a = -1.5 + .5*\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i$$ Where $b_i$ is the value for b for the ith observation. This would have the interpretation of what the average effect for an additional a would be for the actual sample that you are using.
