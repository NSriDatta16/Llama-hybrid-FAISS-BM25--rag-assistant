Web browsers have a built in security mechanism called Same Origin Policy (SOP) that prevent you to do that. You can use JSONP , which is embedding you response in a Javascript function that will be called when the file is loaded and injected in your page as a SCRIPT tag. For instance a response could be something like: myCallbackFunction('a string parameter', {or:{a:json:'data'}}, ...) And in your page you have a function: myCallbackFunction(str, json, ...){...}
