multi-touch touchesBegan

I'm having a bit of a problem trying to get touchesBegan to respond to multi touch. -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; for (UITouch *touch in allTouches) { CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; if(CGRectContainsPoint(snare.frame, location) && lastButton != snare) { //Swap Image snareImg.image = snareImgDown; [self performSelector:@selector(swapBack) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.1]; //Play Sound NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"snare" ofType:@"wav"]; SystemSoundID soundID; AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID((CFURLRef)[NSURL fileURLWithPath:path] , &soundID); AudioServicesPlaySystemSound (soundID); // lastButton = snare; } else if(CGRectContainsPoint(hiHat.frame, location) && lastButton != hiHat) { //Play Sound NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"hi_hat" ofType:@"wav"]; SystemSoundID soundID; AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID((CFURLRef)[NSURL fileURLWithPath:path] , &soundID); AudioServicesPlaySystemSound (soundID); // lastButton = hiHat; } I'm unaware of how to get it setup so that it will respond to multi touch, right now touchesBegan only works with 1 press. I know there something like I'm assuming a for(UITOuch *t in something) I cant remember how it works exactly. Any one knows how to do it?
