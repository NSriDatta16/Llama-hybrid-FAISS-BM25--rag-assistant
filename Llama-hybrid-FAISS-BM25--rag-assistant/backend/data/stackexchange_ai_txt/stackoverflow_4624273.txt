Zend Technologies Ltd. Zend Technologies is a software company offering a number of (free and commercial) PHP related technologies, including Zend Framework, Zend Server and Zend Studio. They sponsor a number of other projects and organize ZendCon , one of the largest PHP conferences in the world. Zend also offers trainings and certification programs. Tag Purpose The zend tag is an umbrella tag and should be avoided . Because Zend is a company offering a broad choice of products and services, there is no clear definition of when this tag makes sense to use. In general, you should try to use one of the more distinct tags, like zend-framework or zf for questions about Zend Framework, zend-studio for questions about Zend's commercial IDE, zend-server for questions about Zend's server appliance, zend-guard for questions about Zend's source code obfuscator, zend-engine for questions about writing extensions and the inner workings of PHP.
