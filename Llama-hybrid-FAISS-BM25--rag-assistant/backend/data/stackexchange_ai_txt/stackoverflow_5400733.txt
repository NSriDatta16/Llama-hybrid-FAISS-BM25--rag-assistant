How do I get XCode4 to find libgcov.a

I've been building a static library to share between multiple iOS projects, and I want to use gcov (or any code coverage analysis tool) to tell me where I'm missing my tests. However, when I enable gcov by following these directions: http://supermegaultragroovy.com/blog/2005/11/03/unit-testing-and-code-coverage-with-xcode/ I get this error from Libtool: /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/libtool: can't locate file for: -lgcov /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/libtool: file: -lgcov is not an object file (not allowed in a library) For some reason XCode4 can't find the libgcov.a file. It is in many places on my system but for some reason it can't be found. I'm fairly new to XCode, and gcc based programming in general, so I'm not sure how I can fix this, my guess is that I just have to tell it specifically where to find libgcov.a but I'm not sure how to go about that.
