Nope. With the exception of indexed views, views are only really useful for making the SQL cleaner to read - executing a query containing a view is essentially the same as executing a query with the view definition copied and pasted into the query. I would discourage the use of complex views in this way as although it makes the query look cleaner, it makes the diagnosis process more of a pain (as you need to look up all of the views to understand what the original query is doing)
