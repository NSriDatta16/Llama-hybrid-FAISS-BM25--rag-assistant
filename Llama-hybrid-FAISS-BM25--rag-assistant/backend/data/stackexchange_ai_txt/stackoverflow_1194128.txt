We evaluated libraries from Syncfusion, Infragistics, ComponentOne, Xceed, Janus and DevExpress. We decided on DevExpress based on its feature set, grid performance and features and ribbon control features. Comparing Infragistics and DevExpress Grid control I found that: DevExpress Grid is faster at loading, and handles more data, than the Infragistics grid. 25K rows * 50 columns: Infragistics load time is 2000ms, DevExpress load time is 1400ms 50K rows * 500 columns Infragistics 600ms first load, 400ms subsequent DevExpress 1000ms first load, 250ms subsequent load 500K rows * 50 columns Infragistsic 3500ms first load, 7000ms subsequent load DevExpress 2000ms first load, 1700ms subsequent load 2M rows * 10 columns Infragistics Out of memory exception DevExpress 8500ms first load, 10000ms subsequent load The DevExpress DxGrid control for Windows Forms is fantastic. Inline editors make the UX very nice. The sorting and grouping is easy to use and understand for both the developer and end-user. Overall I am extremely happy with the library. Their support is excellent. Over the life of this project, I have asked over 20 support questions and have received a good response each time. I would spend my own money on the DevExpress controls.
