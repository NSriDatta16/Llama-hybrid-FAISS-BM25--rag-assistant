Because, when you use weights=distance , your samples are weighted by the inverse of their distances to the query point. If the query point is inside the training set, the closest point is itself and the distance is $0$ . When inverted, this becomes infinity while the other closest samples' weights are finite. When averaged, other points have no effect and the query point is predicted as itself.
