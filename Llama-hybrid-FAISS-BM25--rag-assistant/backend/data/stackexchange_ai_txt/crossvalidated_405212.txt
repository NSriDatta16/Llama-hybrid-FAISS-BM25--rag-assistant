The ACF plot shows a seasonality with a period of about 12 (note the sinusoidal pattern). So the first plot to do is a seasonplot . seasonplot(ts(foo,frequency=12)) However, that does not look very promising. So, let's look at your time series plot once more. We do see the seasonality, but we also see that the peaks alternate between being high and low. So there does not only seem to be a yearly seasonality, but one of length 2 years as well. So let's look at a seasonplot for a period of 24 months: seasonplot(ts(foo,frequency=12)) This looks much more regular than the one above. So let's work with a frequency argument of 24. If we now fit a model using auto.arima() , R indeed gives us a seasonal ARIMA model: model I would rather trust auto.arima() to create a forecast based on minimizing AIC, than trying the older Box-Jenkins approach of trying to parse (P)ACF plots. Note that forecast() gives you nice prediction intervals. Take a look at ?forecast.Arima (note the capitalization). Finally, note that in-sample fit is not a good guide to out-of-sample accuracy. Instead, consider using a holdout sample.
