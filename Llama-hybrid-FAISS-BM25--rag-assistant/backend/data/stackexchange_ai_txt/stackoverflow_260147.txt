I think you have several options... Require registration to post comments - but thats more annoying than captcha, so probably not the best idea Examine the user-agent of the poster (see here ) for something that looks genuine or exclude those which look suspect Use a nice Captcha. As annoying as they are, used properly they aren't that bad. It took me 7 attempts to sign up for a gmail the other day because i just couldnt read what it said. A nice captcha though isnt that bad really, kept it short and READABLE
