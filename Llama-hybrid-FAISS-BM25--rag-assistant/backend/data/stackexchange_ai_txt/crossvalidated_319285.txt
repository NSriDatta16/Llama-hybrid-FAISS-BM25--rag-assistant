How to use an ARMA model to make predictions?

After we fit an ARMA model and do all the goodness of fit tests to convince ourselves everything is as it should be, how can we use the model to make predictions? The point of my question is the moving averages part of ARMA, which says predictions depend on the errors in the past (the $\epsilon$ below) $$y_t = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i y_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \delta_j \epsilon_{t-j} + \epsilon_t$$ So suppose I'm at $T=t$ and want to make a prediction for $T=t+1$. At this point in time I know $\epsilon_{T Am I missing the point here?
