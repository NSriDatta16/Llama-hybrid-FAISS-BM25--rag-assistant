Yes, you'll want to look into the Magento DataFlow System (it even has its own support forum ). Someone may already have implemented a commercial and/or free implementation for you specific Inventory Management Program, or you may have to develop feeds from nothing. Google around and see what you find. Either way you're looking at a "medium" development effort for you or the guy you hire. It's also worth contacting the vendor of the Inventory Management System to see if they have a standard way of dealing with Magento.
