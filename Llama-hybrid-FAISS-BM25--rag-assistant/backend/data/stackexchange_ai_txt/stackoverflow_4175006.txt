If your goal is to compute the equilibrium distribution of a Markov chain, take a look at the mcStatDist function implementation from the PMTK3 toolbox . It shows four different ways to compute the result. Example: TR = rand(3,3); %# random transition matrix TR = bsxfun(@rdivide, TR, sum(TR,2)); %# normalize so that rows sum to one [V,D] = eig(TR'); %'# eigen-decomposition EQ = V(:,1) ./ sum(V(:,1)); %# state equilibrium distribution As noted in the comments of the linked code, this method can be numerically unstable for some cases, so you might want to consider one of the other options...
