It's one of those things that they fixed in AS3, but in AS2, you can't detect mouse events on elements that are inside elements that have a listener for the same event. The work around this is to detect, inside the menu on press function, if the mouse is over the ellisIsland_mc - if so, execute the ellisIsland start drag, if not, execute the general menu drag. I'd try using hitTest ( http://www.adobe.com/support/flash/action_scripts/actionscript_dictionary/actionscript_dictionary534.html ) to detect which element the mouse is over.
