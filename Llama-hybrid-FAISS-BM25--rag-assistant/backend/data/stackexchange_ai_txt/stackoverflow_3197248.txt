There is no way built in to LINQ to SQL, but you have a couple of other choices. The first is to load your strings in as in-memory objects which you can apply Regex functions to . I'm not a big fan of this since it looks like you're potentially getting some very big strings to match against. The second option is to leverage SQL CLR as described here . This effectively lets you create a stored procedure that gets linked to a CLR method that you create. Whenever you call the method in a LINQ to SQL context, it gets converted to a stored procedure call. Then you use a query like this: var q = from p in context.Pages where p.DomainId == reportId && RegExMatch(p.PageContent, "display\:[ \t]*none") select p;
