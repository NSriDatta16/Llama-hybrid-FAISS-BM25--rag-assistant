Obtaining exact output values of SMO based classification, before clearly demarcating them into classes

While running the SMO classifier in weka, if I have inputted my training labels as 0 and 5, (A binary set), then while running the classifier model on test data, are the outputs some decimal values between 0 and 5 which get distinctly classified into the two binary labels at a latter step, or are there no intermediate decimal values? If they exist, how to obtain these intermediate decimal values? (Eg, In the above model, does the smo/svm classifier assign values like 1 , 2, 3 and 4, or some other decimal/float value within the given range and then these get appropriately grouped under the 0 and 5 value classes).
