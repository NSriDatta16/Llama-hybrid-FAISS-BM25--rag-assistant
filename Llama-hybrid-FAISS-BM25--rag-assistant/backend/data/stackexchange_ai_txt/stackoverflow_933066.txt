You would most likely want to override WndProc and handle the WM_MOVING message. According to MSDN : The WM_MOVING message is sent to a window that the user is moving. By processing this message, an application can monitor the position of the drag rectangle and, if needed, change its position. This would be a way to do it, however, you would obviously need to tweek it for your needs: using System.Diagnostics; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; using System.Windows.Forms; namespace VerticalMovingForm { public partial class Form1 : Form { private const int WM_MOVING = 0x0216; private readonly int positionX; private readonly int positionR; public Form1() { Left = 400; Width = 500; positionX = Left; positionR = Left + Width; } protected override void WndProc(ref Message m) { if (m.Msg == WM_MOVING) { var r = (RECT)Marshal.PtrToStructure(m.LParam, typeof(RECT)); r.Left = positionX; r.Right = positionR; Marshal.StructureToPtr(r, m.LParam, false); } base.WndProc(ref m); } [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)] private struct RECT { public int Left; public int Top; public int Right; public int Bottom; } } }
