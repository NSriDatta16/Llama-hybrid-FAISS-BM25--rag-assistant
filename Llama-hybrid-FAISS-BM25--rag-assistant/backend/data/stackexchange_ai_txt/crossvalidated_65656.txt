How to account for repeated measures in glmer?

My design is as follows. $y$ is Bernoulli response $x_1$ is a continuous variable $x_2$ is a categorical (factor) variable with two levels The experiment is completely within subjects. That is, each subject receives each combination of $x_1$ and $x_2$. This is a repeated measures logistic regression set-up. The experiment will give two ogives for $p(y=1)$ vs $x_1$, one for level1 and one for level2 of $x_2$. The effect of $x_2$ should be that for level2 compared to level1, the ogive should have a shallower slope and increased intercept. I am struggling with finding the model using lme4 . For example, glmer(y ~ x1*x2 + (1|subject), family=binomial) So far as I understand it, the 1|subject part says that subject is a random effect. But I do not see how to specify that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are repeated measures variables. In the end, I want a model that includes a random effect for subjects, and gives estimated slopes and intercepts for level1 and level2.
