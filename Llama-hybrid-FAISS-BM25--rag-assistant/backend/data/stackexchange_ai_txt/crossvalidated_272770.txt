This may be due to complete separation, since you have a binary outcome with binary predictors. Some categories may have very close to zero events. If that's the case, one way to address this is by combining categories if possible, and if not then perhaps a penalized logistic regression may help. I'm not sure what software you are using, but both R and SAS have Firth's method of penalized logistic regression available.
