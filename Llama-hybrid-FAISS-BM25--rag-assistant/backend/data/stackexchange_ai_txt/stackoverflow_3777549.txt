Flex 4 Air 2 RSL (Runtime Shared Libraries)

Has anyone got any experience will loading SWC / SWZ's at runtime within a Flex 4 / Air 2 desktop application? The very rough idea would be to have a desktop Air app, which is able to "download" additional modules (eg, a SWZ/RSL representing a form) and load these at runtime? Imagine the App is configured using an XML file obtained over the net. When this has instruction to get a new module (SWZ/RSL), the app will download the module to its App Storage folder, and instanciate it at runtime? The Flex Manual seems to indicate this is possible, but is talking web rather than desktop http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7fd1.html Can anyone offer any advise? Has anyone got any experience, or knows of some walkthroughs / code examples? Thanks, Henry
