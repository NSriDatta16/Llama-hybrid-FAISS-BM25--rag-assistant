What you are talking about is basically what Google Adsense and similar services do, and it's based on analyzing the content of a page and matching it to topics. Generally, this kind of stuff is beyond what you would call simple programming / development and would require significant resources to be invested to get it to work "right". A basic system might work along the following lines: Get page content Get X most commonly used words (omitting stuff like "and" "or" etc.) Get words used in headings Assign weights to different words according to a set of factors (is used in heading, is used in more than one paragraph, is used in link anchors) Match the filtered words against a database of words related to a specific "category" If cumulative score > treshold, classify site as belonging to category Rinse and repeat
