How did the (First Ever) Perceptron Classify Pictures?

I was reading about the development of the original Perceptron Algorithm (i.e. the First Neural Network https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron ) - if I understand this correctly, a Perceptron is a One Layer and One Neuron "Neural Network". It seems that Rosenblatt figured out how to use this One Layer and One Neuron Neural Network to perform binary classification on linearly separable data. I have been trying to find a source that clearly explains the task he was trying to accomplish - for instance, the following link ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suevq-kZdIw @ 1:23) explains that he used the Perceptron to classify pictures of shapes and letters, but I have trouble understanding how this shape/letter recognition task can be considered as "linearly separable". The Perceptron took a picture of some letter or shape, and converted it into 400 entries - this was the input of the Perceptron. I find it hard to believe that data in a 400 dimensional space can be considered as "Linearly Separable". I heard that AI Researchers soon discovered that the Perceptron can not not successfully handle the "X-OR" Problem ( https://dev.to/jbahire/demystifying-the-xor-problem-1blk ) - that is, with only a single neuron, the Perceptron can not "learn" a function of sufficient complexity to separate data, when the data is not linearly separable. This is when they figured out that adding more neurons allows the Perceptron to better handle data that is not linearly separable. In the end - I have the following question: It was proven that the first Perceptron can only "work" (i.e. perfectly classify) on data that is linearly separable. Yet, Rosenblatt was able to use the Perceptron to successfully recognize pictures of letters and shapes. At the surface, "recognizing pictures of numbers and shapes" seems far more complicated than the "X-OR" Problem (I understand why "X-OR" is not linearly separable : no such straight line exists that can perfectly separate data when organized according to the "X-OR" condition). Thus: Why is a seemingly complicated problem like "recognizing pictures of numbers and shapes" considered "linearly separable"? Thanks!
