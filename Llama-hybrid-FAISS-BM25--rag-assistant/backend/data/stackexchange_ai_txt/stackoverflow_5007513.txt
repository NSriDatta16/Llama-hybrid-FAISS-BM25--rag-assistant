Eclipse Visual Editor: Components not shown in JTabbedPane

I want to create a JTabbedPane in a Visual Class using the Visual Editor in Eclipse. I selected JTabbedPane from the beans menu on the toolbar. I next clicked on the class to drop it in. So far, no problems. But wait, no tabs are showing up. The tutorials on the web say to drop a component into the TabbedPane and the tabs will show up. I dropped a JLabel and no tabs showed up. Deleted the JLabel using the design window. Dragged a JTextPane, still no tabs. I drag a JTextfield, onto the TabbedPane (without deleting the JTextPane), still no tabs showing. I set the "tabs_text" properties of the JTextField and the JTextPane. Still no tabs show up. Also, the components are not showing on the TabbedPane. It's like a gray whole that just swallows things and no images are reflected back. Anybody have a step by step tutorial, instructions or something similar for how to put a JTabbedPane onto a Visual Class and also components into the JTabbedPane? Pictures would be very helpful. Do I have to use NetBeans or hand-code the JTabbedPane? Note: I'm trying to create a tabbed pane (or notebook in other GUI terminology) with one tab for person's address and another tab for phone numbers.
