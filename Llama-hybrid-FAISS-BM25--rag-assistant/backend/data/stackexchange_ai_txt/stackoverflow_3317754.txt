After much debate, i've decided to switch to jsTree version 1. In jqGrid I added the event afterInsertRow: function (rowid, rowdata, rowelem) { $("#" + rowid).addClass('jstree-draggable'); }, I then added the dnd plugin for the jstree, which allows all external elements with the class "jstree-draggable" to be dragged into the tree with the event "drag_finish": function (data) {} in the jsTree. While jsTree version 1 is a pain to switch to after using pre-Version 1 it really is a lot faster, neater and easier to use once you get the hang of it. I'm told that full documentation will be released with the version 1 final.
