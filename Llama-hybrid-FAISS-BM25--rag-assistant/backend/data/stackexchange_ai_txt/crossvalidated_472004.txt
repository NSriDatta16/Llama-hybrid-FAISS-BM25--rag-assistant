How to model logistic regression with a predictor that predicts another predictor in the model

I'm trying to answer a question about whether resident (surgical trainee) presence increases the risk of complications during surgery, and I'm trying to figure out how to include total operative time in the model. Operative time is a known independent predictor of complications: the longer an operation takes, the more likely a complication is to occur. Therefore it is a potential confounder. Residents are more likely to be assigned to cases that are expected to take longer, because those are likely to be complex cases that require assistance and the expertise present at major academic teaching hospitals that have residents. At the same time, resident presence by itself is likely to increase operative time, because they take longer to perform certain procedures and additional time is spent instructing them during the operation. So the issue I have is that one predictor (resident presence) is a predictor of another (operative time). Both are potential predictors of the main outcome of interest (complications). I'm really having trouble wrapping my head around how to model this using logistic regression, any advice would be much appreciated!
