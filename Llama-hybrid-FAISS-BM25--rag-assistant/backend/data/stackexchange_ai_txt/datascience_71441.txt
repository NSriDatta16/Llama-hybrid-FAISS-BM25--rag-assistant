IÃ¬ll go through your questions one by one: i have multiple variables my data is multivariate time series data ... This means your task is a multivariate regression. You have more than one explanatory variable to explain your y. i want to predict 2019 data by using test data of 2018.is it possible? Yes it is. The quality of the prediction depends from your data and your model's architecture. What kind of RNN did you try to implement up to now? i am confused about Long short term memory neural networks working what is actually it will do.does my problem come under multivariate multi step forecasting? or multivariate single step forecasting? As you said above, it's a multivariate forecasting. Whether it's multistep or not depends on your choice: - Single step: you predict one step in the future; your model has one output node. - Multi step: you predict multiple steps in the future; your model has n output nodes, one for each step of the prediction. This is completely up to your needs and your preferences. Could you provide more information about the kind of prediction you need to implement?
