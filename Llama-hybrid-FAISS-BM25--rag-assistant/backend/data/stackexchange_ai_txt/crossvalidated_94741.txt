Ljungâ€“Box test for a multivariate time series?

From Tsay's Analysis of Financial Time Series , For a univariate weakly stationary time series $r_t$, its sample autocorrelation function $\hat{\rho}_l$ is defined as: and the Ljung-Box test is For a weakly stationary multivariate time series $r_t$, the sample lag-$l$ cross-covariance matrix $\hat{\Gamma}_l$ and sample cross-correlation matrix $\hat{\rho}_l$ of $r_t$ is defined as The multivariate Ljung-Box test is: I wonder how to see the test statistic for a multivariate time series is a generalization of the one for a univariate time series. Why do the coefficients $T(T+2)$ become $T^2$? Why does $\hat{\rho}_l^2$ become the trace of something? How is the representation in Kronecker product equivalent to (8.7)?
