First To get maximum attention at minimum time, you'll want to use a high-level language. probably you'll want to show 3D . I'd go with Opengl - I'd start by showing a short scene from a 3d computer game, then explaining, that this was done by dividing the big program into smaller parts, and then showing them how a little part may look like. something like lesson 05 on nehe.gamedev.net , or maybe even a more advanced lesson. it's quite impressive, and not too complicated. Also you may want to check Alice which contains 3d and was designed to teach..
