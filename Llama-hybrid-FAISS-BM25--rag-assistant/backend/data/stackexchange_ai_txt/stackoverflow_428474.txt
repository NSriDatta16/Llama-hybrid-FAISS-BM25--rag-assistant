I use the Telerik controls and also paid for the source code, so as for them going out of business, not a huge concern given the source code. I have no specific experience using the Telerik controls on a public facing website but wouldn't hesitate to at all. I have been directed at times, to use JQuery for additional functionality that the controls didn't have. The one issue that I do have is that because you aren't coding all of this functionality yourself with the use of controls (not just Telerik's) it's really easy to drag and drop all kinds of fun stuff to your page, which is going to add processing to each and every page. That being said, keep your use of them to a minimum and I don't think they'll be any more bloated than hand-coded JQuery implementations.
