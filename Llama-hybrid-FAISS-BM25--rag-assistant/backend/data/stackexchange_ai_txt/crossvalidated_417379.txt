In short, the problem behind the question is statistically meaningless if probabilistically interesting. When using the definition of the Negative Binomial random variate as the number of failures, the two conditional distributions are actually incompatible with one another, that is, there is no joint distribution on $(X_1,X_2)$ producing these conditionals. If instead one uses the definition of the Negative Binomial random variate as the number of attempts, then they are compatible: \begin{align*} f(x_1|x_2) &= {x_1-1 \choose x_2-1} p^{x_2} (1-p)^{x_1-x_2}\Bbb 1_{x_1\ge x_2}\\ f(x_2|x_1) &= {x_1 \choose x_2} p^{x_2} (1-p)^{x_1-x_2}\Bbb 1_{x_1\ge x_2}\\ \end{align*} implies that $$ \dfrac{f(x_1|x_2)}{f(x_2|x_1)} = \dfrac{{x_1-1 \choose x_2-1} p^{x_2} (1-p)^{x_1-x_2}}{x_1 \choose x_2} p^{x_2} (1-p)^{x_1-x_2}=\dfrac{x_2}{x_1} $$ factorises as a product of a function of $x_1$ and of a function of $x_2$ . In this case, the only issue to define properly $f(x_1|x_2)$ when $x_2=0$ since this is not the case for rnbinom(1,0,p) . I suggest using a Dirac mass at x_1=1. if(lambda[i]>0) betax[i]=lambda[i]+rnbinom(1, lambda[i],p) In which case the corrected R code produces a sequence However, given the above ratio I strongly suspect the joint measure on $(X_1,X_2)$ is not proper i.e. sums up to $\infty$ . The Markov chain is thus either null recurrent or transient. Note that if both conditionals are Binomial distributions, $\mathcal B(x_1,p)$ and $\mathcal B(x_2,p)$ , respectively, then the conditionals are also incompatible with one another the resulting Markov chain always converges monotonically (i.e., decreases) to zero, $(0,0)$ .
