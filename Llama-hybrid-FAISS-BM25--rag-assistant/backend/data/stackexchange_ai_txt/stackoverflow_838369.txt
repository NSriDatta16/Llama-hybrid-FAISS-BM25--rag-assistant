Take a look at buffer-list (function). It returns a list of all the open buffers (BUFFER objects). See the manual for a simple example of using it with mapcar (which operates on every element of the list, and accumulates the results). You would probably also find set-buffer, which programatically sets the current buffer from Emacs Lisp, useful.
