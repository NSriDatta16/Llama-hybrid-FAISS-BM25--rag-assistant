To create new data from rows of existing data by multiplying random numbers

Wondering if they could be two ways to create data, when more data is required for machine learning (conventional algorithm for binary classification). The goal is to create new rows of data, by having varied values from the originals. Taking South African Hearth Disease Data as an example. Idea #1: Based on the existing data - each row of the original data, is used to create a new row of data. That is, each cell value of the row, is multiplied by a random number between a range, for example, +/-20%, i.e. 0.8 ~ 1.2. Trying to illustrate the idea as: Idea #2: First, to find out the minimum and maximum of each input variable, of each target variable. Each cell value of the new row is a random number in the correspondent (min, max). By doing this, new rows of the target "1" and "0" will be created. Trying to illustrate the idea as: Except to use the created data to build models and apply to validation data, to examine the effect of the created data, what would be the theory and practice to verify if above ideas are valid? Thank you.
