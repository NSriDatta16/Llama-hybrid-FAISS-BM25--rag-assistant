In Perl, the record separator is a literal string, not a regular expression. As the perlvar doc famously says: Remember: the value of $/ is a string, not a regex. awk has to be better for something. :-) Still, it looks like you can get away with $/="\n" x 10 or something like that: perl -a -F\n -ne '$/="\n"x10;$\="\n";chomp;$regex="CHUPACABRA"; print if /\S/ && !m/$regex/i;' data/lib51.000 Note the extra /\S/ && , which will skip empty paragraphs from input that has more than 20 consecutive newlines. Also, have you considered just installing Cygwin and having awk available on your Windows machine?
