I think the language itself is not an issue here, as python is really nice high level language with good and easy to find, thorough documentation. From what I've seen, the Django framework is also a great tooklit for web development, giving much the same developer performance boost Rails is touted to give. The real issue is at the maintenance and management level. How will this move fragment the maintenance between PHP and Python code. Is there a need to migrate existing code from one platform to another? What problems will adopting Python and Django solve that you have in your current development workflow and frameworks, etc.
