Google App Engine urlfetch to POST files

I am trying to send a file to torrage.com from an app in GAE. the file is stored in memory after being received from a user upload. I would like to be able to post this file using the API available here: http://torrage.com/automation.php but i am having some problems undestanding how the body of the post should be encoded, the most i got from the API is a "file empty" message.
