In both statistics (kernel density estimation or kernel smoothing) and machine learning (kernel methods) literature, kernel is used as a measure of similarity. In particular, the kernel function $k(x,.)$ defines the distribution of similarities of points around a given point $x$. $k(x,y)$ denotes the similarity of point $x$ with another given point $y$.
