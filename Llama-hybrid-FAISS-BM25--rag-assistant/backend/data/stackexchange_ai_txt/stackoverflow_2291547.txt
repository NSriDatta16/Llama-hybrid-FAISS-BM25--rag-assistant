If I understand correctly, you need to have an "add UI" which can be N entries. In your example you're adding an arbitrary number of addresses for the last 5 years. The StackOverflow Answer UI is one example (add an arbitrary number of responses to a question), and it provides the "add" mechanism inline as opposed to going through a separate screen/UI widget. You can find something similar on the Infragistics Quince site here .
