I would do it like this: use OpenCV ( python bindings ), take only the R component of RGB image, binary threshold the R component, so that it leaves only the reddest pixels, use some object/feature detection to detect the dots, fe. ExtractSURF Comments: it will not be fastest, it will not be always accurate. But it will be fun to do - as CV is always fun - and ready in 10 lines of code. Just a loose thought. As for the more production-ready suggestions: actually I think that your idea is very good, and it can be parallelized if given some thought; use blob detection in OpenCV ( cvBlobsLib ). But the most elegant solution would just be to count the tagged nuclei in GIMP, as Ocaso Protal has suggested above. Accurate and fastest. Everything else will be prone to mistakes and much much slower, hence mine are just loose ideas, more fun than anything.
