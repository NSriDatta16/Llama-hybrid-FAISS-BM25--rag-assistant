Magento development environment on windows with debug capability

I have seen hundreds of post on how to setup an Magento development environment for Windows. But nowhere i could find a good tutorial on this works with proper debugging enabled. I have tried many IDE's and debugging frameworks (Zend, Xdebug) but i can't find a way to actually get this to work. It would be great if i could set a break-point in an .phtml file so i can see what is going on and check all variables/objects. Any (experienced) Magento developers who can explain on how to setup a proper development environment for Magento on a windows machine. Hope to get some feedback....
