I think loading Javascript on demand is a good idea because it reduces bandwidth and page load times. A Microsoft Research Project (Doloto) takes this concept even further: They generate empty function stubs and lazily fetch code when it is invoked. However, on many sites you already know at compile time which Javascript the page requires and can leverage the numerous optimization methods (combination, compression, minification, etc.) in a build step to produce the one ideal Javascript request at the bottom of the page. I've found that a combination of the above often works well, loading essential Javascript in one compiled request at the bottom of the page and javascript required by features on demand.
