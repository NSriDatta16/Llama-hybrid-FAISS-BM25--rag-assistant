What you can do is extend the User model. For the User table, generate a username (e.g. A_123, A_345) that will not be displayed at all in the site. Then create a new model that extends User. class AppUser(User): username = models.CharField... organization = models.CharField... You then create a custom authentication backend that use AppUser instead of the User object.
