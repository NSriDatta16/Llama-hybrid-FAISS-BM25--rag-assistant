It does seem odd, but it really depends on how the data is used. There could be very good reasons for the use of varchar. If there is no need to use the fields in criteria or perform calculations, using varchar would give the user a lot more freedom to do what they want. For example, in real-estate, it seems like the price of a home should be numeric. However, many agents want to display phrases like "call for pricing", "in the low 300s", etc (though we keep a separate numeric price field for searching). I would suggest looking at how the fields are used to determine if they should be varchar or not. If you see a lot of conversions from varchar to the type it should be, then varchar is probably not the right choice.
