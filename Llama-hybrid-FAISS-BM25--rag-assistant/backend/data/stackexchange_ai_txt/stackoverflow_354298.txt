There are couple of ways of doing it. Use SQL Server 2005 copy function, but it would fail if SQL Agent is not ruining or there is any permission restriction - mostly like to happen with shared hosting. Use SQL Server backup/restore: the problem is usually you don't have access to the Database server file system with shared hosting. Replicate database schema on development server, then do a DTS to transfer data, you can save the DTS package ( even manually edit it if needed ) and set up a scheduled task in the development machine, it would automatically synchronize the database everyday, it may not be incrementally, depends on your database design/schema. option 3 seems to require more work but actually it is easy to set up and would save you a lot time in a long run. any other suggestions I would like to hear too.
