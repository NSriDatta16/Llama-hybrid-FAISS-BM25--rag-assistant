From a pragmatic standpoint, Java probably has the most power and flexibility, PHP is probably the most widespread but tends to encourage bad coding if you're not careful (I have yet to see a PHP app where I said "Wow, this code is pretty"), and Ruby/Rails is easy to learn and really fast to develop on, but everything is pretty much decided for you (not necessarily a bad thing) and when you step away from the "Rails" way of doing things, it can get messy.
