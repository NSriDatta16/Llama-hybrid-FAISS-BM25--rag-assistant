Your question isn't very clear, but maybe the select method is what you're looking for. It does the following: Select a tab, as if it were clicked. The second argument is the zero-based index of the tab to be selected or the id selector of the panel the tab is associated with (the tab's href fragment identifier, e.g. hash, points to the panel's id). Also from the documentation : [How do I]...select a tab from a text link instead of clicking a tab itself var $tabs = $('#example').tabs(); // first tab selected $('#my-text-link').click(function() { // bind click event to link $tabs.tabs('select', 2); // switch to third tab return false; }); Here's a demo of how it works: http://jsfiddle.net/hP9xb/
