In first cast ABC will be initialized only once, on first function call. In second case ABC will be initialized every time. You'll feel the difference if ABC is complex type with constructor. It could allocate memory or initialize some mutex. For int there is no difference in practice. According to C++03 Standard 3.7.1/2: If an object of static storage duration has initialization or a destructor with side effects, it shall not be eliminated even if it appears to be unused, except that a class object or its copy may be eliminated as specified in 12.8.
