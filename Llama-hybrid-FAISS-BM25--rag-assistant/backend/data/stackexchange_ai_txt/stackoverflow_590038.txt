If you use TestNG you can annotate tests in a variety of ways. For example, you can annotate your tests above as long-running . Then you can configure your automated-build/continuous integration server to run these, but the standard "interactive" developer build would not (unless they explicitly choose to). This approach depends on developers checking into your continuous build on a regular basis, so that the tests do get run! Some tests will inevitably take a long time to run. The comments in this thread re. performance are all valid. However if your tests do take a long time, the pragmatic solution is to run them but not let their time-consuming nature impact the developers to the point that they avoid running them. Note: you can do something similar with JUnit by (say) naming tests in different fashions and getting your continuous build to run a particular subset of test classes.
