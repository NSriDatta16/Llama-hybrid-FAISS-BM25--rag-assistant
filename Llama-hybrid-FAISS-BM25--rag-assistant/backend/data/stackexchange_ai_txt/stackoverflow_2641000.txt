make a class that has only the properties you need, often this is a summary class like {Id, Label} and you'd reuse it anywhere you need a simple type, in a listing for example. Use ProjectionList to define which columns to return. Then use Transformers.AliasToBean to transform the result to your simple type. ProjectionList projectionList = Projections.ProjectionList(); projectionList.Add(Projections.Property("EmployeeID"), "Id"); projectionList.Add(Projections.Property("EmployeePosition"), "Label"); var x = DetachedCriteria.For(Employee); x.SetProjection(projectionList); x.SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean(SimpleType))); return x.GetExecutableCriteria(UnitOfWork.CurrentSession).List ();
