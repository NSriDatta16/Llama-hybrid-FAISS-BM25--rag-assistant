Replace placeholders with text - C?

I use the below function to retrieve characters one by one from a FILE stream. Now the text in that file will sometimes include places holders like !first_name! within the text. What's the best way to detect when such a place holder start and when it ends so that I can swap each character between !! with proper character from another storage? void print_chars(FILE *file) { fseek(file, 0L, 0); int cr; do { cr = fgetc(file); putchar(cr); } while (cr != EOF); }
