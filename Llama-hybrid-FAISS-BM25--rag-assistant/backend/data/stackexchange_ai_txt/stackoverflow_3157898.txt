Thanks patrick! That works great in everything but IE7 and FF on Windows. The scrollbar you're currently dragging has this weird back and forth effect in those browsers. And doing console logging instead of running that scroll bar function once (which was what I was trying to do with unbinding and binding) it runs over itself over and over. I think most of the newer browsers JS engines are better but apparently IE7 and FF choke.
