I think it surely a convenient way to declare type synonyms. Some languages have direct support for that (in Delphi (pascal), for example, you can do that like that: type MyMap = HashMap ; Since Java does not, I think you can use inheritance for that. You need to document, that this declaration is just a synonym and noone should add meethods to this class. Note also, that this consumes a little memory for VMT storage.
