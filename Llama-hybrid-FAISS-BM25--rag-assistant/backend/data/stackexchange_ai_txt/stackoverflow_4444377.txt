Normalization has nothing to do with saving space. It's about eliminating potential anomalies that can occur as a result of certain kinds of redundancy. Since normalization defines the logical level only it would be quite possible for a normalized database to be physically larger or physically smaller than a denormalized or un-normalized one. It is true that normalization generally makes designs that ought to translate efficiently into storage - but that's really down to the features of the DBMS rather than something implicit in normalization.
