How to get the previous word with regex?

I have a path like this one: C:\Development.TFS\Examn\R4-branch\Web\OrganisationManager\themes\blue\css And I need a regex to get the word "blue" out of there. I tried, but didn't find a solution yet. It's practically getting the word before the last word from that string. Please help, thank you
