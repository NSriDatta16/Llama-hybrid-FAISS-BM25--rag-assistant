We use "man-day" to mesure the cost of a project. In how many day a single average man will complete the project. (well, how many years sometimes) Lines of code are not the best but not the worst unit, but exclude the 'libraries'. A study estimate that a developper can write ten lines/day which remains in the final programm. (but he will also make the conception, documentation, management project, etc...) For example, check Ohloh project which analyse some open-source project, they estimate the cost with the COCOMO algorithm ( online calculator ). The base is lines of code.
