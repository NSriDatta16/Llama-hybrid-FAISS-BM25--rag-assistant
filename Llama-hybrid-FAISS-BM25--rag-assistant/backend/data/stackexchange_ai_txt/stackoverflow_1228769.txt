I'm not sure it's smart to be giving us your paypal request id and other data... The exact data being sent to the server isn't really relevant here; what matters more is the type of error you are getting when you use LWP::UserAgent. You indicated in a previous question that you were getting HTTP 500 errors, which suggests there is something wrong with the recipient, or you are sending data which is being rejected.
