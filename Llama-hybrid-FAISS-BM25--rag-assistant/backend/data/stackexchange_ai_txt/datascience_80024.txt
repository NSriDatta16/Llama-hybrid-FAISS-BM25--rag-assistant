Thank you for clarifying the question @Eisen. So the question looks at two main things: To show which districts need more police presence. To classify people as to whether they will commit 1+ traffic violations, regardless of the district, given their previous number of violations, by district. For the first point, I think what would be a good idea is to yes show the break down of people visiting each of the districts and committing 1+ traffic violations. But, I think adding (95%) confidence intervals would be particularly helpful to see what is a reliable estimate of people who commit 1+ traffic violations in a given district. In terms of the second point, maybe you can use a feedforward neural network which will take as input the traffic violation categories for each district and output whether the person has committed an accident in 2019 ( Accident19 ). The architecture is pretty much up to you, but the fail layer would need to be a 2-node softmax layer, which will create the probability distribution over the two classes (has had an accident in 2019 or not). To represent this categorical data, I would suggest making the NA it's own category. Furthermore, best to represent the district traffic violation categories as one-hot encoded vectors. Then for a particular person, you concatenate these one-hot encoded vectors from all districts in your dataset.
