It would make sense that the time-series data sticks together - and so forms these lines you are seeing. In normal time-series analysis where the variables are assumed to be random (e.g. modelled on Brownian motion), the best prediction for tomorrow is just the same as today. t-SNE finds the closest points withing your feature-space and embedding them into a 2D space. It is quite impressive that it picks it out and ends up with your plot! While you often get circular looking plots, it is not true that you always get circles/spheres. t-SNE is maximising the distance between clusters and at the same to minimising the distance between points within a single cluster... for the sake of efficiency, circles arise very often. You can observe this in nature: the shape of planets, of bubbles in water... circles are efficient! t-SNE does not allow you to directly interpret the distance between clusters back to the input units (e.g. a line twice as high as another doesn't mean the values are twice as big). It would perhaps be interesting to plot the individual time-series lines themselves there (within a single cluster) next to the input time-series data of the same feature, then look for any correspondance. For more understanding, I would recommend reading this great walkthrough/visualisation article covering t-SNE. There are a few examples that show non-circular results: Wattenberg, et al., "How to Use t-SNE Effectively"
