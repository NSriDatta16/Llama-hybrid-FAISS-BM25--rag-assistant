Bayesian Network Problem: What is P(A=T, B=T, C=F, D=F)?

Suppose you have these probabilities in a bayesian network. What is P(A=T, B=T, C=F, D=F)? I attempted to answer this by saying that P(A,B,C,D) = P(A) P(B|A) P(C|A,B) P(D|A,B,C), according to the Chain Rule. But it doesn't really seem to work, because D needs to be conditional on E for it to work. So I really need help figuring this out. Thanks!
