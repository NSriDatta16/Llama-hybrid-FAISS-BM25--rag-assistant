Time series models for projected sales

Suppose we are given various reports on projected sales of Product $X$ for $5$ years starting in $2013$. All of the reports just give the results and not the methodology as to how they arrived at the predictions. Suppose we are interested in the projected sales of Product $X$ for $10$ years. So we already have the projected prices from $2013-2018$ and are interested in the projected salesfrom $2019-2023$. Can we use a time series model for these years?
