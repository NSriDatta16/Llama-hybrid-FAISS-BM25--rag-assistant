TinyMCE adds tag when inserting from Word

I have several Drupal 6 sites which use the WYSIWYG module along with TinyMCE. For one of my sites, whenever I use the Paste From Word icon, it adds a tag with the class "mceItemHidden". In addition, if the text is long enough, it does this strange thing where I click the "Insert" button in the Paste from Word window, the text appears in the main TinyMCE box, there is a brief pause, and then each paragraph is on a single line, which creates the horizontal scrollbar that is as long as the paragraph. Has anyone experienced this, and do you have any idea why this is happening? I've tried changing my theme and various WYSIWIG settings and this is still happening.
