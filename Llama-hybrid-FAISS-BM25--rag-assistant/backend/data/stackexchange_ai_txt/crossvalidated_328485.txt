Interpretation of the parameter estimates from a glm model with proportion data

I have the following model to look at the effect of humidity (AverageHumidity) on the proportion of insects surviving in climate controlled chambers. I have used a glm for proportions. My response variable is the proportion of males that have survived (Im looking at the sexes separately for now): ySrubusMale=cbind(Males_survived,Males_died) My model is: m=glm(ySrubusMale~AverageHumidity, data=chamberData, family=binomial()) Which gives me the following output: Call: glm(formula = ySrubusMale ~ AverageHumidity, family = binomial(), data = chamberData) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6619 -0.6637 -0.1952 0.7441 2.0895 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 4.90053 1.87168 2.618 0.00884 ** AverageHumidity -0.06781 0.02597 -2.611 0.00902 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 35.361 on 26 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 28.198 on 25 degrees of freedom AIC: 88.758 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 As the humidity of the environment increases, the proportion of males surviving is reduced. However I want to know how to calculate an effect size. In a simple binary logistic regression, you can use the odds ratio to determine how a unit change in the predictor will change the odds of an outcome occuring. But, when I have used proportions as my response (and not a binary outcome of 0's and 1's) how can I interpret the effect of a unit change in the preidtcor (i.e. humidity) on the proportion of males surviving?
