How do I add a "confidence rating" to something?

I have a bunch of survey responses from people all over the country. Each survey has one question: "How much do you like X?" (X isn't important here), where answers range from 0 (not at all) to 100 (a lot). I want to group the results by (for example) State. However, when I group things by State, some of these groups have a couple hundred responses, whereas others might have fewer than 10. I want to take an average of my results by State, but States with few responses are going to potentially be misleading. So I've been asked to add a "confidence rating" so people can determine which averages are meaningful, which aren't, etc, and I'm not sure how to properly quantify / include this sort of metric. Making up an example: State Num Responses Average Rating Rhode Island 4 96 Texas 124 77 Alaska 2 100 Arizona 15 55 Washington 23 76 California 34 67
