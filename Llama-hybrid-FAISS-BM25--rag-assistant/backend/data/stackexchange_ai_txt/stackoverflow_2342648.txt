I have a few questions about this piece of code $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance(); $identity = new stdClass(); $identity->user_pk = $user->getPrimaryKey(); $identity->user_name = $user->getName(); $identity->role = $user->getRole(); // select * from user_role where user_pk=xxx $auth->getStorage()->write($identity); $identity = Zend_Auth::getInstance()->getIdentity(); Are user_pk, user_name and role stored as cookies? Will someone that makes a cookie with the role-name able to access the secured parts of the websites? Shouldn't a password (with md5-encryption) be part of the identy as well so when can verify username and password with each request?
