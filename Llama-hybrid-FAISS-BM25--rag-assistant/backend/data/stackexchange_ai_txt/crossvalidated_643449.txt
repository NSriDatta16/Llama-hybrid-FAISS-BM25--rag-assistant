These are nested models so each LR test in effect tests the effect of each new predictor. If you want to define stepwise regression as using information criteria instead of p-values to decide which variables should be kept, fine, but this is following the spirit of such stepwise regression and carries the same issues listed by Frank Harrell . It yields R-squared values that are badly biased to be high. The F and chi-squared tests quoted next to each variable on the printout do not have the claimed distribution. The method yields confidence intervals for effects and predicted values that are falsely narrow; see Altman and Andersen (1989). It yields p-values that do not have the proper meaning, and the proper correction for them is a difficult problem. It gives biased regression coefficients that need shrinkage (the coefficients for remaining variables are too large; see Tibshirani [1996]). It has severe problems in the presence of collinearity. It is based on methods (e.g., F tests for nested models) that were intended to be used to test prespecified hypotheses. Increasing the sample size does not help very much; see Derksen and Keselman (1992). It allows us to not think about the problem. It uses a lot of paper. Issues 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are the most problematic in my mind. The issues center on the fact that stepwise-style regression is cherry-picking the variables that happen to work well in the one given sample and then act like you knew from the beginning that those were the right variables instead of accounting for the uncertainty in the stepwise selection process. Therefore, I disagree with your reference that this is the statistically sound way to go. However… …I understand the appeal. Look at the issues. Performance metrics are biased high. Confidence intervals are falsely narrow (so p-values are falsely low). If you can pull a fast one on the reviewers and use this approach to make your results look better than they are, that makes it easier to publish your work and make your case for tenure/promotion/bonus/etc. This is basically the same as how it is easier to look at the smart kid’s exam answers than to learn the material by studying, though. With the caveat that I only know about the source material from what is described in the question, this sounds like cheating, and I would discourage this practice. (Stepwise-style regression can be useful if some care is taken to account for the uncertainty in the variable selection. However, this approach does not seem to do so.)
