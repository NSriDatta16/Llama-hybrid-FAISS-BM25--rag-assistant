Least squares estimation of a shift in linear processes by Bai(1994). Does it have to be stationary?

So in his paper Least squares estimation of a shift in linear processes. ( Link ) Bai shows a method to find a structural break point in time series data. He states that to obtain the LS estimator for the breakpoint $\hat{k}$ given by $\hat{k}=agrmin_k(min_{\mu_1,\mu_2}\{\sum^k_{t=1}(Y_t-\mu_1)^2+\sum^T_{t=k+1}(Y_t-\mu_2)^2\}$ (3) where $\mu_1$ is the mean of Y from t=0 to the breakpoint k and $\mu_2$ is the mean from breakpoint to the end. He then states that the equation (3) can be written as $\hat{k}=argmin_k(S^2_k)$ . He further adds $\sum^T_{t=0}(Y_t-\overline{Y})=S_k^2+V_k^2$ (4), where $V_k=({k(T-k)\over{T}})^{1\over{2}}(\overline{Y}_k^*-\overline{Y}_k)\space where \space \mu_1=\overline{Y}_k \space and \space \mu_2=\overline{Y}_k^* $ . Note that: $\hat{k}=argmin_k(S_k^2)=argmax_k(V^2_k)$ He then concludes that As will be seen, the statistical properties of the change point estimator are obtained by studying the behavior of $V_k$ and the argmax functional. Then there is the part I do not understand. I am confused because he states that the residuals are $\hat{X}_t=Y_t-\hat{\mu_1}-(\hat{\mu_2}-\hat{\mu_1})I(t>\hat{k})$ , where $X_t$ is a stationary process. Does this mean that the data I am searching the break point for, needs to be stationary? But that does not make sense to me, as stationarity seems irrelevant to solve the minimization problem. And if I were to differentiate the time series to get stationary data, wouldn't that skew my breakpoint?
