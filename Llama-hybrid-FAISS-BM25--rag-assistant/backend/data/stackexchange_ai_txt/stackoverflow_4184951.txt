Get Path of image from ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE Intent

Hi I am using ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE for capturing image using Intent as follows: Intent cameraIntent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); cameraIntent.putExtra( MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, (new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis()) + ".jpg")) ); startActivityForResult(cameraIntent, 0); I need to store image in an sdcard and retrieve the path of that image using the onActivityResult method. I don't know how to get the image path of the currently captured image. If any one knows please help. Thanks
