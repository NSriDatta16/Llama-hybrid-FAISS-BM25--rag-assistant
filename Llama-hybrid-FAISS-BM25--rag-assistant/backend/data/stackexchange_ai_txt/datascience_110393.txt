Removing seasonality in time series forecasting

In time series forecasting we are removing the "seasonal" component to fit models better and have better forecasting. But why? if I should give an extreme example: if I have a sin wave, I wouldn't remove the seasonal component of it. Because it is much easier to forecast with its own structure (because it has an easily recognizable pattern). Am I wrong?
