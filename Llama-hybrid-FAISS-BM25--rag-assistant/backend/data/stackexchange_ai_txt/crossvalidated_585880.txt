I recommend having a look at Poincare embeddings ( https://github.com/facebookresearch/poincare-embeddings ) which are designed for hierarchical graph structures . In the case of ZIP codes there is if course a natural ( non-trained) embedding in 2D ; latitude and longitude. I recommend using that as 2 features and get rid of zip codes category. That also solves sparsity issue on rare codes.
