Computing odds ratio confidence interval directly vs fitting logistic regression model

If I have two binary variables. I can compute the odds ratio and its confidence interval directly from the data ( See here and here ). Alternatively, I can fit a logistic regression model and compute the odds ratio and confidence interval from the parameter estimate and its SE. Will these two methods produce the same odds ratio and confidence interval? If the answer is "not necessarily", why? Both of these confidence intervals are based on asymptotics. Will they produce the same results asymptotically?
