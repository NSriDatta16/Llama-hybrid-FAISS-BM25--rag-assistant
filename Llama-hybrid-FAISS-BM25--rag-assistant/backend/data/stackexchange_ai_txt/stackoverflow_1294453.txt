Create a document with a single page and all the text in a single column. Use JavaScript to cut the text into parts. Use pixel coordinates to locate the paragraph/element that doesn't fit anymore. Move it and everything below to the next col . If a "page" already has two "col" divs, start a new page. After all pages have been created, count and number the pages. Fix even/odd stuff, etc. Will take some time but it's automatic. Another approach would be to add all the content to a "source" div and move items to the col div until it's full and repeat with the next col. Have a look at Prototype or jQuery; they should give you lots of tools to move stuff around in the document. [EDIT] Instead of only relying on jQuery functions, I suggest to create one or two objects which keep track of the current page and the current column, etc. These give you stable foundations to stand on from which you can fire the helper methods.
