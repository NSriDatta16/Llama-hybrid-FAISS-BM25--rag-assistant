re: URL and file structure I converted a site where all the content was in a database and accessed with the index?p=434 model. There was no benefit to using the database, and the site was confusing to the people who had to add content since they had to edit content with the browser and pages were just numbers. I pulled all the content out and put it in separate files. Each had a sensible name and was organized into folders. Each file looked something like this: require('sitelib'); do_header('about', 'About Us'); // content here do_footer(); The client loved it. They were able to use any HTML editor to go in, find the right file and make the change. And they were able to make new pages. All to say: Sometimes, it is useful to have the URL and file structures match.
