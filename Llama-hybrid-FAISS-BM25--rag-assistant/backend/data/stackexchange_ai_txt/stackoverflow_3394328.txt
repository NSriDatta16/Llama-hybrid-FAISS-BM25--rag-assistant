It's called 'Arrow Antipattern' Some of the methods of dealing with it are described here: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ArrowAntiPattern One of the ways you migt consider, is to refactor code in nested levels to separate functions like if cat = "animal" then functionForAnimal(); elseif cat = "plant" then functionForPlant(); elseif... function functionForAnimal() if sec = "man" then functionForMan(); elseif sec = "horse" then functionForHorse(); elseif... etc... This splits code into smaller fragments which are easier to maintain, and possibly reusable.
