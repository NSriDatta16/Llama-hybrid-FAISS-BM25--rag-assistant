Magento - Show product cost in backend

Is there any way of showing to product cost in magentoÂ´s order view (backend)? So far I have not found an extension that does this (maybe you will :) ), so I guess I will have to do it myself. What would be an efficient way of doing this? Maybe by overwriting the admin template? Or maybe there is a setting for this I just wasn't able to find. Thanks in advance :)
