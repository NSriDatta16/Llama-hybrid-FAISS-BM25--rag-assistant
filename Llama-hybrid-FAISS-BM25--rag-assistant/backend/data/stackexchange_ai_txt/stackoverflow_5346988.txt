Well, how modern is modern ? Delphi requires that you manage your Memory, but provides simple and elegant ways to do that, it also has a pluggable architecture for memory management, and compiles to native code. Delphi is still actively developed, nowadays by Embarcadero but was created originally in 1995 by Borland software, and even then was the successor to Turbo Pascal, so modern might be a subjective term for Delphi as its history is long.
