Tiering after clustering with Kmeans

I would like to have some suggestions on possible avenues that would make sense in the following context. 3 Optimal clusters have been identified in a 5000 list of customers using Kmeans Data model has 30 features and a PCA was performed prior to Kmeans. I would like to further breakdown each of these 3 clusters into smaller tiers for each cluster. These tiers would server in ranking each customer within his cluster. For example: Cluster 1, 2, 3 could all have 4 or 5 tiers. What interesting option could I explore to create the tiers within the 3 clusters (e.g. RFM quantile separation, classification algorithms)?
