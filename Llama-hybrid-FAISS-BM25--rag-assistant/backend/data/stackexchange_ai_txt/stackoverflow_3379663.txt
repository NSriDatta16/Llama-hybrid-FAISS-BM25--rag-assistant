how do i have a facebook-like scrolling updates on my website showing all activity

i have an asp.net mvc website with a SQL server backend. For every table i have a "History" table to track all changes (who, when, etc). I can run a query and generate an audit report (view of what has changed including who, when, etc) but i wanted to try to implement a facebook style view that shows a list of updates (instead of a static report) that updates . . . what is the best way to get started on implementing something like this in asp.net mvc? do i just have some jquery get called on a timer from the client side? Is there any code to leverage instead of having to write this from scratch?
