Ways to choose between an annual time series and monthly time series?

Some context : I'm working with deforestation areas. An research institute provides time series data of deforested areas (in kmÂ²) in two ways: monthly and annual. Each one of them is obtained by a different methodology (like different satellites, image resolutions, etc). So, in my study, I selected the years from 2009-2016, obtaining 8 observations (one for year 2009, one for 2010, ...) in the annual series and 96 in the monthly series (jan-2009, feb-2009, ..., dec-2016). Since they're different methodologies, the monthly one doesn't provide the exact number of the annual series if we add up them. My question is: Are there any ways/tests to show that the annual time series can share the same information (like periodicity/seasonality) as the monthly one? What I have found so far : a. I started studying time series recently using the R software and found the DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) package. Is searching for similarities using the short series as query and the other as a reference a good idea in this case? b. I also found some dimensionality reductions like Piecewise regression and Piecewise Aggregate Approximation so I can reduce the monthly time series. Can this help with the comparison? c. ARMA models were discussed here , but doing that was not indicated. Thanks in advance for any help provided.
