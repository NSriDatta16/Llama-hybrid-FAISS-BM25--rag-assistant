Your mobile device usually does not have any memory swapping to disk option, so since you choose to store your images as bitmaps in memory rather than files on disk, you quickly consume your phone's memory. Your "new Bitmap()" line allocates a large chunk of memory, so it is very likely to throw the exception there. Another contender is your Camera.ImageToByteArray that will allocate a large amount of memory. This probably isn't large to what you're used to with your computer, but for your mobile this is gigantic Try keeping the pictures on disk until you use them, i.e. until sending them to the webservice. For displaying them, use your built-in controls, they are probably the most memory efficient and you can usually point them to the image files. Cheers Nik
