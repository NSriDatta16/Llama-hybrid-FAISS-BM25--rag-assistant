This is all in the context of the data-generating distribution (or underlying distribution of the data). You can check another answer I made for more details on this. First of all, note that this is a theoretical construct and not an existing, observable distribution. In short we consider that all there is a data-generating distribution from which all our training examples are sampled from. In the case of the MNIST dataset, you can think of this distribution as all possible $28 \times 28$ grayscale images containing handwritten digits . Since the dataset contains samples of such images, we consider them to follow the data-generating distribution. The empirical distribution, on the other hand, is the distribution that we can observe, i.e. the distribution of the MNIST images. It's the distribution which we want to train the model on. These concepts are useful when trying to understand the objective of generative models, such as GANs.
