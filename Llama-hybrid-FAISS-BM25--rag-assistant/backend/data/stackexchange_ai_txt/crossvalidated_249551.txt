Use the cluster centers. They correspond to the average user behavior in each group. So treat them as if you have 3 typical users now, and study their differences. Beware that k-means is very sensitive to noise. So if you have "one of a kind" users, they may ruin your cluster averages. K-means probably is not a very good choice because of this. To validate your findings: 1. pay attention o cluster sizes, and 2. run k-means multiple times - if you don't get consistent findings (i.e. there is always a cluster much more interested in politics than the others) then it probably did not work well.
