There are at least three strategies you could use to fix this, unfortunately they'll all involve a bit more work than just telling vim a "code base path". Before choosing one, I'd recommend reading :help make_makeprg to get a good sense of the :make process "under the hood". Write a shell/perl/ruby/whatever script that filters the output from your build process and rewrites file names from /sandbox/src/blah.c to src/blah.c or /sandbox/src to src as appropriate. Then change makeprg to include the filter program when running make (in your .vimrc , add this: :set makeprg=make\ \\\|\ filter ). This is probably pretty easy to do, but might be made trickier depending on what exact build system you are using. Change errorformat (see :help errorformat ) to strip off the sandbox prefix for you. This might not be possible in some cases, depending on the exact output format from your build system. Add a QuickFixCmdPost autocommand that will rewrite the file paths in the quickfix window before you begin using :cnext and friends. If you haven't used Vim's autocommand feature before, I would try the other two strategies first. They are powerful and very useful, but they take some practice to get right.
