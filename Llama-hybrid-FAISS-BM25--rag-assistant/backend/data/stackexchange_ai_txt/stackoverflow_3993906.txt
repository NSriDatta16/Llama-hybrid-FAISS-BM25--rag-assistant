You realize that B::getAs() returns a copy of its myAs. So the vector that it_A ranges over is a different copy than the one whose getA().end() it keeps being compared to... I.e. the for loop never stops. (Even worse, it_A ranges over a vector<> that is a temporary, so it's destroyed and all kinds of random crap could be written over that storage while you're pretending to iterate through it.)
