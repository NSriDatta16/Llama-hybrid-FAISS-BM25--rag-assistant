Need help understanding data leakage

I am a newbie to this stuff so I am sorry if my question is stupid~ I need help understanding what data leakage between X_train and X_test is and when exactly it happens. I am currently working on a dataset where I am using KNN imputer to fill in the missing values. I need to scale the data for knn imputation and I am doing the train-test-split and applying machine learning models after the imputation process. I read that data leakage might happen during scaling so we should scale after splitting , fit_transform the train set , and only transform the test set . I am unsure about how that would work in my case since I am scaling the data to be able to impute for missing values and I actually reach the train-test-split stage later. Should I be worried about data leakage the way I am doing things? Here is the code: Although here I am doing the splitting + applying DT algorithm right after imputation, I have other steps like feature selection left so I won't reach the train-test-split and decision tree part until much later.
