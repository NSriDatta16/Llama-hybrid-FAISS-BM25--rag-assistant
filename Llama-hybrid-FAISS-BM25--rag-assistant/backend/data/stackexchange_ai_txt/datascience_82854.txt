Should Discriminator Loss increase or decrease?

This question is purely based on the theoretical aspect of GANs. So, when training a GAN how should the discriminator loss look like? Should the loss of discriminator increase (as the generator is successfully fooled discriminator) Or should the loss of discriminator decrease? Can someone please help me in understanding this?
