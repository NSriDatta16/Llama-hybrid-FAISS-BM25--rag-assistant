Basically you have a regression problem where a number of binary coded fruit (variable is either 0 or 1) predicts a pain score. If you want the door to all sorts of combination effects, a machine learning technique is probably better suited then a probit model. Consider a random forest or a neural network or ... They will respect all the combinations that you feed them (no pun intended) without forcing you to try all possible combinations. They will try to draw all the information from your 120 observations and find a model that fits these observations. Be warned though, that 120 orbservations is not that much (depending on the number of possible foods) and it may well be, that many different models might fit your data and that the model found by an algorithm does not reflect your biological reality well. That being said, I'd try a regression tree as well as a random forest. And yes, you can use R to compute both. There will be a lot of explanations and examples on the web. I'd recommend starting with Youtube searching for "StatQuest" and the topic at hand, but that is a weakly founded personal preference. If given the sample size, interactions are not that important, you might also want to look into Naive Bayes, which is also explained in a StatQuest video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA
