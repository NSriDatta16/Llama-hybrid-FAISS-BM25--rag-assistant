Though I've never used the browser control in WinForms, I think what you want to use is a Master Page. Assuming what you're rendering in the browser control is an ASPX page, create a Master Page with the hidden text box that you want to grab your data from, and tell all of the pages you want to have that common control on to use your Master Page. When the page renders, the control id will then be "ctl00_TextBoxName". There is no way of getting around the ID concatenation, since unique IDs are needed and that's the only way to guarantee uniqueness with all the nested control abilities of ASP.NET. However, doing this will guarantee you always have that control named the same on every new form you create that inherits the Master Page. Hope that helps! In summary (because who reads paragraphs?): Create Master Page Place your common control in the Master Page Have your Form inherit the Master Page You can read up on how Master Pages work in MSDN's Documentation .
