Can MAPE values change after inverse tranform of target?

I have tranformed my Target variable as following Maxmin transformation and used an engine to get prediction for a time series data. The target transformation is done using the following formula in Python. Max = 5412 Min = 0 y.trans = (y-max)/(min - max) I'm calculating my MAPE as following: SUM(ABS(predicted - Target))/SUM(Target) However when I calculate MAPE with the below values with transformed scale and then inverse transform to original scale, the value changes. In case of scaled values I get the MAPE as 0.016 In case of inverse transformed to original scale I get the value 1.403 Can you help me understand why this would be the case? shouldn't MAPE be same in both the cases? Please ignore the colors in the table. Target Original| Target Transformed |Predicted Transformed Scale| Predicted Original Scale 0 1 0.984760045 82.47863646 0 1 0.985348307 79.29496252 0 1 0.986776916 71.56333061 0 1 0.986517592 72.9667921 0 1 0.98946835 56.9972898 0 1 0.989874186 54.80090537 264 0.951219512 0.991295546 47.10850505 60 0.988913525 0.99119119 47.67327972 0 1 0.988430027 62.61669388 480 0.911308204 0.98764636 66.85789968 0 1 0.986962233 70.560395 0 1 0.98922508 58.31386704 0 1 ' 0.986643061 72.28775387 0 1 0.988411587 62.71649116 0 1 0.988002631 64.92976103 0 1 0.986578411 72.63763967 0 1 0.989387047 57.43730164 12 0.997782705 0.988696028 61.17709646
