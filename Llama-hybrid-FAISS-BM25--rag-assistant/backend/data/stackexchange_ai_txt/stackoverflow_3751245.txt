I think you're going down the right lines here. A polling application to check the database for the existence of a new update followed by an xcopy deployment script would do it. This might be doable from a PowerShell script too, that runs on a schedule, say every 10 minutes. It could check the database, close the process and service, xcopy the application (from a shared source) and restart the said service and app. All this assumes that you are not using Windows Installer to package and deploy your application initially. Although an xcopy to directly replace binaries wouldn't hurt an MSI package, it's not recommended. We use AD MSI deployment at work and it's a pain at the best of times! MSDN contains references for MSI vs XCopy deployment for WPF applications (as well as the security requirements). This was the first link I found for querying SQL from PowerShell: http://elegantcode.com/2008/03/27/discovering-windows-powershell/ Good luck!
