Like others have said an update panel only updates its contents, thats one of the main benefits of using it. Panel2 and pnlPrvCmt need to be inside your update panel for your button click method to work. Another option would be to put Panel2 inside one update panel and pnlPrvCmt inside a second update panel. Then any control inside either update panel will cause both to refresh, as long as the UpdateMode=Always (which it is by default).
