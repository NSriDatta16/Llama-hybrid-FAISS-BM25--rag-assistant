Using RabbitMQ with nServiceBus (for C#) vs using Amazon SQS

If I understand correctly, I can use nServiceBus as a "framework" and / or a wrapper around RabbitMQ My preference of RabbitMQ is being able to use it on linux machines Background I have an application that enables people to upload images. These images will require thumbnails. Our application is predominantly asp.net (c#) My idea is to do the following: upload the full size images to S3 (or whatever storage service) create a "message" that has input storage key, output storage key, width, height - and add to queue. there will be a linux server acting as a worker (windows licensing constraint) that reads the messages from the queue, and does the actual resizing new image will be placed on S3, defined by output key of received message I could use Amazon SQS i suppose, but I wanted to explore the possibility of nServiceBus with RabbitMQ for transport. Does anyone have any further info on doing this? I saw this on GitHub: http://github.com/machine/machine.mta/tree/master/Source/NServiceBus.Unicast.Transport.RabbitMQ but was wondering how this could be used? What would your preferred way of approaching this be?
