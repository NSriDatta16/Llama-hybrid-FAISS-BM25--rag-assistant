Would PCA work for boolean (binary) data types?

I want to reduce the dimensionality of higher order systems and capture most of the covariance on a preferably 2 dimensional or 1 dimensional field. I understand this can be done via principal component analysis, and I have used PCA in many scenarios. However, I have never used it with boolean data types, and I was wondering if it is meaningful to do PCA with this set. So for example, pretend I have qualitative or descriptive metrics, and I assign a "1" if that metric is valid for that dimension, and a "0" if it is not (binary data). So for example, pretend you are trying to compare the Seven Dwarfs in Snow White. We have: Doc, Dopey, Bashful, Grumpy, Sneezy, Sleepy and Happy, and you want to arrange them based on qualities, and did so as is: $$\begin{pmatrix} & Lactose\ Intolerant & A \ Honor\ Roll & Athletic & Wealthy \\ Doc & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ Dopey & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ Bashful & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ Grumpy & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ Sneezy & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ Sleepy & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ Happy & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ So for example Bashful is lactose intolerant and not on the A honor roll. This is a purely hypothetical matrix, and my real matrix will have many more descriptive columns. My question is, would it still be appropriate to do PCA on this matrix as a means of finding the similarity between individuals?
