Trying to get the associated value from an Enum at runtime in Java

I want to accomplish something like the following (my interest is in the toInt() method). Is there any native way to accomplish this? If not, how can I get the integer associated with an enum value (like in C#) ? enum Rate { VeryBad(1), Bad(2), Average(3), Good(4), Excellent(5); private int rate; private Rate(int rate) { this.rate = rate; } public int toInt() { return rate; } } Thanks
