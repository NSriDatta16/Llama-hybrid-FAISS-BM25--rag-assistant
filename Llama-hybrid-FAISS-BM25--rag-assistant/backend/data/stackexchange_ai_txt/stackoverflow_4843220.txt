In Java what happens if two classes call a method in a third class at the same moment?

In my project I have a game class which is called by a client class. At the moment the game class writes a path to a file and the client class will read from this file and clear the contents. I am getting too many conflicts with access here so want to use another class as the method for storing the path data. I want to know, however, if there will still be a problem, or what the outcome will be if the game class tries to call the method in the storage class to write whilst the client class at the same instant calls the method in the storage class to read and clear.
