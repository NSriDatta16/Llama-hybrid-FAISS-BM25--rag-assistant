Transform input file in matlab adding values, or replacing and save it to other file

I am using libsvm , and would like to train some data, the issue here is, libsvm ask the input patterns in a special format. Let be my file: 72,0,5.6431,28.19,34.398,0.00662,3.38005,0.00401,0.00317,0.01204,0.02565,1 58,0,5.8600,77.7 ,19.317,0.00793,6.39105,0.00379,0.00385,0.01136,0.03751,2 Where last '1' (last column) in first row represent the class last '2' (last column) in second row represent other class Let be the format libsvm asks for (taken from heart_scale example file): +1 1:0.708333 2:1 3:1 4:-0.320755 5:-0.105023 6:-1 7:1 8:-0.419847 9:-1 10:-0.225806 12:1 13:-1 -1 1:0.583333 2:-1 3:0.333333 4:-0.603774 5:1 6:-1 7:1 8:0.358779 9:-1 10:-0.483871 12:-1 13:1 +1 1:0.166667 2:1 3:-0.333333 4:-0.433962 5:-0.383562 6:-1 7:-1 8:0.0687023 9:-1 10:-0.903226 11:-1 12:-1 13:1 How could you load or put in libsvm format the input file? or change the last column for the first?, changing ',' for column number and ':'?? I forgot saying that for libsvm the first column represents the class...
