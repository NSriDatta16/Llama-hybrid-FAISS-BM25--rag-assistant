How to define degree of freedom for Ljung Box text?

I am using Ljung-box test after fitting an ARIMA model to a time series to investigate whether residuals do look like white noise or not. For this purpose I need to define the degree of freedom in the ljung_box function in R . I am not sure how we extract the number of parameters, is the sum of p , q and the Seasonal P & Q in case we have a seasonal ARIMA model? As an example imagine we have a regression model with ARIMA errors like this: fit % model(ARIMA(Demand ~ Temperature + I(Temperature^2) + (Day_Type == "Weekday"))) Resulting in: fit # A mable: 1 x 1 `ARIMA(Demand ~ Temperature + I(Temperature^2) + (Day_Type == \n "Weekday"))` 1 The degree of the freedom specified by the Dr. Hyndman is 9 in this case but I am not sure how one should do it. Any help is appreciated in advance.
