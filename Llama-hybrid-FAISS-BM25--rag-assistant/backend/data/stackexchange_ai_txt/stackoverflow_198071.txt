Code for checking write-permissions for directories in Win2K/XP

Greetings! I am trying to check directory write-permissions from within a Windows MFC/ATL program using C++. My first guess is to use the C-standard _access function, e.g.: if (_access("C:\mydir", 2) == -1) // Directory is not writable. But apparently on Windows 2000 and XP, _access can't determine directory permissions. (i.e. the Security tab in the Properties dialog when you right-click on a directory in Explorer) So, is there an elegant way to determine a directory's write-permissions in Windows 2000/XP using any of the Windows C++ libraries? If so, how? Thanks Evan
