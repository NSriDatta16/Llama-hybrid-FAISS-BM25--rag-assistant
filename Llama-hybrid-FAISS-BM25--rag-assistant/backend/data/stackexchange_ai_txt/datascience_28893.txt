Intuitively, the linear classifier you built is only trying to find a local minimum meaning he is trying a lot of different operation but it is not looking at the whole space of possibilities, if an "and" operation is relevent to your problem and you add it as a feature it will improve the SVM performance. The fallback of adding features like this is that it can help the model overfit : it is easier to find a linear bound that separates well the data if the input space has a lot of dimensions.
