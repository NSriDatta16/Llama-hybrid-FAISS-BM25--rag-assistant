You can put parameters into the body of the request. They are the same format as appending them to the URL. Eg: POST /path/script.cgi HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: HTTPTool/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 32 home=Cosby&favorite+flavor=flies You can do that in prototype pretty easily with: new Ajax.Request('someurl/service', { method: 'post', postBody: 'home=Cosby&favorite+flavor=flies', encoding: 'UTF-8'}); To add your xml file, just append it to your postBody with some sort of delimiter so your cgi knows where parameters end and where xml begins. I think that's what you were looking for, hope it helps.
