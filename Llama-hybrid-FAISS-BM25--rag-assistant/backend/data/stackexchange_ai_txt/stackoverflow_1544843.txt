I always maintain a repository just for binary libraries ( https://svn.myserver.com/lib ) and put all shared binaries there. Then I make use of svn:external to get the correct library from a central storage. However, there are two pitfalls: This only works when you do not reference the libraries in VS from the GAC but by using the "browse" tab and choose the library from the local directory created by subversion when handling the svn:external property. On branching you need to "freeze" the svn:externals property by putting a specific revision between the target and the source using the "-r" parameter: /lib/3rd-party-lib -r4711 https://svn.myserver.com/lib/3rd-party-lib This way it is possible on every machine to do a check out and just press play to start. Sometimes I even use this to share small tools needed for the build (batch for setting permissions, registring a certificate, etc...)
