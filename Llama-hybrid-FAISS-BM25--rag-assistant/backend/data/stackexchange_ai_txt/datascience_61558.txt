Custom POS tags with SpaCy for NER

Quite new to NLP and especially NER. I'm trying to train a NER model on a custom dataset. This is a dataset of houses for sale. As part of the entities I'm training the model to extract are reference numbers . These are of variable length (but usually between 4-9) and look like G55L7 or LPP01Z1-32 . How can I give these entities a new "POS tag", as from what I'm aware of, I can't find any in SpaCy's default list that would match these? Ideally, I'd like to train this alongside a pre-existing NER model so that I can also extract ORGs which SpaCy already has support for.
