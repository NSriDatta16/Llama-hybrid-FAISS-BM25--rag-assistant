Try explicitly writing index.php in your RewriteRule. RewriteRule ^admin/([^/.]+)/?$ admin/index.php?admin=$1 [L] You may also find it to be cleaner organization to just move this directive to a .htaccess file in /admin/ itself, thus removing duplication in the rule and making the rule easier to find later.
