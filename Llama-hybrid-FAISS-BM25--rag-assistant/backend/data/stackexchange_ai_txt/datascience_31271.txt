custom delimiter for dat file

I've a dat file in the following format which I'm trying to load using pandas . 28::Persuasion (1995)::Romance 29::City of Lost Children, The (1995)::Adventure|Sci-Fi 30::Shanghai Triad (Yao a yao yao dao waipo qiao) (1995)::Drama 31::Dangerous Minds (1995)::Drama 32::Twelve Monkeys (1995)::Drama|Sci-Fi 33::Wings of Courage (1995)::Adventure|Romance 34::Babe (1995)::Children's|Comedy|Drama Code movies = pd.read_csv('movies.dat') I'm getting this error ParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 1 fields in line 11, saw 2 Line 11: 11::American President, The (1995)::Comedy|Drama|Romance I understand that it's because of the comma. One option I found is to skip these lines, which I don't want to. Is it possible to set newline as the delimiter here? Any help will be truly appreciated.
