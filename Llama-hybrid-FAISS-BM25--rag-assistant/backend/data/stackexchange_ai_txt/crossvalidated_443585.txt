$cor(B_1,Y) > cor(B_2,Y) > 0$ but $cor(A + B_1, A+Y) < cor(A + B_2, A+Y)$. Is this possible?

When I was processing data I came across this strange phenomenon. Say I have time series with positive values only, $A, B_1, B_2, Y.$ $\operatorname{cor}(X,Y)$ is the correlation of $X,Y.$ Here I have $\operatorname{cor}(B_1,Y) > \operatorname{cor}(B_2,Y) > 0$ . I add $B_1, B_2, Y$ to $A$ . But then I observe that $\operatorname{cor}(A + B_1, A+Y) . Is this possible? Or there are some issues in my data I need to dig?
