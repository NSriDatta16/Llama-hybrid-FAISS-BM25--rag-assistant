From C#, open an arbitrary application

Related question [stackoverflow] here . I'm trying to do the above, but I want to take the process one step further. I want to open an arbitrary file using the default editor for the file type. From that point, I want to allow my user to interact with the file as they would normally, or continue to work in my application. The extension is what happens after the user finishes editing. Is there a way I can capture a close (and ideally save) event from the external application and use that as a trigger to do something else? For my purposes, tracking the closing of the external application would do. I can do this in the specific case. For example, I can open a Word instance from my application and track the events that interest my application. However, I want to de-couple my application from Word.I want to allow my users to use any document editor of their choice, then manage the storage of the file being edited discretely behind the scenes.
