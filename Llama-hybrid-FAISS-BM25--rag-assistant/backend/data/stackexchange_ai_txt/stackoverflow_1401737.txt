It depends a lot on what you want to show in your (ex-) MDI Forms. Tabbed Forms (IE, Firefox etc) Tabbed with tools (Visual Studio) Sidebar + Collapsing panels (Outlook) TreeView navigation (Explorer) And you can make various combinations of the above. Just a Tech Tip, in case you have trouble deciding: Put your content on UserControls, derived form a common baseclass or interface. Use specialized Tabpages and/or floating Windows to host those controls. This makes it very easy to switch, or even let the user decide through drag&dock.
