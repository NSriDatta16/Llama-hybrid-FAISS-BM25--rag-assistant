Month TableView Organizer

I need to create a table view with 1 or 2 sections, depending on certain conditions. The first section needs to contain all of the remaining months of the current year, and the second section contains the preceding months of the next year, up to but not including the current month. Example: 2009 November December 2010 January February March April May June July August September October This would be the scenario with the current month of November. However, if it were January, there would be only 1 section containing all 12 months of the current year. This all needs to be dependent on the date settings of the phone.
