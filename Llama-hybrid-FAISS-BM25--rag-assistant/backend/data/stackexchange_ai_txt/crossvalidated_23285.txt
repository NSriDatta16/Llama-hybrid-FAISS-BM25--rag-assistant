To your first question: they are different model performance measurements. You want some of them to be big, others to be small. In fact they are somehow related so suggest you focus on one or two To your second question: what you have in your first R output is your model performance on training sample. When you do validation by cross-validation, you get those measurements on multiple test samples and their average. This give you more realistic estimate of how your model performs. HTH
