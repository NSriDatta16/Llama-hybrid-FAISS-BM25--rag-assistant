send(2) for TCP does not actually "send" anything on the wire, but places your bytes into the socket send buffer. It tells you how many bytes it was able to copy there in the return value. Make the send buffer bigger (see setsockopt(2) and tcp(7) ), pay attention to the syscall return value. In any case, TCP is a stream. You need to manage application-level protocol yourself.
