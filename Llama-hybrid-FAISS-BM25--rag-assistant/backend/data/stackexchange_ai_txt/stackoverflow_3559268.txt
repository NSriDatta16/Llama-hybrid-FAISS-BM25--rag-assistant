Here's a link on how you can incorporate ASP.NET C# with your custom Javascript code. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386450.aspx It also contains a sample VS 2010 project here: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=185646 Here's generally what's going on here: In the AjaxIScriptControl solution: SampleTextBox.cs - takes care of rendering the script control on the page; and attachment to client javascript code (the js file) SampleTextBox.js - takes care of client side functionality and generates Javascript object of control via prototype Notes: This example leverages existing ASP.NET's built-in control (you notice SampleTextBox inherits Textbox and IScriptControl) but you can render any type of HTML control if you inherit ScriptControl class instead. This solution also chose to separated the Script control code and website code in two projects but you can easily make it into one. You can easily leverage another Javascript library in your JS file In my experience so far, this is the one of the more elegant way to incorporate server side code with client side if you are to create re-useable controls for your website. You leverage server side power to do the initial rendering while provide client side capabilities through Javascript.
