There is no good way to do this without casting. Don't get hung up on the casting cost. Focus on things that actually impact performance...for example, hashing isn't free to begin with. You shouldn't be calling back into your service provider every time you want to use a service. Get the reference a single time and you don't have to worry about the mounting costs of retrieval: var service = provider.GetService (); service.DoSomething(); service.DoSomethingElse();
