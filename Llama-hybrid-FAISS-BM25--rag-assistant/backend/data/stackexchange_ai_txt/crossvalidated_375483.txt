Incorporating noise into machine learning models?

Usually, in machine learning textbooks the $X$ dataset and the target $y$ are defined with exact values. How about the case if the values of both $X$ and $y$ have noises: for instance, we only know that $0.5 but not the precise value. How could I integrate the information into the model?
