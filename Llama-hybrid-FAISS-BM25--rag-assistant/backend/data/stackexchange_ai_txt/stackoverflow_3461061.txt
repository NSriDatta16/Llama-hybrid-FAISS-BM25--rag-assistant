I'm going to try using Google Docs in my AP Computer Science class this year. It looks like it will work really well. I'll have each student sign up for a Google account and have them copy & paste their source code into a new Google doc, making sure they use a monospaced font. Then they'll just share the document with the Google account I've set up for myself. Google Docs will let me write comments directly in their documents, which they'll be able to see the next time they log in. I'll create a different folder for each assignment to keep things organized. Not sure if this is the BEST solution, but it's free, and WAY better than having the student print everything out like I was doing last year.
