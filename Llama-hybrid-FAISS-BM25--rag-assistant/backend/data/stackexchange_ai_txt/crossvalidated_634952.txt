If you have complete data on all mice in all conditions and all of your outcome measures are continuous, you could consider a multivariate linear model, in the sense of multiple outcomes . That's explained in a freely available Appendix to the Fox and Weisberg text An R Companion to Applied Regression , and is easily performed with the standard R lm() function for linear modeling. That method takes into account the within-animal correlations among the different types of outcomes, while providing overall significance tests that take correlations among types of outcomes into account. The first example in that Appendix is very close to your situation, with 4 different continuous measurements from individual plants evaluated as a function of 3 plant species. An alternative would be to devise a single "anxiety" scale that combines the results from the 5 individual tests for each mouse, then evaluate that overall scale as a function of genotype. If you take that approach, you should either follow standard procedures in your field for combining results of the individual tests, or develop your own combination scale by applying your understanding of the subject matter without looking at the genotype differences. You should make sure, however, that the potential problem of "carry-over" from test to test, noted by Robert Long in a comment on the question, was handled appropriately in the experimental design.
