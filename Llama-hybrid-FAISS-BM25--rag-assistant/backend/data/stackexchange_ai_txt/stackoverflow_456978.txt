Moving a Flex GUI window confused by underlying Papervision3D viewport

I'm developing a Flex 2 application, and I noticed that part of the library which is responsible for moving GUI windows ( TitleWindow s) around when you drag them with the mouse gets confused if there is a clickable ( buttonMode = true ) sprite beneath them. When I say confused, I mean that the window is moved around normally for a while, but then at some point "jumps" into the upper left corner of the flash app, and makes very minor movement there. Then at some other point it jumps back. It is more difficult to explain than to experience, so please go and see for yourself. Here's how to reproduce the problem: Go to http://www.panocast.com In the left sidebar, choose "Real Estate" Just below the bottom right corner of the flash window, choose "high res" by clicking on the rightmost icon. When (part of) the video loads, click on the staircase. A TitleWindow will pop up. Try dragging it around the screen. When the mouse cursor is moved above one of the clickable areas (like the staircase), the window is misplaced. (Sorry, but can't give you a direct link, part of the page is generated dynamically.) (What's makes the problem even more interesting is that for me, in "low res" mode, the problem does not occur! There is very little difference between the various modes.) I would really appreciate if someone told me what was going on here and how it can be fixed. I'm not sure if it matters, but the underlying sprite is actually not just plain sprite, rather it is a Papervision3D renderer object with some 3D elements in it. I'm telling this because it is possible that the incorrect mouse coordinates somehow come from the texture UV mapped on the clickable objects.
