Since classes are all "equal important" when added to an element it doesn't matter in which order you assign them to your paragraph. In this case, color in .class1 and .class2 are both declared as important, but because .class2 was declared after .class1 the browser will show your paragraph in blue, since it overwrites the declared color from .class1 Also, have a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/3uPXx/1/ You can see it doesn't matter in which order you declare the class on your paragraph. Since both classes define the same attribute ( color ) it will be overwritten be the class which is declared last. The only thing that can overwrite this is an inline-style with !important as you can see in the fiddle.
