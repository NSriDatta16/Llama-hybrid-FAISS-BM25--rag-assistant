OK, two things. Firstly, the default string representation of a Django model instance is "Modelname object". To change this, define a __unicode__ method on the class - in your case, you just want it to return self.slogan. Secondly, your slice is a queryset, because that's what you've asked for with [:1] - ie 'return a list consisting of all elements up to element 1'. If you just wanted a single element, you should use [0] .
