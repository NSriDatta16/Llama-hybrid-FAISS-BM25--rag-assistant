Predicting items based on time and weather

I've got a data-set with items bought, the time it was bought (I can add the weather of the location at that time of the day). I would like a simple "prediction" model based on time and weather. Most of the time series predictions I've seen have quantitative data to work with so it could be predicted by using regression, but predicting a categorical feature. Which method/approach do you recommend?
