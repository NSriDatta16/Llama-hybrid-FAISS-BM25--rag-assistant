It sounds like a decent use of the Google Calendar API to me. After browsing through the API docs for Java , it looks like you can create a calendar, add whatever events to it you wish, and pass a link to that calendar back to the user. In fact, the API page I linked mentions that "you can generate a public calendar for Google Calendar to display, based on your organization's event database". This sounds like exactly like what you are wanting to do. Try out some of the sample code there and see if it looks like it will meet your needs.
