Normal V Binomial Distribution (Elementary Question)

CONTEXT: First year university statistics course exam question Suppose couples decide to have children until they either have a child of each sex, or they have three children. Assume that births are independent and equally likely to be boys or girls. I calculated the expected number of girls per couple, $E(X)$ , to be $1.25$ . A gathering is organised where $50$ couples who followed this approach bring their children along. What is the approximate distribution for modelling the total number of girls at the gathering? (a) Binomial(50, 0.5) (b) Binomial(50, 0.625) (c) Normal(62.5, 5.86) (d) Normal(62.5, 41.45) (e) Uniform(0, 150) I know the correct answer is (c), but don't understand why it is a normal distribution instead of a binomial. Shouldn't it be normal since the amount of girls you can have is discrete (as you can't have 0.5 of a person)? But then I also understand that $n\cdot E(X) = 62.5 = \mu $ which is not discrete. Is the fact that this isn't a discrete number what makes the distribution normal? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated :)
