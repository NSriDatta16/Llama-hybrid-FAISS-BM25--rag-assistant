Assuming that FileList here is the FileList class from rake then the problem is in Ruby's underlying Dir class (which is used by FileList ) not matching files starting with . for the * wildcard. The relevant portion of rake.rb is # Add matching glob patterns. def add_matching(pattern) Dir[pattern].each do |fn| self Below is an ugly hack that overrides add_matching to also include files starting with . Hopefully someone else will be along to suggest a more elegant solution. class Rake::FileList def add_matching(pattern) files = Dir[pattern] # ugly hack to include files starting with . on Windows if RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /mswin/ parts = File.split(pattern) # if filename portion of the pattern starts with * also # include the files matching '.' + the same pattern if parts.last[0] == ?* files += Dir[File.join(parts[0...-1] Update: I have just tested this on Linux here and the files starting with . are not included either. e.g. If I have a directory /home/mikej/root with 2 subdirectories a and b where each contains first.template and .other.template then Rake::FileList.new('home/mikej/root/**/*.template') => ["/home/mikej/root/a/first.template", "/home/mikej/root/b/first.template"] so I would double check the behaviour on Linux and verify that there isn't something else causing the difference in behaviour.
