All meta approaches for treatment effect/uplift estimation work equally for continuous and categorical outcomes, for example the two-model approach or transformed outcome approach [1]. The recent and efficient R package {grf} implements the causal forest [2] that works similar to the upliftRF, but for both continuous and categorical outcomes. [1]Knaus, M.
