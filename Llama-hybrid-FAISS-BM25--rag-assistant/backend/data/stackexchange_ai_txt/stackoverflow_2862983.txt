Flex Difference between AdvancedDatagrid and DataGrid? Are footer rows supported?

What is the difference between normal DataGrid and AdvancedDatagrid ? Sorting, dragging columns, resizing columns are supported even in normal datagrid. I want to add footer details like summery, average etc of each column. Does AdvancedDataGrid support these features?
