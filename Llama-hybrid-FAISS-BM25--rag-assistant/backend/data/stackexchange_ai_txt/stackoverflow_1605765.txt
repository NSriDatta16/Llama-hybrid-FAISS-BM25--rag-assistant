How configure log4net for a c# Windows service

I have a windows service where the app.config file and the log4net.config files are seperate. The logging is not working. In my app.config file, I have the following in the section: This works if in the value I specify an absolute path to the log4net.config file. Do I need to supply an absolute path to the log4net.cong? Both the log4net.config and app.config file are in the same folder as the executable. any ideas? Parag
