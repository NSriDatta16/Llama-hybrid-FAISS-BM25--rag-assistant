Two points: You probably don't want to wire up an MPD ring by hand. Unless you are just doing some troubleshooting with a raw mpd command, you probably want to use mpdboot . Its usage is described in the User's Guide . Since you are using MPD, you are using MPICH2 or an MPICH2 derivative. Starting with MPICH2 1.1 there is a new process manager available, called " hydra ". I encourage you to update to the latest version of MPICH2 that you can and give hydra a try. It is much more robust than MPD and has many more features, including better performance.
