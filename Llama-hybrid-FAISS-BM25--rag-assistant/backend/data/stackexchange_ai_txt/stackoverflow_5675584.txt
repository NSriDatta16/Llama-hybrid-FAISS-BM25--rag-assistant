I believe the easiest way to get coverage for an existing application is to use cucumber. This will allow to describe and document how to the website/application should work (and will keep working). Because it works from the outside in, this also has the advantage you do not need to comprehend the inner workings completely yet. At the same time, you test all layers of the application (model-view-controller) in one test. When you start actually changing code, then I would start adding the unit-tests for the code you are changing, using your favourite testing framework. I personally favour rspec, but as you know this is a personal choice :)
