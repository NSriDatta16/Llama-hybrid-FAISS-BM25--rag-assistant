Large coefficients in logistic regression

This is from the book The statistical sleuth--A course in methods of Data analysis Chapter 20, Exercise 12(c)-(e). I am using logistic regression to predict carrier with possible predictors CK and H . Here is my solution: Carrier |z|) ## (Intercept) -2292.8 4130902.8 -0.001 1 ## logCK 315.6 589675.2 0.001 1 ## H 11.5 21279.6 0.001 1 This results appear to be weird, because it seems that all coefficients are not significant. Also the next question is to do a drop-in-deviance test for this full model and the reduced model that neither of logCK and H is useful predictor. I get: fit5 So the p-value indicates that at least one of logCK and H is useful. Then I'm stuck at the next question, it asks me to calculate odds ratio for a woman with (CK, H)=(300,100) over one with (CK, H)=(80, 85). But how can I get a meaningful result with all coefficients in this model ranging so wildly? Is there anything wrong with the way I did this logistic regression? Are there any remedial measures?
