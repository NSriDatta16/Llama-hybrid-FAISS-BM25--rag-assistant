Hosting control panel with Java EE Application Server support?

I currently have WHM/cPanel on my server, but it doesn't integrate properly with any Java EE App Server. I installed Tomcat manually, and have made it work through Apache, but the configuration is more fragile than I'd like. So, I'm trying to find a replacement where a Java EE App Server can be properly integrated & managed. Requirements: Open Source / Free Software (i.e. not proprietary) Runs on CentOS (although, Debian/Fedora Core/FreeBSD are options if necessary) Supports Apache + Tomcat (or equivalent) Self-monitoring (e.g. auto-restarts MySQL if it falls over) User account management (easy setup, limit space & bandwidth quotas, etc) Friendly end-user control panel (for configuring db, mail, stats, logs, etc) Anything obvious I've forgotten. Are there any recommended software packages which do all of this?
