What is a normal Memory Usage for a request in Coldfsuion

Looking at Coldfusion's Server Monitor, I see many requests with averages from 100KB to 700KB average memory usage. This seems high to me, is it? If it is high, it would explain why the server seems to love to eat up RAM and never let it go. What would be a good way of finding out why the memory usage is so high. There is nothing that I can think of that would be using this much memory. Are there any good ways of debugging Coldfusion requests?
