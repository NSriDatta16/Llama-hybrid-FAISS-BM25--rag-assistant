Correlation test

Please consider this table: above below A11 35,712 15,864 B 22,723 29,741 B10 3,513 5,427 B3b 5,146 3,780 ... I need to test the existence of a correlation between the two the variables. If they would be "counted individuals" (I also apologize for my basic ignorance ...) I'd use a chi-square or a Fisher test. But here the values are kg obtained as sum of subsequent weighings. What should I use ? Many thanks in advance. UPDATE I should have been more informative: the table represents the quantity of certain materials above or below a certain geographical altitude, expressed in kilograms. They cannot be counted because they are fragments of different dimensions. Weight is a more meaningful measure of their presence in the two regions (above/below). The values are not the result of a sampling but the total weight of each material in the area under study.
