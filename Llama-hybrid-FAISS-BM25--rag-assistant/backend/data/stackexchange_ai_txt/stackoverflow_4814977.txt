What is ABI(Application Binary Interface)?

This is what wikipedia says: In computer software, an application binary interface (ABI) describes the low-level interface between an application (or any type of) program and the operating system or another application. ABIs cover details such as data type, size, and alignment; the calling convention, which controls how functions' arguments are passed and return values retrieved; the system call numbers and how an application should make system calls to the operating system; and in the case of a complete operating system ABI, the binary format of object files, program libraries and so on. A complete ABI, such as the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard (iBCS), allows a program from one operating system supporting that ABI to run without modifications on any other such system, provided that necessary shared libraries are present, and similar prerequisites are fulfilled. I guess that an ABI is a convention or standard, and compilers/linkers use this convention to produce object codes. Is that right? If so who made these conventions(companies or some organization)? What was it like when there was no ABIs? Is there documents about these ABIs that we can refer to?
