You can use Server.HtmlEncode (which translates to HttpServerUtility.HtmlEncode ) , but Microsoft has a better web protection library called AntiXSS that you can download from CodePlex . It includes a utility that uses a white-list approach to HtmlEncoding (much safer and better, and recommended by OWASP although they point to an older version ). It also has tools that allow you to get safe HTML fragments, etc. If you look at nothing else, however, take a look at the OWASP top 10 . It sounds like you're just scratching the surface of web app security, and this is the best resource out there. Cross-Site Scripting attacks are just one of a whole slew of things you need to defend against. It's also the one you will need to conform to if you have to deal with any sort of compliance (PCI, Red flag, etc)
