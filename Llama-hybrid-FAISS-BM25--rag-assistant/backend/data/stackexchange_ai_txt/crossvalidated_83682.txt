Logit link notation

Here is the whole question: (a)A Simulation Study (Logistic Regression). Assume $y|x \sim \mathrm{Binary}(p)$, where $p= \mathrm{E}(y|x)$, and $\mathrm{logit}(p_i)=-1+5.1x_{1i}-0.3*x_{2i}$. Generate data with $x_{1i}\sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$, $x_{2i}=1$ for $i$ odd and $x_{2i}=0$ for $i$ even, and sample size $n$=500. Try generalized linear model (GLM) with logistic and probit links. Whatâ€™s your finding? We are required to use R to do it. I am not familiar with the notations like $y|x\sim\mathrm{Binary}(p)$,where $p= \mathrm{E}(y|x)$, and $\mathrm{logit}(p_i)=-1+5.1x_{1i}-0.3*x_{2i}$, with $x_{1i}~\mathrm{Unif}(0,1)$ ,$x_{2i}=1$ for $i$ odd and $x_{2i}=0$ for $i$ even,and sample size $n$=500. Also how to use to generate $x_1$ and $x_2$? Many thanks.
