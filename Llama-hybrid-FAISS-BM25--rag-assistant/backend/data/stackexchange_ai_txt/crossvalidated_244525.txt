What is or how to choose,calculate the optimal query point for Logistic regression with RBF kernel?

I have implemented a Logistic Regression with RBF kernel. I have trained the algorithm using a training set and a query point after the weights have been calculated i applied this weights to the test set . The problem is that I reached different accuracy levels on the test set between 55%-90% depending on what query point I have chosen. So what is the way to find or choose the best query point ?
