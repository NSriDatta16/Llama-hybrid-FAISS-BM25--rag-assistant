std::vector uses the unitialized_* functions to construct its elements from raw memory (using placement new). It allocates storage using whatever allocator it was created with, and by default, that allocator uses ::operator new(size_t) and ::operator delete(void *p) directly (i.e., not a type specific operator new ).
