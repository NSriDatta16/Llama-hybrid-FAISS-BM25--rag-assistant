Logistic regression with binary independant variables

I have searched high and low on the internet and cannot find the answer to my question. I am conducting a logistic regression (glm) in r to find how input variables influence my dependant dichotomous value (present/absent). My question is can my independent variables be in the form of 0 and 1, i.e. absent or present? If this is not possible why not and how would this impact my outcome? Thanks
