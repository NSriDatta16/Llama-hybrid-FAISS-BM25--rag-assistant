If a DGP is ARIMA(P,D,0) does that imply no other variables affect this process?

Im currently working with some time series data and have ran a number of tests, presuming the need of a VAR or VECM for an optimal forecast. However, upon going back to basics I noticed that the appropriate univariate models for the variables interested in are ARIMA(1,2,0) and ARIMA(1,1,0). The reason why this is of interest to me is because there is no MA component in each of these models, only the process's previous values are influencing the determination of the DGP. If a DGP is ARIMA(P,D,0) does that imply no other external variables affect this process?
