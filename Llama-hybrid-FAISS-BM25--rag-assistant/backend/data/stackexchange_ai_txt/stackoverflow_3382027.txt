New to Liferay 6.0

I have only recently started using Liferay 6.0. I have downloaded liferay-portal-tomcat-6.0.4_1 community edition. First of all can you please recommend me some website and books or articles for Liferay 6.0? (The ones available on the Internet are for earlier versions...) Secondly. I don' t seem to get the structure of Liferay. For example, how do organisation, communities, users, pages all fit in together? Lastly, could you tell me how I could make a link on a page to point to a directory on the file system at the local machine of the user? Thanks.
