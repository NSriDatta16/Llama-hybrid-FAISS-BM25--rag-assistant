Magento: Adding a Website with the same catalog, then associating products to new Website

I just added a new Website to my client's installation. It is supposed to share the same catalog as the one Website that's already there, but products are only showing up if I go to "Catalog > Manage Products > Product Foo Bar > Websites > Check new Website > Save". How can I just have all products show up in both websites without any extra steps for each product?
