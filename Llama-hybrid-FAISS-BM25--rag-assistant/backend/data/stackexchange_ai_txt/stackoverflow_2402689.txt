Papervision3D: Making Object Appear Still When Moving Camera

I'd like to keep an object appear to remain in the same place while moving the camera. I'm using this script http://pv3d.org/2008/11/19/dragging-mouse-for-camera-orbit/ to orbit an object using a mouse drag. But I have an object in the scene that I would like to keep still. How to I do this? Thanks, Josh
