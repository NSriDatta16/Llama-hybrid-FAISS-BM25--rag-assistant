Out of the box, I don't think so. AFAIK, while its possible to implement your own functions in MySQL, these can only return single values - not tables of data. It should be possible using a custom storage engine plugin. I believe there's one written for DB2 but a quick google turned up nothing for ODBC. It'd be a useful thing to have - so you could write one. The only caveat is that neither the local MySQL nor the remote ODBC connected database would be able to optimise queries spanning engines properly - so it might be more efficient to handle the two systems in a progrmanning language which supports both.
