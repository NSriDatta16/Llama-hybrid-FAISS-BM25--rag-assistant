How can I send/receive (SMTP/POP3) email using R?

I strongly suspect the most upvoted answer will be "that is the wrong tool for the job". I acknowledge that R may not be particularly well suited for sending and receiving email but it is the scripting language I know best. I am hoping to find a way to send and receive short emails in R. Does anybody know an established way to do this on a Windows platform? I might be able to use a combination of BLAT and GetMail but a native R solution would be preferred. Edit: An acceptable solution should be able to interface with servers that require SSL. Edit 2: I provide my stab at a 80% answer. Sadly an R native way is not demonstrated. Instead I use an unholy combination of system calls and command line programs that is likely to not be compatible across platforms. R native calls will require digging into the way POP3 servers like to talk to connected clients and an understanding of SSL that I don't currently have. Other answers are still encouraged. ##Note: Other programs are wrapped in R functions and system calls. #They each have their own licenses which may or may not allow the use suggested here #Programs used here: #STunnel: http://www.stunnel.org/; Provides an SSL tunnel but requires OpenSSL #OpenSSL: http://www.openssl.org/; OpenSSL to actually provide SSL # Note that these .dlls should be placed with the stunnel exe. # Also note that libssl32.dll may need to be renamed from ssleay32.dll #Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable (may be required for the SSL .dlls to work correctly) #Blat: http://www.blat.net; a public domain SMTP sending program #Getmail is free for non-commercial use. If you use it in a business environment, then a fee of $50 USD is payable to Tim Charron. #Stunnel is a TSR, so it will need to be killed from the task manager if there is an issue. If you are willing to install it as a service you may be able to tweak my code to start and stop the service. #My current code does not create .conf file for stunnel the way a full version ought. Check http://spampal.sanesecurity.com/manual_eng/servers/stunnel/stunnel.htm#sconfig21 to create the appropriate configuration file. #Set the config values as appropriate ##Config## BLAT.loc Usage case : Simply put, I need to have R be able to send a message whose content is determined elsewhere in the R script to an SMTP server. Participants will receive the email and respond to it. I need to retrieve their response from my POP3 server and store it in an R data structure so that I can perform post processing on it. In practice, I'm establishing a way to do experience sampling via R. That is, R can email a participant "How are you today (1 = Bad; 7 = Great)?" The participant can respond "4", and I can match the question asked, the response, and so on in a database for statistical analysis.
