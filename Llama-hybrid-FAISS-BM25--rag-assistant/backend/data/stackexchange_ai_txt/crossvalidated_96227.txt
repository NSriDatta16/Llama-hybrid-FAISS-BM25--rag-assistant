Generally, model building through stepwise regression is a good way to insure biased results. See for example: Steyerberg, E. W., Eijkemans, M. J., and Habbema, J. D. F. (1999). Stepwise selection in small data sets: a simulation study of bias in logistic regression analysis. Journal of clinical epidemiology , 52(10):935–942. Whittingham, M., Stephens, P., Bradbury, R., and Freckleton, R. (2006). Why do we still use stepwise modelling in ecology and behaviour? Journal of Animal Ecology , 75(5):1182–1189. If concerned about inflated Type I error from testing so many hypotheses/including so many predictors, consider methods for controlling the family-wise error rate or the false discovery rate .
