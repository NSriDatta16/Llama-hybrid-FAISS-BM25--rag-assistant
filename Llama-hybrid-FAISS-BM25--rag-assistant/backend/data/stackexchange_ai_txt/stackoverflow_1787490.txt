An observation is that your diagram is structured more like a DB schema than an entity diagram. Entities should be designed to meet the business needs independent of the data storage structure so you can use any DB to store the data. I believe you can remove the "Link" entity and set up a one-to-many or many-to-many associations between Products and Recipes. Then setup your DB schema w/ the link table and do the Table Mapping accordingly.
