Temporarily restrict certain resources from build inclusion in Xcode?

Is there a way to temporarily restrict which resources are included in the build of an iPhone app (via Xcode)? I am testing a use case in my app and want to minimize the installation time on my device. I would like to do this by reducing the resources to only those needed by this use case... i.e. there are over 70MB of .wav and .png files that I do not need to copy over. I am looking for something more elegant than moving the out of the project into a separate directory on the file system. Thanks in advance!
