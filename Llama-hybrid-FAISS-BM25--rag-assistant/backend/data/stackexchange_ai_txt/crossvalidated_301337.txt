You are right that the imputation model needs to be as rich or richer than the outcome model. The fact that imputation based on full maximum likelihood estimation and imputation done by mice assume linearity everywhere was a prime reason I wrote the R Hmisc package aregImpute function, which creates imputation models automatically using rich additive restricted cubic spline models. So linearity is not assumed for multiple imputation. The default approach in aregImpute is predictive mean matching, which I generally prefer over more parametric approaches (splines are still used; PMM is less parametric on the left hand side of models). Like mice , aregImpute uses chained equations. Unlike mice , it uses bootstrap draws instead of approximate (assuming multivariate normality) Bayesian posterior draws.
