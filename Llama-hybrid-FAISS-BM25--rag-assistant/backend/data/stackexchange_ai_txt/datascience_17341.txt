Forecasting non-negative sparse time-series data

I have a time-series dataset (daily frequency) representing the sales of a product to a customer over time. The sales is represented as the following: $$[0, 0, 0, 0, 24, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, ...]$$ in which each number represents the sales of the product in a day. The problem is that time-series forecast methods (ARMA, HoltWinters) work well for "continuous" and "smooth" data, but is not producing good results in this case. I want to make a forecast of that series, with attention to 2 points: (1) assuring non-negative values and (2) sparse/ non-continuous data. Anyone knows how to approach this problem? What methods/ technique? Thanks!
