Run SSIS package from SQL client

I deployed my working package on server which is enterprise edition, SSIS installed on it. When I tries to run package by connecting to integration services engine from my desktop SQL client (which doesn't have SSIS installed) I get error "The task "Send Mail Task" cannot run on this edition of Integration Services. It requires a higher level edition." Does it mean that I need to login to the server (RDP) and then run the package? Also, when I schedule the package thru SQL agent it fails saying login time out but my windos auth login works for everything from connecting, deployment. Any clue?
