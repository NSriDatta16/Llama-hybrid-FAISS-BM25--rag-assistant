Choosing a Model Selection Criterion

I am trying to decide which among for model selection criteria to use for a Bayesian nonparametric model. The candidates are: The L-criterion, as defined by Laud & Ibrahim (1995); Bayes factors; Bayesian Information Criterion; and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Is one criterion better than the others? Can you point me to some references that discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each? Thanks in advance.
