Can a file be opened simultaneously under SIlverlight and Windows?

Silverlight uses an IsolatedStorageFileStream to open files. I am trying to determine if I need to watch for locking issues when opening a file in Silverlight. In other words, can a file be opened by Silverlight and some other Windows (let's say W7) application at the same time. If so, any ideas on how to handle locking?
