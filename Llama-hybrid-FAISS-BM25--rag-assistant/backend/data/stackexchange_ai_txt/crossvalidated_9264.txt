You may think about happiness as the dependent variable, and you could use logistic regression with chocolate consumption as a predictor. Some people may be generally happier or less happy independently from chocolate consumption. This can be modelled by including subject id as a random effect categorical predictor. Age might also influence happiness. After these the model would look like this: logit(happy) ~ choc + age + id , where age is either 14 or 18, and the data are in the long format, a mixed effect logistic regression including a random categorical, a fixed categorical and a continuous predictor. (As an analogue of the repeated measures approach you could use a covariance pattern model, where id is not a predictor, but used in the specification of the covariance.) Alternatively chocolate consumption can be regarded as dependent variable. choc ~ happy + age + id could be the model (long data format), where id is a random effect, mixed effect ANOVA; or choc ~ happy + age , where repeated measures are considered, repeated measures ANOVA. I have no idea if happiness causes increased/decreased chocolate consumption or vice versa. You are safe asking about a "relationship" between the two.
