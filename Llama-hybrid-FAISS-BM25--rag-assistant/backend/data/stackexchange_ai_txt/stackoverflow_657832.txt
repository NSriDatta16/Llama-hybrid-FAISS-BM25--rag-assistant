From a C/C++ background a rapid coverage of C#'s syntax should be sufficient (it isn't that much different), especially given C++'s OO. I would suggest " C# in a Nutshell " (O'Reilly) for a rapid coverage of the language. Then start coding. Your real challenge is the scope of the framework, I would suggest starting with simple console applications to get the very basics, and then expand into one of WinForms, Web Service & Client, or ASP.NET. Note web apps (ASP.NET) will require also HTML and CSS (and maybe JavaScript) so maybe worth leaving to a second iteration of learning.
