What are the performance implications of small vs large numbers of NOT NULL columns? This may be stating the obvious, but , when a column is nullable, each record will require 1 extra bit of storage. So a BIT column will consume 100% more storage when it is nullable, while a UNIQUEIDENTIFIER will consume only 0.8% more storage when it is nullable. In the pathological case, if your database has a single table consisting of a single BIT column, the decision to make that column nullable would reduce your database's performance in half. However, under the vast majority of real world scenarios, nullability will not have a measurable performance impact.
