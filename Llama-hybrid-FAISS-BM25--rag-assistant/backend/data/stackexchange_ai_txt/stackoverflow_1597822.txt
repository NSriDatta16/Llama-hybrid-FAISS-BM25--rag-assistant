I like the third approach. I have a similar situation in my app where the controller needs multiple domain level services to perform a task, and the code gets a bit verbose for a controller. In particular, i have an event management system which allows for photo uploads. In addition to repositories and IAuthService, physical storage is handled by an IFileSystem (we can switch between local and S3), image manipulation by IThumbnailer, sweeping/cleanup handled by a IBackgroundTask. What i've begun doing is create application services in addition to domain services to handle the responsibility, so that the container is now only injected primarily with app services (option 3 in your case)
