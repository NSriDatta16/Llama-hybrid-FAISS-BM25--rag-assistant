Sounds like you need a UOM (Unit of Measure) table and a function to calc co-pack measure count and and unit count measure qty. with UOM type based on time between orders. You would also need to create a cron cycle and freeze table managed by week/time interval in order to create a freeze view of the current qty sold each week and the number of units since last order. Based on the 2 previous orders to your prior order you would set the current prediction based on min time between the last 2 freeze cycles containing an order and the duration of days between them. based on the average time between orders and the unit qty in each order, you can create a unit decay ratio percentage based on days and store it in each slice forward. Based on a reference to this data you will be able to create a prediction that will allow you to trigger a notice to sales or a message to the client to reorder. In addition, if you engage response data from sales based on unit count feedback from the client, you can reference an actual and tune your decay rate against your prediction. You should also consider managing and rolling up these freezes by month, so that you can view historical trending and forecast revenue based on velocity of reorder and same period last year. Basically this is similar to sales forcasting and we are switching out your opportunity percentage of close with Predicted Remaining Qty. percentage remaining.
