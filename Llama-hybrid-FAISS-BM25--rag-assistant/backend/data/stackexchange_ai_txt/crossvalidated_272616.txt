It appears that you have a lot of background reading to do. First, it is not usually appropriate to develop classifiers because this involves using an arbitrary loss/utility/cost function. It is usually better to develop a probability estimator (this is what logistic regression does). For details see Classification vs. Prediction | Statistical Thinking . Second, categorical predictors that are not ordinal should be treated as such in any method. In regression this is done by creating $k$ indicator variables for $k$ mutually exclusive categories. This may also be done for ordinal predictors when there are not many levels. For some ordinal predictors for which you can assume roughly equal spacing in the meaning of the values of the predictor, treating it as numeric can work.
