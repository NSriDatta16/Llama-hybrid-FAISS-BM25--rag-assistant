Distinguishing text with opposite meanings in SVM (False Information Detection)

I am currently working on a Binary Text Classification Model (False Information Detection) using Support Vector Machine and used TF-IDF as text vectorizer in Python. I have already tried training the model but upon testing, I have encountered a problem: For example I have the model predicted an entry saying "COVID-19 is happening today" as "True" , but after changing the text into "COVID-19 is not happening today" , it is still predicted as "True" , in which should be predicted as "False" . Where does the problem lie in this situation? How can we make the algorithm classify text with opposite meanings like ones mentioned above? Note: The text that exists in the dataset I used in modelling is “COVID-19 is happening today.” I used also predict_proba to know the probability of the text being 0(False), or 1(True). It shows that the two entries I made have the same output in predict_proba which with this I can say that it reads the two entries as the same (maybe as "COVID-19 is happening today").
