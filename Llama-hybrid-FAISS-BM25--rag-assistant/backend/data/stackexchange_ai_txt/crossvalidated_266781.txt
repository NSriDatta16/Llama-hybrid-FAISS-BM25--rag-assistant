You can make a prediction. You're going to have to make some assumptions, but that's often the case anyway. For example, you can assume future years are most like the most-recent year, i.e. set the dummy variable for 2002 to 1. Alternatively, you can assume future years are most like the average behavior of the three years in the sample, i.e. set the dummy variable for 2001 to 1/3, and the dummy variable for 2002 to 1/3. Or you could forget the qualitative predictor, and use year as a continuous variable in the regression. By assuming a linear trend over the three years, you would be extrapolating linearly to future years. One approach or the other might make more sense depending on the context. Or none of it might make sense depending on the context; you might be overfitting by including year in the first place.
