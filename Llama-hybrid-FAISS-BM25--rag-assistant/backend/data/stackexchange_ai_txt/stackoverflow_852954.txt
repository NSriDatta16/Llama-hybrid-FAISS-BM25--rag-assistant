For any code generation problem I'd take a good look at T4 (the text templating functionality that appeared in VS.NET 2008). A good place to start with T4 is... http://www.hanselman.com/blog/T4TextTemplateTransformationToolkitCodeGenerationBestKeptVisualStudioSecret.aspx You would need different templates for C++ and C#, and would drive your code generation from some other metadata. The alternative is to use the CodeDom API. This has two CodeDomProviders (CppCodeProvider and CSharpCodeProvider) that can target each language. For more information: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.codedom.compiler.aspx There's a related links on SO: T4 vs CodeDom vs Oslo Is it possible to dynamically compile and execute C# code fragments?
