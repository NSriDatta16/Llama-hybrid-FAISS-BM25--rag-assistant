Residual deviance, residuals, and log-likelihood in [weighted] logistic regression

I would like to ask a question about the relationship between deviance, residuals, and log-likelihood in logistic regression. I'm currently fitting a logistic regression with a moderately sized data (N>300k). As far as I've known, residual deviance equals to -2 times log-likelihood, and it also equals to the sum of squared residuals of the regression model I fit. I observed a weird result from my data, here is my code: xnam In my example, the sum of squared residuals is not the same as the residual deviance, but the residual deviance equals to the -2 times of log-likelihood. But the more weird thing is my previous knowledge is confirmed in the small dataset like mtcars . data(mtcars) mtcars I have no information that describes there is a relationship between the data size and the model fit. Could anyone explain the reason of such weird results? Thank you.
