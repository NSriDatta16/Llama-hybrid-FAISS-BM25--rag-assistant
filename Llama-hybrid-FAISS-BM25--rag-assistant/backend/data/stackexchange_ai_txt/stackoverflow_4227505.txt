The question shows that you do not understand the string literals. image this code char* pch = "Here is some text"; char* pch2 = "some text"; char* pch3 = "Here is"; Now, how the compiler allocates memory to the strings is entirely a matter for the compiler. the memory might organised like this: Here is Here is some text with pch2 pointing to memory location inside the pch string. The key here is understanding the memory. Using the Standard Template Library (stl) would be a good practice, but you may be quite a steep learning curve for you.
