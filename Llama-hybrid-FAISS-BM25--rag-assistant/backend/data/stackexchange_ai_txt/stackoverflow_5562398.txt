_mockChef.Verify(chef => chef.Bake(It.Is (vetoArgsPredicate), It.IsAny ()), Times.Never()); You can use Argument Constraints aka It.Is (predicate) with a method that evaluates to true for invalid arguments and combine that with a Times.Never(). OR You could strict mocks as another answer here demonstrates ; but they tend to make your tests brittle. So their use is discouraged unless you absolutely need them. For more details, See bullet #5 and #9 here
