Dynamically Assigning unique IDs to the Body tag of Pages using Rails

In PHP there's a clever trick where, based on the URL of a page, you can automatically assign a unique ID to the body tag of every page on your site. (which i find super helpful in writing CSS). e.g. "> -> source: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/wordpress/id-the-body-based-on-url/ The Result being that, a page with a url of "http://domain.tld/blog/home" gets a body with an ID of "blog", and a page with a url of "http://domain.tld" gets an ID of "home". I'd like to know if there's an, (ideally) equally simple and elegant, way to do the same in a Ruby on Rails based website? Thanks so much for sharing your wisdom, oh great mucky mucks of code!
