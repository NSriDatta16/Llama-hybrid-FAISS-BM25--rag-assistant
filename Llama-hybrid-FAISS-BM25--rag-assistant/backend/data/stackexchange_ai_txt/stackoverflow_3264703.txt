Which layer should host the LinqToSql entity files - In My Case

So i looked around a and didn't find anything that quite looks like what i'm talking about, i know some are similar but this is a more specific question. I'm working on project at home and using the entity framework as my ORM provider, when we work on project at my workplace we use NHibernate and have different DLL's set up for DM \ DAL \ BL etc.. where the actual mapped classes and hbm files are set up in the DM folder and the DB connection occurs only at the DAL layer, all the projects have access to DM and use the models to move stuff around, i.e UI->-(WCF)->BL->DAL and back again. My own project has a similar set up, however when I got to actually using EF to map my database and seeing how it works, it seems that wherever I generate the classes the DB connection must exist as well. So my question is where should I position entity classes and DB connection? or is there a way to separate the two and still easily generate the classes via drag n drop? Thanks in advance!
