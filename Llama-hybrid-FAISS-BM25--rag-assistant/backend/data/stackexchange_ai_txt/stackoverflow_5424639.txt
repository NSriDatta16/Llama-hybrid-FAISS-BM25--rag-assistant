WPF StackPanel has lost its child

im trying to solve the following problem: I have a StackPanel that contains an Image as. But if I do panel.Children.Count it sometimes returns 0 and sometimes 1. Why? How can I fix this? Note: I get the StackPanel from the sender Object of an MouseEvent. Does anyone has an idea how to solve my problem? Any help is appreciated:) Update: private void MoveContainer(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { StackPanel panel = sender as StackPanel; MessageBox.Show(panel.Children.Count.ToString()); } Update 2: Update 3: private void StartDrag(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { startPos=e.GetPosition(null); //startPos is a local attribute }
