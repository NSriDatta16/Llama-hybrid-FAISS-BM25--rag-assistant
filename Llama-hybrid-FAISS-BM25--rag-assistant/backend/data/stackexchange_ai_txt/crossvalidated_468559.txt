In basic OLS you don't estimate the covariance matrix of residuals. You assume that errors (not residuals) are spherical , meaning that they're not correlated with each other. Residuals will come out of OLS uncorrelated. What you described as a second method is a different assumption. When applying basic OLS to time series you run into an issue that its assumptions are not practical. In time series the residuals are often correlated. So, you could assume that they're AR(1) process, and that what that method does: it estimates the model assuming the errors are AR(1). This is called feasible generalized least squares
