Contrary to what others are suggesting, trying to extract data on square footage and number of rooms from apartment ads is not a problem for machine learning - especially not when you don't have any training data. You will spend 10 times as long trying to build a machine learning system for this task than you would manually extracting the data yourself. If you really want an automated system, consider building some simple regex rules based on ads you have seen. There are only so many ways people describe these features, and you should be able to get most of them when they are present in the ad. You won't get 100% accuracy, but you're not going to do any better another way, in my opinion. You can start with some simple rules, and improve them as you look at more and more ads. In Python, for example: import re ad = '$3582 / 1br 1ba - 724ft2 - Breathtaking Seaport District' sqft_pattern = '([0-9]+)\s?(sq|ft)' beds_pattern = '(([1-9](\.5)?)\s?(br|bd|beds?|bedrooms?))|(beds|bedrooms):?\s?[1-9]' bath_pattern = '(([1-9](\.5)?)\s?(ba|baths?|bathrooms?))|(baths|bathrooms):?\s?[1-9]' m = re.search(sqft_pattern, ad) sqft = m.group(1) if m else None m = re.search(beds_pattern, ad) beds = m.group(2) if m else None m = re.search(bath_pattern, ad) bath = m.group(2) if m else None print('square feet: {}'.format(sqft)) print('bedrooms: {}'.format(beds)) print('bathrooms: {}'.format(bath)) Output: square feet: 724 bedrooms: 1 bathrooms: 1
