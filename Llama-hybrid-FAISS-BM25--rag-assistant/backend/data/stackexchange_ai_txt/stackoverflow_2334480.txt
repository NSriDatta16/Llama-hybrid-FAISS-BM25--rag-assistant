Not sure if dragging a Javascript library into the mix is possible in your application, but a lot of CSS that doesn't work well in IE6 is possible when using jQuery. However, if you have no other use for a the 24kb jQuery library, it seems a hefty addon for a single CSS-attribute. Maybe you can go with graceful degradation?
