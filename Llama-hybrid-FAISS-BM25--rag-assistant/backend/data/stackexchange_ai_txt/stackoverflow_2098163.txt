If there is no way to rewrite the color-handling sub-routines, then there is no good way to do it. You options: Reflection , which allows you to get the names of objects members (methods and properties). If your routines are on an object you can use this. Believe it or not, it is probably better to have a big select statement ! It looks inelegant, but will perform much better than using reflection.
