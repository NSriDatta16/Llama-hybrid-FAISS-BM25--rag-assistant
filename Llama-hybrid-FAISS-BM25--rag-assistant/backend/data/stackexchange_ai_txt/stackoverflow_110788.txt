In model class you would probably have to add "order" field, to maintain specific order (eg. item with order = 10 is the last one and order = 1 is the first one). Then you can add a JS code in admin change_list template (see this ) to maintain drag&drop feature. Finally change ordering in Meta of model to something like ['order'].
