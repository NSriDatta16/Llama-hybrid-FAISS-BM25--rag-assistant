There are a few factors you'll want to consider when deciding where to store temporary data. Session storage is great for data that is specific to a single user. If you find the default file-based session storage handler is inefficient you can implement something else, possibly using a database or memcache type of backend. See session_set_save_handler for more info. I find it is a bad practice to store common data in a user's session. There are better places to store data that will be frequently accessed by several users and by storing this data in the session you will be duplicating the data for each user who needs this data. In your example, you might set up a different type of storage engine for this wave data (based on wave_id) that is NOT tied specifically to a user's session. That way you'll pull the data down once and them store it somewhere that several users can access the data without requiring another pull.
