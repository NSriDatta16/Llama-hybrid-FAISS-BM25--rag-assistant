Some variables, including those declared within a parallel construct, have data-sharing attributes that are predetermined (eg, you can't declare them shared or private ). Those are defined in section 2.9.1.1 in the OMP3 standard. In this case, OpenMP Standard 3.0 , 2.9.1.1: (p78, line 12) "Variables with automatic storage duration that are declared in a scope inside the construct are private." I'm pretty sure it's always been this way in OpenMP. So yes, in your C99 example, i and x are private; on the other hand, I understand that same section to say that if x was declared static, it'd be shared. I think in this respect, it more or less does what you'd expect.
