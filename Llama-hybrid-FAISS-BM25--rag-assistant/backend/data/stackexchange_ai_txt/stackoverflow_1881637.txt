How do I prevent Window resizing when the Workstation is Locked then Unlocked?

We have an application that is run in multi-monitor environments. Users normally have the application dialog spread out to span multiple mointors. If the user locks the workstation, and then unlocks it, our application is told to resize. Our users find this behavior frustrating, as they then spend some time restoring the previous layout. We're not yet sure whether it is the graphics driver requesting the resize or Windows. Hopefully through this question, it will become clearer which component is responsible, Popular applications like (File) Explorer and Firefox behave the same way in this setup. To replicate just: open Explorer ( Win+E ) drag the Explorer window to being horizontally larger than 1 screen lock workstation ( Win+L ), unlock the application should now resize to being solely on 1 screen How do I prevent Window resizing when the Workstation is Locked then Unlocked? Will we need to code in checks for (un)locking? Is there another mechanism we're not aware of?
