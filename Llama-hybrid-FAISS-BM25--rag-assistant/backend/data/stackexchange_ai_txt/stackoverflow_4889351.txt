Upgrading C code to VB.NET - Unioned Structures

I am trying to upgrade the btrieve code written by Jim Kyle in the early 90's to VB.NET and am running into a problem with unioned structures. The old C code is as follows: typedef struct { union { struct { PGPTR PgSeq; // 00 - page number int Usage; // 04 - match with usage count int Version; // 06 - version code, So far, I had: _ Structure FCRTOP Public PgSeq As PGPTR Public Usage As Short Public Version As Short Public RecSig As Short Public SeqNbr As Short Public Usage As Integer End Structure One issue I am running into is that VB.NET doesnt like two struct variables with the same name (Usage). What am I missing to group the overlapping fields with a unique struct name as is done in the C example (v5 and v6)? Thanks for any help!
