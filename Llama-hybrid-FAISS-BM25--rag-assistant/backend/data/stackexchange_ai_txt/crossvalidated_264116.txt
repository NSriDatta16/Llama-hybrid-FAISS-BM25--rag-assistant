I see what you're trying to do here, i.e. calculate the success rate for year 2014 (0.85), the proportion of projects attributed to that year (0.22), total proportion of projects that have a initial year (0.9) and multiplying them to get a KPI. But I don't understand how you would interpret this number that you get for each year as a measure of importance for the "initial year" variable. Also, this is a bi-variate way of looking at variable importance, as you are looking at the "initial year" variable's impact on project success, whereas any real relation between variables and project success could be a combination of 2 or more variables. I'd suggest you do a quick Random Forest run to get an estimate of variable importance for your problem. And you don't have to necessarily be proficient in stats or R to do so. Just download R ( https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ ), and then a package called "rattle" ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rattle/index.html ) that provides a GUI interface to do RF (and many other correlation tests that you can try out!). And about the missing values in your dataset- you can impute them (probably make rules looking at project end year, manager start date, end date, etc. In my past experience I have found that usually a few simple ones help in covering a majority of missing values. For ex, if a project end year was 2011 then start year will be 2010 or 2011; then if the manager who was assigned to work on the project started in your firm in 2011, then the project may also have started in 2011), but if there is no reliable way of doing that you can flag them (say code all values with missing initial year as 9999) to still incorporate them in your training data.
