Why do we say that large margin improves generalization in SVM?

I am trying to understand SVM from very basic level. I encountered this statement that large margin tries to improve the test error i.e the generalization ability of the classifier. I read about it further in this but still I don't get the point. Can someone please explain this to me ?
