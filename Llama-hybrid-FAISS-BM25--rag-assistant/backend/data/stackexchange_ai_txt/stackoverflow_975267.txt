Mutex is the way to go. It's a lot less fragile than using process names etc. However, you need to make sure the Mutex isn't garbage collected. In the case of a service (which is event driven rather than having a "main" method which runs to completion), the most sensible way of doing this is probably to put it in a static variable. Dispose of the mutex when the service stops, so you don't need to wait for finalization or anything like that.
