elegant string splitting

I am looking for a nicer way of accomplishing the following code block which is part of an EmailAddress class/object. To my thinking, the parts array is clunky and I'm wondering if there isn't a one liner using tuples or Linq that would tidy it up a bit. Also, what would be a better property name than "Alias" for the first part of the email address? public string Alias { get; private set; } public string Domain { get; private set; } private void Split(string emailAddress) { var parts = emailAddress.Split(new[] { '@' }); Alias = parts[0]; Domain = parts[1]; }
