I'd suggest to write a fragment shader that uses combines some sine waves of different frequency, phase shifts and color (i.e. combine x and y and time in different ways, mash them together and you should get something). To get the colors to correspond to the music, try filtering out some frequency bands, connect the intensity of each bands to the color waves above and use some filtering over time on the intensity for each band. (i.e. so that a peaking frequency gives a high output that degrades slowly over 0.2-5 seconds.)
