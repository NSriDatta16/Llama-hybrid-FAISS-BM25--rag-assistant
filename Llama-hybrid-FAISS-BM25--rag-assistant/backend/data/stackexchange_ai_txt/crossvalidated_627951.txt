When we talk about the term "adjusted" in the context of statistical findings, it indicates that the researchers have taken into consideration other influencing variables or covariates. In simple words, they've made allowances for other factors which might otherwise distort the results. This ensures that the differences we see are genuinely because of the primary variable under investigation—in this case, infections during early childhood—and not because of some unrelated factors. Your reference to "The Medical Birth Registry and the Population and Housing Census data were used for birth-related and socio-demographic data..." is quite telling. These datasets would have provided additional parameters that the researchers would have wanted to keep constant, like socio-demographic details that could affect both IQ and the chances of having infections. The existence of an "Adjustment for Covariates" section confirms this understanding. So, when they mention "adjusted mean difference", it's not just a simple matter of subtracting the average IQ of one group from the other. What they've likely done is employed a statistical method (like linear regression) to gauge the difference between these groups while simultaneously accounting for other influencing factors. In layman's terms, they're trying to find out, "After ensuring other external factors are not muddying the waters, what's the actual difference in IQ between children who had infections and those who didn't?"
