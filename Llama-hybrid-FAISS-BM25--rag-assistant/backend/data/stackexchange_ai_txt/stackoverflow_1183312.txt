I don't know of an elegant way to do this in MSTest besides using its data-driven testing features. However, you might try using an abstract base class for your test fixture and then creating one subclass of it for each interface to be tested. BTW, Gallio provides free integration with the Visual Studio test tools. We're also going to resume work on another add-in for Visual Studio as part of Gallio v3.2.
