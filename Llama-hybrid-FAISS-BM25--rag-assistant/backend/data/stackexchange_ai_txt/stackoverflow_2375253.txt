Sorting generally takes more than one iteration by itself. It's almost certainly O(n log n) for the average case (the algorithm isn't specified by ECMAScript, but that's the best you can do with a comparison sort), so there's not much point in doing both at the same time. You can chain them into one expression though, since sort returns the array itself: function order(a, b) { return a b ? 1 : 0); } var arr2 = arr.map(function(item) { ... }).sort(order);
