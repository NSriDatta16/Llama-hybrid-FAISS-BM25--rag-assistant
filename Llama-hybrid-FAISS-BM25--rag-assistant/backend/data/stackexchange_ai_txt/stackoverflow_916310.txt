Therefore, it follows logically that sizeof(void*) >= sizeof(T*) for all types T, correct? That doesn't necessarily follow, since sizeof is about the storage representation, and not all bit-patterns have to be valid values. I think you could write a conformant implementation where sizeof(int*) == 8 , sizeof(void*) == 4 , but there are no more than 2^32 possible values for an int*. Not sure why you'd want to.
