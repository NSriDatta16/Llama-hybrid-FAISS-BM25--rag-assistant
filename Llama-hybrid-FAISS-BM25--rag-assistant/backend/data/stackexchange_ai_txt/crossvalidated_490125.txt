How should one transform a variable in which the further away from 0, the more significant it is?

Let's say you have a variable that ranges from -inf to +inf. The further you get away from 0, the more effect you think it has on the response. I am doing a logistic regression by the way. And basically, the closer the variable is close to +/-inf, my hypothesis is that the more likely a 1 is to occur. I can take the absolute value, but then we have the issue of the random variable being bounded to unbounded from 0 to +inf. Should I normalize the absolute value of the random variable? Thanks!
