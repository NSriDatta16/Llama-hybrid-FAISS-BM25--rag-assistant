I've had pretty good success applying KNN with Dynamic Time warping as the distance metric. My research (pdf) suggests that this approach is very difficult to beat. The below schematic is from my python implementation of KNN and DTW on github . Or view in IPython Notebook If you're training data set is very large, I suggest performing a hierarchical clustering of the distance matrix. Then sampling from desired clusters to produce your smaller training data set. The hclust will ensure you have time series that represent a broad range of time series characteristics in your data.
