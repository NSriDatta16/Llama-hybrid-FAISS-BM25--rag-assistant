lines (and in general hyperplanes) sit on an object call Grassmanian ; e.g. lines in the plane sit in Gr(1,3), which is isomorphic to the 2-dimensional projective space, and yours is the simplest non trivial one: Gr(2,4). It is a compact metric space, which comes with a standard metric (arising from the plucker embedding - see the link above). However, this metric is a little expensive to compute, so you may want to consider an approximation (just as you'd consider using dot product instead of angle in 2 dimensions - it works find for small angles) A more detailed explantion (based in the metric defined in the linked wikipedia article): For each line l take two points (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) on it. Let A be the 4 by 2 matrix whose columns are (1,x1,y1,z1)^t and (1,x2,y2,z2)^t. Define P to be the 4 by 4 matrix A(A^tA)^(-1)A^t. Then P is dependent only on l and not of the choice of the two points. The metric you want is the absolute value of the top eigen value of the difference between the matrices corresponding to the two lines.
