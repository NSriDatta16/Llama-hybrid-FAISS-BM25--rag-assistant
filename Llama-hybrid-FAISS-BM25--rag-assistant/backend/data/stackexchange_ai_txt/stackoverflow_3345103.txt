I am just a newbie in javaEE but I think the problem is that the container redirects the users just after a 401 HTTP error, when he is not authorized. 403 Error means the it knows the username/pwd but it is not suitable for that resource. So I would try to write a filter for this 403 error and redirect manually. Or you should hide the link to this page to students if this is possible.
