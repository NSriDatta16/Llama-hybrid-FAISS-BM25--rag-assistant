NB: The steps below will solve 90% of your Xcode archive issues however, from the comments it is suggested you try quitting Xcode first. This may save you hours of setting tweaking. Check the "user header paths" are correct (Add "" to paths for spaces, both in your project and dependencies) Set "Always search user paths" to YES Create a group call "Indexing headers" in your project and drag the headers to this group, DO NOT add to any targets when prompted. This includes any headers inside your .xcdatamodeld , you'll need to right-click and view package contents to find them. For all dependencies set "Skip Install" build setting to "Yes" Moving any "Public" headers in Build Phases to "Project" Set the Build Setting "Installation Directory" on your Target to $(LOCAL_APPS_DIR) Change the target build setting "scan all source files for includes" to YES.
