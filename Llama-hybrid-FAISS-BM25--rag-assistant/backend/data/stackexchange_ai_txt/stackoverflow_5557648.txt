Making a repeating text background on a website?

I've been requested to put a sequence of text repeating as the background of a website. It will be just a slight shade lighter then the background color, similar to physical company stationary with the name, slogan, whatever repeating covering the paper. I mocked it up simply enough by putting the following div onto the page Repeating Text Here Repeating Text Here Repeating Text Here I like this solution in general terms as using a repeating image seems like a big headache (trying to get a seamless repetition) and the text based seems like better bandwidth wise. However, to get enough text onto the page to cover browser windows maximized at a high resolution, I am manually repeating the text in the html many times over. I'm wondering if there is a more elegant solution to this, something CSS based maybe I could say to repeat X times. I know I could repeat the text X times into html server side with PHP, ASP.Net, etc but I am looking for something where the html source output doesn't need that text repeated like that. I could do it JavaScript based, but then users without JavaScript won't see it. An advantage I could see with the JavaScript would be bots like Google's won't see the repeating text and think it is an attempt to boost keyword hits. Comment Responses: The text is static, essentially it is a company slogan. Picture if instead of SO having a pure white background it was white with a soft gray "Making the Web a Better Place" over and over again. The issues with doing this image based I see is lack of text justify and wrap for variance of browser window width. It would sometimes need to go: Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web a Better Place Then if you reduce the browser width it'd need to be: Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web a Better Place Making If you are doing that with a tiled image, you'd end up with: Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web Making the Web a Better Place Making the Web
