Deeplearning without an objective function?

In this article , the author talks about how deeplearning models no longer are trained for an objective function that humans specify, but find their own objective function. Specifically, he is talking about GANs. Is there a good resource explaining this idea that GANs find their own objective function? Based on what I've read about GANs, I don't think of them this way.
