Magento products import from database using SQL query

Magento uses the EAV structure in its database system. I have this query that gives me product_id and name of products in my magento store. SELECT e.entity_id AS product_id, var.value AS product_name FROM catalog_product_entity e, eav_attribute eav, catalog_product_entity_varchar var WHERE e.entity_type_id = eav.entity_type_id AND eav.attribute_code = 'name' AND eav.attribute_id = var.attribute_id AND var.entity_id = e.entity_id I need help in getting product_url|price|image_url|description|manufacturer
