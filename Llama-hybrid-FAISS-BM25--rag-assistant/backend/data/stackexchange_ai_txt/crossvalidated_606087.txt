You can rewrite the second model like this: $$y = \tilde \beta X + \tilde \gamma_1 \cdot (Q_1 - Q_4) + \tilde \gamma_2 \cdot (Q_2 - Q_4) + \tilde \gamma_3 \cdot (Q_3 - Q_4) + \varepsilon$$ You can estimate this model by subtracting $Q_4$ from the other three before you fit the model. This still avoids the dummy variables trap, even if you have an intercept in X. The coefficients will be different since the quarter variables on the RHS are transformed by subtracting $Q_4$ . You have imposed a constraint on the $\tilde \gamma$ coefficients that they add up to zero. This is why I added tildes and changed the error in the equation above. These coefficients represent the difference in the predicted value of the dependent variable when comparing one quarter to the average of all the other quarters instead of relative to $Q_4$ (if that is the omitted quarter). You can do a likelihood ratio test with the two models to decide which is better.
