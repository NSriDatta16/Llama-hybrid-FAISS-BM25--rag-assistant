There is nothing Bayesian in this problem since you did not define any model in terms of likelihood function and priors. If you have independent $y_1, y_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and $\varepsilon_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{ \varepsilon_1 }^2)$, $\varepsilon_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{ \varepsilon_2 }^2)$ then $$ y_i + \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 + \sigma_{ \varepsilon_i }^2) $$ given the property of variance that $$\mathrm{Var}(X+Y) = \mathrm{Var}(X) + \mathrm{Var}(Y)$$ when $X$ and $Y$ are independent. So you end up with two random variables that are not identically distributed.
