It depends on the level of expertise that is required. Personally I know how to do most of the standard operations you would need for Excel but I don’t think a Data Scientist needs to know more than that. If this is a job advert where they are asking for advanced knowledge of Excel as a Data Scientist and do not require much in the way of programming/machine learning skills then I would give the job a wide berth. It would indicate to me that the company putting the job out don’t understand what a Data Scientist is and are putting a job out to say they have one.
