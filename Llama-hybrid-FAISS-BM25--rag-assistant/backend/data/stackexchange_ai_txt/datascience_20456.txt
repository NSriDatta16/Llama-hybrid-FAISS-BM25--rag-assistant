In simplified words, Model Parameters are something that a model learns on its own. For example, 1) Weights or Coefficients of independent variables in Linear regression model. 2) Weights or Coefficients of independent variables SVM. 3) Split points in Decision Tree. Model hyper-parameters are used to optimize the model performance. For example, 1)Kernel and slack in SVM. 2)Value of K in KNN. 3)Depth of tree in Decision trees.
