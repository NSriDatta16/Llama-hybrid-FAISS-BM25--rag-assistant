When you use linear regression on non-stationary time series, there is a big risk of spurious correlation. E.g. You will see a strong relation between the population of China and the Dow Jones stock averages over the last 100 years. When you are trying to find the correlation between two variables you almost never want this sort of thing. Otherwise, everything that goes up is correlated positively with everything else that goes up, and negatively with everything that goes down.
