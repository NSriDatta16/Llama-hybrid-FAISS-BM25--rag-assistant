Positive definiteness of Hessians?

I'm reading the book " Convex Optimization " by Boyd and Vandenbherge. On the second paragraph of page 71, the authors seem to state that in order to check if the Hessian (H) is positve semidefinite (for a function f in R), this reduces to the second derivative of the function being positive for any x in the domain of f and for the domain of f to be an interval. However, am I right to assume that the case for R^n is more complex, that is, I need to do more work to proof that z^THz is positive for any z (likely using minors, or something else)?
