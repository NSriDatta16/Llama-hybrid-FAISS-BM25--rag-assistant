(Installshield 2010) ISProject Folder in TFS 2008

I wonder what the ISProjectFolder, ISProductFolder, ISProjectDataFolder, ISPROJECTDIR (predefined paths) values are assigned when I build using TFS 2008 build agent I think these can have different values from the values that are seen on local does anyone know about this????
