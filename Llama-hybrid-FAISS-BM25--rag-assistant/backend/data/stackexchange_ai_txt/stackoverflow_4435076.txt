Can a controller influence the _layout.cshtml file?

I'm stuck! I'm under the impression that the _layout.cshtml file is used for MasterPage-like content. Everything there is rendered on every page. Naturally, I want to write the code for rendering my sidebar menu in that file. I want to dynamically display a list of Categories from my DB, but I'm having a problem with passing the actual model of categories to Layout.cshtml since it seems no controller actually touches it. Any suggestions? Otherwise please tell me how to approach this problem. I've been wracking my brain for the past three days and still no elegant solution. I need to: Dynamically fetch a list of Categories from the DB. Display this list of Categories on every single view. (Hence the use of _layout.cshtml) Elegantly handle each different categories click. I'm at my wits end. :P How would you solve this?
