As long as it works and its valid, then it doesn't really matter whether its in 1 file or 3, its just personal preference. Personally, I prefer to have a seperate sheet for each IE version (if needed), as I find it easier to organise. Like I said, if its W3C complient (god, don't we just love them), then its all good.
