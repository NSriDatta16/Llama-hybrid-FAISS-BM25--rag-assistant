Most Ssh clients will recognize the following ssh username@remotemachine -pw'YourPassword' However, I used GanymedeSSH for Java and it had a method like this: conn = new Connection(servername, 22); conn.connect(); conn.authenticateWithPassword(username, password); session = conn.openSession(); And as long as you keep reference to your session, you will be able to use it to execute commands on the remote machine.
