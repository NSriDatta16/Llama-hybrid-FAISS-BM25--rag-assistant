What happens after backpropagation in the learning phase within Neural Network?

Within a Neural Network during the learning phase ,there are two mechanisms happening. Feedforward and Backpropagation. Taking an example of XOR operation. A B Q 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 For the first pass(0,0->0) feedforward takes place, then backpropagation happens.After this step all the weights are recalculated . What happens now? Question-1:Again the same input 0,0 is feedforward with the new calculated weights(during the backpropagation) and then backprogated until the error becomes nill? If yes, what happens if the error is never nill? Which brings me to the next question. Question-2:When would the learning for the next pass(0,1->1) happen? Question-3: Suppose the concluded weights for the 1st pass is 10.3,-2.3,5.5 .The second pass(0,1->1) starts the feedforward with the concluded weights of the first pass?
