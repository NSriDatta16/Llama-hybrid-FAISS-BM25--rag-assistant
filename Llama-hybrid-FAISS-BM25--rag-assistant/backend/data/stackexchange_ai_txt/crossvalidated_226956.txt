Determine Chi Square Group Differences in multiple choice questionnaire

I'm trying to determine if there is a group difference in answering a multiple choice question. For example, I want to answer the question of, do "Change Instigators" (group A) answer "communication" as a strength more often than the group mean (average of group A, B, and C). You can select up to 2 answers, "communication" being one of 5. Here's how my data is formulated: Q: What's your strength? Strength Change Instigators GroupB GroupC Communication 300 100 122 Productivity 200 212 500 Conflict Resolution 150 157 130 Vision 216 256 233 Personnel 350 300 222 What type of analysis do I perform when I'm comparing percentages between groups within a question? Any suggestions for other types of analysis?
