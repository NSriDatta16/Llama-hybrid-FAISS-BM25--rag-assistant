The storage of your decimal can be at a higher precision than 2 digits. Since you mention, C# and Javascript, I can assume that you are using ASP.NET for your front-end. The display of the currency has to be handled in your ASP.NET code, to display it based on your user's locale/cultureinfo. For your gridviews and other display controls, in C#, you can use the string formatting option: {0:c} to display the currency with the correct symbol and 2 decimal places.
