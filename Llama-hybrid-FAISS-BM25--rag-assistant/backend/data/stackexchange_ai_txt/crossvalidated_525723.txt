Apparently, the terms are used ambiguously, but I always seen them used as that there are three (or more) sets of data: train set used for training the model, validation set for assessing the performance of the model when tuning it, and held-out test set that you use at the very end to assess the performance of the model. These names are used in Google's Machine Learning Crash Course , the Deep Learning with Python book by François Chollet, the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow book by Aurélien Géron, The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, and a number of other books. If you find this naming convention confusing, you can, as Andrew Ng, use the train/dev/test naming, where the dev set is used for dev elopment.
