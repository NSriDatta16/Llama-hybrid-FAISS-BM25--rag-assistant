Recommendations for database with R

I am using R to run simulations using time series data. I have been using arrays to store data but I need a less memory intensive solution for storing data at intermediate steps in order to document the process. I am not a programmer so I am looking for something relatively easy to setup on multiple platforms if possible (Windows, Mac, Linux). I also need to be able to directly call the database from R since learning another language is not feasible now. Ideally, I would like to be able to read and write frequently to the database in a manner similar to an array though I don't know if that is realistic. I will gladly sacrifice speed for ease of use but I am willing to work to learn open source solutions. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
