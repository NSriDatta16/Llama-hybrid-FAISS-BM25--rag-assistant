It would be nice if programming languages, markup languages, and text editors could all cooperate with each other to allow text formatting to adapt itself sensibly to fit the code. For example, if a comment associated with a line of code would be too long to fit to the right of that line, and if succeeding lines of code are shorter, allow the comment to wrap and remain to the right of those succeeding lines of code, with some sort of arrow or box to show that the continuation lines of the comment all belong to the first line of code. Unfortunately, I know of no widespread programming languages which fit well with any means of embedding markup.
