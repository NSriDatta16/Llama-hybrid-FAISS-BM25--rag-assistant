If we consider the "most Pythonic way" to be elegant and effective then: def fib(nr): return int(((1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2) ** nr / math.sqrt(5) + 0.5) wins hands down. Why use a inefficient algorithm (and if you start using memoization we can forget about the oneliner) when you can solve the problem just fine in O(1) by approximation the result with the golden ratio? Though in reality I'd obviously write it in this form: def fib(nr): ratio = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2 return int(ratio ** nr / math.sqrt(5) + 0.5) More efficient and much easier to understand.
