Is there a code coverage tool that works with manual testing?

In php, is there a tool that can generate a code coverage report without using automated unit test cases ? (basically not using phpunit or similar unit testing frameworks which do a good job generating the report but require unit testcases to be written in php!). Exactly what I am looking for, is a tool that would generate me a code coverage report based on manual testing performed by a tester.
