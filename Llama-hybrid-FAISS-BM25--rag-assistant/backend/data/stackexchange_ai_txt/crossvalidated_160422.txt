What are "rotated" and "unrotated" principal components, given that PCA always rotates the coordinates axes?

As far as I understand, principal components are obtained by rotating the coordinate axes to align them with the directions of maximum variance. Nevertheless, I keep reading about "unrotated principal components" and my statistics software (SAS) gives me varimax-rotated principal components as well as the unrotated ones. Here I am confused: when we compute principal components, the axes are already rotated; so why is there another rotation needed? And what does "unrotated principal component" mean?
