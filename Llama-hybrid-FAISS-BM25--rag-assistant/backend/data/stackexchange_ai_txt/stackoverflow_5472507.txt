How do I output a text table in Perl?

I want to output a table containing four variables, an example of the desired format is: A confusion matrix H | P | ----------------------- $var1 | $var2 | H $var3 | $var4 | P The problem I am having is that depending on the number of digits in the variables, the format changes and the various lines are offset. I know this is a complete noobie question, but I have never had to pay too much attention to the format of output before, its just one of those little things I want to get right this time. Any help at all would be great, thanks.
