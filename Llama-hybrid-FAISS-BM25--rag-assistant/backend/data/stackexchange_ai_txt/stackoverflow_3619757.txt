Using .NET/Mono on Linux to serve a high volume web service, a good idea?

We have a web service that does a fairly high volume of traffic that helps you figure out what are your preferred contacts based on the e-mails you receive. This service was initially implemented in C# /.NET in order to leverage some code we already have running on Windows hosts. This service does not uses ASP.NET but it's a simple C# service using a base HTTP Listener from .NET. The service is performing OK, but once in a while MONO will totally blocks and stop responding to any requests. The performance is OK, but not great and it seams that we spend a huge amount of time figuring the difference between the MONO CLR and the Windows CLR. I must admit, I am coming from a Java background and it seems that the ecosystem on the server side is way larger on the Java side than the MONO ecosystem on Linux. So for now, I am looking for examples and personal experiences around using Mono on Linux to server a high traffic web service.
