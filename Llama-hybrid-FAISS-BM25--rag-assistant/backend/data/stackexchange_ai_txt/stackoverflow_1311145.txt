For the sidebar: Set your image to display:block; to remove the extra space. Because of your other styles you will also have to add either clear:both; to the image as well or take away the float on your top ul (all it's doing is clearing the floated li 's, which you can do using overflow:hidden; instead). For the hover text: You will have to use separate paragraphs to get padding, but that is easy to do in WP. You don't need the extra at the end of each if you use float instead of display: .cover p { float: left; /* so they don't fill the full width */ clear: both; /* so they don't float next to each other */ color: #000; background-color: #fff; padding:5px; } Of course, I would leave the display: inline; as well anywhere you are floating. It takes care of the IE5/6 doubled float-margin bug. But that is a different issue.
