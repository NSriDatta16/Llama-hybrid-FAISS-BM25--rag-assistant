Removing 'outliers' is a good idea IF the outliers are properly described as erroneous readings, mistakes or they are known to be misleading. However, to ascribe one of those properties to the outliers requires something other than just inspection of the data. Were the three readings at each time point intended to allow assessment of whether the measurement 'worked' or are they intended simply to reduce the influence of measurement variability? If it was the former then you should be considering the known properties of the test and measurement system when deciding what causes outliers. Missing values and odd things like the decimal point without numerals may be indicative of a 'fragile' measurement or recording system that can be expected to yield outliers that are mistakes. If a four times range for repeated measurements is plausibly just a result of the underlying variability of the values or of the measurement method then do not remove them. Perhaps the median of the distribution, which is less strongly affected by outliers, will serve instead of the mean. If you have lots of data then you are in a good position to work out whether the outliers are bad values, because you can plot the distribution of the readings.
