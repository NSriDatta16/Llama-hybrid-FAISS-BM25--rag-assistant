Why are Machine Learning models called black boxes?

I was reading this blog post titled: The Financial World Wants to Open AIâ€™s Black Boxes , where the author repeatedly refer to ML models as "black boxes". A similar terminology has been used at several places when referring to ML models. Why is it so? It is not like the ML engineers don't know what goes on inside a neural net. Every layer is selected by the ML engineer knowing what activation function to use, what that type of layer does, how the error is back propagated, etc.
