To understand what is required, consider a slightly simpler problem: how much time does it take two jobs to finish? Call these jobs $X$ and $Y$, which are independent $Exp(1/10)$ random variables. What is the distribution of $T = X+Y$? The pdf of an $Exp(1/10)$ r.v. is $f(x) = \frac{1}{10}e^{\frac{-x}{10}}$, which implies that if the value of $X$ was known, say $X=x$, then the pdf for $T = X+Y$ given $X=x$ would be $g(t) = \frac{1}{10}e^{\frac{-(t-x)}{10}}$, where $t$ must now be greater than $x$. That is the same as the original distribution only shifted $x$ seconds to the right. Since we know the pdf for $X$ and the pdf for $T|X=x$, then we find the marginal distribution of $T$ by integrating/averaging over our uncertainty about $X$. In what follows, think of fixing $T$ at $t$ and taking a weighted average of the possible values of the conditional pdf $T|X=x$ where the weights are given by the pdf for $X$ over $0 $$\int_0^{t} \frac{1}{10}e^{\frac{-(t-x)}{10}} f(x) \;dx = \int_0^{t} \frac{1}{10^2}e^{\frac{-(t-x)}{10}}e^{\frac{-x}{10}}\;dx$$ $$=\frac{1}{10^2}e^{-t}\int_0^{t}\;dx$$ $$=\frac{1}{10^2}t\;e^{-\frac{t}{10}}$$ This pdf has the form of a gamma, namely $Gamma(2,1/10)$. It is not hard to see that if we iterate the procedure above to extend to the required four jobs, the power in the constant term and in the $t$ term will increment by 1 each time, so that the pdf will be $\frac{1}{10^4}t^3\;e^{-\frac{t}{10}}$, a $Gamma(4,1/10)$. Now you can integrate to find $P(t\le 60)$;
