You can either put it in a session or a viewstate in case you donot wish to keep in a storage like database or a ASP.net cache. Of course, you shall have to be careful if you keep it in session as you shall have to clean it up as soon as you go out of scope. Also, serialising/deserialising will be another angle. Can't you have some global cache or so for your app?
