You can use a neural network, support vector machine, or other machine learning construct for this. But it will not do the entire job. If you do a screen shot, you are going to be left with a very large image that you will need to find the individual characters on. You also need to deal with the fact that the camera might not be pointed straight at the text that you want to read. You will likely need to use a series of algorithms to lock onto the right parts of the image and then downsample it in a way that size becomes neutral. Here is a simple Java applet I wrote that does some of this. http://www.heatonresearch.com/articles/42/page1.html It lets you draw on a relatively large area and locks in on your char. Then it recognizes it. I am using the alphabet, but digits should be easier. The complete Java source code is included.
