Don't worry about what exactly "average" means in the question because you're given no information about how it was computed; it can only really serve as a benchmark value. You have dichotomous data. A binomial test is a better fit for this than a $z$-test. I believe the part that says "Comment on the suitability of the test" is hinting that if you were the student, there's a better way to collect the data that would allow you to conduct a more powerful test.
