If at all possible (and it looks like it from your code), using DrawImageUnscaled will be significgantly faster than DrawImage. Or if you are using the same image over and over again, create a TextureBrush and use that. The problem with GDI+, is that for the most part, it is unaccelerated. To get the lightening fast drawing speeds you really need GDI and BitBlt, which is a serious pain in the but to use with GDI+, especially if you are in Managed code (hard to tell if you are using managed C++ or straight C++). See this post for more information about graphics quickly in .net.
