Cross validation is more robust. So, in general, it is better. But, the marginal benefit you get decreases as dataset size increases. In small datasets, it's definitely suggested. On the other hand, it may not be the best choice due to computational complexity. For example, training might be very expensive, like in deep neural nets. In that case, a representative validation set is preferable over a statistical average of validation folds.
