This is your run-of-the-mill independent samples t test . # Check average values. > aggregate(ds, by=list(group=ds$factor_5), mean) group return factor_5 1 0 0.163873 0 2 1 4.636236 1 Is this difference in means statistically significant? # t test to see if difference is statistically significant. > t.test(subset(ds, ds$factor_5==0)$return, subset(ds, ds$factor_5==1)$return) Welch Two Sample t-test data: subset(ds, ds$factor_5 == 0)$return and subset(ds, ds$factor_5 == 1)$return t = -1.4439, df = 4.781, p-value = 0.211 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -12.54563 3.60090 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 0.163873 4.636236 Result: average returns are higher when factor_5 is at 1 , but there's a 21.1% chance that there's no real difference, and that this result is down to chance. (apologies for possibly non-idiomatic code - R isn't my first language, so to speak). Edit - Two additional points: With only 5 cases in each condition, your chances of finding a statistically significant difference were always going to be extremely slim. Looking at your data, it's pretty obvious that the only reason there's a difference in the mean scores is because there's one return of 15 in the 1 condition. This also means that the t test may not be appropriate, as your data isn't normally distributed, so you can run the same analysis as the following instead, yielding the same result. wilcox.test(subset(ds, ds$factor_5==0)$return, subset(ds, ds$factor_5==1)$return)
