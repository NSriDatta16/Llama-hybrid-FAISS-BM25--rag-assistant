When you say friction u, I'm not sure what you mean. Usually there is a coefficient of friction C, such that the friction F of a sliding object = C * contact force. The disk is modeled as a single object consisting of some number of points arranged in circles about the center. For simplicity, you might model the disk as a hexagon evenly filled with points, to make sure every point represents equal area. The weight w of each point is the weight of the portion of the disk that it represents. It's velocity vector is easily computed from the velocity and rotation rate of the disk. The drag force at that point is minus its weight times the coefficient of friction, times a unit vector in the direction of its velocity. If the velocity of a point becomes zero, its drag vector is also zero. You will probably need to use a tolerance about zero, else it might keep jiggling. To get the total deceleration force on the disk, sum those drag vectors. To get the angular deceleration moment, convert each drag vector to an angular moment about the center of the disk, and sum those. Factor in the mass of the disk and angular inertia, then that should give linear and angular acclerations. For integrating the equations of motion, make sure your solver can handle abrupt transitions, like when the disk stops. A simple Euler solver with really fine stepsize might be good enough.
