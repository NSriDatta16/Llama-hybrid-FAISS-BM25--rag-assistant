The momd file is the versioned equivalent of the mom file. You have two options at this point: Add a version to your existing myProj.xcdatamodel model. In Xcode select the myProj.xcdatamodel file and select Design -> Data Model -> Add Model Version from the menu in Xcode. Only use the non versioned model file. Change your supplied code to: NSString *modelPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"myProj" ofType:@"mom"]; NSURL *modelURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:modelPath]; If you create a Navigation-based application (Use Core Data for storage) from the default template in Xcode, you'll notice the model file is already versioned. For further information see: Model Versions
