Way to redefine "feed" Facebook. Give this a try, and take a look at the downloaded page echo file_get_contents('http://www.facebook.com/feeds/share_posts.php?id=207302593&viewer=207302593&key=d95b2de790&format=rss20'); It looks like Facebook is doing User-Agent sniffing, and rejecting any "browser" (in this case PHP is the browser) it doesn't think can handle its pages. That they're doing this on feeds is a little weird, but Zuckerberg works in mysterious ways. (doing it to prevent screen scraping is one thing, but feeds are implicitly meant to be read by machines) You'll want to set your user-agent string to match a browser that Facebook supports. When I need to do this I user curl to download the file (curl has a ton of options for setting http headers). If curl isn't your thing you can override PHP's default user-agent with an ini setting ini_set('user_agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3');
