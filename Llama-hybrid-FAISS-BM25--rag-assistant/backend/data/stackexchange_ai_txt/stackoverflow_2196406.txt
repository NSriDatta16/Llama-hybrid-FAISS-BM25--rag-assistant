What'a good way to store large time/value datasets?

I'm working on an application that stores a lot of quite large time/value datasets (chart data, basically values taken from a sensor every day, hour or 15 minutes for a year+). Currently we're storing them in 2 MySQL tables: a datasets table that stores the info (ID, name, etc) for a dataset, and a table containing (dataset ID, timestamp, value) triplets. This second table is already well over a million rows, and the amount of data to be stored is expected to become many times larger. The common operations such as retrieving all points for a particular dataset in a range are running quickly enough, but some other more complex operations can be painful. Is this the best way to organize the data? Is a relational database even particularly suited to this sort of thing? Or do I just need to learn to define better indexes and optimize the queries?
