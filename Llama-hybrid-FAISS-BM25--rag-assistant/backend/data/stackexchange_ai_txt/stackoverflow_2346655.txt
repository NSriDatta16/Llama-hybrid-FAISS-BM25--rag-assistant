No, C-style casts can act as reinterpret_cast s, const-cast s or static_cast s depending on the situation. This is why they are discouraged - you see a C-style cast in code and need to look for details to see what it will do. For example: const char* source; int* target = (int*)source;// - acts as const_cast and reinterpret_cast at once //int* target = retinterpret_cast source;// - won't compile - can't remove const
