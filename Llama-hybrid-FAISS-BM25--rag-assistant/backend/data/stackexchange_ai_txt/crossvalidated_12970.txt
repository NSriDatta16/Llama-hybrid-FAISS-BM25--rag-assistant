In most situations, I would have thought that dsuch a plot basically means that there is no cluster structure in the data. However, clustering in very high dimensions such as this is tricky as for the Euclidean distance metric all distances tend to the same as the number of dimensions increases. See this Wikipedia page for references to some papers on this topic. In short, it may just be the high-dimensionality of the dataset that is the problem. This is essentially "the curse of dimensionality", see this Wikipedia page as well. A paper that may be of interest is Sanguinetti, G., "Dimensionality reduction of clustered datsets", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 30 no. 3, pp. 535-540, March 2008 ( www ). Which is a bit like an unsupervised version of LDA that seeks out a low-dimensional space that emphasises the cluster structure. Perhaps you could use that as a feature extraction method before performing k-means?
