Consider $n = 10\,000$ observations from the standard Cauchy distribution, which is the same as Student's t distribution with 1 degree of freedom. The tails of this distribution are sufficiently heavy that it has no mean; the distribution is centered at its median $\eta = 0.$ A sequence of sample means $A_j = \frac 1j \sum_{i=1}^j X_i$ is not consistent for the center of the Cauchy distribution. Roughly speaking, the difficulty is that very extreme observations $X_i$ (positive or negative) occur with sufficient regularity that there is no chance for $A_j$ to converge to $\eta = 0.$ (The $A_j$ are not just slow to converge, they don't ever converge. The distribution of $A_j$ is again standard Cauchy [ proof ].) By contrast, at any one step in a continuing sampling process, about half of the observations $X_i$ will lie on either side of $\eta,$ so that the sequence $H_j$ of sample medians does converge to $\eta.$ This lack of convergence of $A_j$ and convergence of $H_j$ is illustrated by the following simulation. set.seed(2019) # for reproducibility n = 10000; x = rt(n, 1); j = 1:n a = cumsum(x)/j h = numeric(n) for (i in 1:n) { h[i] = median(x[1:i]) } par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) plot(j, a, type="l", ylim=c(-5, 5), lwd=2, main="Trace of Sample Mean") abline(h=0, col="green2") k = j[abs(x)>1000] abline(v=k, col="red", lty="dotted") plot(j, h, type="l", ylim=c(-5, 5), lwd=2, main="Trace of Sample Median") abline(h=0, col="green2") par(mfrow=c(1, 1)) Here is a list of steps at which $|X_i| > 1000.$ You can see the effect of some of these extreme observations on the running averages in the plot at left (at the vertical red dotted lines). k = j[abs(x)>1000] rbind(k, round(x[k])) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] k 291 898 1293 1602 2547 5472 6079 9158 -5440 2502 5421 -2231 1635 -2644 -10194 -3137 Consistency in important in estimation: In sampling from a Cauchy population, the sample mean of a sample of $n = 10\,000$ observations is no better for estimating the center $\eta$ than just one observation. By contrast, the consistent sample median converges to $\eta,$ so larger samples produce better estimates.
