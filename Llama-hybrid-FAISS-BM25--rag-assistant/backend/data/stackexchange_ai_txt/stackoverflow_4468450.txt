From the class file format spec : The per-class or per-interface constant pool is limited to 65535 entries by the 16-bit constant_pool_count field of the ClassFile structure (ยง4.1). This acts as an internal limit on the total complexity of a single class or interface. I believe that this implies that you cannot have more then 65535 named "things" in a single class, which would also limit the number of enum constants. If a see a switch with 2 billion cases, I'll probably kill anyone that has touched that code. Fortunately, that cannot happen: The amount of code per non-native, non-abstract method is limited to 65536 bytes by the sizes of the indices in the exception_table of the Code attribute (ยง4.7.3), in the LineNumberTable attribute (ยง4.7.8), and in the LocalVariableTable attribute (ยง4.7.9).
