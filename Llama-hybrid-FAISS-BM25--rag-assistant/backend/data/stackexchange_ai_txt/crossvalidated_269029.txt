Estimating the # of Principal components based on variance explained

I am running PCA on a dataset with dimensions 1460(n) * 307(p). Upon running PCA, I obtain the below plot of variance explained and the number of components. I am trying to estimate the number of PCs to select for my training dataset. Based on the plot below, It appears that around 75% of the variance is explained/captured by 50 PCs. So, selecting 50 PCs is a reasonable estimate. How would you interpret the below plot and estimate # of PCs to select? Thanks!
