Duplicating item from one list to another using jquery's sortable

I have a normal sortable list, and a "toolbox" from where I want to get elements into the list. So for example: item 1 item 2 I want to make it so that when you drag one of the toolbox's elements, it creates a copy of itself that can attach to the list. Also, I don't want the user to reorder the elements of the toolbox. I'm using this, but it doesn't do everything I need: $('#toolbox').sortable({ 'connectWith': '#list', });
