Yahoo Finance API like chart

I want to create a chart very similar to yahoo Finance interactive chart in a .NET application. The interactive chart on Yahoo finance is not included in their developer API. Has anyone tried to leverage their API to create a similar chart? Although the chart is very much like the one used on Yahoo, the data used for my analysis is not Stock data. So, I will not be able to call the Yahoo Url by feeding any query params. Any suggestions?
