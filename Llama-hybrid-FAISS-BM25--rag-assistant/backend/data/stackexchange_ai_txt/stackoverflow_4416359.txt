EntityManager doesn't see changes made in other transactions

I'm writing some application for GlassFish 2.1.1 (JavaEE 5, JPA 1.0, as far as I know). I have the following code in my servlet (which I mostly borrowed from some sample on the Internet): @PersistenceContext(name = "persistence/em", unitName = "pu") private EntityManager em; @Resource private UserTransaction utx; @Override protected void doPost(...) { utx.begin(); . . . perform retrieving operations on em . . . utx.rollback(); } web.xml has the following in it: persistence/em pu The problem is, the em doesn't see changes that have been made in another, outside transaction. Roughly, I make a request to my servlet from web browser, see data, perform some DML in SQL console, reload servlet page -- and it doesn't show any change. I've tried to use many combinations of em.flush , and utx.rollback , and em.joinTransaction , but it doesn't seem to do any good. Situation is complicated by me being a total newbie in JPA, so I do not have a clear understanding of how the underlying machinery works. So any help and -- more importantly -- explanations/links of what is happening there would be very appreciated. Thanks!
