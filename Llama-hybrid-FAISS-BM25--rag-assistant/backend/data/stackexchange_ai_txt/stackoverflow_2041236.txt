How to handle large database?

I am working in one real-estate website and I have large database around 250 fields in table and 15 lakhs (1.5 million) records in table. I want to give searching functionality in website so, How should I design db such that I can search property fast from these 15 lakhs records. I want to make site like http://www.redfin.com/ . is it effective all 15 lakhs records should be in one table for searching ? I don't understand how should I design the db? I am using PHP + Mysql and so I also want to ask that which storage engine(MyISAM,InnoDB etc.) preferred for this type of large database handling ? Please Help me out.
