Colorization color != the base color chosen. It's misleading, I know. But I'm confused. The image you borrowed was from my post entitled " Retrieving Aero Glass base color for opaque surface rendering ". Is this not what you want to do? I also indicated in the post the registry location in which all the color information is stored (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM) for retrieval purposes. Edited 8/26 DwmGetColorizationColor (dwmapi.dll) returns the "colorization color", which is a blend of various colors (incl. your selected base color) and shader logic to achieve the overall glass effect. All the color information you need/want can be found in the registry key noted above. The base color, the colors used in blending, and the resulting colorization color are all there. (The key above is present on Windows Vista and above.)
