I don't think that this is possible as Annotation attribute/property values must be available at compile time. Therefore, Strings cannot be externalized to a file that needs to be read in by some sort of process. I tried to find if there was something that package-info.java might be able to provide, but could not find anything. An alternative strategy for organization could be storing the queries as constants in a Class. In your entity class: @NamedQuery(name="plane.getAll", query=NamedQueries.PLANE_GET_ALL) Then define a class for your query constants: public class NamedQueries { ... public static final String PLANE_GET_ALL = "select p from Plane p"; ... }
