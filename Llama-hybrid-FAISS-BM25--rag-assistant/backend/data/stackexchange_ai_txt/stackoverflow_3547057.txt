Although it's already a bit behind schedule, Pragmatic Publishing has The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends due out in September (you can buy a pre-release pdf version now, if you prefer). PeepCode also sells four different screencasts on Rspec and Cucumber: http://peepcode.com/products/cucumber http://peepcode.com/products/rspec-basics http://peepcode.com/products/rspec-controllers-and-tools http://peepcode.com/products/rspec-mocks-and-models There are tons of blog posts and tutorials on these subjects, but things get out of date quickly, so it's hard to recommend specifics. The very recent Ruby on Rails Tutorial book uses Rspec in its testing, and it's available in editions for 2.3.8 and 3.0. It's free to read online, or you can pay for a pdf copy. http://railstutorial.org/book?version=2.3 http://railstutorial.org/book (3.0 version) Edit April 9, 2012 : There's now an entire book just on Cucumber from Pragmatic Publishing, namely The Cucumber Book . I haven't looked at it, but it is likely to be a good place to start.
