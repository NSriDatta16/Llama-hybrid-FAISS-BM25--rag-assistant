Exchangeability is not an essential feature of a hierarchical model (at least not at the observational level). It is basically a Bayesian analogue of "independent and identically distributed" from the standard literature. It is simply a way of describing what you know about the situation at hand. This is namely that "shuffling" does not alter your problem. One way I like to think of this is to consider the case where you were given $x_{j}=5$ but you were not told the value of $j$. If learning that $x_{j}=5$ would lead you to suspect particular values of $j$ more than others, then the sequence is not exchangeable. If it tells you nothing about $j$, then the sequence is exchangeable. Note that exhcangeability is "in the information" rather than "in reality" - it depends on what you know. While exchangeability is not essential in terms of the observed variables, it would probably be quite difficult to fit any model without some notion of exchangeability, because without exchangeability you basically have no justification for pooling observations together. So my guess is that your inferences will be much weaker if you don't have exchangeability somewhere in the model. For example, consider $x_{i}\sim N(\mu_{i},\sigma_{i})$ for $i=1,\dots,N$. If $x_{i}$ are completely exchangeable then this means $\mu_{i}=\mu$ and $\sigma_{i}=\sigma$. If $x_{i}$ are conditionally exchangeable given $\mu_{i}$ then this means $\sigma_{i}=\sigma$. If $x_{i}$ are conditionally exchangeable given $\sigma_{i}$ then this means $\mu_{i}=\mu$. But note that in either of these two "conditionally exchangeable" cases, the quality of inference is reduced compared to the first, because there are an extra $N$ parameters that get introduced into the problem. If we have no exchangeability, then we basically have $N$ unrelated problems. Basically exchangeability means we can make the inference $x_{i}\to \text{parameters}\to x_{j}$ for any $i$ and $j$ which are partly exchangeable
