I've released Client-side GChart 2.7 in a brand-new Google Code project (untainted by the previous rootkitting of my laptop) that you can find here: http://clientsidegchart.googlecode.com For details on the new security-related improvements I've instituted in an effort to prevent a future breach, follow the "release notes" link on the home page to the GChart 2.7 release notes. I wish it had not taken me so long to re-release. I was attempting to correct the part of the problem that was under my direct control: my deep ignorance of all things related to computer security and systems administration. I encourage you to give the re-released, better-secured and administered, Client-side GChart 2.7 a second look. John C. Gunther, Client-side GChart author
