Quicktest Pro - find first button after matching text

I want to use dynamic object recognition (descriptive programming) to find the first button labeled "Delete" that occurs after some given text (eg, the first Delete button that appears after the text "Item XYZ-123"). I have a kludgy way to do it if both the text and the button are inside a single row of a webtable, but I was hoping for a more elegant or reliable solution (hopefully one that won't rely on tables). I would prefer to avoid using the .Object property, since the documentation claims that the .Object property only returns DOM objects when you are testing within IE, and not within firefox. Thanks!
