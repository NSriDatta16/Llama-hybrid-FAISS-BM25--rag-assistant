Run function only if event default is/isn't prevented

Is there a way to run a function only if event.preventDefault() is called on an event (by another unknown function). This is for a jQuery plugin, so I don't have any knowledge of what other parts of the page might be doing. I've tried this: Event.test = Event.preventDefault; Event.preventDefault = function () { alert('Success'); this.test(); } but it doesn't work... just behaves as normal, with no errors. Conversely, I want the opposite too... to call a function only if event.preventDefault() isn't called. In effect, to add a function to the default action for an event. Any ideas? Is all this at all possible? Edit: Based on the comment, I've got a solution to the first problem: http://jsfiddle.net/nathan/VAePB/9/ . It works in Chrome (alerts function preventDefault() { [native code] } , but IE alerts undefined . So IE won't let me define Event.prototype.test , but it will let me redefine Event.prototype.preventDefault . Weird. I'm sure I can come up with a solution to the the second problem based on this one if I can just get it to work in IE.
