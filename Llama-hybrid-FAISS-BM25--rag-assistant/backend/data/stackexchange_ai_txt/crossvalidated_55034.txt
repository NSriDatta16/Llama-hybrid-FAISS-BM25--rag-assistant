How does PCA improve the accuracy of a predictive model?

I've seen in a kaggle challenge about digit recognition someone who used PCA before decision tree or other techniques. I thought it was just for compressing data but he aimed to improve his score. How can PCA improve score in this case ? Is it because there is less overfitting ?
