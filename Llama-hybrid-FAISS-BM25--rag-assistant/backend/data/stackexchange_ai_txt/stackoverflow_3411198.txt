If you aren't familiar with map/reduce and you don't care about scaling up, this is not as elegant as map/reduce, but should be sufficient for small sites: @categories_hash = Hash.new(0) current_user.recent_posts.each do |post| post.categories.each do |category| @categories_hash[category] += 1 end end
