Making div dragable after being inserted from database

Wondered if anyone could help me out with this jquery ui drag/drop issue. I have some draggable and droppable divs that clone themselves when they are dragged over to there container. I am saving the position of the div's in a database, however if I insert the exact same HTML dynamicly and reload the page the div is no longer draggable, droppable etc. I understand that its because the jQuery is no longer bound to the div...? So my question, how can I enable the dynamicly inserted div's to be draggable/droppable again? I did try and implement LiveQuery but could not get it working, how would I use .live? Here's a URL to the page (link went dead) all the drag/drop etc JS is in custom.js Any help is really appreciated Many thanks EDIT: Anyone have any ideas? I really am stuck on this one :(
