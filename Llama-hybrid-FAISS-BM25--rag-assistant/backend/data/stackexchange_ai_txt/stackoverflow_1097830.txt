How to monitor a POP, SMTP and Exchange Server for mail activity

We need to write a .Net (C#) application that monitors all mail activity through a POP, SMTP and Exchange Server (2007 and later) and essentially grab the mail for archiving into a document management system. I realise that the way to monitor each type of server would probably be different so I'd like to know what the best (most elegant and reliable) way is to achieve this. Thanks.
