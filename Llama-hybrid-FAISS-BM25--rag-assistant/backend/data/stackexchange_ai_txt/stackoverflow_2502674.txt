I agree with Vernon's answer. But i can think of a naive approach to fulfilling your requirement. Have your client webpage, poll a servlet through AJAX, that will return say, status=changed;newURL= . Use your javascript function to analyse this AJAX response, and if status=changed,, do a location.href= . Take a judicious choice on the poll interval time, based on the average expected frequency of slide show updates.
