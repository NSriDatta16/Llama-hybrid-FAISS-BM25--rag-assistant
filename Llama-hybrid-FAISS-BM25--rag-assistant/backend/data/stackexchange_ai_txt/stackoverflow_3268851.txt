Conceding defeat, I've decided to abandon the nested form and keep the accordion. So, in case anyone is interested, now I do this: %div.children_accordion - @parent.children.each do |child| %h3 %a{ :href => "#"}Header %div - form_for child do |child_form| -# etc. Which isn't a tragic alternative. In fact, it's superior to the big, all-inclusive form if I want to allow ajax posts of the object's component parts.
