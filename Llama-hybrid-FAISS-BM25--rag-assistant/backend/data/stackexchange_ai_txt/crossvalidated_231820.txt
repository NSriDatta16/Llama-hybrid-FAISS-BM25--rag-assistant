Statistical significance for a dataset of males vs. females

I have a dataset of about 100,000 individuals, each of which is assigned a score between 1 and 5. Let's assume half are male and half are female, so 50,000 each. I find that the average score for males is 3.9 whereas the average score for women is 3.6. How do I determine if gender has a statistically significant role? For reference, the scores do not follow a normal distribution. Would a chi-squared test be appropriate by comparing this to the expected case of the results being identical for males and females?
