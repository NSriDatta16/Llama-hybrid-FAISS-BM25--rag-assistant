Suppose you have a data sampled over $N$ different geographical locations. At each location you take $n$ measurements: each measurement, say, records the wind speed, which is dependent on the temperature and humidity (I have no idea about the real world, this is just for illustration purposes). The simple way (or ordinary linear regression) to proceed is to assume that the data is independent of the geographical location. In this case you just pool everything into one sample and perform OLR analysis. But if you have a hunch, that the location might have influence, you add another level of hierarchy - you assume that wind speed and humidity are dependent on geographical location. Hence, the first level of hierarchy is used to measure the variability within-source, or in each different geographical locations, and the second level takes into account the between-source variability. You can add as many hierarchies as you need. P.S. hierarchical regression, as performed within frequentist framework, is usually called multilevel regression, while within Bayesian formalism it is hierarchical regression.
