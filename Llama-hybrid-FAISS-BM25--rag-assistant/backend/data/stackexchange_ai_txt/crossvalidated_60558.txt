OLS Regression for binary outcome

When is it appropriate to use linear regression for a binary outcome? I understand that it is conventional to use logistic regression for a binary outcome because it generates a linear list of outcomes which avoids the problem of generating estimates greater than 1 or 0. However my professor advised me to use a linear model to predict my outcome. She said that it is actually quite common in Economics to do this. Does anyone know why using OLS regression could be deemed appropriate?
