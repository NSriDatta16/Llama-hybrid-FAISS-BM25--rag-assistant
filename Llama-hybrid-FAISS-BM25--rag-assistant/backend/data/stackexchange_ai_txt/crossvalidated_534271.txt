Validity of multilevel modeling to include results for multiple psychometric tests with subscales #statsnube

I have survey data for approx n = 1650 for multiple psychometric tests (all participants have completed all the tests), and about 12 outcome variables (from a PCA of a 52-question survey, e.g. medication adherence, health perceptions, etc.). The question is essentially "what psychological/psychiatric traits relate to these behaviours/beliefs" . I may decide to narrow the focus to fewer outcome variables. Because I suspect significant interaction between these variables, is it reasonable to perform multilevel regression on this? This seems like a non-standard application of the analysis, and I've pretty much self-taught myself stats over the past 6 months (I have a medical degree so i have pretty limited prior knowledge), so I'm scared I'm overlooking some major reason this would be invalid... Also, is it valid to just run a separate analysis for each outcome variable? They're not particularly correlated with eachother... most extreme pearson coefficients are .434 and -.305 The data are often slightly skew (e.g. in the OCIR, with a range of 0-72 and Any comments/suggestions (including pointing out why what I'm doing is completely wrong, or assumptions that need testing) are hugely appreciated Additional info: Looking at maybe using the Universty of Bristol's MLwiN (centre for multilevel modelling)... I am resigned to teaching myself R at some point (I have python basics), but I've mainly been using SPSS for analyses and GraphPad Prism for prettier graphs. we do not know if the participants have a psychiatric diagnosis, it was an online questionnaire, and that was not asked. Psychometric scales: Obsessiveâ€“Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) 6 OCIR subscales: obsessing, washing, checking, neutralising, ordering, hoarding Self-regulation questionnaire (SRQ) SRQ subscaless: assessing, receiving, evaluating, triggering, searching, planning, implementing Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale 2 HADS subscales (not often used as a total score): anxiety score, depression score Memory score (created by the researcher who composed the survey) (I still need to create a combined score of the two components): components 1: free recall of 30 bold words from a paragraph (score out of 30) component 2: working memory test score (recall an increasing number of a series of characters) (score out of 8) Turns out you can't solve all stats with ANOVAs :(
