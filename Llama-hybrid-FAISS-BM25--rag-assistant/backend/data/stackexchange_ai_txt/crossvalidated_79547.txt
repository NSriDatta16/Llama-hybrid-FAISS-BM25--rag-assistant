Metropolis algorithm, what is the target distribution and how to compose it?

When we do Metropolis sampling or MCMC, we need a target distribution $P_{target}(\theta)$, and a proposal distribution $P_{proposal}(\theta)$, then a value $\theta_i$ is generated via $P_{proposal}(\theta)$, we need to compute the probability whether to accept or reject this $\theta_i$ via $P_{target}(\theta)$, right? My problem is, we should know $P_{target}(\theta)$ before we doing this Metropolis process, right? Then what is this target distribution, does it have to do with my prior belief of $\theta$? If I've already known it, why bother doing this Metropolis sampling, can't we just use grid approximation? As I read in the book, it takes the product of the likelihood and prior of $\theta$ as the target distribution, why? Different prior belief will result into different target distribution, does it mean we don't have a fixed desired target distribution?
