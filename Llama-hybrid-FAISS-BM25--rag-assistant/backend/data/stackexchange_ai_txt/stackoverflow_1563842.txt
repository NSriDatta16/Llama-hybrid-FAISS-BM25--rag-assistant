If a list of values is tied closely to application logic, I generally don't have a problem storing them with the application, as enums or similar. You'll have to update your application with new logic regardless, and storing the values in a database just increases the chances that someone will mistakenly add or remove a value without updating that logic. The example you've given ("Mexican", "American", "Italian"), though, is a prime candidate for storage in a database. This list seems likely to change frequently, and nothing in the application code needs to be updated to handle new values. If you decide to handle Elbonian food, all you need to do is update the database and you're done. No reason to force an application update if you don't need to.
