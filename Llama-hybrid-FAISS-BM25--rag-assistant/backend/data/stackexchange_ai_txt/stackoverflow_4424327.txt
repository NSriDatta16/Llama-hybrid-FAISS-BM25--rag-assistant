Using headScript view helper for and scripts

I've got some scripts I'd like to add to the end of the of the page, and some that I need to have in the . I'm wondering if there's a more elegant way to add certain scripts to the and certain in the using a segment or something like that. Say I have two scripts that are going to go in the body: $this->view->headScript()->prependFile($assetUrl . "/js/jquery.min.js"); $this->view->headScript()->appendFile($assetUrl . "/js/application.js"); And I want this one in the instead: $this->view->headScript()->prependFile($assetUrl . "/js/modernizr.min.js"); Calling $this->headScript(); outputs all three in both cases. Is there a way to group scripts? I could just paste the HTML snippet manually, but I'd like to have it in code because I switch to minified versions of the javascript if the site is running in the production environment.
