How to prove non correlation (orthogonality)?

How can I check the orthogonality of one variable to any single and any combination of other variables? Suppose you have 10 variables (called A to J) and you want to prove that variable A is not correlated with any single and any combination of variables B to J. One option would be to measure the "direct" correlation between A and each of the nine variables (B to J) via for example Spearman rho. However this approach would not look for combinations. For example, if A = B x C, then A will result with a very low rho to both B and C even if it is exactly their simple combination. Maybe I can use PCA but I am not sure. Help!
