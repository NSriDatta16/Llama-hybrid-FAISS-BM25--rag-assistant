Should OOB (Out Of Bag) error be less than a Test set error in Random Forests?

I am using the book, "An introduction to statistical learning with applications in R" and reading the section on using OOB to estimate the model error for Random Forests. The graph seems to suggest that the OOB error will be a lot lower than the test-set error. However I cannot find any rationale for this. To the best of my understanding, it should be equal to the test error. Why are these 2 errors different?
