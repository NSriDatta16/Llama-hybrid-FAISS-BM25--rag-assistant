One of the independent variables in a logistic regression is the ratio of other two inputs. Is this okay?

Suppose that I have a logistic regression with continuous independent variables $a$,$b$, and $c$. In my logistic regression, $c = \frac{a}{b}$. Is it all right to include variable $c$ in the logistic regression? These independent variables are financial ratios. Output of logistic regression using SPSS : EXP(coef) a 4.937568 b 1223.406 c 0.30749 constant 2.45432 I think that this holds: EXP(coef) value of variable c is lower than 1 (negative effect on dependent variable-odd ratio) because EXP(coef) value for b is much higher than a . (All coefficients are statistically significant at 5%) Is this reasoning correct?
