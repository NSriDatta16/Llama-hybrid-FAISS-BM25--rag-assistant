Predictive model based on Principal Components when new data has different variables

I built a logistic regression model to classify a corpus of documents. The dependent variable is the type of document (eg A or B) while the dependent variables, because of dimensionality, are the first 2 components obtained by performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (or a Single Value Decomposition (SVD)) on the columns (terms) of the document/term matrix. The question is: on a new corpus of documents (and therefore a different document/terms matrix), is it methodologically correct to use the same model if the first 2 components are obtained from a different set of variables (terms)?
