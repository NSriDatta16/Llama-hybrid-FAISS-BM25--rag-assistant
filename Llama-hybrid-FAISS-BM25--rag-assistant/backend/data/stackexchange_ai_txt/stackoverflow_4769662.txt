I'm working with Pyramid, and I was trying to do the same thing. After some time I came up with this solution. from cStringIO import StringIO from cgi import FieldStorage fs = FieldStorage(fp=request['wsgi.input'], environ=request) f = StringIO(fs.value) im = Image.open(f) I'm not sure if it's the "right" one, but it seems to work.
