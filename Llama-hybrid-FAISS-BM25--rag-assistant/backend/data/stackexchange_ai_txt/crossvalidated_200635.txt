If two traits have known correlation, can you predict probability they'll “align” for a random pair? It depends on which population correlation you look at. For the Pearson correlation you mention ($\rho$), the answer is "no", at least not without additional assumptions. (RobertF's answer is correct) If instead you know the population Kendall correlation ( Kendall's tau , here denoted $\tau_K$) in a continuous bivariate distribution then the answer is actually yes. The population Kendall correlation is the difference between the probability of a concordant pair and the probability of a discordant pair: $$\tau_K = p_C-p_D$$ (the sample Kendall correlation is similarly the difference in sample proportions of concordant and discordant pairs). Since in continuous bivariate populations $p_C+p_D=1$, if you know $\tau_K$ you can calculate $p_C$: $\tau_K = p_C-p_D$ $ = p_C-(1-p_C)$ $ = 2p_C-1$ Hence $p_C = \frac12(\tau_K+1)$, a nice simple result. While $\tau_K$ determines the probability you ask for (at least in the continuous case), the relationship between $\rho$ and $\tau_K$ depends on the structure of the bivariate relationship between the variables (i.e. the copula ). If you assume bivariate normality, then you could work out the (nonlinear) connection between $\tau_K$ and $\rho$. In fact this is a well-known result; we have: $$\tau_K = \frac{2}{\pi}\arcsin(\rho)$$ - see sec 5.3.2 of Embrechts et al. (2005) [1], which result can also be found in various places -- for example in Meyer (2009) [2]. So in that case $$p_C = \frac{\arcsin(\rho)}{\pi}+\frac12\,.$$ (However, an assumption of bivariate normality would seem dubious for BMI and blood pressure) This relationship between $\tau_K$ and $\rho$ actually holds for elliptical distributions more generally. See for example Lindskog, McNeil, & Schmock (2003)[3]. However, again, this assumption for BMI and blood pressure may be dubious -- for example, both measures in practice tend to be right-skew.
