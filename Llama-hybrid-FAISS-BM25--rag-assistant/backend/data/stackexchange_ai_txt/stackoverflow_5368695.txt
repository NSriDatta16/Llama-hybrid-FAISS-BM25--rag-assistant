UI Automation has nearly nothing to do with your Application in fact you can even run automation for apps that aren't yours. Indeed you have to know the accessibility label for each element. Therefore it should call the normal UIScrollViewDelegate which contains: Responding to Scrolling and Dragging – scrollViewDidScroll: – scrollViewWillBeginDragging: – scrollViewDidEndDragging:willDecelerate: – scrollViewShouldScrollToTop: – scrollViewDidScrollToTop: – scrollViewWillBeginDecelerating: – scrollViewDidEndDecelerating: Managing Zooming – viewForZoomingInScrollView: – scrollViewWillBeginZooming:withView: – scrollViewDidEndZooming:withView:atScale: – scrollViewDidZoom: Responding to Scrolling Animations – scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: simply implement all into your application and NSLog() which one gets called. Not sure if that's what you wanted to know.
