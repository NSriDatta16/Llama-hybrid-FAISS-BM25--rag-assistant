Handling touchesBegan in UITableViewCell disables didSelectRowAtIndexPath

I'm implementing swipe gestures in my customtableviewcell control and so I hvae to implement touchesBegan event. I'm able to implement the swipes, but unfortunately, because the touchesBegan gets handled in the customcell, i'm not getting a didSelectRowAtIndexPath message on the tablecontroller. If the touchesBegan method is disabled, it works. How should this be handled? I want the touch event to bubble up the responder chain after the touchesBegan is processed. How can I do this? Thanks.
