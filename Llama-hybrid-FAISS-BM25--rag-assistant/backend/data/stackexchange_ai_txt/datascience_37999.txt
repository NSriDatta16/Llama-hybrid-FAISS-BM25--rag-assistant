Why does a machine learning algorithm need a bias?

The first line of section 2.7.3 in Mitchell's Machine Learning is: "A Learner that makes no prior assumptions regarding the identity of the target concept has no rational basis for classifying any unseen instances." Why is it that a machine learning algorithm needs a bias? Can someone please help me understand this, with examples perhaps?
