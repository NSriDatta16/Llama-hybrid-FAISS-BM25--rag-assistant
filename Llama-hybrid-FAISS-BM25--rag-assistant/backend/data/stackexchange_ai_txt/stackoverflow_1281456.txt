How do I implement dispatch tables in Perl?

I need to write a storage related app in Perl. The app needs to upload files from the local machine to some other storage nodes. Currently, the uploading method is FTP, but in the future it may be bittorrent or some unknown super-file-transferring method. For every file that needs to be uploaded, there is a configuration file which defines the file name, the storage node which the file will be uploaded to and what transferring method should be used during the uploading. Of course, I can use the following method to solve my problem: { if ( $trans_type == "ftp" ) { ###FTP the FILE} if ( $trans_type == "bit" ) { ###BIT the FILE} ### etc ### } But even with my basic OO knowledge learned in school, I still feel that this is not a good design. (The question title might be a little bit misleading. If you think my problem can solved gracefully with a non-OO solution, it's quite OK for me. Actually it will be better, since I have limited OO knowledge.) So could you guys give me some advice in general? Of course, if you provide some sample code as well, this will be a great help.
