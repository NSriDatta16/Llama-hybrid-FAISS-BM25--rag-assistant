Randomized Response, calculating probability

I have a problem with randomized response method when calculating the probability of critical attribute. For any of you who are not familiar with the method, you can check it here, Wikipedia Entry for Randomized Response . Briefly, the method encourages people being surveyed on a critical question to answer honestly. To achieve this, there are two questions whose answers are opposite to each other and respondents choose the first or second question with a probability of p and 1-p , respectively. The interviewer does not know which question is answered by the respondent, so the privacy of the respondent is preserved. As far as I know, this method is first studied by Warner . As you can imagine, the proportion of "yes" answers from the survey is composed (used conventions from Wikipedia) YA = p*EP + (1-p)*(1-EP) EP= (YA + p - 1) / (2*p-1) YA: yes answers from survey, EP: proportion of true yes answers p: probability of answering critical questions In my tests, for some cases the proportion of true yes answers is greater than 1. Assume that, I get 55 yes answers out of 160 survey respondents and p is 0.4. p=0.4 YA=0.34375 (55 out of 160) EP= (YA + p - 1) / (2*p-1) EP=(0.34375 + 0.4 - 1) /(2*0.4 - 1) EP=(-0.25625)/(-0.2)=1.28125 Here, EP is greater than 1 which is not reasonable for a survey result because it means that more than survey respondents having such an attribute?(Am I wrong?). Is this result possible in this technique? Am I missing something? I wonder if anyone has any experience in this method and or any idea? How can I apply this method in order to get reasonable proportions for EP (0 I will appreciate your comments and suggestions.
