A Bayesian approach might be fine, but doesn't appear necessary. These are just binomial variables. Inside your probability statements (e.g., "$P(\rm result = player1\ win)=0.4$") is a statement that can be converted into $\rm TRUE$ or $\rm FALSE$ for each of the events in your dataset. So you can get the proportion true and test it against your null hypothesis with a binomial test .
