Submitting a form requires the page to re-post, so you should be able to get the parameters from the posted array directly. If you don't want to redraw the entire page, you'll want to use Javascript to read the input fields and change the second block directly. More detail on what the two blocks are supposed to do would be helpful. Also, you're likely to get more responses if you accept answers to questions that you post. You have 8 questions and no accepted answers right now, which will discourage people from answering. Thanks, Joe It's still not clear whether you want to update w/ Javascript or after posting the page. If Javascript, do something like this: var boxval = $("#elem1_id").val(); $("#elem2").append(boxval); If posting, set some name for the input and do this in box two's class: public function __construct() { parent::__construct(); $this->setPostedValue($this->getRequest()->getParam('box1name')); } And in your template: getPostedValue(); ?>
