Unfortunately JavaScript's RegExp has no support for Unicode character classes; \w only applies to ASCII characters (modulo some browser bugs). You can use Unicode characters in groups, though, so you can do it if you can isolate each set of characters you are interested in as a range. eg.: var r= new RegExp( '[A-Za-z0-9_\]+|'+ // ASCII letters (no accents) '[\u3040-\u309F]+|'+ // Hiragana '[\u30A0-\u30FF]+|'+ // Katakana '[\u4E00-\u9FFF\uF900-\uFAFF\u3400-\u4DBF]', // Single CJK ideographs 'g'); var nwords= str.match(r).length; (This attempts to give a more realistic count of ‘words’ for Japanese, counting each run of one type of kana as a word. That's still not right, of course, but it's probably closer than treating each syllable as one word.) Obviously there are many more characters that would have to be accounted for if you wanted to ‘do it properly’. Let's hope you don't have characters outside the basic multilingual plane, for one!
