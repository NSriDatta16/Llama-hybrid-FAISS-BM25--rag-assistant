I'm not sure where you have the idea that you must LGPL your app. From Wikipedia : The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter can be linked to (in the case of a library, 'used by') a non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is free software or proprietary software. 1 This non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any chosen terms if it is not a derivative work. From the LGPL license : You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. That says that you merely need to provide access to the source code of the library if it's distributed in binary form. Just make sure you're not creating a derivative work and instead are merely linking to the lib. If you're not content with LGPL, then you could always purchase a license from Novell. From http://www.mono-project.com/License : Mono is available to be licensed commercially if the LGPL/GPL/X11 combination is not suitable for you. Mono Tools for Visual Studio Ultimate Edition includes a commercial license to redistribute Mono under non-LGPL terms on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X PCs for products with volumes under 100,000 and revenues under $2M annually. If your organization intends to redistribute software which embeds or bundles Mono, but is unable to comply with the terms of GNU LGPL v2, the Ultimate Edition may be right for you.
