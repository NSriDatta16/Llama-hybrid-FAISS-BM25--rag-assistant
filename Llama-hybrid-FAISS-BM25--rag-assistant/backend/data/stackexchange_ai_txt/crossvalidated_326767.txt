While I have no complete picture of the problem at hand, I believe the following comments may be of help: It is reasonable to assume a roughly normal distributed shape for the marks, at least if: (a) the sample sizes are large enough to allow an assessment by eye that supports this assumption, or at least does not glaringly contradict it, and (b) if some outliers are ignored. You write: "While I think applying a linear curve would have been best..." An affine-linear transformation actually blends very well with a normal distribution, since if X is normally distributed, then so is Y=a*X+b for any constants a,b. Here the (random) exam mark is modeled by X, and the "adjusted" mark by Y. So in this application we need a>0. The standard deviation of Y is then a times the standard deviation of X. Since Y does not represent the raw data, its mean and standard deviation can be changed freely via the choice of the above affine-linear transformation. If your colleague only used a (that is, if she took b=0) to transform the data, it would not raise the average mark and thus not remedy the problem of poor overall performance; it would merely widen the gap between strongest and weakest results (if a>1). If the marks were to be raised by changing the constant b, this may necessitate reducing one or more top marks to below the maximum of 100.
