Why can negatively correlated variables have similar beta-coeficients in logistic regression?

I try to predict whether households use a certain service ( TRUE or FALSE ) based on various variables, using logistic (LASSO) regression. Among many others, I have the variables percentage man and percentage woman , which have a -.85 Pearson's correlation coefficient with each other. However, when I run the logistic regression they both have a beta-coefficient of respectively 3.34 and 3.16, which puts them both in the top 40 of most predictive variables among the 150 variables I use. How can they both be a positive predictor for the label when they are so negatively correlated with each other? EDIT: some extra info that might be of interest: percentage man correlates with the outcome variable by a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.041, and percentage woman by -0.045
