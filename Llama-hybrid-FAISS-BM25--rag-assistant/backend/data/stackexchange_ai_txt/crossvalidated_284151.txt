test error and correlation

In my machine learning textbook, the most common way after applying a ML algorithm to a training set and test set is to compute the mean square error between your predictions and the response variable in the test set (in the case of regression). I was wondering, as an alternative, can one measure the correlation (or some similarity measure) between the test set response variable and the predicted set to gauge the accuracy of the model?
