What is the difference between category/category_id/item_id and category?category_id={}&item_id={} in REST?

I just began looking at REST and was wondering what the basic difference between the two representations was. The first one looks pretty nice to me and the second one has to pass some attribute values but the underlying logic seems to be boiling to almost the same thing (I could be mistaken though) http://url/category/category_id/item_id AND http://url/category?category_id={12}&item_id={12334}
