I agree with gabriel1836. However, an added benefit would be that you could for a time run a hybrid system for a time since you aren't going to convert 14 millions documents from your proprietary system to you home grown system overnight. Also, I would strongly encourage you to store the documents outside of a database. Store them on a file system (local, SAN, NAS it doesn't matter) and store pointers to the documents in the database. I'd love to know what document management system you are using now. Also, don't underestimate the effort of replacing the capture (scanning and importing) provided by the proprietary system.
