C# control to handle drag drop controls

HI, I would like to make a control which look like a gantt charts or a audio sequencer... But i don't know if i can use a datagrid for that. In my mind, one of the grid column would be a "canvas" where i can drop controls and /or drag them to move inside... It doesn't seem possible with native winform datagridview ... but i 've devexpress grid which is more powerfull (but i don't know if it can set canvas for column type) One hard part is how to manage the width of the column to feel like it is infinite (no limit) .. is it possible with native control ?? ("i wonder if wpf won't be better for that...")
