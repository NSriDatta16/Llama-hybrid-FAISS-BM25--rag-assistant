How to analyze Level 2 outcome variable when Level 1 parameters of the same person are drastically different

I have a dataset with eye measurements (retinal thicknesses) of 250 participants (500 eyes). This data is cross sectional. I am trying to build a model where the eye measurements can predict the brain volume of a participant. The eye measurements are a level 1 predictor (2 measurements per person), and the brain volume are a level 2 outcome (one per person). The recommended analysis is to average out the eye measurements, aggregating them to a level 2 variable (one averaged eye measurement per person). However, I expect the eyes on one person to vary dramatically in measurement because of history of inflammation (Right eye may be much thicker/inflammed than left eye). How do I account for this in the model? Would I need to build a multi-level model? Unsure how to do so if it is a level 2 outcome and I get convergence issues with multilevel models. ID Eye EyeThickness BrainVolume 001 L 134 45 001 R 456 45 002 L 102 56 002 R 521 56 003 L 453 49 003 R 162 49 Brain Volume, being a level 2 outcome, has the same value per row of Eye thickness, so that even if I tell the model to convey a random slope by ID, I get convergence issues. I am using R. Any help is appreciated.
