Improvement on flag files and data files?

I have a existing project (non-web), with multiple components/programs running on different machines. The programs use flag files e.g. "xxx.request" "xxx.done" to signal each other. And also data files are created and put in a particular directory and passed to another program to process. The data files and flag files are all in a shared storage. The pros of this approach is that it is really easy to implement. But I feel that this is not good in the long run. What other alternatives do I have, so that I can make substantial improvement.
