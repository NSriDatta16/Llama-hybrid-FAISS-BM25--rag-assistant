display lookup data as text in asp.net gridview with microsoft access backend

i am facing a boring issue when i have to present lookup table data (with MS Access backend) in an ASP.net page the main table Employees that the asp.net page will show its data includes one field main.gender with type "Integer" which is linked to the lookup table gender if the table is linked to gridview, then the field in question will display "1" or "2" i need to display "male" and "female" i figured out two ways to solve this issue but i dont think any of them is the best thing to do first way: -convert the gridview field gender to template field, replace the label in edit template with dropdownlist linked to the lookup table and display gender as text -make the DDL enabled=false to be "read only" -problem is that DDL show dimmed text second way: to make a select query replacing Employee.gender(integer) with gender.gender(text) this way is MUCH SLOWER in data retrieval could anyone please help me find a way to display text with a more "professional" way
