There may be ways to trick a specific JVM into doing what you want, but these would probably be fragile, complicated and most likely very specific to the JVM, its version, OS it runs on etc. In other words, wasted effort. So without knowing more about your problem, I don't think anyone will be able to help. There certainly is no way to do it in Java in general, at most on a specific JVM. To suggest an alternative: If you really need to store data in contiguous memory, why not do it in a small C library and call that via JNI?
