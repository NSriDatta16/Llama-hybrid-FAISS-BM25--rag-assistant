I've never done CLI within PowerShell before, but I have executed some PowerShell goodness within a .NET application before. Here's something that might help. This Channel9 episode contains relevant details for running PowerShell 2.0 commands in a .NET application (which is a lot easier than 1.0): http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/bruceky/How-to-Embedding-PowerShell-Within-a-C-Application/ (Note that the process does not include using System.Diagnostics.Process to invoke the commands while manipulating the process' standard input and output stream. Any attempts I made down that road were met with frustration and failure.)
