If it's just between those two then you definitely want to go with the former, since the latter has that nasty asymptote towards infinity as the difference goes to zero. (You might not actually see the asymptotic behavior if your measures are in whole numbers, but looking at the limit shows why it's almost certainly a bad measure.) Not mentioned, perhaps because it's irrelevant in this case, is controlling for population mean and nonlinearities in the scoring system. For example, rather than normalize by an individual's score you may want to normalize by the average score or some reference score. And if this is an I.Q.-type (i.e., normally-distributed) score than it's far more significant to go from a tail 300 to 308 than it is to go from, say, 260 to 268.
