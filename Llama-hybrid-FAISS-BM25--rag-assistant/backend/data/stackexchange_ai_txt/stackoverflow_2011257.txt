Get XmlNode Open Tag with Attributes

Is it possible to get the open tag from a XmlNode with all attributes, namespace, etc? eg. test I would like to retrieve the entire opening tag, exactly as retrieved from the original XML document if possible, from the XmlNode and later the closing tag. Both as strings. Basically XmlNode.OuterXml without the child nodes. EDIT To elaborate, XmlNode.OuterXml on a node that was created with the XML above would return the entire XML fragment, including child nodes as a single string. XmlNode.InnerXml on that same fragment would return the child nodes but not the parent node, again as a single string. But I need the opening tag for the XML fragment without the children nodes. And without building it using the XmlAttribute array, LocalName, Namespace, etc. This is C# 3.5 Thanks
