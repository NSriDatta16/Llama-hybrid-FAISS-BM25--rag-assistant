About "Flow Network based Generative Models for Non-Iterative Diverse Candidate Generation"ï¼Ÿ

I am reading the Yoshua Bengio et al, Flow Network based Generative Models for Non-Iterative Diverse Candidate Generation. After read this paper, I wonder how to establish a GFlowNet if I don't know all the States? That is, I only have goals, such as maximum likelihood estimation or some generation models similar to MCMC. How can I initialize the GFlowNet nodes when I don't know all the states in advance?
