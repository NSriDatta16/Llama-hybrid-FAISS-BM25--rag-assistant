jquery / javascript setting width fails

I have encountered this problem: Depending on numbers from I want to create a bar chart. Interestingly it works very well in IE8 set on quirks mode, but fails everywhere else. I cannot really say where the error is and I hope that someone here can help me. I am using jQuery, but using getElementById() and element.style.width = Somevalue (i.e. without jQuery) did not work either :( [Edit: Full example link removed; the pastie expired.] Basically: function calculateField(fieldname){ value = $("#input_" + fieldname).val(); fancyMagic(); value = 6 * value; // for testing $("#subtotal_" + fieldname).html(value); updateDiagram(); } function updateDiagram(){ // gather required into, maxwidth, maxval, etc... // fetch 'normal' bar var target = $("#animatebar_1"); var width = maxwidth * (value / maxval); // set width to proper width target.width(width); // like for avg bar var avgtarget = $("#avgbar_1"); var avgwidth = maxwidth * (averagevalue / maxval); avgtarget.width(avgwidth); } I tried all of FF, IE8 in various settings and Opera and it simply doesn't work. The bar's width is set to zero immediately after. IE8 quirks mode works, interestingly. I am pretty sure it's just me being dumb, but I will appreciate help with this. I also tried to use .css() to change the size, but it did not work either. Thank you muchly in advance.
