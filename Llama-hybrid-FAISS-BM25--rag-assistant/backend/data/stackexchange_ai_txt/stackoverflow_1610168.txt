Downloading files with PHP - Only downloading one at a time!

I have a PHP file that serves up a file, but the problem is that no matter what browser is being used, if you click on 2 links that go to 2 separate files, the second download doesn't start until the first one is complete! Any ideas? Download Code header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream'); header('Content-Description: File Transfer'); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.basename($filename).'"'); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); header('Expires: 0'); header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0'); header('Pragma: public'); header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($fullpath)); readfile($fullpath); Example Links Link 1: download.php?downloadfile=1 Link 2: download.php?downloadfile=2
