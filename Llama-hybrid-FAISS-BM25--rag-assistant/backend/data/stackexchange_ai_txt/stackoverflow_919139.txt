It's not really possible to transplant a Groups hierarchy intact from one project to another. Some suggested approaches: If the files you want to bring across are the vast majority of the project, just clone the project and delete everything that's not the files you want to copy. If it's a lot of files in a small number of groups, then set up the groups in the new project, and drag-copy the files from the old project groups into the new project groups Write an AppleScript to move the hierarchy across with a recursive-descent algorithm ◆◆ Open both project.pbxproj files as text files, and carefully copy the File References and Group References from one to another.
