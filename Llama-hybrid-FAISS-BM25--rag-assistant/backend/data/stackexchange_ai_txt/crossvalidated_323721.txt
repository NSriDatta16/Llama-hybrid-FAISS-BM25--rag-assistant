Can I take a mean of a set of means?

I have heard that takes mean of means or averages of averages is bad, however I don't exactly understand why. For example, in my case I have mean sales per store for 10 stores. Why is it bad for me to take the mean of the mean sales per store (creating the mean store sales for the entire company)?
