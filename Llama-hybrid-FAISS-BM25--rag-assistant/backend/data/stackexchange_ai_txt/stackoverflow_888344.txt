Include Search Paths in TeamCity build Configurations

Normally when a Developer compiles a certain mixed C++/C# solution locally on their machine at our company, they employ the use of a .vssettings configuration file. One of the things included in this config file is reference to various directory paths for Lib and Include files. However, our buildAgent machines (using TeamCity) are set up to be sterile, and have the bare minimum installed on them required to build any given solution/project. This means the above exampled mixed C++/C# project wont have access to the IDE's configuration where things like include search paths were set. TC accounts for this by allowing you to set all sorts of variables for any given buildConfiguration (or even by buildAgent).... But how do I get an Include search path to WORK in TC? I'm copying down from Source Control (Perforce) a copy local of what I want Included (1) , and then trying to define an Environment Variable (2) -- and yet TC fails the build (3) . I'm sure I have something configured wrong, but for the life of me cant figure out what! Any help would be most appreciated, blong (1) VSC Client Mapping - Perforce //depot/OpenSource/Boost-1.33.0/boost/... //team-city-agent/OpenSource/boost/... (2) buildConfig Environment Variable definition env.Include = %system.teamcity.build.checkoutDir%\OpenSource (3) TC build log snippet [16:57:39]: [Project "xxx.sln" (Build target(s)):] e:\buildagent\work\ef1853a454da9d94\xxx\rowsbase.cpp(5, 0): error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'boost/dynamic_bitset.hpp': No such file or directory
