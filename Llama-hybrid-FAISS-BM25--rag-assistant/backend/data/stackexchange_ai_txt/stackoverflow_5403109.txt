phpmyadmin convert myisam to innodb

Hey, so I have recently become aware that in order to do foreign key relationships, I need to convert my tables over to innodb. I was wanting to do this in phpmyadmin and found the option for 'storage engine (type)' However my dropdown of options is limited to: MyISAM , MEMORY , and MRG_MYISAM Would anyone be able to explain why this is? apache 2.0 phpmyadmin 3.3.10 mysql 5.0.67 php 5.2.2 Thanks!
