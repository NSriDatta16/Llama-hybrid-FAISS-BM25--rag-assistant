Very late but I think the real answer is more historical. Historically, deep learning refers to networks that use backpropagation in contrast to a lot of other types of neural network (Kohonen, mono-layer perceptron, oscillatory network, chaotic network, etc., etc.) that are a lot of research branches. When deep learning appears, before being the well-known hype terms used today, it was just a branch among the other and its specificity was to use backpropagation (in fact, it is its only specificity). When CNN appears, due to the fact that it also uses backpropagation, it was seen as an extension of the deep learning with flavours. The fact that there are in the same family can also be seen through the fact that it is common to meld both methods.
