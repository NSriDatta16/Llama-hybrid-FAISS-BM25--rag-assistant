IANAL, however IMHO: PHP - no issues, it has its own license which specifically allows you to sell code written in PHP jQuery - no issues. It is offfered under both the MIT and GPLv2 licence. If it was GPLv2 only, then you would be in breach of copyright by selling the code you write while retaining copyright but I believe that the MIT licence permits this. LGPL plugin - no issues, the LGPL licence is specifically designed to accomodate this business model. Your concerns are totally unfounded. Its worth noting that in all the above cases (AFAIK) the products are only offered as open-source (OK, so you can buy packaged versions of PHP from Zend). However although technically free from licensing constraint for your purposes, I would recommend you consider the moral aspect of how you have benefited from these and consider a donation to one or more of the projects or one of the umbrella organisations which fund open-source software. IMHO, the use of MySQL however, in the context you describe would clearly undermine the terms of their licensing. There are a number of solutions to resolve this including paying for a license releasing your code as GPL writing your code to be DBMS independent then requiring the client to perform installation / integration I think there are some very serious issues around the terms covering your client's and your responsibilities - while I think its a good thing all round that the client owns a non-exclusive copyright on the delivered code, the part about "direct competitors" might be rather difficult to define - and would certainly need to be constrained in terms of them being competitors between the time of approach and contract.
