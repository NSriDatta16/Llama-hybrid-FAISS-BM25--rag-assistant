What should you do with attributes that predictive in an interaction?

I am trying to predict results of football games. Some of our attributes only give meaning for a prediction only when they are considered in interaction with another attribute. To illustrate, a team with an average possession of 48.6 has much higher possession than some teams and much lower than others. Should we modify the features in such a way that we would use the difference between the two teams, instead of two values? On the other hand some algorithms might be good at finding this interactions?
