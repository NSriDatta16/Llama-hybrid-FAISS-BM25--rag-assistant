Normal distributed random variables with constraint?

Consider $n$ random variables $X_i$ with $i=1,2,...,n$ , each drawing values from identical normal distributions with mean $\mu=0$ and standard deviation $\sigma=const.$ so that expectation values are $\langle X_i\rangle=0$ and $\langle X_i^2\rangle=const.$ Is there a way to modify these distributions to additionally enforce $$\sum_{i=1}^nX_i=0$$ not just on average, but for each set of elements drawn? How can one generate and parameterize explicit distribution functions to numerically produce such sets of elements? Naively, I suppose one could generate elements from the original distribution without the extra constraint and project to the subset of elements that satisfies the additional constraint... But that seems a bit unsatisfactory. Any analytical way to incorporate the constraint?
