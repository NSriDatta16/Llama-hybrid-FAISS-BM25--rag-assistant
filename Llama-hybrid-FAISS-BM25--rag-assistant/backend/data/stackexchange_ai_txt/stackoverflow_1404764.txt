That line is invalid as has been mentioned before. The program that thinks it's okay is probably using it's own custom XML parser which will just ignore these invalid attributes. It makes me have doubts about the programming qualities of the people who created that program. It just seems to me that they're just writing this XML as text instead through an XML-DOM mechanism. Still, that should be okay but unfortunately, their code has a bug. Most -if not all- XML editors, parsers and transformers will validate the XML before it's processed. So unfortunately there's no good solution to fix this problem from within the XSLT file. Using a RegEx, you could remove the invalid attributes or make them valid by appending ="" to them, but there's no way to do this before the XSLT will validate the XML. To solve this, the program needs to be changed to generate valid XML. Because right now, this could be considered a very serious bug. (Unless the program just uses this fake XML for internal purposes.)
