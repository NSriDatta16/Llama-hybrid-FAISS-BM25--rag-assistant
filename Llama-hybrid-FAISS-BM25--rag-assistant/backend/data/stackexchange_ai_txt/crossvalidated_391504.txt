Is bagging involved in the split of node of a tree of a Random Forest?

I know that using Bagging method in a RF, implies that the subset we give to the root node of each tree, has randomly selected Features and Attributes. I also know that during the split of a node in a RF we split only by feature selection, but does Bagging has to do anything with the process of splitting a node. Or does its responsibility end in the Feature, Attribute selection for the subset of a single tree?
