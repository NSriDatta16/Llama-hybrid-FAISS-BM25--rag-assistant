There is a predictor effects graphics gallery by Fox and Weisberg that has extensive explanations and examples of how predictoreffects works. In particular, section 1.3 says: Suppose that you select a focal predictor for which you want to draw a predictor effect plot. The predictorEffect() function divides the predictors in a model formula into three groups: The focal predictor. The conditioning group, consisting of all predictors with at least one interaction in common with the focal predictor. The fixed group, consisting of all other predictors, that is, those with no interactions in common with the focal predictor. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume for the moment that all of the fixed predictors are numeric. The predictors in the fixed group are all evaluated at typical values, usually their means, effectively averaging out the influence of these predictors on the fitted value. Fitted values are computed for all combinations of levels of the focal predictor and the predictors in the conditioning group, with each numeric predictor in the conditioning group replaced by a few discrete values spanning the range of the predictor, for example, replacing years of education by a discrete variable with the values 8, 12, and 16 years. and goes on from there to parts that did not paste well. The above ought to apply regardless of whether you are using lm or lmer. If this does not answer your question, please edit your question to say why it does not.
