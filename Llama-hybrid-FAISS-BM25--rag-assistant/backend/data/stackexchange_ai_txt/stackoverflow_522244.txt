Making a component less sensitive to Dragging in Swing

A JComponent of mine is firing a mouseDragged event too vigorously. When the user is trying to click, it interprets is as a drag even if the mouse has only moved 1 pixel. How would I add a rule for a particular component that amounted to: Do not consider it a drag event unless the mouse has moved 10 pixels from the point at which is was pressed down. Note: I know it's not a system setting in my OS, since only events on that component suffer from this over sensitivity. Thank you.
