Why my models have a pretty high accuracy with a small training dataset?

I was wondering why my models (decision tree, svm, random forest) behave like that, with "high" accuracy on a small training dataset. Is it a sign of overfitting? The graph represents the accuracy measured on training datasets with different sizes, from 0.01 to 0.9 of the total dataset. https://i.stack.imgur.com/P1cTj.jpg Thanks
