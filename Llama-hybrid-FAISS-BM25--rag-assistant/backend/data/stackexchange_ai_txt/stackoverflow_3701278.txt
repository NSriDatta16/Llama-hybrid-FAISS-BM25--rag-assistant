Aggregating Probabilistic Plans

I'm trying to create a simple STRIPS -based planner. I've completed the basic functionality to compute separate probabilistic plans that will reach a goal, but now I'm trying to determine how to aggregate these plans based on their initial action, to determine what the "overall" best action is at time t0. Consider the following example. Utility, bounded between 0 and 1, represents how well the plan accomplishes the goal. CF, also bounded between 0 and 1, represents the certainty-factor, or the probability that performing the plan will result in the given utility. Plan1: CF=0.01, Utility=0.7 Plan2: CF=0.002, Utility=0.9 Plan3: CF=0.03, Utility=0.03 If all three plans, which are mutually exclusive, start with the action A1, how should I aggregate them to determine the overall "fitness" for using action A1? My first thought is to sum the certainty-factors, and multiple that by the average of the utilities. Does that seem correct? So my current result would look like: fitness(A1) = (0.01 + 0.002 + 0.03) * (0.7 + 0.9 + 0.03)/3. = 0.02282 Or should I calculate the individual likely utilities, and average those? fitness(A1) = (0.01*0.7 + 0.002*0.9 + 0.03*0.03)/3. = 0.00323 Is there a more theoretically sound way?
