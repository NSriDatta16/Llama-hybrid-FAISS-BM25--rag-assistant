How to calculate propensity scores for multiple treatments with different predictors?

I use propensity score matching with one control condition $d\in\{0\}$ and multiple treatment conditions $d\in\{A, B, AB\}$ , where $AB$ denotes the combination of (relatively unrelated) treatments $A$ and $B$ . As usual, to get the propensity scores, I used a multinomial logistic regression of $D$ on a set of predictors $X$ and did the matching (with replacement) with $D[d = 0]$ as the pool of controls for each of the treatment conditions $D[d\in\{A, B, AB\}]$ . However, the challenge in my case is that the different $D[d \neq 0]$ have slightly different predictors, and I think if I separately could use the appropriate predictors for each treatment condition $A, B,$ and $AB$ , I would get a better balance with the (recycled) control group than if I use the union of the predictors for $A, B,$ and $AB$ as I currently do. Hence, my intuition is, to obtain more accurate propensity scores for the respective treated and control, I would use separate binary logistic regressions with its corresponding appropriate predictors for each subset $D[d\in\{0, A\}]$ , $D[d\in\{0,B \}]$ , and $D[d\in\{0, AB\}]$ , similar to how it is done in this answer , with the difference that I use different predictors. I couldn't find any source that has done it this way, and my question is, if my approach is statistically sound and can perhaps be covered by a source. Somehow I have the suspicion of neglecting the contrasts of the treatments with each other, when I use separate models, but I currently can't think of a better idea. Perhaps it's worth noting that I work with R, and I also couldn't find a package that allows you to define separate formulas for different treatments.
