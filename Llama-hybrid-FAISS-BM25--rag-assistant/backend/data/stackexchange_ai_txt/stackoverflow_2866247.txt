Be aware that Windows Phone 7 will require a new implementation anyway, based on Silverlight Mobile (or XNA, if you prefer). As such, you might want to look at the MVVM pattern, and ensure separation of business logic from presentation layers -- System.Windows.Forms has effectively been nuked for mobile development, from the next version. In addition, Windows Phone 7 is not going to contain any structured data storage (SQL CE) functionality or LINQ data providers -- you'd have to "do it yourself".
