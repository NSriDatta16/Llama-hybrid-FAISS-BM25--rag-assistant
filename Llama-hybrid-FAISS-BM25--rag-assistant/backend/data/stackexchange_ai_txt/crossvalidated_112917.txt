Independence of effects in meta-analysis and meta-regression

In meta-analysis, I know that an important assumption is independence. Clearly, if we want to estimate a pooled effect size, its best if each effect comes from an independent sample of observers. Otherwise, the summary effect will be overly influenced by samples that contribute more than one effect size to the model. However , as an experimental psychologist, many of the comparisons I am interested in differ at the within subjects level (for instance, the same sample of subjects may have been tested on two sets of stimulus types). My question, therefore, is whether moderator-analyses can be conducted where k represents conditions, rather than samples. In other words: If I had two effects for every sample, one for stimulus 1 and one for stimulus 2 -could I perform a moderator analysis on stimulus type, given that this varies at the within subjects level? Note the following things- 1) I wouldn't use this "between condition" model to estimate the "overall" pooled effect size because of the issues I mention in the first paragraph. 2) I have seen published examples of such a "between condition" analysis, but the consequences/ limitations/issues involved are rarely discussed. Additionally, If anyone has any references/ examples as to why this is ok/ not ok I would be very grateful. I appreciate your time.
