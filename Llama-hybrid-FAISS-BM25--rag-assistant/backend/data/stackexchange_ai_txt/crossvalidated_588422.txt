Models fitting to different data but input is the same

I am currently running candidates for a meta-analysis using the rma.mv function in metafor. I have tried running models, comparing by AIC, and then averaging using the model.avg approach in the MuMIn package. However, I continue to get an error that indicates my candidate models are fit to different data -- but the dataframe I input is the same for all three models. What is happening here? The only number I notice that seems to change is the df in the Test for heterogeneity -- what would be causing this change and these models be fit to different data? The full model I am trying to fit is: full_moda I have 1703 effect sizes going into this model And I have been trying to do model selection with different combinations of the moderators to ensure that I am chosing the best model. I have tried using model selection with the glmulti package but it takes days for the task to run, so I have not done that recently. The error I get for every combination of model I run is "error: models are not fitted to the same data". I have cleaned by dataset to ensure there are no NA's so I am really confused about where it would be dropped effect sizes?
