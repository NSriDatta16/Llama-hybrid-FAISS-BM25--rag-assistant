For the future of MySQL I would rather let one of the creators do the talking : http://askmonty.org/w/images/a/a4/Osd2010.pdf Not to mention that oracle just made InnoDB (a very popular MySQL storage engine) commercial only. http://www.cloudave.com/7356/internal-email-on-why-a-software-company-migrates-away-from-mysql/ Needless to say it is not going anywhere but it is not free to use for sure (never was actually but now oracle will ensure GPL anytime they want). After MySQL, PostgreSQL is the most used open source free (as in beer) database. On the commercial ( high cost ) side. Oracle is still the most used database. But it is most certainly an overkill if your software does not need a DBA as a monthly maintenance cost to the customer.
