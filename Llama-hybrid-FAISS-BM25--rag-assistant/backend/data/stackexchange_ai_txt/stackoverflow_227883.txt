http://dpaste.com/ is written in Python with Django. From http://dpaste.com/about/ : This site began as an exercise. It seemed silly that Django coders didn't have a pastebin app written in Django, when writing a pastebin app is just a couple steps above "Hello, World" in complexity. Initially it was all generic views — in other words, it was some configuration info plus a couple templates — and worked great, but as I've added features some actual programming has been needed. The source to the "pure generic" version of the site is still available here . At some point I may release the latest source, but that's contingent on finding time to do the cleanup and enhancements on my list. The book Python Web Development with Django (co-written by Paul Bissex , the creator of dpaste) contains a chapter on creating a pastebin.
