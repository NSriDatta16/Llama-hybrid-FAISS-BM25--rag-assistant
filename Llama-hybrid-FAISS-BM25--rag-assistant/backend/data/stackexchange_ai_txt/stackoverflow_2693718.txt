You might find Spawning a good fit. It has several options for deployment, one of which is somewhat transparent async (as implemented by Eventlet ). So if you literally do time.sleep(3) it'll be okay. Not everything you might do is transparently handled, so you have to pay some attention to Eventlet and how it works. Sockets are, for instance, so if you read from a socket (and that socket blocks) it won't halt the server or consume a thread. But if you do CPU-heavy work that will block all requests. So... it's a bit tricky. Spawning has some other deployment options that might work for you too. You might be able to use WaitForIt , though it has some gotchas. It will spawn threads for long-running requests, and provides some browser feedback, so if you are creating a very simplistic frontend to long-running backend processes it might be useful. It acts as WSGI middleware.
