If you did have a gigantic list of locations in a relational database, and you're only concerned about 500 to 1000 words, then you could definitely just pass the SQL command to find matches for the 500-1000 words and it would be quite efficient. But even if you did have to call a slow API, you could feasibly request for 500 words one by one. If you kept a cache of the matches, then the cache would probably quickly fill up with all the stop words (you know, like "the", "if", "and") and then using the cache, it'd be likely that you would be searching much less than 500 words each time. I think you might be surprised at how fast the brute force approach would work.
