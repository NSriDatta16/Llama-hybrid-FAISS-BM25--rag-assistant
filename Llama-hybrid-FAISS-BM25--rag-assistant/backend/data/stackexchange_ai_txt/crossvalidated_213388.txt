Non-linear transformation to increase separability between clusters

I want to do a classification on PC scores. I have a $400$ dimensional matrix, e.g. $2000\times 400$ ( $2000$ number of samples and $400$ dimensions). I first apply PCA on it and take it to 3D, i.e. $2000\times 3$ . There are $5$ types of classes in this data. When I go to PC space, these classes gets separated but this amount of separability is not enough for my purpose. I'd like to pass data through a non-linear/linear function to increase this superability. I applied LDA but the results was surprisingly worse. What type of function do you recommend to increase the separability? Thanks
