How to drag only one image with iPhone SDK

I want to create a little app that takes two images and i want to make only the image over draggable. After research, i found this solution: -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[ event allTouches] anyObject]; image.alpha = 0.7; if([touch view] == image){ CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; image.center = location; } It works but the problem is that the image is draggable from its center and I don't want that. So I found another solution: - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Retrieve the touch point CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; startLocation = pt; [[self view] bringSubviewToFront:self.view]; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Move relative to the original touch point CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; frame = [self.view frame]; frame.origin.x += pt.x - startLocation.x; frame.origin.y += pt.y - startLocation.y; [self.view setFrame:frame]; } It works very well but when I add another image, all the images of the view are draggable at the same time. I'm a beginner with the iPhone development and I have no idea of how I can only make the image over draggable.
