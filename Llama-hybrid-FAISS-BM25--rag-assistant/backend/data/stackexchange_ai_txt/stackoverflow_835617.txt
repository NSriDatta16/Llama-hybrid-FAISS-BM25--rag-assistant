Hierarchical Memory allocator library for C++

My application is mostly organised in layers so I found that something like the APR memory pools would be the best way. While reading on SO about C++ placement new posts here & here , and a more generic C allocation question I was thinking about hand-crafting a hierarchical pool allocator as suggested in one post, but in the pure NYI tradition I'm first asking if something like this already exists. It could also have the nice property of being able to give back unused memory to the OS (since allocation could be done with mmap(MAP_ANON) ) or could be allocating from the stack as suggested Ferrucico here .
