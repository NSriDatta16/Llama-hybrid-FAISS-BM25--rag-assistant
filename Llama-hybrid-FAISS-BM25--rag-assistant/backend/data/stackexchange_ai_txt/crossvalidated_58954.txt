Is spectral leakage a random variable?

Spectral leakage ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_leakage ) is obviously a function of several factors, including its underlying algorithm, precision of variables, etc. Is there a body of work that explores the behavior and attempts to characterize the noise in spectral leakage? Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches?
