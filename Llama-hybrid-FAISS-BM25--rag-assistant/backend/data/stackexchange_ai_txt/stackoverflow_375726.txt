There does not seem to be an easy solution to this problem since Google doesn't provide the answer in the API. The only method I have found to get access to individual placemarks is to "capture" them when they are added to the map. In order to do this you have to set an 'addoverlay' listener on the map object. Something like this: GEvent.addListener(map, 'addoverlay', function(o) { kmlmarkers.push(o); } However, I couldn't figure out a way to get the id of the placemark out of the marker object. Therefore the only way I was able to access specific placemarks was to loop through the array and match the markers with my data based upon the coordinates. It's not a real elegant solution but is was the only way that I was able to make it work.
