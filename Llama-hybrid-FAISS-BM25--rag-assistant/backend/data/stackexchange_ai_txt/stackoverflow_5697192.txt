If you need to delete it, harakiri's query is good but I have a question, why to add a record in the first place? In time your website could grow bigger and things might get complicated. I would suggest you to not record it to the database in the first place. You just do more actions and queries while there is a shorter way. I believe such approach is more elegant and useful, considering in the future your web site might grow bigger and you might need to check your codes again. Please don't forget such things might be headache. This is a fatal mistake for a programmer. In the beginning, many thinks, ok for now this do the trick, why to bother coding more? In time you will add more and more codes, later you might lose yourself in it. It will be too late once your visitors / customer will start to complain about slow opening pages, eventually bad coding.
