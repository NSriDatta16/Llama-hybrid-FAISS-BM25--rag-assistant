I'm not sure exactly where the issue may be in your code, but I've got a one page oauth/appengine/gdata example which may at least set you in the right direction. Have you tried to navigate to the site directly from the iPhone/desktop browser to see what message is delivered? Hope it helps. Alternatively, is it possibly to do with the user agent the UIWebView sets?
