Laplace mechanism on vector record?

Does the definition of neighboring database in differential privacy capture the multi-dimensional record? Let's say we have a database domain $\mathbb{N}^{n\times d}$ where $n$ is the number of records and $d$ is the number of attributes in each record. Assuming there is no missing value, let $x,y \in \mathbb{N}^{n\times d}$ be two databases where at most one record differ. Can we say that $x,y$ are two neighboring databases? If so, how can we bound the $\ell_1$ sensitivity of a query, say simple average query. Below are the notations of x.y for convenience. $$ x =\begin{pmatrix} x_{1,1} & x_{1,2} & \ldots & x_{1,d} \\ \vdots & & & \vdots \\ x_{n,1} & x_{n,2} & \ldots & x_{n,d} \\ \end{pmatrix}, y =\begin{pmatrix} x_{1,1} & x_{1,2} & \ldots & x_{1,d} \\ \vdots & & & \vdots \\ y_{n,1} & y_{n,2} & \ldots & y_{n,d} \\ \end{pmatrix} $$
