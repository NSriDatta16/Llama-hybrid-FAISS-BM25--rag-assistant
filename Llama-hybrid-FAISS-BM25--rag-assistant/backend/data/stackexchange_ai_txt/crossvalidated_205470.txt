Low recall and high precision in text summarization

We are trying to generate a model to summarize Persian news. About 14000 news were summarized with help of humans(supervised) and then we extracted all sentences (about 180000) and labeled them ( true if were selected in summarization, false if not). We have also calculated 9 features for these sentences (all features are between 0-1). Finally we used MaxEnt classifier (logistic regression) for binary classification on our data set. And here is the result : I really don't know low recall and high precision is normal for our classifier or something is wrong in our work? Can anyone come up with an explanation?
