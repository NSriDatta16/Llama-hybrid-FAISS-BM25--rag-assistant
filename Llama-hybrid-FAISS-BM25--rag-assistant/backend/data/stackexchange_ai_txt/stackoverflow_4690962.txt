You can try to implement a simple script to backup your data using rsynch - you'll need a second Linux machine with Internet access and some tinkering to make sure your backups are reliable in case you need to restore the - think /etc/ settings, website files and any databases you might have. Pay special attention to file permissions. Some hosting companies offer managed backup with their plans - you could look into that as well, but make sure your backups run and are stored remotely - you don't want the same disaster to strike all copies of your precious data. Last, if you can do with a small amount of disk space for your backups, you can try a free account from VPS Backup - it's free up to 5GB of compressed data, works on most flavors of Linux and is specially suited to backup MySQL databases as well. Since you don't have to pay for it, it might be a good workaround until you figure longtime solution.
