This is an old question, but it still googles up, so here's something that might help. This post talks about dotnetnuke modules, but I think the concept is what you were talking about - Main web project with secondary web projects that contain user controls. Something the blog post doesn't mention: Once you've set your project to use IIS rather than webdevwebserver, and set the override URL(s), you sometimes have to do something extra to get debugging working. Right click the project -> Debug -> Start New Instance. This seems to be the only way I can reliably debug one of our usercontrol projects. Mind you, that particular project has been dragged kicking and screaming from 1.1 to 3.5, so it's probably unhappy about a few other things :-)
