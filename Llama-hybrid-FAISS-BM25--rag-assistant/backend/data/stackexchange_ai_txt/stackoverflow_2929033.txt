In general alt is for when images are disabled, rather than as a backstop for error conditions. Whilst IMO it's a desirable feature that the alt text be displayed in error conditions, the standard doesn't say it has to: For user agents that cannot display images, forms, or applets, this attribute specifies alternate text. and indeed browser behaviour varies. WebKit (Safari, Chrome) will only display a broken image icon and never the alt text; IE tries to render the alt text inside a box with an image icon (which frequently displays poorly). So you shouldn't rely on alt text being displayed on error. Sure I could parse the filenames and detect when it's an mp3 Yes, I think you'll have to. Not that that's possible either in the general case since filename/URL extension may well have nothing to do with the actual file type. However if you control all the URLs yourself you may be able to guarantee that all MP3s are called ...mp3 .
