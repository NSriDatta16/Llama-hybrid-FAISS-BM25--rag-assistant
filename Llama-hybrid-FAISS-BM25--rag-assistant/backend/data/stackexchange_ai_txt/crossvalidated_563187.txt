Interpretation of A/B Test with 3 Variants

We are currently having an interresting discusison about a recent A/B Test we ran and i'd very much appreciate your thoughts on it: We recently ran a A/B/C Test regarding the pricing of same day delivery: Control, current state:: free same day delivery Variation 1: 3 Dollars for same day delivery Variation 2: 5 Dollars for same day delivery We measured: CR_Checkout: Overall Conversion Rate in the Checkout (including other delivery options) as: '# users in checkout / # transactions CR_SameDay: Usage Rate same day delivery as: '# transactions with same day option / # transactions Results compared to Control: Variation 1: Change in CR_Checkout_1: Not Significant Change in CR_SameDay:_1 Significant decrease Variation 2: Change in CR_Checkout_2: Significant decrease Change in CR_Sameday_2: Significant decrease Question: Under the given circumstances - is it statistically sound to go on and make a profit calculation to compare Variation 1 and Variation 2, using the respective conversion rates, average order value (generic for both variants) and revenue from same day delivery fee - even if we have not proven a statistically significant difference between Variation 1 and Variation 2? Example: Variation 1: 100 Users in Checkout x CR_Checkout_1 x Average Order Value + Revenue SameDayFee = 100 Variation 2: 100 Users in Checkout x CR_Checkout_2 x Average Order Value + Revenue SameDayFee = 105 Therefore Variation 2 should be implemented.
