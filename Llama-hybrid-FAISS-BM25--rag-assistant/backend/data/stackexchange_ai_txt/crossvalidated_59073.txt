Although a misclassification table sounds intuitive, you need to be very careful in its interpretation as these counts are sensitive to the marginal distribution of the dependent variable. Consider the simplest form a logitstic regression: a logistic regression with just a constant and no explanatory variables. If you are modeling a rare event, say something affects only 1% of the population, then this model will correctly classify 99% of the observations. Does that mean that this is a good model? If you add variables to this model than the proportion correctly classified won't change much as there just is not any room for improvement. Does that mean that the constant only model is prefered?
