Storing the image data in the database itself isn't a good solution. What I would suggest is storing the image on the file system in a folder and a reference to its name and location is stored in the database. This Php class will make writing the app a lot easier, "class.upload.php": http://www.verot.net/php_class_upload.htm It comes with lots of examples and has an active support forum. All you need to add to it is the storage of the file name and location in the database.
