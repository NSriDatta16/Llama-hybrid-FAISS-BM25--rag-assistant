Chow test multiple variables

great site! I have collected monthly deals data for how new ships are being finance from 2005-2012. The data consists of "deals" made by different shipping companies and the amount raised in each deal. The deals can split into the following categories: Bank Loans, Bonds, IPOs and FOs. Bank loans has been the premier financing option, accounting for 70-80% of total capital raised pre-2008. I am therefore looking to do a time series analysis to see if there has been a structural break (chow test) in the use of bank loans, and that other forms of financing such as Bonds, IPOs and FOs has increased post the financial crisis (2008). My question is, will I have to conduct a chow test for each variable to prove the structural break or can I somehow incorporate all variables into one analysis? Thanks in advance!
