The standard C/C++ syntax is followed. So %d and %i are both 'signed integer', %f is 'decimal floating point' and will show floats or doubles. Without being sure why d and i are duplicated, the reason that %f does floats and doubles is that things passed via an ellipsis are subject to the C promotion rules. If you pass any integer type that is smaller than an int, it'll be promoted to a full size int for passing. Similarly, if you pass a float, it'll be promoted to a double. So the thing receiving the arguments just needs to think in terms of integer versus floating point, not about storage size.
