Here are a few suggestions copied verbatim from the Optimisation Task View on CRAN : Rsolnp is currently being developed on R-Forge in project rino . This package offers general nonlinear optimization using the augmented lagrange multiplier method. In package Rdonlp2 function donlp2(), a wrapper for the DONLP2 solver, offers the minimization of smooth nonlinear functions and constraints. DONLP2 can be used freely for any kind of research purposes, otherwise it requires licensing.
