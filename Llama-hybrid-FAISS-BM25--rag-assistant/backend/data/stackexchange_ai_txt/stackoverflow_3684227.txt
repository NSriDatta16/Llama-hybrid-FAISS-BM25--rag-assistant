Trying to get id of a div using its class

I have a strange problem, I am trying to implement drag and drop using dojo, this all works fine. However I need to attain the id of all divs with a certain class, I have been unable to do so using the dojo.query method e.g. : var totalNumDays = dojo.query(".shiftDropper"); console.log(totalNumDays.id); This results is undefined ? I have also tried using the following: var totalNumDays = dojo.query(".shiftDropper"); var idName = totalNumDays.attr("id"); console.log(idName); However this returns the results in a strange way it returns the id's but as an object ? If anyone could point me the right direction it would be great, I will include the HTML source to give u guys a clearer idea of the problem: Clear Shifts Clear Shifts Thanks in advance
