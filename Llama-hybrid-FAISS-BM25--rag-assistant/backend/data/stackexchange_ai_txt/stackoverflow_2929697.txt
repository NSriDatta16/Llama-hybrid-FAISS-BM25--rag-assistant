Magento module - database not initialized?

So I've installed an extension in my Magento Enterprise. I've been able to configure new options in the admin interface after installing the module. However in the frontend it complains "table not found". Checking the database that is indeed true. Seems the mysql4-*.php scripts have not been run or failed. Is there a log or something I can look at to see what goes wrong? From what I've read (difficult to find documentation on this) the modules db should've been initialized on the first request after it was installed and activated. Any other suggestions to what I can check to find out why it's not initialized properly?
