ARM development and emulation

I have an ARM device (network storage) with debian installed. I can pull out drive and dump fs image (using dd). The OS there is debian, I use ubuntu. What do I need to install (software) to be able to cross-compile? I can mount image and modify its content. How can I emulate that device to test cross-compiled executables? UPDATE : I don't mean any assembler programming, what I want is compile some usual debian daemons (web-server + scripts) and deploy after check.
