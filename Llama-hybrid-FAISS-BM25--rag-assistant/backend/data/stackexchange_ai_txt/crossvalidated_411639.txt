How to determine bang-for-buck apart from just $/TB

Firstly, I'm no expert on statistics or any of the fancy jargon so please pardon my ignorance and use of layman terms! Also, forgive me if this is not the right forum to post my question. So I've been asked to choose between three different capacity storage array units. All other things equal, the only difference between the three are their capacity and price. Obviously one can easily work out which array yields the lowest price per TB - it's the fourth column and is typically that with the most capacity (due to falling storage prices). What I'm interested in is whether there are other ways to determine what is the best bang-for-buck or sweet-spot, so to speak. Here is my data set: +-------+----------+-------+------+ | Model | Capacity | Cost | $/TB | | | (TB) | ($ ) | | +-------+----------+-------+------+ | A | 16 | 20400 | 1275 | +-------+----------+-------+------+ | B | 32 | 22150 | 692 | +-------+----------+-------+------+ | C | 40 | 26500 | 662 | +-------+----------+-------+------+ For example, whilst C is the cheapest in terms of \$/TB it also commands a hefty increase of \$4350 compared to a reduction in \$/TB of just \$30. It also has only 25% more capacity than B. Meanwhile, B is significantly cheaper \$/TB compared to A, has double the capacity of A and yet is only \$1750 dearer. So upon initial inspection it appears Model B offers the best bang-for-buck relative to A and C. However, is there an objective way to show this by graphing the data and showing some kind of intersection (or something) which represents the sweet spot? Thank you so much for your time!
