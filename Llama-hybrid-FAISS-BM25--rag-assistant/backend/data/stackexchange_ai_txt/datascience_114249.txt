Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) are measured on a Likert scale from 1-5. Likert scale variables are not amenable to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or k-means clustering because those methods assume continuous measurement. It would be more appropriate to use multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and k-modes which assume nominal level measurement.
