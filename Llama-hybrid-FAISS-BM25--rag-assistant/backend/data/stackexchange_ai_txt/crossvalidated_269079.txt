oriented bounding box obtained applying principal component analysis

Is there a theorem indicating that the OBB obtained by PCA from a point cloud is almost the same (or the same) than the one obtained with a subset of points (regularly distributed) on the surface of this point cloud ? So that if you are given a set of points laying on the boundary of an object you do not need to use internal points to obtain the best OBB using PCA
