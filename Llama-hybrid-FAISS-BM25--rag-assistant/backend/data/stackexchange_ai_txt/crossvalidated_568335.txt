If Yes to both of the questions in my comment, then suppose you have 100 with Method 1 and 100 with method 2. Then find midpoints of bins for Methods 1 and 2, using quantiles of bin boundaries. Here is one possible way to combine the two samples of binned observations. Combined, after some arithmetic, you have new levels a through g with mid-bin quantile values $15, 30, 50, 60, 75, 80,$ and $95$ with respective counts (out of 200) as $30, 60, 20, 20, 30, 20,$ and $10+10=20.$ The lowest bin $(0,30\%),$ label 'a' is from Method 2, and contains 30 subjects. For label 'b', bin $(0,60\%)$ with midpoint 30 from Method 2 contains 60 subjects; and so on.] Then taking midpoint values and frequencies as below, we have approximate mean quantile value $51,$ using R as a calculator. v = c(15,30,50,60,75,80,95) f = c(30,60,20,20,30,20,20) a = sum(f*v)/sum(f); a [1] 51 One could use R to simulate samples consistent with this method, but each sample would be somewhat different. Because information is lost in binning the data, you cannot know the exact sample mean of the combined sample. The mean for one possible sample is as follows: set.seed(2022) x = sample(v, 200, rep=T, prob = f) mean(x) [1] 52.4 table(x) x 15 30 50 60 75 80 95 # values 34 50 22 22 26 18 28 # frequencies summary(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 15.0 30.0 50.0 52.4 75.0 95.0 If we use R to simulate 10,000 such samples, then the average of their mean scores is consistent with the value 51 above. set.seed(318) a = replicate(10^5, mean(sample(v,100,rep=T,prob=f))) mean(a) [1] 50.99432 This histogram of these simulated scores is nearly normal, possibly slightly skewed to the right. hist(a,prob=T, col="skyblue2", main = "Mean Scores of 10,000 Combined Samples") curve(dnorm(x, mean(a), sd(a)), add=T, col="orange", lwd=2)
