Cannot access drag adorner template

I've used the sample code provided by Bea Stollnitz ( http://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/?p=53 ), in order to enable drag and drop in my application, and drag adorner, etc. Everything works fine, my drag adorner is well displayed, I have all the behavior I want. But (yes there is always a but), I cannot access the DataTemplate of the Drag Adorner, in order to display different data depending on the dragged data. I have simplified the code, but the basics are still there. This is the DataTemplate of my DragAdorner This is the code that create the Adorner : if (this.draggedAdorner == null) { var adornerLayer = AdornerLayer.GetAdornerLayer(source); this.draggedAdorner = new DraggedAdorner(draggedData, dataTemplate, source, adornerLayer); } And this is the code that init an adorner public DraggedAdorner(List dragDropData, DataTemplate dragDropTemplate, FrameworkElement adornedElement, AdornerLayer adornerLayer) : base(adornedElement) { this.adornerLayer = adornerLayer; this.contentPresenter = new ContentPresenter(); this.contentPresenter.Content = dragDropData[0]; this.contentPresenter.ContentTemplate = dragDropTemplate; this.adornerLayer.Add(this); } The draggedData, will be a list of MyType, I get the first item as the content of the ContentPresenter of my DraggedAdorner, so the DataTemplate can apply. The problem is, I want to access the numberContainer and number control of the DataTemplate, in order to display the number of dragged object, in the adorner. But I cannot manage to access it, whatever I try, It ends with the "This operation is valid only on elements that have this template applied." message. I have tought I could do something like this : this.contentPresenter.ContentTemplate.FindName("number", this.contentPresenter); Since the DataTemplate should apply to the ContentPresenter, but nope... For information the adornedElement is the ListViewItem from which the drag occurs. If you have any idea...
