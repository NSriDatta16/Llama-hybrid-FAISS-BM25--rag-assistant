Recommended model to analyze relationship with aggregate rate

In order to analyze the relationship between some independent variables and a binary dependent variable, it is standard to use logistic regression, which allows us to model the probability of the independent variable equalling 1 conditioned on the independent variables. However, what is the standard model used for aggregate rates? For instance, take some cross-country data, where the dependent variable is national unemployment rate and where we do not have micro-data? Logistic regression cannot be used because the variable is not binary, and similarly linear regression does not seem to be a good fit because the predicted value must lie between 0 and 1. What statistical technique would you recommend for this? I have researched a little on solutions, but have been failing for now: Instead of the rate, I can use count data. However, my data is unemployment rates by country, so I have very high counts Poisson and Negative Binomial models fail to converge I've seen it recommended to use a Gaussian GLM with a log link function. What is the point of this? I'm interested in your recommended approach
