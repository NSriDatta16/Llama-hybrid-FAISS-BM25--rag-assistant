The JPA annotations are really your only dependency. If somebody is using your object in a POJO (non DB) way that all they will need is the JPA annotations jar, which for a most application servers is actually on the classpath anyhow. Surely just having the annotations as a dependency is pretty reasonable, it's no like you need to drag in the whole of hibernate and it's many friends. The alternative is as you've worked out is to use hbm's for this entity. It's not that bad, as hibernate is quite happy mixing annotation and hbm style entities in a single SessionFactory and you can still use field access so don't need to compromise the public interface to your class.
