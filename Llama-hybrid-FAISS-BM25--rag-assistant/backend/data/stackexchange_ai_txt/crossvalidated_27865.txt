strucchange breakpoints command: does NA mean no breaks are identified?

I am using the package strucchange to analyze a monthly time series. I read it in as a zoo object. The series looks something like this: date A B 2 1979-01-07 0 7 3 1979-01-14 0 4 4 1979-01-21 0 5 5 1979-01-28 0 19 6 1979-02-04 0 20 I then run the command: breakpoints(Conf ~1, breaks=2) And in some cases, I get the answer: Optimal 1-segment partition: Call: breakpoints.formula(formula = timeseriesMon_short[, 4] ~ 1, breaks = 2) Breakpoints at observation number: NA Corresponding to breakdates: NA Does this simply mean that no structural breaks were identified? I could not find an answer to this in the documentation of the package.
