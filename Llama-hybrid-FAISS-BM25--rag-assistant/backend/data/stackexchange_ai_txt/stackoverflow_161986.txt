The overall floorplan determines what works best for people. My previous employer used cubes with wraparound desks that can be used either corner facing or straight. Most used as corner facing for extra legroom. I agree with Sam Wessel, the pair programming concept would work best with straight desks to quickly share workspace and view each other's monitors. I've also spent some time working in the German branch of my previous employer and their model is to separate the floor into rooms with high partition walls and stick 4 desks in the middle so that everyone faces each other, instead of away. The high partition walls blocked idle conversations but you can still shout to neighbors if needed. This allows you to develop a close work group relationship you wouldn't have otherwise. I liked this layout. My current employer uses nothing but desks lined up against the walls or half-height partitions. They believe in the clean desk policy and minimal storage. Forget your coding book collection or office decorations, privacy, etc. I end up whispering to my wife on the phone because everyone hears you. I'm not a fan. They can squeeze us together like sardines to reduce office space footprint. Because of growth, they're now pushing people's desks into conference and storage rooms. Pretty soon I expect to be relocated to the basement with no stapler.
