Loss function in for gamma objective function in regression in XGBoost?

Suppose I want to predict $y$ from a set of predictors $x$ . $y$ is gamma distributed, so I want to use gamma regression with XGBoost. The help page of XGBoost specifies, for the objective parameter (loss function): reg:gamma: gamma regression with log-link. Output is a mean of gamma distribution. It might be useful, e.g., for modeling insurance claims severity, or for any outcome that might be gamma-distributed. What is the explicit formula for this loss function? I haven't been able to find it. Also, Why is the log-link required? As far as I understand, log is usually used as the link function when using Generalized Linear Models, but in gradient boosting it would make any sense...
