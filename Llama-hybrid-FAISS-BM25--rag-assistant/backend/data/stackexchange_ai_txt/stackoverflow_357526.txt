I like my photos to be sorted by date taken, so I wrote a groovy script to look at the EXIF data of pictures and put them into directories in ISO date format (2008-12-11). It keeps them organised. It doesn't solve the tagging according to content though, I use flickr for that. As for the duplication problem, a checksum would cut down on the number of images you'd have to manually sort but unfortunately it wouldn't pick up the resized images. You could look for a less crappy dupe finder, one that doesn't automatically delete duplicates? Be sure to make a backup before you test any though :p
