Let me address a few preliminary issues first. As a terminological matter, there is no such thing as "logistic regression with a probit link". Rather, there is the generalized linear model that can use a variety of different links (of which, logit is one, and probit is another), and different distributions of $Y$. Thus, you are doing probit regression. The maximum likelihood methods used to fit these models are not troubled by 0's, unless there's something very weird about your data that I don't recognize. When and whether your statistical software returns a warning vs. results will depend on many factors, importantly, which software you are using, but as I say, it's not clear that anything is amiss. An interaction means that the nature of the effect of one covariate depends on the level of another. For example, $Y$ may increase as $X_1$ increases when $X_2$ is low , but decrease as $X_1$ increases when $X_2$ is high . However, that is a different issue than the main effect of a covariate (cf., "decreases the difference between the conditions"). It is quite possible that that "cell" (n.b., I know nothing of the structure of your data or the design of your study) has a great deal of leverage . Without knowing more about your data, my first guess would be that you should accept the results that the software are returning. I do believe that arbitrarily changing your data to get the results you expect is generally considered a no-no.
