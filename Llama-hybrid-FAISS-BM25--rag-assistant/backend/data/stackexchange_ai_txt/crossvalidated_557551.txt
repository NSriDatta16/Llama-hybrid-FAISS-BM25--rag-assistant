Why Are Empirical Bayes Methods Not Considered "Controversial"?

I was reading about Empirical Bayesian Methods and came across the following: My Question: As this text explains, I have often heard that the priors used in Bayesian Methods should be decided prior to seeing any data - however, it seems that Empirical Bayesian Methods seem to outright go against this and choose priors based on the data. Does anyone know why they do this and what are the advantages/disadvantages of doing this compared to the traditional Bayesian Approach?
