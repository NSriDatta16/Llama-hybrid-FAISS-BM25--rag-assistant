CassiniDev is an open source project that was developed to fill in all the blanks left by WebDev.WebServer/Cassini. You will find this issue handled as well as many others. It works well as a stand-alone server, as an in-process server suitable for testing and embedding and, most notably, as a direct replacement for the Visual Studio 2008/2010 dev servers. alt text http://i3.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=cassinidev&DownloadId=123367 alt text http://i3.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=cassinidev&DownloadId=123366
