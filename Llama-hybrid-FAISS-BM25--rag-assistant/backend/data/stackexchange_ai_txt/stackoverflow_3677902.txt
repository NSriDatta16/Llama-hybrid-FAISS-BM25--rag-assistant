Regular expression for counting sentences in a block of text

Possible Duplicate: PHP - How to split a paragraph into sentences. I have a block of text that I would like to separate into sentences, what would be the best way of doing this? I thought of looking for '.','!','?' characters, but I realized there were some problems with this, such as when people use acronyms, or end a sentence with something like !?. What would be the best way to handle this? I figured there would be some regex that could handle this, but I'm open to a non-regex solution if that fits the problem better.
