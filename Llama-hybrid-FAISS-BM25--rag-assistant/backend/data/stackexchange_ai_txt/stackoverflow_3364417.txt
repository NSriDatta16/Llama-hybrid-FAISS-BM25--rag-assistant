To the best of my knowledge, that's undefined. Good thing, too. If you're writing coding that depends on priorities to determine order of execution, you're doing it wrong. You either control this stuff explicitly and intentionally, or be prepared for whatever happens. Best is to write code that will work regardless. Priorities are a hint to the runtime scheduler, not a hard and fast directive. It's possible and legal for your priorities to be ignored altogether, or threads to be scheduled in an order having nothing to do with priorities. The best you can hope for is that, on average, your higher-priority threads get more CPU time than lesser-priority threads, other circumstances like IO waits permitting.
