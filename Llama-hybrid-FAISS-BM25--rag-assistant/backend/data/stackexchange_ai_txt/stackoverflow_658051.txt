I once heard compare a service method with "string xml" in/out this compares to writing a C# function like this: public object DoSomething(object o){ } I guess it might have it's usages sometimes, in case you want your service to support multiple versions of a schema for example, but it's not really a transparent design and should therefore be avoided. I've even seen organizations that define web-service standards for insurance companies design services like this. [Sigh]
