JQuery UI slide effect creates a new line

I want to enable an effect on my web app where a user clicks an "Edit" icon and a text box elegantly slides out horizontally immediately to the right of the icon. Currently it is sliding out, but not very elegantly, because when I click on the icon for some reason a new row is created in the browser below where I clicked (and all content below is bumped down). The text box slides out, and then bizarrely jumps back up to where I originally wanted it to go, and the new row created disappears. Please note, however, that if I put the textbox on its own line so that it is fully left-justified against the margin, that it works just fine. But I want it to scroll it to the right of the icon. This behavior is the same for IE8 and Firefox. Here is the HTML: And here is the relevant Javascript: function toggleNotebox() { var options = {}; $('#AddText').toggle('slide', options, 500); } Here is the jsbin.com URL to see this behavior in action: http://jsbin.com/alopu/edit
