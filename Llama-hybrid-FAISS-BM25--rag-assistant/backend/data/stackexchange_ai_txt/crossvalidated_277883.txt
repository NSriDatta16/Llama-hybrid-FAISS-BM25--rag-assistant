Unless the variable in question is strongly bimodal, I would suggest against dichotomising it using some arbitrary threshold. Some of the obvious issues of dichotomising is that the estimated values will have reduced precision as well as that the dichotomisation assumes that the relationship between the dichotomised variable and other variables is constant within dichotomisation intervals (an obviously strong assumption that usually is unrealistic). There is a significant body of literature presenting problems deriving from such dubious discretisation approaches. See for example: Ragland (1992) Dichotomizing continuous outcome variables: Dependence of the magnitude of association and statistical power on the cutpoint , Buettner et a. 1997 Problems in defining cutoff points of continuous prognostic factors: Example of tumor thickness in primary cutaneous melanoma and Altman et al. (1994) Dangers of using 'optimal' cutpoints in the evaluation of prognostic factors . F. Harrell's RMS book has the aptly name subsection 2.4.1: " Avoiding Categorization ". It could potentially be OK to partially dichotomising a variable into Low -/ Medium -/ High - value ranges and use only the Low - and High - value ranges if the variable in question is really noisy and contains a high degree of error but this is an edge case and should rely on particular domain knowledge. M. Kuhn discusses this shortly in his APM book in Chapt. 20.4 " Discretizing Continuous Outcomes ".
