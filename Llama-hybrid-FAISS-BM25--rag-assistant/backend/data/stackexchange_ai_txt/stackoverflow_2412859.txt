Silverlight MouseDragElementBehavior. How to rearrange items after drag and drop?

I have stack panel with custom controls in it. User can add or remove the items. I have attached MouseDragElementBehavior to each item. So now user can move them within the stack panel. However the items now are arranged on arbitrary manner. Is a mess really. They stay where the user left them. What I need now is to make them to be stacked as the stack panel supposed to be... Nicely one by one... So I need to simply let user change the order of items by using drag / drop operation but items has to be stacked precisely. There is DragFinished event, but I dont really see how the Behavior moves items. I thought it is Margin it changes but margins stays 0... I dont know what to do next. Appreciate little help.
