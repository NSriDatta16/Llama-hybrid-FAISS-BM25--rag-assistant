One approach would be to assume that goals are scored independently by each side as Poisson processes with rates of $w$ and $c$ per minute. For particular values of $w$ and $c$ you could calculate the probabilities that over $90$ minutes Wigan scores more goals than City, the same each, or City score more. I suspect that only one pair of values will produce probabilities corresponding to the odds (reciprocal probabilities?) you give, or to some adjustment to them which make the total probability exact$1$. Using these implied rates for $w$ and $c$, you could then work out the probabilities that over the final $60$ minutes Wigan score at least as many goals as City, City score exactly one more than Wigan, or City score more than one more than Wigan. You may then want to turn these probabilities back into odds.
