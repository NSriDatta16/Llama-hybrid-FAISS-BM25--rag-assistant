Wiki like on http://wiki.asp.net (with hierarchical table of contents)

I am looking for a Wiki written on ASP.NET (preferably open source and free ) similar to the one on http://wiki.asp.net/ . The main feature that I like on http://wiki.asp.net/ is a hierarchical table of contents - something which is totally absent in most Wikis - which are just collections of pages connected via hyperlinks, with no place where you can see the "sitemap" of the Wiki. What I need is a more structured Wiki, with pages organized like in a file system. Does anyone know such Wiki? Thank you.
