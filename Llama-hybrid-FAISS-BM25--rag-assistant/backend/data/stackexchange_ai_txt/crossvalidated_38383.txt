Learning classifier system frameworks

For some time already I am studiyng and applying machine learning methods. Recently for some particular problem, where methods like SVM, RF, neural nets etc. failed I got limited success with genetic programming, which was quite new area for me in practice at the moment. But right now it looks like, I really need to implement something like Learning classifier system . So the question is, are there any existing frameworks for LCS implementation ? To be more precise I am looking for frameworks on any language from the list: Java, Python, R, Matlab. Thanks. P.S.: I am still not sure if this is a correct place to ask my question, should I go with it to CrossValidated instead?
