Fade image in and out on Jquery hover

I am using a very basic jquery script to show an image on hover (as shown below): HTML: (display:none in css) ....many more list items with same format. The Jquery Is: $(".block").hover(function(){ $(this).find(".drag").stop().fadeIn(250); }, function(){ $(this).find(".drag").stop().fadeOut(250); }); Although this works, it is not working VERY well. Randomly, some .block divs don't show the image, and some don't fade it in completely. This happens randomly....although the overall effect works. Any ideas on why this is happening, or a better way to write this script?
