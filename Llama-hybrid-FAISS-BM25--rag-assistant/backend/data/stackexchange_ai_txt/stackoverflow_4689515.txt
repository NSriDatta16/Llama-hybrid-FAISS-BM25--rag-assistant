Quaternion cube rotation animation

I created this Rubiks Cube with Papervison3D. With some resources I created a Cube with 27 minicubes inside (3*3*3 = 27). Rotating the Rubiks Cube on mouse move is already done. (I do not rotate the camera.) All the behavior of a Rubiks Cube is in there already. But I'm a bit stuck in the final phase. When I play with it like I would do with a normal Rubiks Cube it's working ok, besides I know that the default Euler rotation values aren't reliable anymore after a while. What I need is to rotate the Rubiks Cube to the selected side and after that rotate the Rubiks Cube over the z-axis so the minicube face faces up. I prefer to animate it with TweenMax but I'm really stuck since I need quaternion rotations. I know the selected face of the Rubiks Cube itself. I know the Euler rotation of the Rubiks Cube using Matrix3D.matrix2euler(_rubiksCube.transform); What I need is to rotate it to the selected face for instance when the current rotation is x: -20, y: 35, z: 10 and I select the back face of the rubiksCube it must rotate to x:0, y: 180, z: 0 . What I need is to change this to Quaternion values and rotate the Rubiks Cube to the new Quaternion value. After that it must rotate the Rubiks Cube over it's z axis to face the selected minicube face up. This is the code I use when dragging/ rotating the Rubiks Cube private function onMouseMove( e : MouseEvent) : void { var m : Matrix3D; m = Matrix3D.rotationY( (mouseX - _mouseDownPoint.x) / 120 ); m = Matrix3D.multiply( m, Matrix3D.rotationX( -(mouseY - _mouseDownPoint.y) / 120 )); _rubiksCube.transform = Matrix3D.multiply( m, _rubiksCube.transform ); _mouseDownPoint.x = mouseX; _mouseDownPoint.y = mouseY; }
