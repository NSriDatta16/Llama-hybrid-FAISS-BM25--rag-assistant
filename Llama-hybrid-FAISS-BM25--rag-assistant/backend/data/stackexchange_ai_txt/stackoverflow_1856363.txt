XAML Treeview, how to displayed nodes horizontally instead of vertically

I'm kinda new at XAML and I'm trying to figure how to display the TreeView nodes horizontally instead of vertically, i.e Header 1 Item 1 Item 2 item 3 Header 2 Item 4 Instead of Header 1 Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Header 2 Item 4 It's not really as simple as it seems, I was able to get the headers to go horizontally though... XAML Code below If it helps to know what I'm trying to accomplish with my code, then basically I'm trying to organise applications in a series of categories. A container(like a list box) is generated for each application category. The data structure I have is Application Collection Application List (1-> Many) Application (1-> Many)
