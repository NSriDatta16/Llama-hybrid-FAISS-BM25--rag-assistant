Test Driven Development, Unit Testing

let me first explain what I'm aiming for with this question: What kind of dev I am? I'm the guy who thinks about the problem, writes the code and then tests it by myself. I'm developing web-apps mainly but there are also projects which are UI based too (RCP/Swing apps). I run my app and click here, test this... You probably know this "style". Well I'm a guy who tries to improve himself with every line/project and I want my code/apps to be tested pragmatically. I write in code - I want test in code. So I started for some of my classes/functions to use unit tests (junit 4). This works for backend stuff where no UI is involved - tbh: I find it hard to write the most of tests. If we're building a webapp there are probably interactions with the session or something. I guess you get the point. What I'm looking for are some resources probably with examples. Any good book advice would be welcome too. Don't get me wrong - I don't want only stuff for logic testing, I'm interested in ways to test my UI. Maybe this is an important part too: I developing in Java (85% of the time) and PHP/Python (the rest) Regards
