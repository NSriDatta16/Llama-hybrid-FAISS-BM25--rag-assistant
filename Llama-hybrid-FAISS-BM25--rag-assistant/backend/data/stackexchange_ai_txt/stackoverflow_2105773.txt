Problem with right-margin with css 100% - 350px layout

could anyone please help me with a problem I have been having with a 100% - 350px layout for embedding vimeo video? It seems like the right-margin property is getting ignored here, and the layout is overflowing to the right. I'm hoping this a simple mistake, but seems like I've tried everything. I'm running out of time. Help would be really appreciated. css: #container { position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; } #content { width:100%; height:100%; margin-left:350px; margin-right:350px; } .video { padding:0 0 0 0; height:100%; width:100%; } html (the vimeo embed code has been reformatted for validation): &nbsp; EDIT: Another solution I have tried: #container { position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; } #content { margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 0px; } .video { padding:0 0 0 0; width:100%; height:100%; } Edit: I'm using the solution for this type of positioning from this thread: How can I do width = 100% - 100px in CSS?
