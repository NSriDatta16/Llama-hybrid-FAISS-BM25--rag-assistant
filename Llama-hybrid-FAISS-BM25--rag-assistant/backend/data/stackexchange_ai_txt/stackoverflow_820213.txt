New to C++: should I use Visual Studio?

I'm about to start work on my first C++ project. I've done lots of C# and VB (VB6 and VB.NET), plus Java and a few other things over the past 10 years or so, just never had a requirement for C++ until now. I plan to use Visual Studio 2008, but I'm interested to find out from experienced C++ programmers whether Visual Studio is a good IDE for a C++ newbie. Will VS in any way make it harder for me to learn to program C++ correctly? Will VS encourage any bad habits? Are there any pitfalls I should look out for?
