You say other PHP scripts are working, so that indicates it's probably not an Apache problem. You also appear to have all your logging settings correct, and nothing is getting logged, so it's quite possible PHP is exiting normally before it outputs anything. One of the following could be true: A misplaced exit() statement? You were working on the code, maybe you added a quick exit() to check something out, and forgot to remove it? don.neufeld's idea of checking for the use of the @ operator, which suppresses any error messages, has cost me hours of debugging time in the past. Definitely something to look for. In situations like this, the poor man's debugging approach can yield some quick results. Throw an exit('wtf'); in as the first line in the script in question here. Does that run? The results of that test immediately rules out all sorts of possibilities no matter what the result is. If you don't get any output, then it's probably a server-level problem (configuration, bad module, etc), although be careful of any higher-level buffering. If you do get output, then you know the server is fine, and the issue lies deeper in your script, in which case you can move the exit() call down a few lines, rinse and repeat. Not an elegant way to debug, but it's quick and dirty, and you'll probably find the issue in a couple of minutes.
