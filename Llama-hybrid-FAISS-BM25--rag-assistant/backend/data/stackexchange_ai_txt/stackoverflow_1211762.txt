Straight-forward regular expressions may not be enough if your div contains nested divs. This is because the closing div element doesn't contain the ID, so it is hard for a regexp to match the closing tag. If your div is: Then you could use a regular expression (just be careful about greediness), a more elegant version of this: (.*?) note: Im pretty sure that regexp won't run, it has been a while! I would look into using a HTML parser library to parse the structure and obtain character offsets for the inside of the div, and then take that range from the buffer. Using a HTML library will allow you to parse and find where the div you want ends. Something like this tutorial might be useful. These parsers will probably allow you to extract the data enclosed in a tag such as your div accurately. You can also use a C# HTML parser , they all do a similar job, Just look through the documentation to ensure they don't just built trees, and allow you to obtain character offsets for the enclosed div data (so you can extract it) or allow access to that data.
