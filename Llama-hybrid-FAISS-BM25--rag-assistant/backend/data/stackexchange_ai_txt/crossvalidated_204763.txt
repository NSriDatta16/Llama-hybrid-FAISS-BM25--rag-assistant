What-if analysis using a fitted regression with ARMA errors

Using linear regression as an equation for prediction is straightforward with, $$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i. $$ Once the betas are estimated I can insert different values of $X$ to use as a what-if analysis for different scenarios. But trying to do the same with ARIMA models is proving difficult to translate. For example with an ARIMA(2,1,1) model, how do I create an equation where I can try out different scenarios to see how the projection changes? Below I have the output for a projection of sales based on past sales and extra regressors. I see that a unit change in poc0_3_PER results in a 135.2229 change in sales. But how do I account for the moving average and auto-regression components? arima(ts.count, order=c(2,1,1), xreg=df.back[3:4]) Call: arima(x = ts.count, order = c(2, 1, 1), xreg = df.back[3:4]) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 poc0_3_PER -0.4569 0.2458 0.9455 135.2229 I have ar1 and ar2 estimates along with ma1 and the extra regressors. How do I convert this into a working equation wherein I can try out different scenarios for the extra regressors to see how the prediction is affected? I'm hoping that the solution is not an equation like this post here . I do have SARIMA models at times with orders like SARIMA(2,0,1)(1,0,1)[12] .
