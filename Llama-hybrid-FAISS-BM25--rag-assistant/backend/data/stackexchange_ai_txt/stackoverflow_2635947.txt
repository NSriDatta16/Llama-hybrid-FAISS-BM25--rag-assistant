I think that non-static variables aren't allowed in interfaces mainly for pragmatic reasons. Multiple inheritance can be more efficient this way and it avoids some ambiguity issues. As the name suggests, an interface just a definition of the operations available on an instance, therefore, it doesn't contain any method implementation. For these reasons, it wouldn't make any sense to allow methods not to be public and variables not to be static. That said, I'm not sure it was a good idea to have different defaults for interfaces than for classes.
