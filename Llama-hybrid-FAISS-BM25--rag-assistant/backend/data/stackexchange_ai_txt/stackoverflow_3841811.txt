Access 2003/2007 : Query to find average of one text field grouped by another in table

So lets say I have a table that looks something like this: ItemName ProductType ---------------------------------------------------------- Name1 Type1 Name2 Type1 Name3 Type1 Name4 Type2 Name5 Type3 and so on for thousands of records. I want a sql statement to find the average number of Names per Types. I want to use it in vba, behind a form. How would I go about this? I have the sneaking suspision that this is something simple that is escaping me right now. EDIT: Sorry....a little unclear. I mean in a table like fashion, have the types listed out with a count for each of the relative Names Averages Type Count of Names ------------------------------------------- Type1 5 Type2 6 so basically see how many names applicable to types, what Inner Select statement should I use to accomplish this? Thanks Justin
