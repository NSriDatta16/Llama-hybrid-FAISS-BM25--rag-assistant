Decision function of GLM itself does not depend on the choice of "reference level". What can probably depend is your threshold , and I guess it is chosen poorly. For the problem of churn prediction, you probably shouldn't use error rate or confusion matrix at all. You can read here why ROC AUC or other metrics can be preferred to accuracy. Or if you still use error rate, choose your threshold in a wiser way than letting an algorithm maximize F1 metric for a single class. What you need in the end is to decide for each client whether to treat her as ready-to-churn (it would certainly cost you $c_1$) or leave her alone (but if she churns, you lose $c_2$). If it is the case, you will profit from your anti-churn measures iff the probability of churn is higher than $\frac{c_1}{c_2}$. This is the natural threshold for your classification problem, and you can use the corresponding cost function to measure your success. Or if you don't know exact losses $c_1$ and $c_2$ in advance, use ROC AUC, which averages all the possible thresholds. And yes, ROC AUC is not affected by class balance/imbalance.
