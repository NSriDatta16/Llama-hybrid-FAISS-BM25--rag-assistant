freopen solves the easy part. Keeping old stdin around is not hard if you haven't read anything and if you're willing to use POSIX system calls like dup or dup2 . If you're started to read from it, all bets are off. Maybe you can tell us the context in which this problem occurs? I'd encourage you to stick to situations where you're willing to abandon old stdin and stdout and can therefore use freopen .
