I think the first method is easier to read and maintain I've found the opposite to be true. Bear in mind that sometimes more than one event handler will be bound to a given control. Declaring all events in one central place helps to organize the actions taking place on the site. If you need to change something you don't have to search for all places making a call to a function, you simply have to change it in one place. When adding more elements that should have the same functionality you don't have to remember to add the handlers to them; instead, it's often enough to let them declare a class, or even not change them at all because they logically belong to a container element of which all child elements get wired to an action. From an actual code: $$('#itemlist table th > a').invoke('observe', 'click', performSort); This wired an event handler to all column headers in a table to make the table sortable. Imagine the effort to make all column headers sortable separately.
