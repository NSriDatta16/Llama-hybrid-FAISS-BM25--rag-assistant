Gaussian Bayesian Networks and covariance calculation

I have difficulties in understanding the way of calculation of covariance matrix in Gaussian Bayesian Nets (from conditional to joint): The last formula is about to calculates covariance between parent Xi with child Y , right? then what is sigma for? is k standing for all parents of Y or parents of Xi itself?
