In binomial logistic regression, the dependent variable takes only two values, which can be coded 0 and 1. So, it can't be that $Y = b_0 + b_1X$ because that could result in any value. The logit transformation solves this problem. We take the odds to make the value continuous. We take the odds ratio to get a parameter estimate and we take the log of that ratio to make the variable range from negative infinity to infinity and be symmetric around 0 instead of 1.
