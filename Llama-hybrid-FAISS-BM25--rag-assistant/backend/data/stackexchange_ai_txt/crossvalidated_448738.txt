What you described is not an imbalanced classification problem. Positive vs. negative is 2:1 is a well balanced dataset and most models (such as logistic regression) will be perfectly fine. Usually when talking about the imbalanced problem people are talking about 1000:1 or even worse. Think about the credit card fraud detection problem, where most transactions are legitimate, and the fraud transaction ratio can be 1 in 10K. Even in such ratio, logistic regression is also "fine" (depending on how people will use the model output) in most cases. If you want to adjust sensitivity or specificity, try to apply different threshold on the model's output probability. Check ROC curve for details.
