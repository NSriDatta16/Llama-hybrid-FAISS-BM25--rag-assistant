Predicting based upon categorical data and one numeric datatype

I would like to determine what variables from this sample data would be best predictors for CallHandleTimeSeconds. Im thinking it would be a combination of CreditRating, EligibleForAssistance, TypeOfCall, AmtInArrears but unsure about how to do this. I understand the process when all the variables are numeric but categorical variables make my head spin! Please help, because I learn best from examples then I can basically plug and play other categorical variables in the future. Like if CreditRating = Good;, EligibleForAssistance = T, TypeOfCall = 2, and AmtInArrears = 21 then CallHandleTimeSeconds = 432????? CreditRating = c("Poor", "Poor", "Good", "Good", "Average", "Poor", "Average") EligibleForAssistance = c("T", "F", "T", "F", "T", "T","T") Season = c(1,2,1,3,2,3,4) TypeOfCall = c(1,1,2,3,3,1,2) NumberOfDaysAccountOpen = c(111,2321,33,322,2321,343,785) AmtInArrears = c(0,0,0,22,232,2,0) CallHandleTimeSeconds= c(123,232,543,239,230,400,210) SampleData = data.frame(CreditRating, EligibleForAssistance,Season,TypeOfCall,NumberOfDaysAccountOpen,AmtInArrears,CallHandleTimeSeconds) What test would I run? Logistic Regression? Please help.
