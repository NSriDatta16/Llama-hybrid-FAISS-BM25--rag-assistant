Visualize effects of hurdles on user numbers

I have the following data: 1000 users were invited 990 emails delivered successfully 200 visited the system 60 tried to create an account 58 tried to create an account with a valid email 50 successfully created an account (i.e. chose a secure password) 40 participated by voting 10 posted something While I could use a bar graph, the proportions of 60:58:50 would likely be lost. If I'd use a logarithmic scale, the proportions would be distorted and the feeling of numbers would be lost. Is there a good way to represent both the (significant) loss in user attention due to the number of hurdles as well as the effect of each hurdle?
