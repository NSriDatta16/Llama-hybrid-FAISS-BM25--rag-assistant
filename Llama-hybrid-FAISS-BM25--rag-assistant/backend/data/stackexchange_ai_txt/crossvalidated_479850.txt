I found an answer here: https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ale.html We accumulate the average effects across all intervals. The (uncentered) ALE of a feature value that lies, for example, in the third interval is the sum of the effects of the first, second and third intervals. The word Accumulated in ALE reflects this. This effect is centered so that the mean effect is zero. The value of the ALE can be interpreted as the main effect of the feature at a certain value compared to the average prediction of the data. For example, an ALE estimate of -2 at $x_j=3$ means that when the j-th feature has value 3, then the prediction is lower by 2 compared to the average prediction.
