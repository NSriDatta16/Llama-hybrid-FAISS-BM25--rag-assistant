What are the common issues surrounding storage of XML data in a relational databases?

In relation to a discussion started at this question , I've decided to put this up as a community wiki question. The root of the question is, therefore, is it appropriate to store XML data in a relational database? Are there generally better ways to implement the same goal? What database engines provide good support for XML data types (such as SQL Server), and what are the issues surrounding so-called "XML indexes"?
