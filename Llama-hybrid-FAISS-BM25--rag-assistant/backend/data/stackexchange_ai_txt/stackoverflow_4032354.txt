If all you have is just the questions, you can try part of speech tagging (POS) and named entity extraction (NER). The nouns in particular would be of interest. There are a number of open source tools for the same, Brill's POS tager, Lingpipe, Open NLP, etc. However if you also have a corpus from the domain that you are interested in, you can extract the key words and phrases from it by using how different the frequencies of the words and phrases are as compared to some other base corpus. Given a question you can then look for those key words and phrases.
