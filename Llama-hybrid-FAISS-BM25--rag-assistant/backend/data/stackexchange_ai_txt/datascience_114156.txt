Algorithm Comparison for Influencers Ranking

I am working on ranking social influencers on Instagram according to their influential power with the metrics collected below. Metrics collected: username categories (the niche the influencer is in) influencer_type followers follower grow, follower_growth_rate highlightReelCount, igtvVideoCount, postsCount avg_likes, avg_comments likes_comments_ratio (comments per 100 likes, used as an authentic indicator) engagement_rate authentic_engagement (the number of likes and comments that come from real peopleï¼‰ post_per_week 1/post_like,1/post_comment (total 12 latest posts) 1/igtv_likes, 1/igtv_comment (total 12 latest igtvs) Here's what the data looks like: Sample_data The expected results would be something like this and to be shown to brands for them to choose their respective influencers: Expected_results After doing some research, I found a few ranking algorithm approaches which are: Compute the score for influential power with Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and rank them with regression Classified influencers through influencer type and rank them through probability Compute the score for influential power with Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and rank them with machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree and Deep Neural Network Learning to rank algorithms like CatBoost Trending algorithm I would like to ask which algorithm from the 5 options above is more suitable for this project and could you compare and provide the reasons for it ? Any ideas will be much appreciated!
