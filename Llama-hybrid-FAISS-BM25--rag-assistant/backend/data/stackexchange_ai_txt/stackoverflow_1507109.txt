I am no expert, but my understanding that if a Property doesnt change, it should be a constant, not static. In my experience, static is used to denote that only 1 instance of the value exists in the application and is not encouraged within OOP design although its a necessary feature. If you have an class Account which has Properties which never change, what you are looking at is a singleton instance of an immutable class. You can develop this using the static keyword to enforce that only 1 instance of the Account class can be instantiated, or alternatively, declare the Properties as constant. If you have alot of methods which need to be static, then you essentially are designing the program to be non object oriented. At that point, it might be good to decide on using a non-OO programming language. I especially despise static because its a major problem if you have a multithreaded application.
