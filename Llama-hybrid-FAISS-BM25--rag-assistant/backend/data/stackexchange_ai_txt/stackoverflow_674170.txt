The things in square brackets are called attributes, and appear often in C# code. They appear here to have the same meaning, as this is not strictly C++. It has Microsoft extensions to allow integration with the CLI. When you declare such a struct in C or C++, this does not guarantee a particular memory layout. To control that, you need special pragmas to control "packing". These are platform specific. So what you're seeing here is just the CLR equivalent of that. Update: that example is from the documentation for an older version of Microsoft's CLI integration for C++, which was called Managed C++. It was abandoned very quickly and replaced in the next version by C++/CLI - a grafting of CLI features into C++ that is so complete and wide-ranging, it effectively becomes a different language just as C++ is a different language from C.
