Proper way of using recurrent neural network for time series analysis

Recurrent neural networks differ from "regular" ones by the fact that they have a "memory" layer. Due to this layer, recurrent NN's are supposed to be useful in time series modelling. However, I'm not sure I understand correctly how to use them. Let's say I have the following time series (from left to right): [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] , my goal is to predict i -th point using points i-1 and i-2 as an input (for each i>2 ). In a "regular", non-recurring ANN I would do process the data as follows: target| input 2| 1 0 3| 2 1 4| 3 2 5| 4 3 6| 5 4 7| 6 5 I would then create a net with two input and one output node and train it with the data above. How does one need to alter this process (if at all) in the case of recurrent networks?
