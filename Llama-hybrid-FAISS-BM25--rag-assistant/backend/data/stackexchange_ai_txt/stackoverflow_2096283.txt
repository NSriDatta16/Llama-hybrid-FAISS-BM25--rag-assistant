Including jars in classpath on commandline (javac or apt)

trying to run this program. I think that to setup all of the web service stuff I need to run apt. (Although using javac I am having the same issue). I think what I am getting is compile errors. (Shown at bottom). I think what I need to do is include this jar in my class path: jsr181-api.jar (source) . Is there a simple temporary way to do this (on solaris)? I don't want to add it to my bash_rc file (it is there forever). I also know that there is some way to do it using a manifest text file but that seemed complicated so I didn't look into it yet. Can I just do something like: javac HelloImp or ant HelloImp Code: package server; import javax.jws.WebService; @WebService public class HelloImpl { /** * @param name * @return Say hello to the person. */ public String sayHello(String name) { return "Hello, " + name + "!"; } } Compile errors: HelloImpl.java:3: package javax.jws does not exist import javax.jws.WebService; ^ HelloImpl.java:5: cannot find symbol symbol: class WebService @WebService ^ 2 errors Update: Cool that is wrapped up but it is still not quite working. I have created a new question to keep things nice and organized:
