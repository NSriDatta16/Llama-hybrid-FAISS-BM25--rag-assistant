Is there a metric to compare machine learning models which takes into account how many trainable parameters they have?

Assume we have two models for the same task. One with 1K parameters and one with 1M and they achieve accuracy as follows Model Params Accuracy small 1 000 0.8 big 1 000 000 0.9 I would like to compare them is terms of price/time necessary to achieve given accuracy. Is there some kind of an established metric to compare two models with regard to their size? Obviously accuracy divided by number of params would be biased towards small models.
