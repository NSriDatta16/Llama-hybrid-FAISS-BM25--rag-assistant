Determine 'w' and 'b' in hard margin SVM

I have been asked the following question related to SVM (Hard Margin) in the exam, and I failed to answer it. Can anyone help me find the solution? Consider the dataset M : \begin{align*} & \left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^T, 1\right), \\ & \left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}^T, 1\right), \\ & \left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}^T, -1\right), \\ & \left(\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^T, -1\right) \end{align*} My approach was to sketch it and draw the marginal plane, then identify support vectors using my intuition (looking at the sketch). After that, I created a hyperplane that was the midpoint of both marginal planes and found its slope and y-intercept, but still, my answer was wrong. I am very new to machine learning so any help would be appreciated. I also tried the solution with sklearn library and the values of w = [-2 2] and b = 3 This is something similar but it didn't work in my case: Support Vector Machine - Calculate w by hand .
