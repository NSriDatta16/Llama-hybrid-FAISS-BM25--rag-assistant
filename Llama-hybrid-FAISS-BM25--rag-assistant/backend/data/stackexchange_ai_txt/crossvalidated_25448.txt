I still like DeGroot / Schervish. Please, take a look: http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistics-Edition-Morris-DeGroot/dp/0321500466 It is highly self-contained, starting with basic set theory, covering all the standard material on probability (without measure theory). After that, the inference part shines, with excellent explanations of sufficiency, estimation, the Neyman-Pearson lemma, hypothesis testing. He goes through nonparametric methods and ANOVA at the end of the book. DeGroot writing is not fast paced and is extremely clear. Since he was a Bayesian statistician (as is Schervish), the discussion of Bayesian topics is more detailed than we usually see in other books at the same level. The third edition covers simulation at the end, including MCMC tools.
