AD(D)D - Attention Deficit (Driven) Development In which you: randomly work on whichever portion of the application attracts your attention at the time work on features for whichever user squawks the loudest (until someone else squawks louder) run down rabbit trails in the code, forget the path you took to get there, and come out at some completely different place and solving some completely different problem "refactor" code by changing its behavior without a solid grasp of what it is actually supposed to do or whether it still works when you are finished - but if it doesn't, you might get around to fixing it if somebody squawks loud enough
