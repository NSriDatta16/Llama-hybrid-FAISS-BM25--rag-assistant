Generally you are correct, if you are initially pulling the page from the server, why make another trip to get more data? But, if the data is large, then you might as well have the page load so end users can see something, then pull the data. The data might be pulled Ajax wise because a similar data retrieval method is used often on the page. Why write a seperate data pull mechanism for the initial load if you are going to be doing a few Ajax loads anyways. Plus, always remember that demos are just that, demos. The Nerd Dinner guys were probably more interested in showing how to use AJAX with MVC than they were about other priorities. Anyway, good catch.
