Hash-bang #! URL's can be indexed by Google, that's kinda the whole point of them otherwise people would just use hash # on it's own. I think the idea is that Google see's the #! URL and converts it into a querystring parameter, eg. example.com/#!/products/123/ipod-nano-32gb becomes example.com/?_escaped_fragment_=/products/123/ipod-nano-32gb but users still use the hash-bang URL. You program the server to response to the ?_escaped_fragment_ parameter, but JavaScript user get redirected to the proper #! URL. Check out Google specification here http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html I don't think it's a good idea to use both types of URL, as you'd have two URL's being posted on blogs, Twitter etc. by users for the same page, would also be a nightmare to write the code to handle it reliably. You'd probably have to settle for hash-bangs for now until HTML5 History API is more broadly supported.
