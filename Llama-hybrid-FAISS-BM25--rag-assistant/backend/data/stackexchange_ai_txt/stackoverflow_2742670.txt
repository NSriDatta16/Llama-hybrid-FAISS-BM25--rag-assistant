NakedObjects (NO) are good for rapid prototyping. You can concentrate on Domain Model while not paying attention to GUI, DB and other parts of your solution. For production it requires alot of improvements (bugs fixing, data mapping, gui, etc.) in NakedObjects framework itself. So if you need to get some kind of "proof of concept" for your solution, you may use NO. But for production be ready to invest resources into development of NO framework. BTW, recently we are working on creating DnD viewer based on GWT for NO 4.0.
