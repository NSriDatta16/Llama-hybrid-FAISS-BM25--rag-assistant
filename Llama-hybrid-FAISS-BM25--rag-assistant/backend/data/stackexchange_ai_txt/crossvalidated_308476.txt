Yes, if the test set performance does not dip below the training set performance under any circumstances, then you don't have over-fitting.. But it was still the right move to measure performance on unseen data. That should always be done. Training set performance is much more optional, most of the time you wouldn't even look at it. I'm not entirely sure what you mean with ground truth data of the earth that composes your training set but that it seems you later divided into training set and test-set. It matters how you do this division. You cannot expect to train only on data regarding Europe and test on Asia for example. Your training data would not be representative of the test cases. (But as your test performance is good, you seem to be fine here.) PS. PCA wouldn't sort your variables in order of importance. Importance would be defined in terms of how indicative they are of the class label and PCA does not look at the class label.
