I'm not desiring to become a programmer with varied and marketable skills, so I'd rather avoid spending time learning things that won't apply to this project. In that case, skip .Net. It'll take you time to learn it well enough to do a good job. Since you mentioned you have (perhaps minimal) C++ experience, I'd maybe use Qt instead with the aid of Qt Designer to layout the GUI. From that point the rest of the app should be much like the stuff you've already done. Unless you know what your doing with .Net, you'll end up with wildly unmaintainable code very, very quickly. I blame Visual Studio for this. By default, it encourages a "drag this thingy here, drop that there, double click and write code" approach to coding that usually results in a horrendous mess. If you insist that you want C#/.Net anyway, I encourage you to start at the backend and work your way forward. Take the time to model your entities and your data access and your business layer before you even think about GUI. You may even take this a step further and write two project. One would be your dll, containing business and data access logic. The other would be your executable, where you wire your UI events into the dll's api. Good luck.
