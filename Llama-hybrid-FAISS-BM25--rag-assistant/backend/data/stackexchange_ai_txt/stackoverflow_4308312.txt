If you want to do named entity recognition (NER) using PHP, you'll need to either call out to an external NER package or make use of an online natural language processing API . APIs NLP API are listed below. Complexity Intelligence and Alchemy API will probably be moderately easier to use for beginners than OpenCalais. Complexity Intelligence - see the PHP named entity tagging sample code here . Alchemy API - download their PHP SDK here . OpenCalais - see the PHP sample code here . No Code API - by using their api-calls provide text which u need to process. 10K free requests is quite enough for checking any hypothesis. NER Packages A few software packages you can use for NER are: Stanford CoreNLP (Java) LingPipe (Java) NLTK (Python) OpenNLP (Java) YamCha (C++) Of these, Stanford CoreNLP is probably a good place to start. Similar to many NLP APIs, it provides a complete processing pipeline for common tasks such as NER.
