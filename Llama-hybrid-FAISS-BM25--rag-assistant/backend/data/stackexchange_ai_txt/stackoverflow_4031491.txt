If NumberTaken is indexed you could do it with a join on the same table: select T.NumberTaken -1 as MISSING_NUMBER from myTable T left outer join myTable T1 on T.NumberTaken= T1.NumberTaken+1 where T1.NumberTaken is null and t.NumberTaken >= STARTING_NUMBER order by T.NumberTaken EDIT Edited to get 1 too
