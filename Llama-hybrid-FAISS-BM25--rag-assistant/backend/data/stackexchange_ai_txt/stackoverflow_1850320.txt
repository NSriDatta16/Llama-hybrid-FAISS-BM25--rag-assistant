It's like asking what the best practices for putting your socks on is. Some tools have a better chance to work if you put the declaration and comment together and that probably makes the most sense as to what people expect. But commenting randomly is pointless. Having in/out stuff especially, unless you have a tool which uses that. Any programmer can see what he or she needs from the declaration, and same applies to the language in general. Nothing is more useless than comments like //this is the constructor. Rather try to keep the code itself as simple as possible with names that make sense and a general organization to the code and if there is anything strange write a real paragraph about it like //We had to do this because some weird api we use requires certain things //that caused some other things to break and calls to it get optimized out sometimes //so don't take out these method calls or the optimizer optimizes out //some other stuff and the whole program stops working
