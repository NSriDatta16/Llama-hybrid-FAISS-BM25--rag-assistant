You're using the wrong hammer to pound that screw in. A single string in a database column isn't the way to store that data. You can't easily get at the part you care about, which is the individual words. There is a lot of research into the problem of comparison of text. If you're serious about this need, you'll want to start reading about the variety of techniques in that problem domain. The first clue is that you want to access / index the data not by complete text string, but by word or sentence fragment (unless you're interested in words that are spelled similarly being matched together, which is harder). As an example of one technique, generate a chain out of your sentences by grabbing overlapping sets of three words, and store the chain. Then you can search for entries that have a large number of chain segments in common. A set of chain segments for your statements above would be: row_1 = this is about sports row_2 = this is about study row_3 = this is about study and sports this is about (3 matches) is about sports is about study (2 matches) about study and study and sports
