nunit2 Nant task always returns exit code 0 (TeamCity 5.0)

I just cannot for the life of me get my nant build file to terminate upon a test failure and return (thus preventing the packaging and artifact step from running) This is the unit part of the nant file: And regardless what combination of true/false i set the haltonfailure, failonerror, failonfailureatend properties to, the result is always this: [11:15:09]: Some tests has failed in C:\Build\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\ba5b94566a814a34\Code\AppMonApiTests\bin\Release\AppMonApiTests.dll, tests run terminated. [11:15:09]: NUnit Launcher exited with code: 1 [11:15:09]: Exit code 0 will be returned.1 Please help as i don't want to be publishing binarys where the unit tests have failed!!! TeamCity 5.0 build 10669 AppMonApiTests.dll references nunit.framework.dll v2.5.3.9345 unit isn't installed on the build server or GAC'd Using Nant-0.85 and Nantcontrib-0.85 Thanks, Jonathan
