How does changing GAN training method afftects the GAN?

I am training a GAN in which I am optimizing or reducing the loss of the generator and the discriminator simultaneously. However, the images generated are very noisy. What could be the hidden reason? Why the simultaneous optimization of the loss functions does not ensure good images in GAN? Generally GANs are trained by optimizing the loss functions alternatively.
