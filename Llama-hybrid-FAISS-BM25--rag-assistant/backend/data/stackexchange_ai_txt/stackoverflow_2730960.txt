I would discourage use of threads for this usage, and use an Asynchronous API for data retrieval on the network. NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:URL]; This function call sends some data out a socket then sits there and locks the thread until it receives a response. If you don't make any synchronous calls you don't have to worry as much about locking the UI Thread and your problem becomes much simpler. I would use the ASIHTTP Library or NSURLConnection to access your data, and do all of your updating on one thread. There is a slightly learning curve with the API's but it's substantially smaller than managing threads correctly. I would strongly recommend the ASIHTTP Library, it just rocks. You can set the request delegate to a progress widget and throttle your connection for edge usage.
