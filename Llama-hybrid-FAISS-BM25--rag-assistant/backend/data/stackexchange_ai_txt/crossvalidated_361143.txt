Found this source , see paragraph 1 on page 4. Although the subject is about pooled logistic regression, as opposed to a poisson model, I believe the argument is the same. "While there may be concern with the PLR regarding the dependence of multiple records within an individual contributing to several intervals, Allison (2010) has noted that in working with a dataset with multiple records for intervals within each individual there is no inflation of test statistics resulting from a lack of independence. This property is due to the fact that the likelihood factors into a distinct term for each interval. Allison also cautioned that this conclusion may not apply when the dataset includes multiple events for each individual."
