Updated: How to do a sensitivity analysis for an ordered logistic regression in R?

How would you do an robustness or sensitivity analysis for an ordered logistic regression? Can it be done by replacing the control variables with others that are similar in the model? For instance replace health with hampered in dayli life or replaceing the NA's with 0? If you can also recommend any textbook, video, link.. any type of source I really appreciate! I'm using the R program and the MASS::polr. EDIT 1: More prcisely I want to check my models for robustness by doing a sensitivity analysis and reverse causality. Since my dependent variable is ordered an the variable of interest is a dummy I considered to do a binary logit, however I'm indoubt to use the ordered variable as independent in a binary logit. Will it be a good way to check for reverse causality?
