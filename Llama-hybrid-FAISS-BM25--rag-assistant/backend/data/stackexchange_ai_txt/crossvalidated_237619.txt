Ratio of Means or Mean of Ratios? Inference Across Groups

Edit: For the purposes of the bounty, it would suffice to answer my third question below for the statistic $\hat{P}_g$. I have two groups $g \in \{1, 2\}$ and customers $i$ within those groups who generate revenue $R_{ig} \in \mathbb{R}^+$ by purchasing a quantity $Q_{ig} \in \mathbb{R}^+$. There is price discrimination, so the effective price per unit of the good for each customer, $P_{ig}$, is different. An "average" price can be estimated for each group in at least two ways: as $\hat{P}_g = \dfrac{\sum_iR_{ig}}{\sum_iQ_{ig}}$. By dividing by the sample size, $N_g$, this can be seen to be equivalent to the ratio estimator $\hat{P}_g = \dfrac{\overline{R}_{g}}{\overline{Q}_{g}}$, or as $\tilde{P}_g = \dfrac{1}{N_g}\sum_i{\dfrac{R_{ig}}{Q_{ig}}}$. I have several questions: Is there a difference in interpretation between the two estimators $\hat{P}_g$ and $\tilde{P}_g$ -- are they estimating the same underlying population quantity? I came across this , but there does not appear to be a version of this online. From a statistical point of view, is one of the estimators better than the other (for the common or for their respective population quantities), especially in terms of their bias properties? Lastly, for either one of the estimators, what is the right way to compare them across groups to test the hypothesis that $P_1 = P_2$? Is there a variance estimator for either of the two estimators? I want to be able to say that the price is, on average, the same across the two groups. I believe this is related to the Fieller-Creasy class of problems , but I am not familiar with the problem family.
