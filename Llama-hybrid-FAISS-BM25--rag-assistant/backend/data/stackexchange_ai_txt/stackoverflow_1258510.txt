From what I see, the first example only accesses thread-local storage and stack-based variables, while the second one only accesses stack-based variables. Both should be thread-safe. I can't tell if GetByID is thread safe or not. Look to see if it accesses any shared/static resources. If it does, it's not thread-safe without some additional code to protect those resources.
