You could try the new machine learning library called ML-Flex (http://mlflex.sourceforge.net). It is designed to execute a variety of ensemble methods and can also provide side-by-side comparisons when different algorithm parameters are used (though perhaps not exactly as you desire). If you're interested, give it a try and provide any feedback you may have. Full disclosure: I am the author of this package.
