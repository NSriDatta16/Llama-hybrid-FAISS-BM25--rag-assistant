Question 1: Why should "users agent" modify this parameter? What are the reason for a web browser not to set this parameter? Well, web browsers don't really have a reason not to set this. You've been told to avoid it because of the same reason some browsers would avoid it, wich is misuse. Like saving important session info in the URL. You shouldn't try and avoid it using, you should just use it responsibly. And not have to use any 'gimmick'. For example, its very common to use it as a 'Resume' navigation. Say for instance someones session expired using your webpage. You could send them to the login credentials page. And then redirect them to the requested URL. The same goes when they are trying to first access your webpage without passing through the login screen. Start browser (No info saved in cookies o sessions) Go to www.YourApp.com/restrictedZone.php Redirect to login Login challenge passed Redirect to restricted zone instead of 'index.php' or 'home.php' You should just make sure you check for a valid session on ALL of your 'restricted zone' pages.
