This is using a part of the C programming language that is not included in C++, it's called "compound literal". g++ -ansi will diagnose this, saying warning: ISO C++ forbids compound-literals This is not a part of C++0x. The C++0x compatible syntax would have been hexpression.insert(hexpression.begin() + starti, HybridExpression{NULL, en}); To quote the C99 standard, paragraph 6.5.2.5: A postfix expression that consists of a parenthesized type name followed by a brace-enclosed list of initializers is a compound literal. It provides an unnamed object whose value is given by the initializer list.
