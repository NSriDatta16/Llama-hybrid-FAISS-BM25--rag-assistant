To understand when to use lowercase or uppercase, we need to know what is represented in X_train or X_test . It is a capital letter X to represent a 2-D matrix. And for y_train and y_test , it is a small letter y to represent a 1-D vector. Mathematically, it is a common notation for Linear Algebra to use uppercase Latin letters for matrices (e.g. matrix X) and lowercase Latin letters for vectors (vector y). In data science, the feature matrix X is a collection of many columns of feature values. For example a df with 1 target, 20 features and 1000 data records will have the shape of shape (1000, 21). So we will define the feature matrix X to have the shape (1000, 20). Whereas the target label y is a column of values having the shape (1000, 1). After applying train_test_split() on X and y with test_size=0.25 , I would expect: X_train to be a 2-D matrix (750, 20) y_train to be a 1-D vector (750, 1)
