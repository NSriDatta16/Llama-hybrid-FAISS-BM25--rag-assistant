It sure looks like there's no way to do this. I just had exactly this problem with a fresh download of the Eclipse Java IDE (Ganymede SR2). I didn't want Mylyn, but I didn't want "Eclipse Classic", either, because the download was twice the size, I presume because it includes source. The apparent solution was to update everything and restart Eclipse, after which the "Uninstall..." button became enabled for the Mylyn plugins. Unfortunately, this only uninstalled the most recent, updated version (3.0.11 IIRC), reverting to the un-uninstallable 3.0.5.
