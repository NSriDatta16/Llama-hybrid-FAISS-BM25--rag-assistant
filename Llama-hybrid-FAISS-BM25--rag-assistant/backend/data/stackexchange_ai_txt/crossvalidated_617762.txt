Here are a couple of charts I did for another purpose (the law of the iterated logarithm) but they may also help here. Both have $100$ different simulations of over $10,000$ cases of independent noise with mean $\mu=0$ and variance $\sigma^2=1$ so standard deviation $\sigma=1$ noise. The $100$ simulations are the same in both charts (see the upper grey line on the left or yellow in the middle), but you get a very different perspective depending on whether you are looking at the averages or the sums. The first chart shows the cumulated averages. These tend to converge to $0$ as the sample size increases (a law of large numbers result), and the variance of the average is $\frac1n$ so the standard deviation of the average is $\frac1{\sqrt{n}}$ , both decreasing with $n$ . The second chart shows the cumulated sums. These do not converge as the sample size increases. The variance of the sum is the sum of the variances so $n$ here and thus the standard deviation of the sum is ${\sqrt{n}}$ , both increasing with $n$ .
