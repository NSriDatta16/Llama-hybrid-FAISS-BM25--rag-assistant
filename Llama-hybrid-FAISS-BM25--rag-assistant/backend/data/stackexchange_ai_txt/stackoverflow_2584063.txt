yes, binary files are more compact, but you lose portability and there are various other potential problems too, so unless your data files are problematically huge, or slow to export/import, it's a good idea to stick with text if you can (you can always compress them for storage, e.g. with zip) open you file with "wb" instead of "w" and use fwrite() - you no longer have "lines" in your file - it will just be a stream of (binary) floating point values you may be getting confused between double and long double - a long double can be up to 16 bytes in size and have a precision of up to around 32 digits (however this is implementation-dependent - long double can commonly be 10, 12 or 16 bytes). A double is usually 8 bytes and has a precision of around 16 digits. MATLAB may not be able to cope with long double (as it is not well standardized) so you probably just want to write doubles to your data file, e.g. for (i = 0; i
