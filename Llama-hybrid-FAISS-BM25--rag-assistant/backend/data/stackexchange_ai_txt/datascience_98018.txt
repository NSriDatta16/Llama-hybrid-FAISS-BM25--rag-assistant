Epoch One epoch leads to underfitting of the curve in the graph (below). Increasing number of epochs helps to increase number of times the weight are changed in the neural network and the curve goes from underfitting to optimal to overfitting curve. Number of epochs is related to how diverse your data is. Read this article for better understanding Batch size Good batch size can really speed up your training and have better performance Finding the right batch size is usually through trial and error. 32 is a good batch size to start with and keep increasing in multiples of two. There are few batch finders in Python like rossmann_bs_finder.py This article can help you better understand batch size, How to get 4x speedup and better generalization using the right batch size
