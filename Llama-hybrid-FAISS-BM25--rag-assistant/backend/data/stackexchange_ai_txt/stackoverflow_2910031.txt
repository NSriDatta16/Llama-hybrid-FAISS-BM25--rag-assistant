How many bugs have been introduced because of incorrectly written GOTOs? How much money did they cost the company? Turn the issue into something concrete, rather than "this feels bad". Once you can get it recognized as a problem by the people in charge, turn it into a policy like, "no new GOTOs for anything except simplifying the exit logic for a function", or "no new GOTOs for any functions that don't have 100% unit test coverage". Over time, tighten the policies.
