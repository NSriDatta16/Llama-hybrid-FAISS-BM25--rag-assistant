Do you know any alternative to NDepend for architects?

do you know any software similar to NDepend? I've got it just recently, and found it very useful. It helped me a lot, but for now i don't have a possibility to buy a professional version. So, is there any alternative (maybe, open-source)? Preferably, free. But not necessarily. Maybe, with a little bit more fitting price for a single-developer, not a team. Requirements for this software: Build dependency diagrams Retrieve code metrics Display comments coverage (so far)
