You don't need to use addFieldToFilter . now the solution: attributes name is known as code in magento, you just need to use the code below to get all of the products which have a specific attribute as an array $prodsArray=Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection() ->addAttributeToFilter('custom_attribute_code') ->getItems(); you can also specify certain conditions for attribute's value in addAttributeToFilter in the second parameter of addAttributeToFilter. you can find this method in this file (for further study): app/code/core/Mage/Eav/Model/Entity/Collection/Abstract.php
