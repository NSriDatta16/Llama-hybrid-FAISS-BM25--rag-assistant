I'm not sure that this answers your question, but I had a similar issue. My problem was that dragging vertical JScrollPane knob made JList to scroll by blocks instead of by units, that is, the top cell was always displayed in whole except when list was scrolled to the bottom. Curiously, this happened only when using Windows look and feel. By using default L&F I got the behavior I wanted. And after much digging, I found this post which revealed that there is L&F property for that. By default this is true for Windows L&F, but you can set it to false like this: UIManager.put("List.lockToPositionOnScroll", Boolean.FALSE);
