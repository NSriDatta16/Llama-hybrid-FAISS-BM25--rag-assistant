Time series classification and auto correlation

I am trying to understand time series data and data mining. I am trying to classify EEG data set. The classes are known in advance for the data set and the algorithm is trained on the example data set. I understand that the goal is first to understand the distinctive features distinguishing classes from each other and then classify every new row that gets into the system. Does auto correlation make it hard to understand the nature or characteristics of the data?
