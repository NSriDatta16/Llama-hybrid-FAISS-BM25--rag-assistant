Implement drag and drop in an iPad split view app?

I'm quite a n00b at iPhone and iPad development, so any advice would be gratefully received. I want to create a split-view iPad app, where users can drag an image out of the root view controller and place it in the detail view. Once that's been done, ideally the user would be able to manipulate the image by moving it about and resizing it. Any pointers to the best way to achieve this? Many thanks!
