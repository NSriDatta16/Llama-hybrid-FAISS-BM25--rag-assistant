Is there any way to more harshly penalise mis-classification of 3s and 8s, or 1s and 7s during the training process? Yes by setting weights for the loss function but this would likely lead to lower scores in the other numbers. Firstly I note you have just train and test. Standard practise is to do the split as train validation and test. (usually by splitting the training into train and validation) Then you can perform cross validation. Additionally you should stratify (have same representation of classes) in each dataset. As to your main question, several Approaches: More augmentation including elastic distortion, brightness and cutouts Cross Validation Use earlystopping into the method (potentially your model is overfitting the training data) Ensemble more neural networks Data-exploration - see which images are failing in the validation and look for patterns Test time augmentation Perform augmentation on your validation (and test) images and take an average.
