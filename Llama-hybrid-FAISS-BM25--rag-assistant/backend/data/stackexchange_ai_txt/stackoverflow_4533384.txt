How does Rails find models and controllers? How can I get it to load more models?

I'm trying to create a non-ActiveRecord model in app/models/gamestate.rb . Then inside my controller (PlayController) I should be able to do GameState.new , right? No go: NameError (uninitialized constant PlayController::GameState): app/controllers/play_controller.rb:23:in `play' (at least in the development environment) But! If I do have a model called app/models/play.rb , then it's automatically loaded and I can do Play.new . So my question is: how does Rails know which classes to load? What sort of name mangling does it do to get from play#action to PlayController to app/controllers/play_controller.rb to app/models/play.rb ? It seems awfully fragile, but maybe a better understanding of how this works would help. And finally, how can I get it to load app/models/gamestate.rb ?
