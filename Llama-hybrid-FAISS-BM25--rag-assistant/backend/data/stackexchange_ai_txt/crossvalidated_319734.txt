The very first thing you can tell based on your ACF is that your time series is blatantly, obviously seasonal. Which is not overly surprising for monthly temperature data. So you should take seasonal differences and then examine (P)ACF plots for the seasonally differenced data. Better yet, use information criteria instead of the outdated Box-Jenkins approach. I recommend Forecasting: Principles and Practice , 2nd ed., by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman as an excellent forecasting textbook.
