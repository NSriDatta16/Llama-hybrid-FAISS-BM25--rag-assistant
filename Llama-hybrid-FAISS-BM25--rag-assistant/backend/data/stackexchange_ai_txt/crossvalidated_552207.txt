Correlation analysis on a very small dataset

I am doing a research on (something like) the relationship between hospital's personnel job satisfaction(as individuals) and the overall performance score of the given hospital(as a whole). the number of hospitals on which I am conducting the research is 3 with each having a different number of personnel. So, what I had in mind as to the statistical test for the task was to investigate the correlation between the average job satisfaction of each hospital and its performance score(3 rows of data (n-hospitals=3)) using the Pearson correlation test. But I'm inclined to think that this isn't a good approach due to the small set of data, and I should use anova test instead. which approach should I adapt? Thanks in advance.
