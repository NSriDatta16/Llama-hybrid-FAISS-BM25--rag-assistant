Multivariate logit: evaluate contributions of predictors to estimated probabilities

In a logistic regression with multiple regressors, is there a way to analyze the contribution of the predictors on the dependent variable? (e.g. how would one understand why did the probabilities spike at certain point). Maybe one could use marginal probabilities at a given point? Would using probit make any difference?
