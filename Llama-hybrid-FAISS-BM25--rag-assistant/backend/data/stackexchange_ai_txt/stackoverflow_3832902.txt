Boost.Fusion offers the BOOST_FUSION_ADAPT_STRUCT macro, which can turn any struct into a Fusion sequence, which Fusion can then iterate over (as demoed in the Quick Start ). Another option is to use a third-party C++ reflection library like Reflex to iterate over a struct's members. However, all of this may be overkill for your purposes; manually listing each of the class's members may be less elegant, but it's much simpler, and simplicity in coding is important.
