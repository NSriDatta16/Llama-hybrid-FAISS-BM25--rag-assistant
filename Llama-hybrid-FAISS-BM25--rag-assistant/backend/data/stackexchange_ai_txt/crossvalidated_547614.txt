Geometric mean vs geometric mean rate of return

Consider the rate of return for an investment in year 2000 increased by 105% and in 2001 it increased to 42%. what is the average rate of return in 2000-01. I'm confused as to which formula to use (1) Simple GM: (1.05*.42)^0.5= 0.66= 66% or (2) Geometric average return = ((1+1.05)*(1+0.42))^0.5-1 = 0.706 which formula should be used?
