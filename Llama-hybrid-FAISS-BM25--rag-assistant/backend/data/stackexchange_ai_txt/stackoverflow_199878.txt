Detecting and embedding Flash within a web document is a surprisingly difficult task. I was very disappointed with the quality and non-standards compliant markup generated from both SWFObject and Adobe's solutions. Additionally, my testing found Adobe's auto updater to be inconsistent and unreliable. The JavaScript Flash Detection Library (Flash Detect) and JavaScript Flash HTML Generator Library (Flash TML) are a legible, maintainable and standards compliant markup solution. -"Luke read the source!"
