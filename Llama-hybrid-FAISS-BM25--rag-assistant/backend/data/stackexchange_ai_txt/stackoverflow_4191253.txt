udp packet fragmentation for raw sockets

Follow-up of question packet fragmentation for raw sockets If I have a raw socket implemented as such: if ((sip_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)) how can I set the ipHdr->fragment_offset (16 bits including 3 bit flags) if I have a packet of size 1756 (not including the IP header)? Do I need to prepare two packets-one of size 1480 and another of size 276, and then slap IP headers on both packets? Can anyone point to an example code for this?
