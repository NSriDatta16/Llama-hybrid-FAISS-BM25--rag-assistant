With labels, you mainly encounter two problems with treed based algorithms that can overfit in both cases: Rare values Cardinality Rare values are labels/ categories within a categorical variable that are only present for a small percentage of the observations. There is no rule of thumb to determine how small is a small percentage, but typically, any value below 5% may cause over-fitting in trees. High Cardinality: One approach that is heavily used in Kaggle competitions, is to replace each label of the categorical variable by the count, this is the number of times each label appears in the dataset. There's a great course on Feature Engineering on Udemy. Dr. Soledad Galli goes into much detail of rare values and cardinality. In particular, she investigates different approaches to a Kaggle dataset from Mercedes Benz. Pretty interesting and advanced. https://www.udemy.com/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning/learn/v4/overview
