How does accuracy increase in ensemble learning?

I have a doubt from a passage in the ensemble learning chapter of Aurelien Geron's book "hands on machine learning... ". I do not understand If you do the math, you will find that the probability of obtaining a majority of heads after 1,000 tosses is close to 75%. The more you toss the coin, the higher the probability (e.g., with 10,000 tosses, the probability climbs over 97%). Is it not still 51%? How does it increase to 75%?
