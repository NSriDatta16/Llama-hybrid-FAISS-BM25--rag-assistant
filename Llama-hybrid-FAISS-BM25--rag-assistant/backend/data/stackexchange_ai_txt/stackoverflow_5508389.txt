For example, if you'd like to block access to GoogleBot throughout your entire server (which may be comprised of hundreds of virtual hosts), you can add this to your httpd.conf file: #setup the root dir RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Googlebot RewriteRule .* - [F,L] This will send a HTTP 403 Forbidden to anyone who comes in with Googlebot in their user agent string. And this rewrite condition will be applied to ALL virtual hosts, by virtue of applying this to the "/" folder.
