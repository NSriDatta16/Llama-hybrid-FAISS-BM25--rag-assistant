Estimating covariance matrix of irregularly updated time series

I would like to estimate the covariance matrix of returns from a set of time series that don't get updated regularly. To be precise, in my case all of the series fall into 2 classes. Class A gets updated daily and class B once every few days (but all at the same time). The underlying assumption is the actual hidden variables are a multidimensional random walk but some of the variables are revealed only at some points in time. Is there a standard method of modeling such data?
