Are there any Quality Management tools other than SonarQube

We in our organization are trying to implement a source code quality management tool. SonarQube is one such tool that we have come across, and it's quite full of features and is phenomenal. We want to compare it with its peers, if there are any, before we actually implement it. Are there any good contenders to Sonar's capabilities and features?
