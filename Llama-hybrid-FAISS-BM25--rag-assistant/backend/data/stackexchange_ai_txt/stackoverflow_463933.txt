How to suppress javascript errors for sites I'm not developing?

I like to keep javascript debugging enabled in my browser so when I'm developing my own code I can instantly see when I've made an error. Of course this means I see errors on apple.com, microsoft.com, stackoverflow.com, cnn.com, facebook.com. Its quite fun sometimes to see just how much awful code there is out there being run by major sites but sometimes it gets really annoyed. I've wondered for YEARS how to change this but never really got around to it. Its particularly annoying today and I'd really like to know of any solutions. The only solution I have is : use a different browser for everyday browsing. I'm hopin theres some quick and easy plugin someone can direct me to where I can toggle it on and off based upon the domain i'm on. Edit: I generally use IE7 for everyday browsing
