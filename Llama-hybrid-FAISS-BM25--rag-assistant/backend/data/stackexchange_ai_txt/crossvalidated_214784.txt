If the two distributions match a 'normal' circular distribution (Von Mises distribution), you can use a Watson two test, that is available for R at least (package 'circular' or 'circstats'). If they are not normal, I don't know of a non-parametric alternative, but you can bootstrap a 95% confidence interval of average direction in both groups. All of this assumes that kidney rotation spans a full 360 degrees, or a substantial part of it. If this is not the case, a simple t-test is just fine, as suggested above.
