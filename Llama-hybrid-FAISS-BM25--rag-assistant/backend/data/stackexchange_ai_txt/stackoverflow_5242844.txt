As far as I know Chrome Extensions are merely glorified javascript snippets. With the limitations of javascript and chrome's sandboxing I doubt you can do File I/O let alone talking to a native application. I'd say the best you can do use Chrome's LocalStorage or WebDatabase APIs. You'll have to poke around to see where these things are actually stored (hacky hacky).
