I think you're okay in this case for three reasons: You're not actually adjusting your priors in response to your results. If you said something like, "I use XYZ priors and depending on the rate of convergence and my DIC results, I then modify my prior by ABC," then I'd say you were committing a no-no, but in this case it sounds like you really are not doing that. In a Bayesian context, priors are explicit. So it's possible for you to tweak your priors improperly, but the resultant priors will always be visible for inspection by others who can question why you have those particular priors. Maybe I'm naive here, since it's easy to glance at something like a prior and say, "Hmm, looks reasonable" simply because someone offered it up, but... I think what you're doing is related to Gelman's (and others') advice to build up a JAGS model piece-by-piece, first working with synthetic data, then real data, to make sure you don't have a specification error. That's not really a factor in frequentist methodology, and it's not really an experimental methodology. Then again, I'm still learning this stuff myself. P.S. When you say you originally rig it to converge quickly with "informative priors", do you mean actually informative priors that are motivated by the problem at hand, or just priors that for arbitrary reasons strongly push/restrict the posterior to speed up "convergence" to some arbitrary point? If it's the first case, why are you then moving away from these (motivated) priors?
