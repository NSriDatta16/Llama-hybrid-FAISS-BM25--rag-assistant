fill listbox in qt creator

I'm working on Qt Creator and I am completely new to it. I want to have a list box which is loaded with the data when I run the program and I choose a value from the list box and press button and do some operation on that selected value. Is there any option for a list box in Qt creator? I have seen drag and drop listbox and listview but dont know which to use and how to use it . Also, where to write a code to load the list automatically? My project has many files like: mainwindow.h mainwindow.cpp mainwindow.ui mainwindow.c main.c Could someone help me with this listbox thing and also help with the syntax. Thanks
