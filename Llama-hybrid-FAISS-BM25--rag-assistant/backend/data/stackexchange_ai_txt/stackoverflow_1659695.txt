Useful things to put in the user stream segment of minidumps

I am interested in what useful things developers put in the user stream data structure that can be embedded in minidumps. MSDN describes the parameter for MiniDumpWriteDump as such: PMINIDUMP_USER_STREAM_INFORMATION UserStreamParam and describes the parameter thusly: UserStreamParam [in] Pointer to an array of MINIDUMP_USER_STREAM_INFORMATION structures. If the value of this parameter is NULL, no user-defined information is included in the minidump file. I was considering embedding the last n log lines of my program in a user stream since testers tend not to send the properly formatted logs with all bugs all the time. Also, I could put hardware specs (memory, CPU, video, etc) in that section. What else have people used the user stream segment for?
