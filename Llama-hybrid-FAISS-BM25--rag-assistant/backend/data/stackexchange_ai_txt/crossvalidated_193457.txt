Predict the average stay of customers

This is my data: customers subscribing to a service and more or less regularly having activities on that service. I want to calculate an average length of stay for the customers using the service. I have made a segmentation of my customers into a few groups, showing different behaviour. I fit each group to a gamma or geometric distributions. Typically, the geometric customer will be very active at the beginning then the amount of activity will decrease until fade. The gamma customers will be only a few active at the beginning then increase its activity to a peak before to slowly decreasing until fade. I calculate the mean of the fitted distribution for each of the groups. This I what I called my average stay for the group. For each group, I now can define a 25/75% average stay threshold. I do a multinomial classification to get the probability of new individuals to belong to one of the groups. I use the following formula, for a new customer $x$: $$ AvgStay(x) = \sum_{g \in G} P(x \in g) * AvgStay(g) $$ with $G = \{groups \}$ to give me the average length stay of a customer. Is it possible to do something with the different confidence interval? Like to get the 25% confidence interval, using instead of the average stay function, the 25% interval function?
