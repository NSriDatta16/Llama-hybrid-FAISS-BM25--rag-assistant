Looks like you're having trailing whitespace issues. $ sed -e 's/^\s*$//' livehttp.txt | \ perl -e '$/ = ""; while (<>) { print if /^(GET|POST)/ }' This works by putting Perl's readline operator into paragraph mode (via $/ = "" ), which grabs records a chunk at a time, separated by two or more consecutive newlines. It's nice when it works, but it's a bit brittle. Blank but not empty lines will gum up the works, but sed can clean those up. Equivalent and more concise command: $ sed -e 's/^\s*$//' livehttp.txt | perl -000 -ne 'print if /^(GET|POST)/'
