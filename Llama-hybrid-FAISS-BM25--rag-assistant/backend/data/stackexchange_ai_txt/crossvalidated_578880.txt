Retrieve the original count data. Then treat this as a binomial logistic regression. In R with the glm() function, you can provide a two-column outcome specifying the number of successes and failures for each combination of predictors. You specify the values of X , Y and animal in the corresponding row of the data. Forget trying to force this into a specific acronym like ANOVA. This is just a (generalized) linear model. You specify X and Y and their interaction(s) as predictors. I'd recommend coding the data so that the absence of intervention is the baseline category for X and "no modulator" is the baseline category of Y . You include animal as another categorical predictor in the model. If you include an additive term for animal you allow for differences in percentages under baseline conditions among animals. In R the model then would be something like: glm(c(success, fail) ~ X*Y + animal, data=yourData, family = binomial) That will give a set of interaction coefficients for each of Y1 and Y2 with X , to use for testing your hypotheses. Your sense that normal approximations could work OK in this case might be correct, but if I understand your study properly then the above approach should be unimpeachable.
