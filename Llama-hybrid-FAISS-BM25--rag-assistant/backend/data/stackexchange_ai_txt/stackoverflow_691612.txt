If you are using Open XML (ie docx), there are 2 basic approaches to solving this problem: The first is to do what is necessary so ids point to the correct relationship (eg for images, hyperlinks), and styles are defined etc. A good explanation of what you need to do can be found at http://blogs.msdn.com/ericwhite/archive/2009/02/05/move-insert-delete-paragraphs-in-word-processing-documents-using-the-open-xml-sdk.aspx PowerTools implements that. The second is to use altChunk: http://blogs.msdn.com/ericwhite/archive/2008/10/27/how-to-use-altchunk-for-document-assembly.aspx
