Lotus Notes how to get a calculated value from another form using formula language

I have Lotus Notes application, deployed only as modifications (new forms, views, and adding a button to one of the "standard" views) in the main mail template (R7). All these "new" forms and views are inherited in turn from my main application template. Now, for one of these forms to function properly, it have to have a field, which is different from customer (not end user, but organization) to customer. I do not want to break the inheritance from our template, so we can update the application easily by just sending a new template. So, I can't ask the client admin just to break the inheritance for this particular form, as it will stop all updates (or they have to be done manually). So, let's say I have MainAppForm, which has a calculated field ClientCustomData. I'd like to have another form, which only has only one "default" field ClientCustomData. I can break the inheritance for this second form, as it has no really design elements which may change, and then the client can modify this default value to whatever they need w/o fearing that it'll be overwritten. The question is - how from MainAppForm I can read the value from the other form? Or - is there a way to store 2 data elements only in a mail template (I dunno, shared file, or something), so it becomes available to each user, and MainAppForm can get them, w/o a need to remove the inheritance dependency of MainAppForm from our template. I can envision even a class library with just to functions to return this (I don't know why this approach smells to me). Any best practices or advices?
