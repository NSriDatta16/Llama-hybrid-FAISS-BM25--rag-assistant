you do not want newlines at the end of sentences. sure it's easier to do the 4 things you list, but that is not worth doing it different from how the rest of the world does it (even if the world's reasons are as stupid as the reasoning behind CR LF = newline). and your biggest advantage is not true: Otherwise you end up with conflicts where it just informs you "the following two versions of this huge paragraph are in conflict". How would it know when to be line-based and when to be sentence-based? you can use Meld or some similar diff tool and let it do the work.
