Comparing GLM/Lmer Models

I am struggling with choosing the correct model for my study, and I hoped that maybe someone would be able to help me, or shine some light please :) I have lots of data about vegetation and individual preferences that I am trying to analyse. I tried using a mixed model (lmer) to begin with, with the 3 different fields where I repeated the study as a random effect. I began by making my model including every single interaction, but it was too much, and R gave me this error message: "fixed-effect model matrix is rank deficient so dropping 151 columns / coefficients. Error: Dropping columns failed to produce full column rank design matrix" So I dropped the interactions and just did the other factors. I did one version as a glm without the random effect, and one as an lmer with the random effect. I then tried to compare them using anova, but I don't understand the results, I'll put the code and results below. Please can you guys have a look and tell me what you think, that would be great, Thank you!
