There is still one thing that I know of that a Java applet can do and Silverlight, Flex (non-AIR), etc can't do: Drag and drop from the filesystem. Flex offers a o/s based browse and select filesystem access. Silverlight has a similar functionality. But to the best of my knowledge if you want the user to drag a file from Windows Explorer etc. into a web-site based control, Java applets are pretty much your only choice. You could create a Flex based app using Adobe AIR that can ask the filesystem outside the o/s browse and select dialog but I'm not convinced the AIR install base is adequate yet. Probably depends on your target customer (early adopter, install whatever you say to vs. stable corporate user with IT lockdown on their workstation). If someone knows otherwise for certain, please comment! But to answer the original question, unless you need the drag and drop filesystem to web functionality, I would spend your time on Flex. Silverlight and Java FX can't compete with Flash for market penetration. Since Flex compiles to flash, it has a very high install base (>95% of internet enabled computers) and its base updates to the newest version frequently. Inserting a flash file into a browser is a easier than the arcane art of applets.
