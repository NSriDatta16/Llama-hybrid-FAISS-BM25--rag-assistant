McKay's bivariate Gamma distribution

Given the variables $X$ and $Y$, which are correlated, $X\ge0$, $Y\ge0$ and each follow a gamma distribution with different shape parameters, i.e.,$X\sim\Gamma(a_1,\alpha)$ and $Y\sim\Gamma(a_2,\alpha)$. I understood that the Joint PDF $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ can be obtained by making use of the McKay's bivariate Gamma distribution which applies for the case of different shape parameters. $\mathbf{First}: $ McKay's PDF has a condition of $Y>X$ (and vice versa), does that mean that in this case there is no situation (in the event space) such that $Y=X$? $\mathbf{Second}: $ If I want to obtain the following average of another function, denoted by $G(X,Y)$, i.e, $\mathbb{E}[G(X,Y)]=\int^\infty_0\int^\infty_0 G(X,Y)f_{X,Y}(x,y)\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y$ do I need to average the individual cases when $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ applies for $X>y$ and $X what about the case of $X=Y$?
