Sample size formula for multiple regression between binomial variables?

Let's say we have k binomial variables, and a sample size of n observations per variable, where each variable occurs (positive case) at a given frequency/probability f. We would like to check if there is a correlation between these variables, so the null hypothesis assumes that they are all independent (no correlation). Is there a formula to calculate the minimum sample size n required to identify a "significant" correlation (p That is, how are n, k, f and alpha linked to each other mathematically? Are any other parameters involved in the formula, e.g., beta, $R^2$ , etc.? I have a feeling that this relates to power and/or sample size calculations for multiple logistic regression, but I'm really not sure. Could the Wald test or likelihood-ratio test be used here?
