'Solvers' in Machine Learning

What role do 'Solvers' play in optimization problems? Surprisingly, I could not find any definition for 'Solvers' online. All the sources I've referred to just explain the types of solvers & the conditions under which each one is supposed to be used. Examples of Solvers - ['Newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'sag,' 'saga']
