I came accross FusionDesk a while back while reading Joel on Software . It has a free edition, however, I am not sure if the free edition supports time tracking or not. Its a pretty good product, and the pay version isn't terribly priced, in case your interested. http://www.fusiondesk.com/ EDIT: I also forgot the great staple of CodeProject: ToDo List. This sucker is the top project at www.codeproject.com, and has been for years. It lets you organize your tasks and track time, and its free to boot: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/applications/todolist2.aspx
