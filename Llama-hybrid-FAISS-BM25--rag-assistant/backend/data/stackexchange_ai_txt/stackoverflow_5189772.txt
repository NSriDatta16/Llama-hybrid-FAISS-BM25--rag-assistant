the implementation of strtok saves the pointer to the string in a private variable on the first call. On subsequent calls that the first parameter is NULL it will return the next token of initial string. Since strtok uses some private storage to save the pointer you can not process two different strings simultaneously, and it is not reentrant. If you want to sue strtok use the reentrant version, strtok_r that is safer even if you are not running multiple treads. for example if function A is using strtok to parse a string and in the middle of it calls another function that also uses strtok to parse another string, function A will get the wrong result. Also keep in mind that strtok modifies the string, ergo cannot be used on static allocations.
