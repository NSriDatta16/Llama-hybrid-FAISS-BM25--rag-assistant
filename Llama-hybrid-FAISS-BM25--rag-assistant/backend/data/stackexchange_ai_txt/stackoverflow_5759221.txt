job interview question -data structures

Suppose I have set of files and in every files there are include# to other files in the same set.Suppose I have function that load all the includes in certain file.I need to write function that load all the includes in some given source file so I will avoid infinite loop and circular call for the include. To solve the question I have to use this function i can't use pragma once or something similar I think it could be solved by recursion though I am not sure how Thank you
