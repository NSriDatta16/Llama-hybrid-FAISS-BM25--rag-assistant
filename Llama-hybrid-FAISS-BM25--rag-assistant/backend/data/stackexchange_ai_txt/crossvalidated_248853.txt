MCMC can be used for social network analysis and also for sampling from a network. Here is a short description of the way it is used in the two capacities. Social Network Analysis: Whenever social networks are analyzed using Bayesian methodology, it is likely that MCMC will be used. One example is Latent Space Models . You might be able to find more references therein. Sampling from a Network: Often the network is too large to handle, or the network represents a hard to reach population. In this case, a sample from the network is obtained to make inference on the population. Standard sampling techniques often don't work since the population might be unknown. In this case, MCMC crawling techniques may be used. You should be able to find more references therein.
