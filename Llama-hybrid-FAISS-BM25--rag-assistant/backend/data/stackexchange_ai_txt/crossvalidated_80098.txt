It is a bit tough to discern what is going on without looking at the actual paper, but that appears to be from a Path Analysis or Structural Equation Model, where parameters are estimated for direct and indirect effects of variables on one-another. I tried to find the paper via google scholar, and while I don't have access to the journal, I saw in the abstract that it is examining the theory of planned behavior, for which I understand Structural Equation Modeling is often used. A great text on structural equation modeling is Principles and Practice of Structural Equation Modeling by Rex B. Kline. If you search for this method, you might also want to look up the phrase "confirmatory factor analysis". In doing this analysis, effectively, multiple sets of regressions are run to analyze the relationships between the connected predictor variables themselves, and between the predictor variables and the dependent variable, along the different paths in the model. Thus, the coefficients presented are not simply regression coefficients from a single multiple logistic regression on the entire dataset, as might be inferred from the figure caption. The methodology jibes with what is shown in the figure, and makes logical sense given the information presented and the field that this paper is from. I hope that helps a bit at least.
