The issue I am having is that for a given row two of the categorical variables are active, and the stat columns are only relevant to one of the two active teams, but the model will have no way of inferring that. Yes, there is no way of inferring that. This is a causal inference problem. In general causal relations among encoded information within the design matrix , i.e., feature vectors, can not be modelled with "standard" statistical models or machine learning. You would need to build a causal model if you want to induce causal relations among your predictors or set of predictors.
