Marc's example of double-casting is the correct way to get the compiler to behave correctly. You could write a sperate method for each value type and have a generic method for reference types. This would stop stop boxing on value types. This is only useful if the objects being accessed are not boxed for storage (e.g. not stored as an object). public static T GetPropertyValue (string propertyIdCode) { } public static int GetPropertyInt(string propertyIdCode) { }
