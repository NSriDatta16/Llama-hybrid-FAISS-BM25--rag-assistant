Should I check for autocorrelation in a Bayesian Structural Time Series Model (CausalImpact)?

Is it recommended to check for autocorrelation in a Bayesian Structural Time Series model (using CausalImpact)? If so, could I use the Durbin Watson significance table for models with no intercept to determine the lower and upper bounds for the critical values? https://www3.nd.edu/~wevans1/econ30331/Durbin_Watson_tables.pdf
