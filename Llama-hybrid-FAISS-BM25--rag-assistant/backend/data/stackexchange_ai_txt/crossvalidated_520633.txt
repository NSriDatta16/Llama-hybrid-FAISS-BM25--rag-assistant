You should look into Kaplan Meier analysis, which is a way of handling this type of "right censored" data. In these cases, you want to leverage every data point as much as you can, so you'll still want to use the fact that Person 5's phone hasn't broken in 3 years, even though we don't know how long it will actually last (but we know it's at least 3 years). One measure for average survival time is called the median survival, which is the time at which 50% of the phones have broken (excluding ones we don't know whether they broke or not). At 1.5 years, for example, 2 people's phone's have broken, 2 people's phones have not broken, and 1 person's phone we don't know whether it broke or not. From this data, we can say that the median survival time of phones is 1.5 years. To visualize this, you can use a Kaplan Meier survival plot as shown below:
