Possible to get mouse events fired when cursor is outside page?

I'm creating a game in which one can hold the mouse button and drag it around to rotate an object. However, when the mouse position is outside the page bounds, all mouse events are not fired anymore. This means that the object isn't rotated anymore when the cursor is outside the page; moreover, when the user releases the mouse outside the page bounds, I cannot keep track of that which means the object is still being rotated when the cursor gets back in the page bounds, although it isn't pressed anymore. So, is there any way to make mousemove / mousedown / mouse[...] events get fired when the cursor is outside the page bounds?
