I would probably use the XmlDocument class in .net, but that's just me because I've never been that fond of regexs. You could then use XPath expressions to pull out the child nodes of each page node, evaluate them, and append a new node at the end of the page children, save the XmlDocument when you are done. Xsl is an option too, but the initial learning curve is a bit painful. There's probably a more elegant way with a regex, but if you are only running it once, it only matters that it works.
