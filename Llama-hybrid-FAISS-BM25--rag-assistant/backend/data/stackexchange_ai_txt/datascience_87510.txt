Multi-class classification with extremely small dataset

I am working on a text classification task that contains 216 labeled paragraphs. The distribution of tags is as follows: {0: 17, 1: 15, 2: 16, 3: 9, 4: 10, 5: 18, 6: 24, 7: 9, 8: 33, 9: 38, 10: 27}. The keys are representing the classes, and the value is the number of samples. Here's my questions: Q1. Is there any way to train a classifier? Q2. If we want an 11-class text classifier how many samples do we need?
