EDML and EDMX have the same structure and in case of changing the extension can be opened in each tool. EDML diagram is serialized to a separate file. EDML uses Devart code generation. Several features are not available in Microsoft designer: - Editable Store model (with Add DefiningQuery and Add CommandText options); - Flexible Naming Rules; - Ability to execute LINQ to Entities & Entity SQL queries. Also we provide a number of additional features like ComplexType, entity splitting, all types of inheritances design time support and so on. We don't have support for Update from database Wizard yet. But our drag & drop interface allows to delete and add changed database objects from Database Explorer. This operation does not discard changes made to other objects, unlike Microsoft Update from database wizard (it regenerates the whole Store part of the model).
