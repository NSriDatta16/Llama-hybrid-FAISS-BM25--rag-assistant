It depends on what kind of survival analysis you are doing. A censored observation doesn't have to have only one cause (the study ended), it can have several causes (study ended, dropout, death from a cause that isn't of interest to the study [run over by a truck], etc.). If the event of interest is death due to disease and not having received a transplant, you can call having received a transplant a censored observation. On the other hand, you can do competing risks survival analysis instead, if that better addresses your study question. If you think of SA as having outcomes analogous to logistic regression ({0,1} vs. {died, didn't}), then competing risks SA is analogous to multinomial logistic regression where there are >2 categories. In this case, your categories would be {died, got a transplant, were censored}.
