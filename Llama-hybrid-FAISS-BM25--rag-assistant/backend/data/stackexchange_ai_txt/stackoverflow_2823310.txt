Where can I find a jQuery article rotator / carousel / slider?

I want to make an article rotator similar to http://www.vmagazine.com/ And I want to use jQuery. I know there are carousels like jCarousel and jQuery Carousel . There is also the Coda-Slider , but I don't fint it very elegant. Can anyone suggest a good jQuery method / script for having an article carousel? I don't want to use MooTools, Prototype etc. since I'm already using jQuery. Any suggestions anyone?
