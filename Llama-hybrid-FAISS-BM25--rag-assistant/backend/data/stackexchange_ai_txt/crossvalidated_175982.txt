Yes, it makes sense that all the parameters within a particular chain have high autocorrelation. A "stuck" chain is a Markov chain that hasn't reached the typical set and is not effectively making draws from the correct posterior distribution. When this happens, the tuning parameters are estimated to the region of the posterior that has been seen, which isn't where it should be. The difficulty is finding the typical set so we can tune, but without tuning, the typical set can't be found. In Stan, all parameters are jointly sampled, so it makes sense that all parameters have high autocorrelation. One (practical) solution is to fit a better model by providing more information through priors on the parameters.
