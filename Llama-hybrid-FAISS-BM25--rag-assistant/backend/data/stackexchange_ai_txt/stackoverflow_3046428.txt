It's not always easy to allocate large blocks of memory in the presence of fragmentation. I can't say for sure, but my guess is that it's having to do some rearranging to get enough contiguous memory for such a big block of memory. As for why allocating subsequent arrays isn't faster, my guess is either that the big block gets fragmented between GC time and the next allocation OR the original block was never GCd to start with.
