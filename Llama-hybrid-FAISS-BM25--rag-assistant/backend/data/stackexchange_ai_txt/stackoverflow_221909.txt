Oracle PL/SQL - Are NO_DATA_FOUND Exceptions bad for stored procedure performance?

I'm writing a stored procedure that needs to have a lot of conditioning in it. With the general knowledge from C#.NET coding that exceptions can hurt performance, I've always avoided using them in PL/SQL as well. My conditioning in this stored proc mostly revolves around whether or not a record exists, which I could do one of two ways: SELECT COUNT(*) INTO var WHERE condition; IF var > 0 THEN SELECT NEEDED_FIELD INTO otherVar WHERE condition; .... -or- SELECT NEEDED_FIELD INTO var WHERE condition; EXCEPTION WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND .... The second case seems a bit more elegant to me, because then I can use NEEDED_FIELD, which I would have had to select in the first statement after the condition in the first case. Less code. But if the stored procedure will run faster using the COUNT(*), then I don't mind typing a little more to make up processing speed. Any hints? Am I missing another possibility? EDIT I should have mentioned that this is all already nested in a FOR LOOP. Not sure if this makes a difference with using a cursor, since I don't think I can DECLARE the cursor as a select in the FOR LOOP.
