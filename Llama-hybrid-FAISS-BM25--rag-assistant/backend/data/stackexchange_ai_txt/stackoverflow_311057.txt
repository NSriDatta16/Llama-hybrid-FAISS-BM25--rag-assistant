You can use a function attribute "__attribute__ ((optimize 0))" to set the optimization for a single function, or "#pragma GCC optimize" for a block of code. These are only for GCC 4.4, though, I think - check your GCC manual. If they aren't supported, separation of the source is your only option. I would also say, though, that if your code fails with optimization turned on, it is most likely that your code is just wrong, especially as you're trying to do something that is fundamentally very difficult. The processor will potentially perform reordering on your code (within the limits of sequential consistency) so any re-ordering that you're getting with GCC could potentially occur anyway.
