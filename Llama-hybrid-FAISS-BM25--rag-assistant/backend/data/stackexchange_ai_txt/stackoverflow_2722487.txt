If you are embedding your movie in a web view using HTML, then you'll need to address your movie using Javascript rather than the MPMoviePlayer class. Take a look at Apple's scripting guide for Quicktime here . I think the property you require is GetRectangle() which returns a string of the location and dimensions of the movie within the embed area. Once you have the dimensions, you can pass it back into Objective-C from Javascript.
