With no code to look at, all I can give you is a workaround. Try realloc ing memory only when you need it to grow, and double it in size instead of just adding however many bytes you need. This helps tremendously with fragmentation. Since you said you have enough memory, don't worry about freeing it when you're done, just keep it there if it's reasonable enough. Make it your goal to reduce fragmentation at any cost, keeping a 200mb working set seems perfectly fine to me for today's computing power. If you go past 500mb often and your program is ran for long periods of time, you can start looking into optimizing the working set further, but until then don't worry about it.
