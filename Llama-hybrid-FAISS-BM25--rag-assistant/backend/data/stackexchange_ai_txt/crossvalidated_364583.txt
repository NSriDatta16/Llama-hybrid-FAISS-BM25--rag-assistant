ANCOVA - Non-linearity of covariate

I have a dataset where I calculated genetic distances between populations of some animals (a continuous variable). I want to know if these differences are explained by physical or/and ecological characteristics of the organisms. My explanatory variables are type of dispersal (categoric), temperature regulation (categoric), geographic distribution (continuous) and body length (continuous). I considered ANCOVA as the best choice to analyze my data, but I have some doubts about the assumptions. I made a log transformation to normalize my data and fix the variance (and it works perfectly), but when I check the linearity of the covariates with my response variable, they are not significant. So my question is: Should I remove the covariates and make an ANOVA? (It doesn't sound correct for me, but I'm not sure) Thanks.
