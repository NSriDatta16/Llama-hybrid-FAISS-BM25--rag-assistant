How can Notepad++ be extended as an IDE for R?

I am working with NppToR as an extension allowing the use of notepad++ to be an IDE for R. But there are a few features I didn't yet see implemented (I compiled the list from another IDE solution, which is not open source) : Object Browser - Allow users to see all the data and function objects that are available, including those in loaded and installed R packages. Context menus provide the capability to quickly edit and plot data or load a package. Full-featured Visual Debugger - Debug R scripts, with step-in, step-over, and step-out capability, allowing users to inspect and modify R objects as they are debugging A Visual Solution Explorer - Organize, view, add, remove, rearrange, and deploy R scripts. Users can create their own Project Templates for automatic creation of a set of customized scripts for a new R project. Dockable, Floating, and Tabbed Tool Windows. for Creating personally customized workspaces. Enhanced Help - Complete search capabilities and hover-over tooltips for functions and data objects. R Code Snippets - Automatically generate fill-in-the-blank sections of R code for a variety of analyses. Tooltip help gives guidance in filling out the snippet. Any Idea on how to get some of these already in notepad++ through some other noteps++ extensions or R packages ? Thanks, Tal
