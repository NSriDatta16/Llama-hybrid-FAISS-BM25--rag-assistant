How to classify neutral sentiments using BERT

We can do text classification as positive and negative as mentioned in below notebook. But is there any way to classify neutral sentiment also? https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/bert/blob/master/predicting_movie_reviews_with_bert_on_tf_hub.ipynb Actually, I want to know like what kind of changes do we need to make in the above notebook so that it can classify neutral sentiments also besides positive and negative. Thanks in advance.
