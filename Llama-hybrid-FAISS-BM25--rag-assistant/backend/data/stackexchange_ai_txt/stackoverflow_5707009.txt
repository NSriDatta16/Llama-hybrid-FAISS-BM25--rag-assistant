You can use a 8 narrow band filters and amplitude averaging over small time windows. These 2 processes are typically done together using variants of the Goertzel algorithm. The other thing one can do is to measure total average amplitude over all frequencies in the same time window using an RMS averager. When the energy in just 2 of the filter windows is a majority of the total signal energy, then you probably have a DTMF signal. To decode the DTMF you can do a table lookup based on which 2 filters show the energy. If there is a lot more total energy everywhere in the audio than than in just 2 of the filters, the whole audio signal probably noise, not a DTMF signal.
