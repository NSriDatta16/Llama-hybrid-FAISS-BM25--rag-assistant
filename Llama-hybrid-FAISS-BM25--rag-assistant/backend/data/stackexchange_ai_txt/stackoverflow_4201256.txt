Not elegant but this is something quick and dirty that I came up with. Unfortunately I can't stop the line at a certain point, it just goes all the way to the edge. ggplot(quakes, aes(long, lat)) + geom_point(shape = 1) + opts(panel.grid.major=theme_blank(), panel.grid.minor=theme_blank()) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept =seq(165,185,by=5))) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept=seq(-35,-15,by=5)))
