What is an elegant way to return a readable 'file size' of a file stored in an oracle blob column using SQL?

How would you write a SQL query to get the size of blob in a more human readable form? The example would be something like a large word document is being stored in a blob on a table. I would want to execute something like: select fnc_getReadableSize(documents.doc) from documents where id = ? output: 23.4 MB
