Recommendations: Validate the JNLP using JaNeLA . It seems valid to my eye, but JaNeLA is the better judge. Include the package element for each Jar. This element is mentioned in the Resources section of the JNLP File Syntax (also expanded in the table at the top of the page). Chase the link in the page to the (downloadable only) API Specification for further details of the package element. And as an aside, the API Spec. is the single best resource on JWS. I wish Oracle would make it web-browsable. Index the Jar files. Continue to ask such great (well thought out, well researched, well presented) questions. :)
