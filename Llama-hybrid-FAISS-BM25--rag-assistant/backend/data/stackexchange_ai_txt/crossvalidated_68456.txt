nntool accepts any number of input and output dimensions. Simply prepare your data in form of matrices, ie. if you want to train neural network for two target logical function $$ f(x,y) = (x \text{ and } y,x \text{ or } y)$$ you can train it on Input 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Target 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 and in matlab format Input = [0 0 1 1; 0 1 0 1] and Target = [0 0 0 1; 0 1 1 1] . In other words, Target matrix stores target values in columns, and examples in rows, so if you want to use $n$ target labels, simply create a matrix with $n$ columns.
