If you are comparing average trajectories across groups (i.e., growth-factor means), then you do not need to constrain growth-factor variances. If your growth-factor indicators are latent, make sure your latent scales are linked across groups. For example: If growth indicators are common factors, test feasibility of scalar-invariance constraints across groups Ferrer, E., Balluerka, N., & Widaman, K. F. (2008). Factorial invariance and the specification of second-order latent growth models. Methodology, 4 (1), 22-36. https://doi.org/10.1027/1614-2241.4.1.22 If growth indicators are ordinal (requiring at least 4 categories), test the feasibility of threshold invariance across groups Mehta, P.
