What test to use to determine whether a binary variable is distributed differently among groups

I have a set of data which has been grouped into 5 clusters. What I would like to do is, for each variable, determine whether it's distributed differently across the clusters with respect to the responses. I thought that levenes test would be suitable here, but the problem there is it is significant even when the average positive responses for the groups are similar to (.9,.9,.9,.9,.9) . I'd like for this to be considered to be fairly uninteresting, what I'm more interested in is something like (.9,.1,.3,.2,.3) , as this seems to imply that this variable was particularly related to the first group (whereas when they're all .9 that doesn't really say so much). What test should I use for this?
