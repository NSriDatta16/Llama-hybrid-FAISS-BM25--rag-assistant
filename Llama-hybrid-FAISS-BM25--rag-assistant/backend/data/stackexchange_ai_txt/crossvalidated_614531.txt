Linear regression assumptions for causal Inference

When I'm using linear regression as an estimation method to infer the average treatment effect (between treatment and outcome), am I assuming there is a linear relation only between treatment and outcome? Or am I assuming a linear relation between treatment, outcome and confounding variable(s)?
