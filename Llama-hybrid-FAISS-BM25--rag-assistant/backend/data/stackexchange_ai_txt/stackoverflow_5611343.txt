For your first question: First, Remove any "specs" of noisy white pixels that aren't part of the letter sequence. A gentle low-pass filter (pixel color = average of surrounding pixels) followed by a clamping of the pixel values to pure black or pure white. This should get rid of the little "dot" underneath the "a" character in your image and any other specs. Now search for the following pixels: xMin = white pixel with the lowest x value (white pixel closest to the left edge) xMax = white pixel with the largest x value (white pixel closest to the right edge) yMin = white pixel with the lowest y value (white pixel closest to the top edge) yMax = white pixel with the largest y value (white pixel closest to the bottom edge) with these four pixel values, form a bounding box: Rect(xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax); compute the area of the bounding box and find the center. using the center of the bounding box, rotate the box by N degrees. (You can pick N: 1 degree would be an ok value). Repeat the process of finding xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax and recompute the area Continue rotating by N degrees until you've rotated K degrees. Also rotate by -N degrees until you've rotated by -K degrees. (Where K is the max rotation... say 30 degrees). At each step recompute the area of the bounding box. The rotation that produces the bounding box with the smallest area is likely the rotation that aligns the letters parallel to the bottom edge (horizontal alignment).
