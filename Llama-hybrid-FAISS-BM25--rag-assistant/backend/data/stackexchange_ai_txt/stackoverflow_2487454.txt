Yes you SHOULD use a Swing Timer. You SHOULD NOT, use a util Timer and TimerTask. When a Swing Timer fires the code is executed on the EDT which means you just need to invoke the label.setText() method. When using the uitl Timer and TimerTask, the code DOES NOT execute on the EDT, which means you need to wrap your code in a SwingUtilities.invokeLater to make sure the code executes on the EDT. And that is way using a Swing Timer is shorter and more elegant than your current approach, it simplifies the coding because to code is executed on the EDT.
