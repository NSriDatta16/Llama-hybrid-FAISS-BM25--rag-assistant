Proportion of explained variance in PCA and LDA

I have some basic questions regarding PCA (principal component analysis) and LDA (linear discriminant analysis): In PCA there is a way to calculate the proportion of variance explained. Is it also possible for LDA? If so, how? Is the “Proportion of trace” output from the lda function (in R MASS library) equivalent to the “proportion of variance explained”?
