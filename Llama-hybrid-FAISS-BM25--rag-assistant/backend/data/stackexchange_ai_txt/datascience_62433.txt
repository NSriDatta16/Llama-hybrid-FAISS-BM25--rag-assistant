What is a latent space vector?

I do not understand this about GANs. Apparently the Generator is supposed to receive a latent space vector as its input. Yet I couldn't find an example of how I can implement it in Pytorch. This is a problem for me, because different posts suggest different approaches. Is it simply an image of Gaussian noise which is then served as an input to Generator's Convolutional Neural Network or is it a one-dimensional array passed through a Fully-Connected layer to the Generator?
