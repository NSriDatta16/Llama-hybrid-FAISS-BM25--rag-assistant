Storing compressed data in a cookie

What's the best way to store compressed data in a cookie? The reasons I want to do this are: I want to store as much data as possible in 1 cookie I want performance to be as fast as possible in terms of data transfer I don't want it to be so obvious what I'm storing exactly to prevent easy tampering There are many values, hopefully the best mechanism to do this allows for easy retrieval
