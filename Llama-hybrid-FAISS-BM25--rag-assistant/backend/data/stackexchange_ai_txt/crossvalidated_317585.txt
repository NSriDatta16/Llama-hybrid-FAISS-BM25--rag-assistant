Granger causality and cointegration

I have two time series, which are both I(1). I run an ADLM(4) model and compared it with a DLM(4) model (unidirectional: Does X granger causes y?), but the statistic was not significant. Therefore, X does not have any incremental predicting power of Y. I can conclude that X does not granger caused Y. QUESTION: Is it meaningful to test for cointegration, knowing there is no granger causality? What is the link between granger causality and cointegration?
