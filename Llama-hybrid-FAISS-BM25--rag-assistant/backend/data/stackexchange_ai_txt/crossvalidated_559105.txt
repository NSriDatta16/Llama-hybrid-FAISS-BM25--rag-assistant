Logistic regression "probability" function (is not a valid pdf...)

The idea behind logistic regression is to estimate the posterior class conditional probability, given observation x for class C_k , with a sigmoid f(C_k| x)=1/(1+exp(-w*x)) to compute the weights vector w . In every book I've read (e.g., Bishop's PRML) f(C_k| x) is a probability density function but this is definitely not a valid pdf since the integral from minus infinity to infinity does not equal to 1 (nor it could be by any normalization since the integral is infinite). Appreciate any explanations in this matter
