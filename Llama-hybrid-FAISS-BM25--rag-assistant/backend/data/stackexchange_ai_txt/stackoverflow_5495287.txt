Wrap your updates to the text storage in calls to beginEditing and endEditing . This causes Cocoa to hold all of its change notifications until you have finished making your changes to the text storage. - (IBAction)oneThousandButton:(id)sender { NSTextStorage *textStorage = [outView textStorage]; [textStorage beginEditing]; for (int i = 1; i On my system the above action runs in about 10ms. If I comment out the calls to beginEditing / endEditing , it takes about 470ms.
