Highlight text from Visual Studio 2008 add-in

I'm writing another code coverage tool for .NET with Visual Studio 2008 integration. Everything goes well except one thing: I can't find a way to highlight some code chunks. I need it to inform user about covered and not covered blocks. You can see example of the feature I want on the next screenshot (from native VS code coverage toolset): Can someone provide me a code snippet that highlights text in the code view window? Links to appropriate MSDN articles related to VS2008 are also appreciated! Thanks in advance.
