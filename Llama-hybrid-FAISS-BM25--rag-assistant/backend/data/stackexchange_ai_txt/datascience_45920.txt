Welcome to the site. I'm a little disturbed by the other two answers you received here. It sounds like you are skipping a whole lot of steps and wanting to jump right into modeling - that's a massive mistake! You are a scientist ! Your role is to create the most fair, unbiased environment possible to let the data speak to you (not the other way around!). What worked before (LSTM) may or may not be the best approach to this completely new data set. Therefore, after doing your EDA phase, you should keep an "open field" view to the multiple models that you will examine and test prior to making any decisions about which model to proceed with. The answer may not even be a neural network, it may be a whole different approach. Please, be responsible your data science practice. You cannot jump into modeling right away. Let the data speak to you.
