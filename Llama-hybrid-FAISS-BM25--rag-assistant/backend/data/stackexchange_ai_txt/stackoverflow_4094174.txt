Are you using SELinux? Compare the output of ls -laZ /var/www and ls -laZ /home/usr/www Chances are that your home directory cannot be accessed by the apache process. If this is the problem, it might be solved as simply as chcon -R --reference=/var/www /home/usr/www chmod og+x /home/usr /home/usr/www BTW: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/modpython/ warns that "Support for mod_python will be deprecated in a future release of Django. If you are configuring a new deployment, you are strongly encouraged to consider using mod_wsgi or any of the other supported backends."
