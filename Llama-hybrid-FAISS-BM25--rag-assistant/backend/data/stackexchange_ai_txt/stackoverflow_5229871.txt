I haven't used EC2 in this way before, but broadly speaking, I'd encourage you to use the same server for development and production environments if at all possible - the installation effort can be a bit of a pain, but it's nothing compared to developing an app locally and then finding an IIS configuration issue causes it to break on production. This approach also lets you keep your PHP configurations in source code control - php.ini and any modules you're using - and automatically deploy them alongside your application; again, forgetting to deploy the correct PHP.ini usually makes your application do crazy things... So, your choices appear to be: - switch off IIS and have WAMP listen to port 80. Not sure WAMP is designed for production level traffic, but in the past, I've run low-traffic public websites in this way. - work out why port 8080 is blocked, and if it can be unblocked. This would still require you to run your website on an unusual port, which makes for ugly and hard-to-communicate URLs. - install PHP on your IIS instance. One benefit of having installed WAMP is that MySQL should already be up and running, and the basic PHP installation should also be there; getting PHP to run on IIS is no longer a dark art ([http://php.iis.net][1]) For my money, I'd go for the latter option...IIS is a production quality server, and it's clearly what Amazon want you to use in this instance. Of course, running IIS on your development environment may be a problem.
