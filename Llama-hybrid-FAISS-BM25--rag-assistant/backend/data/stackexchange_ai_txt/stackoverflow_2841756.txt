Not possible in the SDK I believe. A workaround would be to create the button in Dashcode (search "dashcode" in the spotlight). In the "Mobile Safari" view, just drag in a "Go Forward Button". You can then recolour the image using Dashcode inspector. Find the Dashcode project in Finder, right click it and go to "Show Package Contents", the button images should be under the image directory (Project > mobile > Parts > Images). Then you can simply add the button to your Nav bar as an custom image UIBarButtonItem (self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = ...); Example http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5372/screenshot20100515at220.png
