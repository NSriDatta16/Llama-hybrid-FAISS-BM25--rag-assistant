Yes, they can make predictions for individuals, but there is a higher risk of significant errors. For instance we can predict that walking home was safer than driving after consuming alcohol; that didn't work too well for this poor man . But the prediction does work well better than 99% of the time... He quipped that the first bridge is Classical Statistics and the second bridge is Data Science. Warning: I'm always suspicious of argument by analogy. He told us that perhaps this example is an extreme example, but this is precisely why a drug that has initially shown strong potential for curing a disease must be rigorously studied in both theoretical and empirical settings before it can be released - and in the interim, potentially less effective but better understood drugs must be administered of which we have higher confidence in. During a previous life I developed medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Imagine that you are dealing with hazards that have high severity. One problem is getting enough test coverage, but what patients do you use for clinical trials? How do you know that you have covered all the unknown unknowns? Of then the best you can do is test with a large number of people, and cover as many possibilites as possible: male/female, young folk/elderly, fat people/slim people, as many ethnic groups as possible . Your statistics professor is right to be cautious.
