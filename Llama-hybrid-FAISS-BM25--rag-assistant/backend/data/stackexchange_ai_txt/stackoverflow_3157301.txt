Some pointers: You will need to capture the user's touch 'n drag. Unfortunately you can't use a GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener for this (it would see it as a scroll), so you'll have to do this in your view's onTouchEvent. This is a little tricky - refer to the SimpleOnGestureListener source code for ideas on how best to do this. As you update the location of the object call invalidate() on the view to trigger the re-draw In onDraw() do the background and then draw your object on top If you are just doing the one object at once this should be sufficient. If there's more to it that this you may have to graduate to a SurfaceView and a separate thread - but don't go there until you need to.
