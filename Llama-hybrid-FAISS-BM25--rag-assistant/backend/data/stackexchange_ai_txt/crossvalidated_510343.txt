What is the intuition behind my Residual vs Time Plot having the same structure as my Data vs Time Plot in a Time series

If I ran a regression on time series data and found the residuals over time and plotted this graph and it looks exactly like the pattern of the original data itself - what is the intuition behind this? Does this mean the model has failed to capture the trend or succeeded? Unable to grasp the intuition behind this.
