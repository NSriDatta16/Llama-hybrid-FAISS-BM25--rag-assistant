The samples from the posterior allow you to compute expectations of the parameters. From Betancourt's A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ... Given sufficient time, the history of the Markov chain, $\{q_0,...,q_N\}$ , denoted samples generated by the Markov chain, becomes a convenient quantification of the typical set.In particular, we can estimate expectations across the typical set, and hence expectations across the entire parameter space, by averaging the target function over this history $$\hat{f}_{N}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N} f\left(q_{n}\right)$$ So if you want to estimate parameters for, say, a model then you have to compute the expectation of the samples for that parameter.
