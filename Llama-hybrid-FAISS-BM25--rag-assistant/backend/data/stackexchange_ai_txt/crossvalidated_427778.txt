Testing for statistically significant difference between two groups: Frequentist vs Bayesian

When testing for differences between two groups or samples, what is the best approach in concluding statistical significance? The orthodox approach is to take a t-test or an Anova when there is more than 1 factor to consider. I've also seen how t-tests can be considered as a linear model and can be generalized. R packages such as BEST or BRMS use a Bayesian approach such as MCMC to obtain parameter estimates. But what can you do after obtaining these estimates to say the two groups are or are not statistically significant?
