Why is d-separation only for disjoint sets?

I'm reading Molak's Causal Inference and Discovery in Python: Unlock the secrets of modern causal machine learning with DoWhy, EconML, PyTorch and more and I made note that I've taken the disjointedness of sets in d-separation for granted. That is, for a DAG $G = (V, E(V))$ , if I wish to consider whether the sets of vertices $\mathscr{X}$ and $\mathscr{Y}$ are d-separated by $\mathscr{Z}$ they should be disjoint as a requirement. Is this disjointedness requirement in the definition just to avoid uninteresting cases, or is there a potential logic problem (undefined cases and/or contradictions)? I've also started a discussion on networkx about the fact that their nx.d_separated checker seems to have defined behavior in non-disjoint cases.
