Android Canvas vs. GLSurfaceView for Drag/Drop operations

I am building aprogram that needs to do drag/drop operations of images. Now on a Canvas it is quite easy, and I might chose this. However, I am also interested in using GLSurface View?? Now what I am seeing in examples is either a drag/drop tutorial on Canvas or drawing on GLSurface view. I am wondering if handling touch events is more complicated with GLSurface view? Is it possible to handle touch events with GLSurfaceView. Also why would one chose GLSurface view for rendering images vs. a Canvas? How does one chose between Canvas vs. GLSurfaceView?
