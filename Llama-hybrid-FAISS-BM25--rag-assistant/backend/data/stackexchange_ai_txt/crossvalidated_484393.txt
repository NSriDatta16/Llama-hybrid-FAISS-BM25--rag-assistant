Here are two references from textbooks I frequently turn to for rather "basic" stuff: Kevin P. Murphy - "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective" , Ch. 6.4.2 Unbiased estimators, p. 200 Christopher M. Bishop - "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" , Ch. 1.2.4 The Gaussian distribution, p. 27 I'm pretty sure there are more.
