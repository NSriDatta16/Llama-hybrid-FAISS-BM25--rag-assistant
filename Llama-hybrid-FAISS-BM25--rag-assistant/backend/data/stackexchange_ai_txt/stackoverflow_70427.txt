Quicksort has a better average case complexity but in some applications it is the wrong choice. Quicksort is vulnerable to denial of service attacks. If an attacker can choose the input to be sorted, he can easily construct a set that takes the worst case time complexity of o(n^2). Mergesort's average case complexity and worst case complexity are the same, and as such doesn't suffer the same problem. This property of merge-sort also makes it the superior choice for real-time systems - precisely because there aren't pathological cases that cause it to run much, much slower. I'm a bigger fan of Mergesort than I am of Quicksort, for these reasons.
