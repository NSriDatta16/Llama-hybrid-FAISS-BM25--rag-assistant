Prediction intervals for levels using a VAR model in second differences

Given a VAR model for the second differences of a vector time series, $\Delta^2 y$, how to obtain the one-step-ahead (and possibly $h$-step-ahead) prediction intervals for the series in levels, $y$? Any suggestion or resources regarding how to implement this, e.g. in R, would also be appreciated.
