How to average multiple non-normal distributions?

I have the following statistics of two independent random variables: First random variable: size: 3830 mean: 119240 percentile 10: 61750 percentile 25: 79930 median: 118250 percentile 75: 145950 percentile 90: 174840 Second random variable: size: 5290 mean: 153180 percentile 10: 81180 percentile 25: 124860 median: 159310 percentile 75: 169090 percentile 90: 192860 How can I estimate the percentiles of a third independent random variable by averaging the two above random variables?
