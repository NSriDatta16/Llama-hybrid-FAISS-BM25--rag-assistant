You could try the following packages in R: REEMtree : which is no random forest but a single tree model where differences between objects are accounted for over time (so called random or mixed effects), and several trees could possible be ensembled, or glmertree : like approaches that can account for segment-wise constant means - which could be adapted to account for individual specific growth patterns (see here ). Or you simply put age as a variable in your model to account for at least that bit of the individual tree characteristic?
