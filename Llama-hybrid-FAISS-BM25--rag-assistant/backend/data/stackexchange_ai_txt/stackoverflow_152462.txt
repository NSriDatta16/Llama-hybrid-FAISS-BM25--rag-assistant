Running a J6SE app on an NT box

I need to run a Java application, which we are trying to port to Java 6, on an NT box. I manage to run java 5 on it (although not officially supported), but when I try to run java 6 I get the following error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_05\bin\awt.dll: The specified procedure could not be found at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source) at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(Unknown Source) at sun.security.action.LoadLibraryAction.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at sun.awt.NativeLibLoader.loadLibraries(Unknown Source) at sun.awt.DebugHelper. (Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue. (Unknown Source) at javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Unknown Source) at ui.sequencer.test.WindowTest.main(WindowTest.java:136) Anybody has any idea how to solve this? This persists even when I move the java executables to another directory with no spaces in its name. p.s. I know, I should upgrade, but it's not up to me or my company - this is a very very bug huge gigantic company we work with, and they intend to keep NT for another 5 years.
