First, Subversion supports (versioned) properties (simple key=value pairs) on files, directories and revisions. This includes svn:mime-type property for a file. This approach (this feature) looks like remnants of original BerkeleyDB storage engine, and reminds a bit "resource forks" on (older?) MacOS filesystems. The closest equivalent of Subversion's file properties in Git would be gitattributes (per-path attributes). You could define mime-type gitattribute, but currently no Git tool (known to me) uses it. Note that in contrast to Subversion gitattributes are stored in an ordinary file: in-tree .gitattributes file (which can be versioned), and per repository user's .git/info/attributes file... which can be edited in ordinary editor, and not only using SCM commands. Second, mime-types or mimetype-like property or attribute is not really necessary. Gitweb (and probably other git interfaces) use file with extension to mimetype mapping ( /etc/mime.types by default), so that e.g. '*.html' files are served in 'raw' mode (i.e. 'blob_plain' action) are served with 'text/html' content-type, see e.g. http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git/blob_plain/html:/gitattributes.html It's the lack in GitHub web interface that http://github.com/git/git/raw/html/gitattributes.html is served with 'text/plain' content-type...
