Normalizing continuous features using sigmoid function

Can you use the sigmoid function to normalize continuous features that have no theoretical maximum value but tend to cluster around [-1, 1]? Although using the sigmoid function would be a non-linear normalization, my intuition is that the deep neural network or machine learning model that I am training would learn that the continuous feature is not linearly normalized, therefore adapting and doing fine. Is this correct? Can the sigmoid function or any other non-linear normalization method (ex. tanh) be used for continuous features?
