Reporting (estimates/tests of) the latent correlations rests on the assumptions that (a) those latent variables exist and (b) are measured by the indicators. Poor model fit is evidence against at least assumption (b), maybe hinting that even (a) is dubious. So it is still recommended to report how well your model fits your data: most often the following estimation results are of primary interest: estimates of the fit of the model, estimates of model parameters, and estimates of the (asymptotic) standard errors of parameter estimates. The presentation of these results can be organized around four main questions... (p. 472) Boomsma, A. (2000). Reporting analyses of covariance structures.
