Filter timeseries before PCA

I have a timeseries dataset with large number of features. Because of that, I need to do PCA. Some of the features are noisy, others are not. My question is - does it make to do some kind of smoothing (filtering) such as moving average, before doing PCA? It seems that this might additionally reduce number of eigenvectors needed to represent the original dataset, as the variance will be smaller after smoothing.
