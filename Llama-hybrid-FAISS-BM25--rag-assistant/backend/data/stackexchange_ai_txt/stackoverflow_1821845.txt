You can always use the element itself as a selector. For example, using $(this) inside a click handler wraps the current element inside a jQuery object. $('p').click( function() { var html = $(this).html(); ... more computing... }); If you need a string selector for a particular element, that's going to be harder. You'd have to recurse upward using parent() and prev() (to get offsets for similar elements at each level) unless the element itself has an id -- then you could just use it. You may be better off creating a unique class that you can assign and referencing it that way. var counter = 0; $('p').click( function() { var uniq = 'paragraph-' + counter; ++counter; $(this).addClass(uniq); });
