I can now more or less confirm that the problem is really with Eclipse 3.5. I've run Eclipse on a much more powerful Mac, a 27" core I7, 2.93Ghz with 8GB ram and a SSD running OS X 10.6.4. Initially this was extremely smooth and snappy, but after an up time of a dozen hours or so, Eclipse suddenly began to slow-down again. I had very little to almost nothing running in the background. Just Eclipse (32 bits, given it 1.5GB memory), JBoss AS and Safari. A simple tab switch would take a few seconds and meanwhile I noticed the CPU load on one core going to 100%. The same happened with switching perspectives and various other operations. When I restarted only Eclipse, everything was completely fast again. This happened a couple of times.
