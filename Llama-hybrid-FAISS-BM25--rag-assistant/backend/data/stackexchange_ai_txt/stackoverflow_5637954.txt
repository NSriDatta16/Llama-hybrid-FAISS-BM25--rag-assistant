Wordpress messing with my db calls on the wordpress pages?

Hey, hows it going everyone? I am having database conflicts I was wanting some help with. Basically, I have a header that pulls in a random database field. Nothing special. It is in my header in my template and works just fine on non WordPress pages. $sql = "SELECT * FROM headerslogans ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1"; $result = mysql_query($sql); while ($myrow = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { echo $myrow['slogan']; }; I am using the same database, same user name, same password, etc. However, I get this error where the echo should be.... Warning: mysql_query() [function.mysql-query]: Access denied for user 'nobody'@'localhost' (using password: NO) in So obviously the wordpress connection is "overwriting" the other (wordpress works flawlessly). BUT, I was also confused as to why it doesn't work, although it is connecting to the same database with same username and password. Can anybody help me out on this? UPDATE: Posted connection code $x = mysql_connect($server,$dbuser,$dbpass,true) or die(mysql_error()); mysql_select_db($dbname,$x);
