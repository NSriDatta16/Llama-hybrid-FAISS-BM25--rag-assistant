I would suggest Kaggle learning projects - http://www.kaggle.com/competitions Look for the ones in the 101 section that offer knowledge. There's many pre-made solutions ready, which you can ingest and try variations of. Also, I have bookmarked a Comprehensive learning path â€“ Data Science in Python , which among other things gives a few answers to your specific question.
