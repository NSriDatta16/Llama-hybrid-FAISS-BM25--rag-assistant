I tried to play a video from internal storage (i.e. /data/data/com.yourapp/files) as well but failed; I looked for this question before as well. But it should work when using a FileDescriptor. See the following links and discussions: http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/a01d415c8e48e0d3 and a solution with code sample here: http://www.anddev.org/multimedia-problems-f28/videoview-cannot-play-video-from-internal-storage-t16636.html#p52373
