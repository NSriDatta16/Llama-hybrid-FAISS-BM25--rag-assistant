What could be causing my WP7 app to crash on only some models?

I've been working on this problem on and off for about a month. I don't expect anybody to be able to give me a definitive answer. I'm just completely out of ideas at this point and could use anything. The problem is that my app crashes on only some models of phones. I have an HTC surround and it runs fine. It has also been tested on a Samsung Focus and it works there to. It crashes pretty consistently on a HTC mozart. There are other phones it crashes on but I don't know what models they are. I don't have access to an HTC mozart so debugging has been very difficult. I'm handling the application UnhandledException event and I have try catch around every background thread. The error handling code never runs. What I know: Sometimes it freezes and requires a press of the power button. At least once it required the battery taken out. Most of the time it freezes and then crashes. Most of the time it crashes on the main menu, before everything displays. It's not 100% consistent. Sometimes it works for a little bit, but never very long. It's not because it's out of memory. Most of the time it crashes while using less then 8MB. When all the exception handling didn't work I added debug logging. This slows things way down but at the same time the issue goes away. These symptoms make it sound like a deadlock to me. Although I have gone over the code and there is no thread ever entering more then 1 lock at a time. Any ideas on how I should track this down would be appreciated. Edit : This is a WP7 version of my game . I've just been able to confirm with a volunteer with an HTC mozart that the simplest conversion of the code meant for to run on the web will crash on the phone. That's code has no networking, isolated storage, or sound. I also should have mentioned that this has passed certification and was in the marketplace for a few days until I took it down because it got bad reviews (because it was unplayable for some people)
