It's very unlikely that you encounter an issue that's due to PDF version. Especially with text content the PDF spec get's very complex and probability is high that crystal reports creates content that either relies on some strange encoding uses CID (multibyte) font techniques and pdf renderer has a blind spot there. You may try to play around with settings on the report side regarding the encoding font (Type1 / TrueType9) font embedding and maybe you find an option better suited.
