To get the Visual Studio key bindings in Eclipse you need to install the C++ development plugins - see this . I downloaded the latest Java development version of Eclipse (version below), when to Help -> Software Updates -> Available Software -> Ganymede and ticked the C++ box. After a restart the Visual Studio key binding appeared in the list. Eclipse Platform Version: 3.4.1 Build id: M20080911-1700
