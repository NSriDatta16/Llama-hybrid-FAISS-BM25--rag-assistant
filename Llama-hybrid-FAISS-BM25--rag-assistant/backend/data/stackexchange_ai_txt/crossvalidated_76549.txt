Is it feasible to use t-SNE to reduce a dataset to one dimension?

Is it feasible to use t-SNE to reduce a dataset to one dimension? Suppose that I have a matrix, $X$ , can I reduce it to a column vector, $Y$ with t-SNE? Suppose that $X$ has 100 columns, how much information can I expect to lose by reducing it to just a column vector with t-SNE (if possible)? References: L.J.P. van der Maaten and G.E. Hinton.
