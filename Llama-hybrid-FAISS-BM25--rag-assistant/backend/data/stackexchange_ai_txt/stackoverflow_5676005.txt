For the data you've already dumped, load it into a table that doesn't use the ID column as a primary key. You don't have to define any primary key. You will have multiple rows with the same ID, but that won't impede your data analysis. Going forward, you can set up a discipline where you dump and then DELETE the rows that are more than, say, one day old. That way the your ID will keep incrementing. Or, you can copy this data to a table that uses the ARCHIVE storage engine. This is good for retaining data for analysis, because it compresses its contents.
