There is currently no built in way using the app engine datastore. See this datanculeus ticket for example. (Note that JDO itself does have a @unique annotation.) One way to 'fake' it would be to create another kind/class called Email with the email itself as a key, and the User's key as a property. Since the email is now a key, it will be forced to be unique. Just make sure your Email entities are top level entities, not children of their associated User. You'll also have to pay close attention to your use of transactions to make sure you don't let a duplicate slip through the cracks if two users try to use the same email at the same exact time.
