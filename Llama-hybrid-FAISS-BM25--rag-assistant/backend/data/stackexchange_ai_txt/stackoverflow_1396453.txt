Most of the approaches deal with a complicated pair of UIView and UIWebView subclasses and overrode -touchesBegan:withEvent: etc. methods. This JavaScript-based approach intercepts touches on the web DOM itself, and it seems like a clever way to sidestep the more complex process. I haven't tried it myself, but I'm curious to know the results, if you give it a shot.
