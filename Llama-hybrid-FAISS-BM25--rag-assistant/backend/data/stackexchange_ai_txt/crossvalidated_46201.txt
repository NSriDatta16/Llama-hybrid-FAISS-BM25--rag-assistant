Taking the average p value from a set of simulated p values

I have 149 locations that are lined up from east to west. I have the geographical distances between each location and the adjacent location going west. I want to test whether the locations are randomly distributed or not. Therefore, I take the furthest west location and the furthest east location, and generate 145 random locations within this space and find the distance between each consecutive location (again from east to west). I then test the actual distribution of distances against the randomly generated distribution of distances using Kolmogorov Smirnov to get a p value. However, if I then decide to do 1000 simulations, does it make sense to just calculate the average (or median) p value of the 1000 KS tests and report this?
