Regression intepretation through standard deviation

I am having an OLS regression where I come to the resultS intepretation stating something in the lines of "an one employee increase in the company personnel leads on average to an increase of $20.000 company profit". However, talking with a professor he advised me do the intepratation in standard deviation like "an one standard deviation increase in company personnel leads to X increase in profits". Looking online i did not find a proper method on how to do that, can anyone provide me with any info on how the intepratations works?
