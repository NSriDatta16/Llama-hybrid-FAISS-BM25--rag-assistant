Flash AS3 - Button on stage will not hide if I change the label - bug or missing something?

OK - weird problem which happens each time - and so I'm thinking I must just be missing something very obvious. If in Flash CS3 I drag a Button component to the stage, and in the Document Class I hide that button with visible = false; - it works fine. However, if I change the label of that Button from it's default 'Label' to anything else, the button does not go invisible... eg. Button named hide_btn, Document Class Foo: package { import flash.display.MovieClip; public class Foo extends MovieClip{ public function Foo(){ hide_btn.visible = false; // Works ONLY if I didn't change the button label!! } } } The Button is (correctly) invisible when I run the movie... If I change the label to, say, 'LabelX' - then the Button is still there... So surely someone would have noticed this before if it were a bug, right?? So - can someone explain what is going on? Cheers. PS. A trace of trace(hide_btn.visible) says false, even though it clearly isn't...
