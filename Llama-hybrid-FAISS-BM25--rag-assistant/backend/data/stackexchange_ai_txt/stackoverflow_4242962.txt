Magento - Modify labels for cart and checkout (order review) screens

In the Magento default theme's cart page we see the following totals box towards the right mid of the screen: I want to modify the labels of the 5 fields in the above box, and I have been able to change the Grand Totals, by overriding the following design file: /html/app/design/frontend/default/mine/template/tax/checkout/grandtotal.phtml So, now it looks like this: My Problem is to: Change the labels for other 3 fields in the box, and the label of a discount box that appears there if a discount applies. I have spent some time grepping through other design files, but couldn't find any. It might be some classes to override, but I haven't been able to locate them either. I am using Magento 1.4.1.1 UPDATE 1 : After turning on template path hints, following are template paths for Cart Subtotal: app/design/frontend//tax/checkout/subtotal.phtml Total: app/design/frontend//checkout/total/default.phtml GrandTotal: app/design/frontend//tax/checkout/grandtotal.phtml Tax: app/design/frontend//tax/checkout/tax.phtml Checkout Same as for cart and the following additional one for Shipping: app/design/frontend//tax/checkout/shipping.phtml But when one goes into these template files, no labels are found except in grandtotal.phtml. I found the solution to the problem, which I have mentioned in my own answer. This question originally asked for help on two separate problems. I posted the other one later as another question .
