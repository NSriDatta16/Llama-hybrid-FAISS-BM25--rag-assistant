If neuron had three outputs, say [-1,0,1] then it could draw three areas with linear boundaries as shown here for the first layer and solution would be (E). The second layer simply picks the south and north region as one category, and west and east regions as another. A neuron with two outputs, whether it's [0,1] or [-1,1] or any other pair of values, can only criss-cross. So the solution can only be (D) Sideways If you abstract yourself from the actual question, then it's clear that the variables are "wrong" :) This is asking for feature engineering (another buzzword!) - shift and rotate by 45 degrees would work beautifully. First you de-mean the data, then create new variables: S = x+y and V=x-y. Then your classification becomes simply a bit problem: L is (S*V No, this is not the solution of the problem, because it still requires four regions, and with binary neurons you still need D in this problem. I just thought it's an interesting twist to consider
