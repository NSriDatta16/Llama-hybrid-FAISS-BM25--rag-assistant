Columns can be reorded by drag'n'drop column headers, at runtime. To reorder columns programmatic, you need to modify ListView.View's Columns collection, for example: GridView gv = listview.View as GridView; GridViewColumn cd = gv.Columns[0]; gv.Columns.Remove(cd); gv.Columns.Add(cd); (assuming listview is your ListView and its View is a GridView with at least 2 columns) this code will put the first column at the end. To reorder rows, programmatic, you modify the Collection behind the ListView (if the ListView has no sorting, if it has one should not want to change the order of the rows). To reorder rows by means of drag and drop, you need to write some code to handle all the beautiful events that define a drag and drop operation. An example and a starting point can be this blog post . Also, if you provide more details of what exactly you want, we can provide more detailed answers.
