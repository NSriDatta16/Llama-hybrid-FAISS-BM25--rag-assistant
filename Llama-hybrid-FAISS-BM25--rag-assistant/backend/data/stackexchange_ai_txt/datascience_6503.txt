I haven't tried R (well, a bit, but not enough to make a good comparison). However, here are some of Pythons strengths: Very intuitive syntax : tuple unpacking, element in a_list , for element in sequence , matrix_a * matrix_b (for matrix multiplication), ... Many libraries : scipy : Scientific computations; many parts of it are only wrappers for pretty fast Fortran code theano > Lasagne > nolearn : Libraries for neural networks - they can be trained on GPU (nvidia, CUDA is required) without any adjustment sklearn : General learning algorithms Good community : Python has 448,000+ questions on SO (R has 99,000+) Python has 103 questions on datascience.SE (R has 140) PEPs , 63,000+ packages on PyPI IPython notebooks Misc : 0-indexed arrays ... I made that error all the time with R. Established package structures Good support for testing your code
