As I understand you even can't receive any guarantee these variables are allocated on stack, they could be stored in registers. What you really could affect here: Advice compiler to place variable to register by using register keyword. Help compiler with localizing variable scope by moving declaration to as late place as you can: int f(void ) { /* var1 and var2 probably use the same place for storage. */ { int var1; /* ... do something */ } { int var2; /* ... do something */ } } Even given defined scope delay initialization: { int i; /* Yes, you must declare it at the begin of block. /* Do something... */ i = START_VALUE; /* But you need it only here and below... */ }
