From another vantage point, one could view this in the light of the field of Spatial Statistics, which has created an assortment of metrics, many of which have been placed in toolboxes (see, for example, ArcGIS ). Wikipedia (link: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_descriptive_statistics ) actually has a good introductory page discussing such concepts as measures of spatial central tendency and spatial dispersion. To quote Wikipedia on the latter: For most applications, spatial dispersion should be quantified in a way that is invariant to rotations and reflections. Several simple measures of spatial dispersion for a point set can be defined using the covariance matrix of the coordinates of the points. The trace, the determinant, and the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix can be used as measures of spatial dispersion. A measure of spatial dispersion that is not based on the covariance matrix is the average distance between nearest neighbors. Related concepts include measures of spatial homogeneity, Ripley's K and L functions, and perhaps most relevant for the analysis of bullet clusters, the Cuzickâ€“Edwards test for clustering of sub-populations within clustered populations. The latter test is based on the comparison (using "nearest-neighbor" analyses to tabulate statistics) to a control population, which in the current context could be based on actual observed targets classified as not displaying clustering, or per a theoretical simulation, from say the Rayleigh distribution.
