How to access subviews in nested UIScrollViews

I was having trouble getting a UIScrollView with multiple UIImageView subviews to zoom properly so I tried using a UIScrollView with multiple UIScrollView subviews inside of it and a UIImageView inside of each of those. That way one UIScrollView can only scroll and the other can only zoom. My question is: How can I access subviews of a subview. I know that normally I can access subviews using [scrollView viewWithTag:tagInt]; for example, but I can't seem to access the subviews of a subview using [[scrollView viewWithTag:tagInt] viewWithTag:tagInt2]; since viewWithTag only returns a single UIView and not all of it's subviews. I could always give each subview a unique tag and access them that way, but that doesn't seem to be the most elegant solution. What is the best way to access a subView and then get to the subView's subview (ie: access my UIScrollView used for zooming which is a subview of my main view, and then access it's subView UIImageView)?
