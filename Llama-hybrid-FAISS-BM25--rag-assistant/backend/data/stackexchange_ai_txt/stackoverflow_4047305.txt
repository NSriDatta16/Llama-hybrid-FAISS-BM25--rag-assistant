From a 40,000 foot view. I can think of two Microsoft Centric ways... both involving processes outside of the browser. 1) Use Internet Explorer, and write an IE Plugin application that plugs into the browser through an object declaration, and is passed Javascript field values for data, images, etc. All communication to the printer/print-driver is handled by the remoting .dll. I suppose you can also do something similar with a Firefox plugin. I use this method to process data from credit-card readers directly into a browser screen. 2) If the data is coming from a database, write an independent agent that runs on a workstation hooked to the printer. When you click the "print" button on the browser form, it sets a flag in the database. The agent periodically scans for this flag, and prints the resulting record. I've used this method for printing on Eltron or Zebra card printers. In fact I used MS-Access as the agent.
