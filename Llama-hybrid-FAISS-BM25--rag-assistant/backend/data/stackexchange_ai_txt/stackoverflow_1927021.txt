I think that most ELO-like systems on the Internet will have a problem with ratings creep. Assume that all new players start at a rating of zero. LousyPlayer loses a dozen games, and his rating goes far below zero. What stops him from clearing his browser, registering a new account under a new email address, and starting over? If this is possible, then low-ranked accounts will lay fallow, moving up the practical average rating.
