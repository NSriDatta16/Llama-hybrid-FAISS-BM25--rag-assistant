Ruby: difference between @cars.each do |car| and for car in @cars do

(Sorry for the newbie question.) In Ruby, what is the difference between the loops: @cars.each do |car| and for car in @cars do ? is there a difference in efficiency, or why do we need two (or more) ways to express the same thing? The second way seems more elegant/natural to me, but I may be missing some crucial observation, why the first may be the better choice.
