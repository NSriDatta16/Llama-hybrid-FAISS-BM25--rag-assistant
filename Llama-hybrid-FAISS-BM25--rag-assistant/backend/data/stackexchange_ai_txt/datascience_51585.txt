Why does a machine learning model of English can not be directly applied on right to left languages, like Arabic Hindi, and Urdu

I have a Logistic Regression model that works fine when used with an English Dataset. But, when I pass a same format data set in a different language, (Language is URDU which is right to left and UTF-8 encoded ) the model does not predict. I understand that the preprocessing differs for URDU, Arabic, and Hindi but even if it has been performed separately, still the model is unable to predict at all. I would like to know why the same model can not perform on different languages directly. Good or bad results are another topic. How can I make a model which is scalable enough to perform on both English and Arabic? What are the constraints in doing so?
