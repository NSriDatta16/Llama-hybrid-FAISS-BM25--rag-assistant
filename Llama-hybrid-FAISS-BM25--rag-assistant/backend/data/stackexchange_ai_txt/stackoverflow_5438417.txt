Is there a workaround to be able to drag and drop input types with Firefox and HTML 5?

I have a cross browser solution for dragging and dropping using HTML 5 that works for all elements in IE 9, Chrome, and Safari. Firefox works for everything except input types such as textboxes. I have done a lot of research on this with a lot of help from these resources: http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/01/10/cross-browser-html5-drag-and-drop/ http://html5doctor.com/native-drag-and-drop/ I have also scoured the HTML 5 spec and the Firefox MDN and other resources and have found no solution to the problem. I would hate to fall back to a jQuery library, but it just looks like HTML 5 is not ready for prime time and that I may have to do so. Has anyone tried this and have a solution or am I going too far over the edge here? Glad to see workarounds are so prevalent in HTML 5 already and my dream of HTML 5 being cross browser so quickly destroyed with the first new thing I try. The spec makes it sound simple. Add a draggable attribute and handle a few events. Except, IE only supports anchor tags and image tags. Webkit browsers need CSS and Firefox apparently doesn't support input fields.
