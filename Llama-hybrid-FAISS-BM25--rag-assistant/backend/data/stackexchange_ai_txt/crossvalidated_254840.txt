How to build the feature vector from sentence for intent classification in NLU?

I am trying to develop a NLU (natural language understanding) engine which interprets human language utterance to intent and slots. After some searching, I found this very useful question for NLU novice like me: How to proceed with NLP task for recognizing intent and slots In the answer, @darshan says: ...use a classifier to do the same using feature vector formulated from the input sentence. I know that after transforming the sentence to a feature vector will be very useful for classification task. But how should we get such a feature vector? For instance, the sentences: What's the weather today? What's it like out? How's the weather? all should be classified to a weather_query intent. But how to make these sentences into numerical feature vectors?
