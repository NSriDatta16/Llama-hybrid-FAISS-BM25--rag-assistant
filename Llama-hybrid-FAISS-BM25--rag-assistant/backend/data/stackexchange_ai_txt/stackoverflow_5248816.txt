Should I use "RecordID" as a column name?

I am creating an online application with five sections. Each section will have its own table. Let's call those sections SECTION1, SECTION2, etc. There will be a main table named APPLICATIONS. The first column in that table will be ApplicationID. There will only be a few thousand records on super fast servers, so I want to focus my attention on table and relationship readability, not on how much processing power I might be able to save if I de-normalize till I am sick. Here's how I am thinking I should name and structure the tables. Can you confirm this is the most readable method? In the past, I have done this effectively. But, I want to see if there are some easy improvements or ideas to integrate. On a scale of one to ten, how solid is this method of table/column naming? APPLICATIONS - TABLE ApplicationID - pk SECTION1 - TABLE RecordID- int - pk ApplicationID - fk Answer1 - text Answer2 - text SECTION2 - TABLE RecordID- int - pk ApplicationID - fk Answer1 - text Answer2 - text
