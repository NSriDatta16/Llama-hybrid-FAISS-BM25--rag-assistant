I would suggest this as a good reference to start with. Familarize yourself with the way documents are prepared for LaTeX. 1) There is no need to use \paragraph{} , just an empty line between paragraphs is enough. This will create a visible vertical space between paragraphs (that's why you wanted different paragraphs, right?). If you are bothered by the default indention for the new paragraph have a look at the documentation for \noindent or \parskip . 2) If you really have to start tweaking the page layout (i.e. your university/journal/employer doesn't already provide an accepted class or style) have a look at the geometry package. 3) There should be some fonts available in your installation already ( beton , helvet , palatino ?), and these can be loaded as packages. It really depends on what exactly you need to do.
