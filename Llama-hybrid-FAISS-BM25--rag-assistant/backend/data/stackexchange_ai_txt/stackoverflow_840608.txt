Deploy WCF service, C#, WCF, VS2008

I have a test project, WCF Service Library, and I published the project. Have a 2003 server with all the right installation. I browse to my application and upon clicking on .svc I get this error. The type 'SearchService', provided as the Service attribute value in the ServiceHost directive could not be found. This is the snippet from my web.config My Interface: [ServiceContract] public interface ISearchService { [OperationContract] string GetName(); } My Implementation: [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.PerSession)] public class SearchService :ISearchService { #region ISearchService Members public string GetName() { returnn "HAL-2001" } }
