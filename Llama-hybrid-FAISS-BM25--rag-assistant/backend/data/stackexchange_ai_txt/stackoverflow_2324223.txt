For Flash/AIR development you can use the (now open-source) Flex SDK. You can develop in pure actionscript and compiling for one vs. the other is just a question of a different root-level class and some different build commands/options. Shockwave I'm not sure about. If you use SilverLight, you could leverage your C# knowledge. There are some trade-offs with which runtime has a larger installed base, but there's no telling quite yet how that will play out in the future. Depending on the level of interaction you need, you might be interested in looking at Processing , which, even though it runs on applets, has done a pretty good job of making them more palatable. This SO question has some links to current version penetration for the different platforms: Silverlight penetration rate
