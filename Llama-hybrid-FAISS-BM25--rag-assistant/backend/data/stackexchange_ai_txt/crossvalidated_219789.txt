samplesize is also a typical hyperparameter. I determines how many random chosen samples are used for each tree. replace is another one. You can sample observations for trees with replacement or without. splitrule : in some packages like R-package randomForestSRC you can specify the splitting rule in the nodes. Random Forests converge with growing number of trees, see Breiman, 2001, paper. So if you set you ntree very high (for small datasets (n Difference in randomForestSRC and randomForest package / increasing OOB-Error curve )
