Polymorphism in Design Pattern

I have observed that most of the design patterns (I refer mostly from the Gang of Four book) are all based on polymorphism. That leads me to a "enlightened" moment that OOP's polymorphism is the most important feature in the paradigm. Some of the patterns use polymorphism are: strategy, factory, bridge... With that, I don't understand why we are not just teaching developers really good polymorphic behavior of OOP instead of overloading them with a bunch of patterns which in fact are based on polymorphism?
