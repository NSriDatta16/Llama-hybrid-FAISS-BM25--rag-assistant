This type of reorganisation is easy to do with the Subversion command line client, which might be a viable option for you. Here's the commands that would do it (from the TopLevel directory): svn mv src/ProjectA MyProject.Core/trunk/src/ svn ci -m "relocate ProjectA" You can also combine both commands into one by using URLs as the source and destination, see the svn mv documentation for details. I haven't found an easy way to do this sort of thing with TortoiseSVN, so when I need to I just use the command line client to do it.
