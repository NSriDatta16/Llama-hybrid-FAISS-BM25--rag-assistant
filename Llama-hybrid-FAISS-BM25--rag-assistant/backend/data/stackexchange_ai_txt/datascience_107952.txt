With PCA it is really important to put all (!) features on the same scale using standardization, e.g. using standard.scaler , i.e. having mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Also see this and this posts. The reason for this is that PCA looks at the variance explained by the different features. So in order to make the features comparable, standardization is required.
