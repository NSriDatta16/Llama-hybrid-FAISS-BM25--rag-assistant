From this StackOverflow Question while no activation is explicitly formulated, we could consider it to be a linear classification function. It appears that the dependencies that the word2vec models try to model can be achieved with a linear relation between the input words. Adding a non-linear activation function allows the neural network to map more complex functions, which could in turn lead to fit the input onto something more complex that doesn't retain the dependencies word2vec seeks.
