WPF Image : Let user drag the image to the desktop

I have a WPF user control hosted in a Windows Forms Application and the control contains a WPF image ( among other things ) and was wondering whether it is possible to let the user drag this image to outside the app ( to windows explorer, to the desktop , to a folder) ? Regards, MadSeb
