help using php explode () and organizing output

Can someone pls show me how to map this correctly? I am trying to understand how to use php explode() and organizing the values in a way that I can retrieve and print them in some organized matter. For each record I want to put a name=value in a particular bucket. I have (7) max buckets per record. Sometimes I have records that won't fill each bucket. (for example record (2) is missing attributes (5,6,7) and record (3) is missing attribute (4)). 1-Column=host1.colo.sub;2-Column=Fri Aug 13;3-Column=db9.nfl.colo2.;4-Column=00:00:03;5-Column=01:55:02;6-Column=87.24 MB;7-Column=Success; 1-Column=host1.colo.sub;2-Column=Fri Aug 13;3-Column=pdb2.colo2.;4-Column=04:00:02; 1-Column=host1.colo.sub;2-Column=Fri Aug 13;3-Column=gl3_lvm;5-Column=04:48:06;6-Column=54.64 MB;7-Column=Success; So far I wrote this to view my output: I would like to print out similar values for each attribute instead of this where its mixed. Using 'print $pieces[3];' 4-Column=00:00:034-Column=04:00:025-Column=04:48:06
