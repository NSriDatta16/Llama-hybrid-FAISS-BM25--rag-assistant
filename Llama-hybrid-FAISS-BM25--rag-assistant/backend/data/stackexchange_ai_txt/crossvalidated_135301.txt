Logistic regression : non exclusive predictors

I am doing a logistic regression . My outcome is a categorical (yes/ no) pain after surgery. The predictors i wish to model for includes the type of anaesthesia , among other predictors. The problem is the types i wish to include are general anaesthetic, plain spinal anaesthetic, spinal anaesthetic with morphine and finally spinal anaesthetic with diamorphine. Now, the 3 spinal anaesthetic categories are not mutually exclusive unlike general anaesthetic versus spinal anaesthetic alone. Is this appropriate for logistic regression? Or should i be using spare predictors ; i.e. GA vs Spinal and then spinal vs spinal morphine vs spinal diamorphine.. Any advice (in plain language please) would be gratefully received.
