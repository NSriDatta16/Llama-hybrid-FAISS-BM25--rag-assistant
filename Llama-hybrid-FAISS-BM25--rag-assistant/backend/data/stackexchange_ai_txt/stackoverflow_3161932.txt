ORM tool OR build the object to relational mapping layer manually

I am trying to determine what if any advantage or disadvantage there is to using an object to relational mapping layer like hibernate or the Microsoft Entity framework when building the data layer. Is using sql and mapping objects by hand better in the long run or is it better to leverage one of these mapping technologies? It seems like for simple apps the additional mapping layer might be advantageous because the tool can handle the simple mapping and sql therefore saving some time, but what about when your object models become more complicated? Also what are the performance implications if any? Thanks for any insight you might have.
