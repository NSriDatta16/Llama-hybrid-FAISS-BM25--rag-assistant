You are assuming that there is a best way to do that, and there isn't. It is completely dependent on your application architecture and personal preference. I can give you a couple of generic hints: Organize your public web folder sanely. Have an images/ directory for images, a css/ directory for CSS, and a js/ directory for javascript. Organization of code will depend on your project architecture. If you are using an OO architecture, it's possible to organize your code files so that they are outside of the web root, which gives you an added layer of security should your web server stop rendering PHP properly due to a misconfiguration (it happens). Images should not be stored in a database unless you have a good reason to do so.
