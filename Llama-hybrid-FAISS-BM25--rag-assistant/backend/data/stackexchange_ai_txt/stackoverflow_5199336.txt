I don't know if you're really looking for a PHP framework (like CodeIgniter or Symfony) or just for PHP library for image manipulation. Framework are useful to manage your whole application, dealing with users management, permission, data storage, etc... If your looking to just manipulate images, a Library should do the thing. My first app I did to manage a map was in plain PHP using the GD library (usually installed with your version of PHP). Documentation available here : http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php Quick small example to draw a line on an existing picture with GD : // Create image from existing jpg $image = @imagecreatefromjpeg('map.jpg'); // Draw a red line from X1 = 10, Y1 = 10, X2 = 20, Y2 = 20 $red = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 0, 0); imageline($image , 10 , 10 , 20 , 20 , $red); You can do a lot of things with GD, it just takes time to be used to.
