For me, I found the solution above helpful.... "Open These Latest Results as Transcript Text File" which explained it couldn't find libGDataTouchStaticLib.a. I then had to build the static library for Gdata.xcodeproj (changing the active target > GdataTouchStaticLib) then had to manually add this file by dragging it to the targets > MYAPPNAME > Link Binary With Libraries. Build & Run.. All Good.
