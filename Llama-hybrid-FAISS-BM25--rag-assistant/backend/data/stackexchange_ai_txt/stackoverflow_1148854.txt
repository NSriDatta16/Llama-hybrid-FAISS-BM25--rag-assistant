Rendering common session information in every view

I'd like to output some information that depends on session data in Django. Let's take a "Login" / "Logged in as | Logout" fragment for example. It depends on my request.session['user'] . Of course I can put a user object in the context every time I render a page and then switch on {% if user %} , but that seems to break DRY idea - I would have to add user to every context in every view. How can I extract a fragment like that and make it more common?
