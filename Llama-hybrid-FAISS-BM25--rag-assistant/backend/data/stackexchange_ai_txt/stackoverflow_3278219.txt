You should be able to meet your goals with AJAX. But as a mobile user, please don't bother with... "dialogs that fade in and out" "drop shadow dialog boxes" "dynamic resizing of dialog boxes" ...because they're completely unnecessary from a functionality standpoint, and all they do is slow down/crash mobile applications. Drag and drop is also something that's often clumsy on mobile devices; but it's your judgment whether it's useful for your app.
