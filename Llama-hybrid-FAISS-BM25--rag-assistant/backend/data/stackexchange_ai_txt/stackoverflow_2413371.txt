Part-1: data structure (from original question) : One row per version -VS- all versions in one row: Store one revision per row, do not pack all revisions into one row as XML or any other multi-value supporting types. Initially the article might be edited few times and the revisions will be asked for by the author(s), but later on only the most recent version will be requested by your application. In this case there is no point in loading all the change history. One table -VS- two tables: Third_normal_form would suggest using 2 tables: - Article[ActicleID(int,PK), AuthorID(int,FK), ...] - ArticleRevisions[ArticleID(int,UK), RevisionID(int,UK), Content, RevisionComment, RevisionTimeStamp, ...] In any case store complete articles and do not play with delta -type implementation - your use case does not call for the complexity, but for simplicity. Also you might redundantly store the LatestRevisionID in the Article table for easier retrieval of latest revision. You might opt for the solution with one table. For an example look at line 76 ( Table('wiki'... ) in the database schema of Trac . Also you might take a look how Trac does it for its simple Wikis by looking at example of their revision history and revision diff , which are quite similar to those on StackOverflow. Part-2: detecting and presenting differences between two revisions : First of all, one does not visually identifies the changes, but rather programmatically . What you need is a library which given two files (strings/lists of strings) will provide you will a diff result. In many cases one opts for line-by-line comparison, as did stackoverflow ). Then you need a mean of presenting those results to the use (with greens, reds, strikeouts etc). Although I have little knowledge about PHP and its libraries, following links should get you started: meta.SO: What revision library does stackoverflow use? with links to the C# implementation and the algorithm explanation SO: Calculate text diffs in PHP 8.4. difflib â€” Helpers for computing deltas - difflib for python, which is used by Trac jsdifflib demo - text diff for javascript
