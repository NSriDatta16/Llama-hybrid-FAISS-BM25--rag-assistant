In Android, how to have bi-directional scroll AND show both scroll bars?

It seems that Android ScrollView does not support bi-directional scroll. Although, a HorizontalScrollView can be placed inside a ScrollView, which effectively provides bi-directional scrolling (as below). However, the horizontal scrollbar is now "at the bottom of" the vertical scroll view. So, if I scroll all the way to the bottom of the vertical scroll view, and then drag left to right, the horizontal scrollbar will show. Otherwise, the horizontal scrollbar doesn't show, because it is "off the screen". Any advice?
