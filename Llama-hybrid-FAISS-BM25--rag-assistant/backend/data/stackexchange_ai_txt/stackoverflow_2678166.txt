how to avoid returning mocks from a mocked object list

I'm trying out mock/responsibility driven design. I seem to have problems to avoid returning mocks from mocks in the case of objects that need a service to retrieve other objects. An example could be an object that checks whether the bills from last month are paid. It needs a service that retrieves a list of bills. So I need to mock that billRetrievalService in my tests. At the same time I need that BillRetrievalMock to return mocked Bills (since I don't want my test to rely on the correctness of the Bill implementation). Is my design flawed? Is there a better way to test this? Or is this the way it will need to be when using finder objects (the finding of the bills in this case)? side note: althout Bill might be a value object candidate, the wider problem still remains when the collections aren't containing value objects (eg Users).
