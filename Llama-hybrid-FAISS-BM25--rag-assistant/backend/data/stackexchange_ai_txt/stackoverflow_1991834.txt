With critical software you want your system to have as deterministic behaviour as possible. Dynamic memory, memory fragmentation, possible leaks, and in some corner cases (not too rare) misbehaviour of malloc will make it that much harder to gain 100% determinism. That said, if part of your program (say an algorithm) requires dynamic allocation and you can prove that your memory allocation and de-allocation (free) will be deterministic (see valuable notes by RickNZ) then you're closer to having a deterministic system.
