API is a logical representation of non-empty collection of Java classes and interfaces (add annotations and enums). Library (being JAR Java library) is a unit of deployment of one, many or part of API. There is no one-to-one or many-to-one association between two in general since their concerns are orthogonal in nature: API is concerned with logic and functionality ; library is concerned with deployment . Excellent resource that covers these relationships is Robert Martin Principles of OOD - look for last 6 package principles.
