Averaging individual predictions in a group

I created linear model to give prediction for a team member (individual). Can I use this model to give average (individual) prediction in a team by providing average values of features among team members, or by averaging predictions by each team member? Example: Training Data Independent Variables are Task Count and Average Points while Points are y-value. $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} \text{Team Id} & \text{Sprint Id} & \text{Team Member} & \text{Task Count} & \text{Avg Points} & \text{Points} \\ \hline \text{1} & 123 & Mike & 4 & 5 & 20 \\ \hline \text{2} & 273 & Chris & 5 & 3 & 15 \\ \hline \text{3} & 403 & James & 7 & 2 & 14 \\ \hline \text{4} & 298 & Paul & 2 & 6 & 12 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ Actual Data that linear model will use to predict I average independent values by category within a team. The averaged values for each category will be given to predict average story points for an individual within a team. $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} \text{Team Id} & \text{Sprint Id} & \text{Avg. Task Count} & \text{Avg. Avg Points} & \text{Avg. Points} \\ \hline \text{1} & 342 & 4 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline \text{2} & 713 & 5 & 5 & 3 \\ \hline \text{3} & 663 & 6 & 7 & 2 \\ \hline \text{4} & 188 & 7 & 2 & 6 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ Not sure if I can use the model with average values by category to predict average points.
