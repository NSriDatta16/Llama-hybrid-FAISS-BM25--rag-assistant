This could be due to the restrictions of Oracle XE(Express i.e. the freebie version). Specifically only one predefined "user" tablespace and a 4GB limit on storage. While this doesnt seem too restrictive the tablespace and "initial" storage sizes are embedded in the export files table definitions. If your the exporting system specified a tablespace other than users or specified an "initial" storage allocation that cumulativly exceeds your 4GB storage allocation the import will fail. So unless the export file was created by another XE database you are likely to have problems. You can capture the DDL (sort off) by using the -show option of the imp command. You can also edit the .imp file to remove the "tablespace" and "initial" clauses from the DDL -- but make sure you backup the original file first as you can easily make the file unreadable.
