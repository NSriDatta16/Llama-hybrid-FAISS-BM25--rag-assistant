subsetting nonconsecituve observations in R

I have a table with >2M rows. I am only interested in percentiles of one variable vs. percentiles of number of observations (e.g. Lorentz curve). How do I create a smaller dataframe that contains e.g. observations number 1,101,201,301,...,last , or observations that corresponds to e.g. the 1,2,3,...,100 percentile of total number of observations? Is there a quick way to get the lorenz curve of (index, variable) with axes on a percentage basis? Right now I was thinking of adding variables for percentiles of index and variables and then plot them against each other. Thanks, Roberto
