Unrealistic results in Gpinter

I have tho following wealth tax statistic from which i want to do a Pareto interpolation using gpinter. From this table i have extracted the percentails, their corresponding thresholds and bracket averages Than I have entered them in R using the gpinter application as shown in the blueprint provided by the creator Thomas Blanchet. However, I recieve unrealistic results, i.e. higher than 100% for top10 shares. Can somebody point put where have I made a mistake? Thank you.
