I rename the variables $X_1=X$ and $X_2 = Y$ so the question is: What is the probability that $X_1>X_2$ given that $X_j$ is Frechet $(\alpha,s_j,m)$ ? First note that this problem can be considered as the problem that $$X_1 = \max\{X_1,X_2\},$$ this problem is well known in the theory of extreme values. First I note that $$Pr(X_1>X_2) = Pr(X_1 - m > X_2 - m) = Pr(Z_1>Z_2),$$ defining $Z_j = X_j - m$ such that $Z_j$ is Frechet $(\alpha,s_j,0)$ . I then note that $$ Pr(Z_1>Z_2) = Pr(Z_1 = \max\{Z_1,Z_2\}) = \int_{z_1} \int_{z_2} I[z_1 = \max\{z_1,z_2\}] f_{Z_2}(dz_2)f_{Z_1}(dz_1).$$ Because the Frechet with location $0$ has positive support on $(0,\infty)$ the first integral goes from $0$ to $\infty$ . The same thing goes for the second integral however the indicator is 0 unless $z_2\leq z_1$ so the integral runs from $0$ to $z_1$ . Making the limits explicit I therefore have $$= \int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{z_1} f_{Z_2}(dz_2)f_{Z_1}(dz_1)$$ and it follows that $$= \int_{0}^{\infty} F_{Z_2}(z_1)f_{Z_1}(z_1)dz_1, \ \ \ (eq. 1)$$ into which the Frechet c.d.f. and p.d.f. can be inserted to get the solution. The Frechet c.d.f. is given as $$F_{Z_j}(z) = Pr(Z_j\leq z) = \exp\left( - \left(\frac{z}{s_j}\right)^{-\alpha} \right),$$ which I choose to reparameterize in order to get $$F_{Z_j}(z) = \exp\left( - \Phi_j z^{-\alpha} \right),$$ having defined $\Phi_j :=s_j^\alpha$ . By differentiation it follows that $$f_{Z_j}(z) = \exp\left( - \Phi_j z^{-\alpha} \right) \Phi_j \alpha z^{-\alpha -1} \ \ \ (eq. 2).$$ Insert these into (eq.1) above to get $$ Pr(Z_1 = \max\{Z_1,Z_2\}) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \exp\left( - \Phi_2 z^{-\alpha} \right) \times \exp\left( - \Phi_1 z^{-\alpha} \right) \Phi_1 \alpha z^{-\alpha -1} dz$$ paying attention to the fact that the $\Phi_j$ parameters come from respective distributions of $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ . This integral is easily solved by defining $\Phi= \Phi_1 + \Phi_2$ and rewriting $$ Pr(Z_1 = \max\{Z_1,Z_2\}) =\frac{\Phi_1}{\Phi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \exp\left( - \Phi z^{-\alpha} \right) \Phi \alpha z^{-\alpha -1} dz$$ where I move $\Phi_1$ outside the integral and then divide by $\Phi$ outside the integral and multiply with $\Phi$ inside the integral. It is now easy to see that the function under the integral is the p.d.f. as given in (eq. 2) and hence it integrates 1 implying that $$ Pr(Z_1 = \max\{Z_1,Z_2\}) =\frac{\Phi_1}{\Phi},$$ which offcourse can be written using the parameterization $$\Phi_j :=s_j^\alpha$$ and $\Phi := \sum_j s_j^\alpha$ . This result can be generalized to get $$Pr(i \in \arg \max_j \{X_j\}) = Pr(X_i \geq \max_j \{X_j\}) = \frac{\Phi_i}{\sum_j \Phi_j}$$ assuming independence and $X_j \sim Frechet(\alpha,\Phi_j,0)$ for all $j$ .
