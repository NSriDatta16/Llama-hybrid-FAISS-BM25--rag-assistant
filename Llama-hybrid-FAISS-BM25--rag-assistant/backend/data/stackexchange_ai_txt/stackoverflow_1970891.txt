How to code smooth scrolling for "flick" gesture on iPhone

I have horizontal list for which I'm implementing my own scrolling logic. I have the "touch and drag" scrolling working great, but I'm having trouble with the "flick" gesture. All the built in scrollable views have the feature that if you "flick" the view it scrolls faster or slower based on the intensity of the flick. Does anyone has any suggestion how do that for my view? What I'm doing right now is changing the UIView.center.x coordinate of my custom UIView to scroll it across the screen
