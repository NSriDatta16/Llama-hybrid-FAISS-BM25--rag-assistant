Silverlight 3 and component library advice

I have to build a web application in a couple of weeks in your usual 3 tier, UI/Business Logic/Data Store, type way, however the customised UI really isn't achievable in anything but Silverlight or Flash (lots of custom vector drawing, fades, animation type stuff etc.). Given I'm not a Flash developer, but am an excellent C# programmer, I'm going to use this project as an excuse to learn Silverlight 3. So, I have a couple of questions which I'd love to hear some thoughts on, to save me a lot of time up-front. What is a great Silverlight 3 book? Unfortunately I'm not seeing an O'Reily book, which is usually my first preference. I'm looking for a book that gets right down to business, not a 'history of Silverlight' book. Here's a canvas, here's how you draw into it, type of thing. Is there value in buying a Silverlight 2 book, or has enough changed to not make this viable? I want to use a mature Silverlight control library to take care of buttons, gauges, graphs, etc., so I can get on with the custom stuff I need to do. I've noticed there are a few different vendors. The ones I've looked at are: Telerik, ComponentOne, Infragistics and Syncfusion. Frankly they all look pretty good, but I'd love to know if anyone has concrete experience they could share to help me make a decision. I've been noticing that Silverlight apps seem to run into performance problems vs similar Flash apps. Even the demos of the control vendors I mentioned in (2) seem to run at very variable framerates (I'm testing on a Mac with Safari 4 using Snow Leopard, but I notice this on IE and Chrome too on Windows 7). I don't mean to create a Silverlight vs Flash flame war here, it's just what I've noticed. Does anyone have gotchas I can steer clear of? Thanks for your input. Regards, Shane
