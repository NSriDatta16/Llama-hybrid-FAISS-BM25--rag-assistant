When are time series data exchangeable?

E.g. is a linear process exchangeable? What about strict vs weak stationarity? EDIT: for clarity, I'm asking if/when the sequence of data points $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ in the time series is exchangeable. I'm mainly interested because I am not sure that I've fully understood the concepts of exchangeability and stationarity, and could not find any other questions that address this directly.
