You can use several approaches to do that. As I understood you want to perform Ex Ante forecasts and one of the many possibilities is to use restricted sample period T = {T1,..., Tn} to estimate the model. The model is then forecasted out of sample over the period Tn+1... Tn+k... The simple example would use AR(1) model to illustrate the main idea of this approach: Consider a sample of {y1,y2....yt} from the AR(1) model such that: yt= δ0 + δ1yt-1+ ut We can obtain ex ante forecasts of yt+1, yt+h as follows: 1. Estimation: Using your sample {y1....yn} estimate δ0,δ1 and get fitted values δ0(hat) and δ1(hat) 2. Forecasting yt+1: using yt and fitted values (δ0(hat) and δ1(hat)) obtain yt+1(hat)=δ0(hat) + δ1(hat)yt 3. Forecasting yt+h: We can recursively obtain yt+h(hat) = δ0(hat) + δ1(hat)yt+h-1(hat) using yt+h-1(hat) and (δ0(hat) δ1(hat)) Try to google predictive regression for time series, regression model forecasts, you may find many creative techniques that the researchers come up with
