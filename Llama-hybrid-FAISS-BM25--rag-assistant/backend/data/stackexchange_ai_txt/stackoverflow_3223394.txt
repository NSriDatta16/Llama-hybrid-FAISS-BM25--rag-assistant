I'm only guessing, but I see distances occasionally being set to Integer.MAX_VALUE . If those numbers are actually entering the result and then being divided down by one or two factors of 10, that would explain very nicely why the average is much, much larger than expected and roughly in the same ballpark as MAX_VALUE. It's OK to have this large value in your graph when it is used to determine the shortest path among alternatives, but once you get to the point where you are determining actual distances, that number has to go! Either you have a path length in the ballpark of MAX_VALUE, that says there is no path. That path length therefore doesn't go into your average. Or your path length is a small integer in the same magnitude as your in-graph distances, then it's valid and you can include it in your calculations. The lesson to be taken home from this: Just because a number came out of a computer program that doesn't mean it's trustworthy or correct!
