I don't know if there's a supported method for generating an extension other than .tmp, but this will give you a unique file: string fileName = Path.ChangeExtension(Path.GetTempFileName(), Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + "tr5")) Not an elegant solution and I'm not sure if you need to then retrieve based on specific extension, but you could still write a pattern even for this.
