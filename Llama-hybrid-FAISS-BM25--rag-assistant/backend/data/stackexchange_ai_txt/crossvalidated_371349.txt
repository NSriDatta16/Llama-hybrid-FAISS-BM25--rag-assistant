I think "nothing" is too strong, but I imagine the statement is a pedagogical challenge meant to address one or more issues: I. It may be addressing the reification of statistical models. II. As you say, it may be addressing point summaries, which do not necessarily represent any individual. (In fact, the summary value may be impossible for any individual to achieve.) III. It may be emphasizing that probabilistic statements have a context. If you say "there's a 95% mortality rate for this disease" you're making a statement that marginalizes out all characteristics of patients except that they're human. In reality, a particular disease may affect men or women more, will affect the old, young, or middle more, will affect someone with a chronic disease or other pre-existing health issues more, will probably affect the never-exposed more than those who have previously been exposed (hence vaccines), will be more deadly if not treated or if not treated within an initial time window, ... We're always leaving stuff out of predictions either because we don't have the information for the model we built or we don't have the information for the individual we're predicting on. In the best case, we lump all of the unknowns into an "error" term and if it's small enough and tame enough we ignore it. That's an ideal, though. In light of that, saying "the disease kills 95% of humans who acquire it" is not the same as saying "the disease will kill you with 95% certainty". We are only now getting to the place where medicine might be developed at the individual level and not the population level. The long list of side effects on medications is a testament to your slogan. IV. It may be emphasizing that statistical machinery is not always necessary or useful. For example, if the question is "who is the tallest person in the class?" or "was our factory's production at an all-time high?", you don't need statistics. For this class or that factory, the data itself tells you and applying statistical machinery in that case is really more of a manipulation than a clarification.
