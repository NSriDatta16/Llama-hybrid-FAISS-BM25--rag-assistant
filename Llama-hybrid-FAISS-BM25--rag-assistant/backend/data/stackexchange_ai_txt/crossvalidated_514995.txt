What would you recommend to someone interested in paying people to wake up earlier based on the research abstract below?

Experiment design: Researchers ran an experiment to test whether paying people to get up on time made them less likely to sleep in late. Fifty participants were randomized to 2 groups: a control group who got no incentive, or a group who got a small daily payment. The main outcome measure was the average time participants got out of bed after 16 weeks. Results: Compared with the control group, the daily payments group got up a mean of 9.2 minutes earlier (t = 1.21; 95% CI, -3.20 to 12.66; P = .23) than in the no-incentives group (4.4 minutes).
