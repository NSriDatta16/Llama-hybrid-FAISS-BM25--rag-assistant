Table in Latex Overlapping with Second Column of the Page

I got a problem with tables in LaTeX. I am using a pre-defined format from a conference, which makes a page consists of two columns. My table is too wide to be contained in one column, so it goes to the second column of the page and overlaps with text! Why is LaTeX allowing this? Is it possible in the current format, to make the table a block, so that it uses two columns, and the text in the other column dragged down a bit? Any other suggestion? This is my code: \begin{table} \centering \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Rule & Factor & Best Value & Delta_t & Delta_{do} & Comments \\ \hline \multirow{3}{c}{Diagonal Dominance} & Line Angle & 45 & 15 & 30 & The angle between the prominent line of the object and the diagonal lines \\ % TODO: What object? Make sure it is clear. & Line Distance & 0 & 0.25 & 1 & The distance, in screen coordinates, from the prominent line of the object to the diagonal lines. \\ % TODO: Need to define screen coordinates & Corner Distances & 0 & 0.1 & 0.7 & The distance, in screen coordinates, from the end of the prominent line of the object to the corners of the screen. \\ \hline \end{tabular} \caption{The factors of each rule and their parameters.} \label{table:factors} \end{table} Thank you in advance for your help. Regards, Rafid
