You are probably running with an ssh-agent or have auth'ed you private key specifically. When you run in cron you do not have a session, and you do not have anything that goes along with sessions like ssh-agent or ttys to read a password from. Create a password-less key and add the public key to the target account under ~target/.ssh/authorized_keys . You will then be able to use the key you just created with scp to auth and copy the file. FYI: You may want to read the ssh server man page on command keys and how key access and authentication work.
