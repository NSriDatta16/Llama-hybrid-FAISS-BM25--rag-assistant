the posterior distribution can be approximated by the prior multiplied by the likelihood This is incorrect. The posterior density $\pi(\theta|x)$ is exactly determined by the product $\pi(\theta)\ell(\theta|x)$ in the sense that $$\pi(\theta|x)=\dfrac{\pi(\theta)\ell(\theta|x)}{\underbrace{\int\pi(\theta)\ell(\theta|x)\text d\theta}_\text{evidence}}$$ there are methods (mcmc) for calculating this integral This is also incorrect in that (a) MCMC simulations from the posterior [which indeed do not require the evidence to be known] are rarely helpful to compute the evidence, witness the poor performances of the harmonic mean estimator and (b) simulations only produce an approximation to the integral.
