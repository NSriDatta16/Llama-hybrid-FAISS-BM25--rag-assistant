Transferring SQL to NHibernate Criteria APi

I have this SQL here that needs to be transferred to NHibernate Criteria API: select nn.* from NetworkNumber nn inner join (select number, max(Version) ver from NetworkNumber group by number) b on b.number=nn.number and b.ver=nn.version If anyone has a good knowledge of it, I'd appreciate a lot. In the meantime - I'll keep trying and post back results (if any).. Edit: So far I've got this: var results = StagingSessionFactory.OpenSession() .CreateCriteria () .SetProjection( Projections.ProjectionList() .Add(Projections.Property("Number"), "Number") .Add(Projections.Max("Version"), "Version") .Add(Projections.GroupProperty("Number"), "Number") ) .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean(typeof(NetworkNumber))) .List (); Which gives me the right Version/Number of the NetworkNumber, but I need the rest of the fields (Id, etc). Perhaps I am missing just a little something?
