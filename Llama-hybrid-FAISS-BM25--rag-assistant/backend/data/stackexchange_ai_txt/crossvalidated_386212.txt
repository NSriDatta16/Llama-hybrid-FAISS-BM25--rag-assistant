After a quick read of your question, I recommend you consider whether period would actually be a psuedoreplicate of match. Are periods independent of each other? Also, it is unclear what your actual response variable is. Time between events seems more like an explanitory variable for whether the event occurs. Are you interested in whether the performace of a team or player is better during the season or pre-season? If this is the case, consider using performance (number of goals, probability of scoring, Event?, etc.) as the response variable. You might try to test whether the seasons are actually different using logistic regression or a generalized linear mixed model. Using a mixed model would all you to incorporate random effects, such as team or stadium, etc. Once you have your model, you could test whether the parameter 'season' actually has an effect on the performance of the players using a liklihood ratio test. Then if you determine 'season' is an important parameter (explanatory variable in this case), you can compare the (log) odds ratios of an event occurring.
