You could have a set of daemons which poll your queue for new tasks. Or you could use a message queuing product or something like Gearman. Or you could run cron jobs which check for new work to do from time to time. You could keep a task queue in your database; this might not be efficient if you have large numbers of tasks and processes, so you might want to investigate the many message queuing products. You could run one or more agent tasks (daemons etc) per server, or just one. You could run them synchronously or asynchronously to gather data from whichever servers they need to. You could write the results to another database, or send them via email, or in a file. You could write all of this in any language or a mixture of several. The options are practically endless :)
