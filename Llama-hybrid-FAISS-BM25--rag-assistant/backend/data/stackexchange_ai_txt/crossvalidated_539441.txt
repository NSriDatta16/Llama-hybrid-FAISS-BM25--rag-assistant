For risk ratios, the averaging is done on the log scale. So, if you take the log of y, then compute the weighted average, and then back-transform via exponentiation, you get the expected result (0.24). For example, in R: w yields 0.2485498 (which is 0.25 when rounded, but this discrepancy is due to rounding of the weights and risk ratios shown in the figure).
