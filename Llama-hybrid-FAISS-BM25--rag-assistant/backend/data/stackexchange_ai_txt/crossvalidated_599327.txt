Well, AlphaGo 's value network has suffered from correlated data according to the authors, David Silver et al.. The network predicts the outcome of a game, and the training data consists of professional games. They say that the network learned to recognize the games in the training data instead of learning the game itself. This is very plausible, learning the game is hard, but recognizing distinct games are much easier, every game probably has some easily recognizable characteristic features. To mitigate this problem, they created a new dataset by taking only a single state from a game. This reduced the overfitting and the network generalized. References: Silver, David, et al.
