W. Craig Trader's answer sums up most of it, however, I find that personal work style makes a huge difference as well. Where I currently work we use subversion as our One True Source, however, many developers use git-svn on their personal machines to compensate for workflow issue we have (failure of management, but that's another story). In any case. its really about balancing what feature sets make you most productive with what the organization needs (centralized authentication, for example).
