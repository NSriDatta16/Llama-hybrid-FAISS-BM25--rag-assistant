MKL Accelerated Math Libraries for Java

I've looked at the related threads on StackOverflow and Googled with not much luck. I'm also very new to Java (I'm coming from a C# and .NET background) so please bear with me. There is so much available in the Java world it's pretty overwhelming. I'm starting on a new Java-on-Linux project that requires some heavy and highly repetitious numerical calculations (i.e. statistics, FFT, Linear Algebra, Matrices, etc.). So maximizing the performance of the mathematical operations is a requirement, as is ensuring the math is correct. So hence I have an interest in finding a Java library that perhaps leverages native acceleration such as MKL, and is proven (so commercial options are definitely a possibility here). In the .NET space there are highly optimized and MKL accelerated commercial Mathematical libraries such as Centerspace NMath and Extreme Optimization. Is there anything comparable in Java? Most of the math libraries I have found for Java either do not seem to be actively maintained (such as Colt) or do not appear to leverage MKL or other native acceleration (such as Apache Commons Math). I have considered trying to leverage MKL directly from Java myself (e.g. JNI), but me being new to Java (let alone interoperating between Java and native libraries) it seemed smarter finding a Java library that has already done this correctly, efficiently, and is proven. Again I apologize if I am mistaken or misguided (even in regarding any libraries I've mentioned) and my ignorance of the Java offerings. It's a whole new world for me coming from the heavily commercialized Microsoft stack so I could easily be mistaken on where to look and regarding the Java libraries I've mentioned. I would greatly appreciate any help or advice.
