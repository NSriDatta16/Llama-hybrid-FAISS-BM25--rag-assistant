What do you mean by "local store"? If you mean the HTML5 applicationCache, then yes, any images that are in the applicationCache are available for use online or offline. If you mean from the Web SQL database or the localStorage API, then yes, but the images must be base64-encoded as text and then loaded as data URLs. If you mean the photos in the user's personal collection on a mobile device or computer, then no, that's not possible.
