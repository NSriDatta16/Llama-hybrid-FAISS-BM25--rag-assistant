Simple MVC Question for MVC beginner

i have an Ajax ActionLink which normally just returns a PartialView (which is just a UserControl ascx file) however, my needs have changed and i want to return another PartialView (so a total of two PartialViews) that occupy different areas of my page... of course i can't call " return PartialView("UserControl.ascx") " twice in a row consecutivelly... so my question is what would be an elegant work around for this? how can i return two PartialViews WITHOUT wrapping these two PartialViews up in a larger parent view? i hesitate to do this because both items are in a different part of the html table which would require me to include practically the entire page in the parent view due to the structure of the table, and in this case lots of html data unnecessarily would be sent to the browser at each request - defeating the purpose of an ajax call/partial update (correct me if i'm wrong).
