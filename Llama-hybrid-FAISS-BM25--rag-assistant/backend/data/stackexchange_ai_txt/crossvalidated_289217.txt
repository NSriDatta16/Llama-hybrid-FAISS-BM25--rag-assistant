Here's a quote from page 306 of the second edition of Bayesian Data Analysis that has helped me personally with the same question: It is hard to give general advice on efficient jumping rules, but some results have been obtained for normal random walk jumping distribtutions that seem to be useful in many problems. Suppose there are $d$ parameters, and the posterior distribution $\theta = (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_d)$, after appropriate transformation, is multivariate normal with known variance matrix $\Sigma$. Further suppose that we will take draws using the Metropolis algorithm with a normal jumping kernel centered on the current point and with the same shape as the target distribution: that is $J(\theta^*|\theta^{t-1}) = N(\theta^*|\theta^{t-1},c^2\Sigma)$. Among this class of jumping rules, the most efficient has scale $c \approx 2.4/\sqrt{d}$, where efficiency is defined relative to independent sampling from the posterior distributuon.
