Cookie available in the same request/response

I have found a strange behaviour (strange for me, a novice :D) in my project. Basicly after an action I create or update a cookie (if it exists or not) and send it to the client. The strange thing is that in the jsp I can read the cookie ONLY when I update its value (and I get the updated value, not the old one) but not the first time, when I create it (I can see the cookie using a browser tool but seems that the jsp can't read it). Is this a normal behaviour? If yes, what do you suggest to do in order to have the cookie information available also at the first time? Thanks very much! Roberto
