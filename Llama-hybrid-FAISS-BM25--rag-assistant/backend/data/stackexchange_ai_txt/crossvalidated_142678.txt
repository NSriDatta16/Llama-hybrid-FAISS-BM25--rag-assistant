As Cross Validated grows ever larger and the need for moderation skyrockets, subgroups begin to speckle the site; one such group is students. As an undergraduate myself, I have grappled with the challenges of learning the basic concepts of statistics and machine learning. A huge number of new posters are students, and their questions are quickly closed for being in the wrong format. I agree with the rules in place, but I think that Cross Validated here is failing the users who might need it the most. As the moderator team must be representative of its community, a stronger core of students must be established in order to serve and assist this group. Thus, I present myself to your judgement. I am not the most experienced user on the site, nor the most decorated. I am, however, passionate about change and accommodation for the marginalized groups on Cross Validated. An underused and slightly intimidating chat system and no information for students self-study questions on the "tour" page are just two places that immediately demand attention and improvement. I owe a lot to this community; being able to give back through donating my time to moderate would be a dream come true.
