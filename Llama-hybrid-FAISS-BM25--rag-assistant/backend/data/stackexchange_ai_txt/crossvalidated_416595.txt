How to formulate reinforcement learning problem with State as a combination of multiple factors?

I am reading sutton's reinforcement learning an introduction . The book mentioned that for continuous state space, one could leverage value function with the form V(s, w) = W*S , where s represents state and w the weights. So if there is only 1 factor in a state, the function could be like, for instance, V(s, w) = w_1*s + w_0 However, what if the state has 2 or more components? Say S = S(position, time) , then how to rewrite the above function? Is it V(s, w) = w_1*(position + time) + w_0 ? Thanks in advance
