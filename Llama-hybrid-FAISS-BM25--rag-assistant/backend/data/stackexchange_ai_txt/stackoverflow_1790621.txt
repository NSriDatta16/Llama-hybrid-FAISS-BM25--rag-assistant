If a DOM parser is out of the question - for whatever reason, I'd go for some variant of PHP's explode() or whatever is available in the programming language that you use. You could for example start out by splitting by , which would give you each result (remember to ignore the first place). After that you could loop the results split each result by etc. This is by no means an optimal solution, and it will be quite fragile (almost any change in the layout of the document would break the code). Another option would be to go after some CSS selector library like phpQuery or similar for your programming language.
