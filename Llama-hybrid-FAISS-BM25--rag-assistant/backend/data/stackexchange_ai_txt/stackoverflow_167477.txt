"Branch early, branch often." All builds should be completely reproducible without having to pour through logs (consider tagging every build) If you use an issue tracker then require all check-ins to have a (valid) issue ID included in the commit message (add a pre-hook to check this). Only the build team should be allowed to make production branches (developers should be encouraged to make personal branches for any non-trivial task) Build continuously and ensure that everyone is aware that breaking the build is a big deal. Read the whole SVN book, then read it again. You need to know this tool backwards and forwards. Hold training sessions for your developers ("how to create a temporary branch for my work", "how to merge", etc). ... There is an lack of good reading on this subject, but if I had to recommend one book to a shop completely green in SCM it would be "The Build Master" by Vincent Maraia. It's very short on details but easy to read and provides a (very very brief) overview of SCM good-ideas that make great sense once you know them but which for some reason so many shops completely lack. Good luck!
