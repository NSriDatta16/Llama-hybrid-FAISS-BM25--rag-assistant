Convention while using Helper Casting Functions

I recently began to start using functions to make casting easier on my fingers for one instance I had something like this ((Dictionary )value).Add(foo); and converted it to a tiny little helper function so I can do this ToDictionary(value).Add(foo); Is this against the coding standards? Also, what about simpler examples? For example in my scripting engine I've considered making things like this ((StringVariable)arg).Value="foo"; be ToStringVar(arg).Value="foo"; I really just dislike how inorder to cast a value and instantly get a property from it you must enclose it in double parentheses. I have a feeling the last one is much worse than the first one though
