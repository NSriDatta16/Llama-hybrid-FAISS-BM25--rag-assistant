You can always take a look at the documentation to get a better idea of what is supported, but the general methods to implement are: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; When you tap down, touchesBegan is called with the set of touches that just began. To retrieve all touches currently on the screen, retrieve event.allTouches . Similarily obvious actions occur when a finger moves or is removed from the screen. The touchesCancelled method is mostly used to support the UIScrollView which allows you to tap something inside a scroll view, then drag the scroll view itself rather that interact with the subview, if certain criteria are met (the scroll view would send a touches cancelled message to the subview when it starts scrolling). There are no built-in gestures you can watch for to speak of, but there are built-in gestures that the system handles, like swiping across a row in a table to delete it, and pinch-zooming on a UIScrollView .
