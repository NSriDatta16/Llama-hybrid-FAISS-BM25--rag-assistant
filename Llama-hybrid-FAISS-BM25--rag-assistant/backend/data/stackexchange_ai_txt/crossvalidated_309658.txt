Given that it is chronological data the scatter plot between two series may not be inferential. It is well known that if a series is auto-correlated the cross correlation is of limited value. When someone views the scatter plot trying to extract "guidance" time series data may not be amenable as the cross-correlation is functionally related to the slope of a Least Squares model. Initially "torturing the data until it confesses" by attempting to power transform the data based upon visualization may not only be anachronistic but inappropriate when dealing with chronological data. As an example of this consider the GASX problem from Box & Jenkins we have the following XY plot which is somewhat despiriting as there is only a hint of possible success due to obfuscations. With thorough time series analytics , we can develop a model like this with statistics like this with an eye-popping r-squared .. all without unnecessary and unwanted power transformations (data torture !) . In summary the things we were taught in the first course in statistics , i.e. eye the data first ... may only be applicable to certain types of data like cross-sectional data without gaussian violations. Chronological data analysis presents not only problems but opportunities to develop what might be a useful modelala GEP Box. Certainly influential observations, changes in variance , changes in parameters etc. also need to be seamlessly incorporated into the model formulation which is an iterative process.
