PCA is sensitive to outliers. Try removing the outlier, and running PCA again, or try a robust PCA approach. From the Wikipedia article on PCA, section "Robustness – weighted PCA": Kriegel, H. P.; Kröger, P.; Schubert, E.; Zimek, A. (2008). A General Framework for Increasing the Robustness of PCA-Based Correlation Clustering Algorithms . Scientific and Statistical Database Management. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 5069: 418. doi:10.1007/978-3-540-69497-7_27. ISBN 978-3-540-69476-2. (which is specific literature for clustering! Roughly the idea is that you try to give less weight to the outliers, such that PCA is less influenced by it.) Also check the various literature given in the Robust principal component analysis article; too much to copy here.
