If I understand you correctly, you'll have to use the Tumblr API (with either JSON or XML) to grab the posts and redisplay them individually. To get an idea of when (and how) to use the API with JSON, you can check out one of my themes at elegantem.tumblr.com using the "sort posts" feature in the sidebar.
