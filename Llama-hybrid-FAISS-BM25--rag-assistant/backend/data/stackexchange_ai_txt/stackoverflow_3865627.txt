You are correct that EPM stands for Enterprise Project Management, and that it is a methodology for managing projects across an entire enterprise. And that Project Server is an application that is designed to support EPM. Microsoft sought to align their branding of their Microsoft Office Project Server solution (an integration of Project Professional (client/desktop), Project Server (one of the first of their business apps built on a SharePoint platform) with EPM by calling Project Server 2007 'Microsoft EPM'. Microsoft is referring to Project Server 2010 more often as PPM - 'Project Portfolio Management'. This reflects the fact that Project Server 2010 now includes Portfolio Server (previously a separate, but integratable app), Excel Services, and other integrated services which provide a full set of integrated Business Intelligence features. 2010 enables organizations to apply more portfolio selection and management strategy to their enterprise project management capabilities. In order to get the full value from EPM, you need a system that can support your methodology. In order to get the full value out of Project Server, you need to develop and implement a consistent EPM methodology. They have to work together. [removed self-promotion]
