Any scalable OLAP database (web app scale)?

I have an application that requires analytics for different level of aggregation, and that's the OLAP workload. I want to update my database pretty frequently as well. e.g., here is what my update looks like (schema looks like: time, dest, source ip, browser -> visits) (15:00-1-2-2010, www.stackoverflow.com, 128.19.1.1, safari) --> 105 (15:00-1-2-2010, www.stackoverflow.com, 128.19.2.1, firefox) --> 110 ... (15:00-1-5-2010, www.cnn.com, 128.19.5.1, firefox) --> 110 And then I want to ask what is the total visit to www.stackoverflow.com from a firefox browser last month. I understand Vertica system can do this in a relatively cheap way (performance and scalability wise, but not cost-wise probably). I have two questions here. 1) Is there an open-source product that I can build upon to solve this problem? In particular, how well does a Mondrian system work? (scalability, and performance) 2) Is there an HBase or Hypertable base solution (obviously, a naked HBase/Hypertable can't do this) for this? -- but if there is a project based on HBase/Hypertable, scalability probably won't be an issue IMO)? Thanks!
