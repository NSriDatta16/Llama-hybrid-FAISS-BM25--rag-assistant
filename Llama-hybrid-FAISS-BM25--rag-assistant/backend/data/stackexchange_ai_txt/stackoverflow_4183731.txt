How do you add a resource to a .bundle/wrapper.plug-in?

Sorry for the n00b question, but I have no more hair to pull. =( I'm building my iOS project using XCode and have a reference to another XCode project, to make this work I also need to reference the bundle-file. The developer who built the project and bundle wanted to organize things and thus put all the images inside of this .bundle-file. Now my question is this: How do you add a file/resource to a .bundle file? -> http://grab.by/7p3Y The file type of the bundle is: wrapper.plug-in -> http://grab.by/7p3W The files I add by right-clicking and selecting add existing files all end up in the project not in the bundle resource. Any kind of help will be most appreciated! Also an indication if this is common or a custom solution? Best regards Abeansits Update: As usual the problem was me, I'm blaming this on low sugar levels. =( All you need to do is add a file to the bundle manually and it will show up in XCode.
