What's best for drawing a calendar - SVG or canvas?

It will be a large calendar, like iCal. I started a working prototype in plain old HTML using tables (for the calendar days etc) and divs (for the entries in the calendar), but am thinking canvas or SVG might be a better fit. The entries in a calendar are going to be interactive - drag and drop, edit etc. so which would be best for this application?
