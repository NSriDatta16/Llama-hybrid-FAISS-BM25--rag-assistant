Subquery returns more than 1 row / Exponential Moving average

CREATE DEFINER = `ninja_dba`@`` PROCEDURE `adb`.`MACD12`( x int) LANGUAGE SQL DETERMINISTIC READS SQL DATA SQL SECURITY DEFINER COMMENT '' BEGIN MACD_12:BEGIN DECLARE z FLOAT; DECLARE y FLOAT default 56.41; DECLARE w float; WHILE x I'm trying to construct a Exponential moving Average. Part of the problem is setting the first row, hence I declare the first row (56.41) as the procedure begins. I believe the procedure will work, however when I try to call the procedure, I get the infamous error "Subquery returns more than 1 row" error 1242. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.
