For the most part, yes. That's the point of POSIX. Each platform you plan to port to (including down to the OS, kernel number, and architecture) may have some differences that you'll need to be aware of. This is your homework :) Also, as a piece of advice, frameworks like Qt and library packages like Boost make a lot of this work more elegant. If you can integrate them, I highly recommend it.
