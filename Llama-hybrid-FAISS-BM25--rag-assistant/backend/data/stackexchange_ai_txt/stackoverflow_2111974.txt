How to I inject only certain parts of PHP page using PHP

I know I can include other files using PHP Now my question is how do I inject only certain parts of "file.php"? Lets say I have some header code and some footer code within file.php. How do I organize file.php with the correct separated section, and how do only include certain sections of the file.php ( file.php?footer or something like that?)
