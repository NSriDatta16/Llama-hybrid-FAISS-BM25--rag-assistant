Assuming NTFS, there is a limit of 4 billion files per volume (2^32 - 1). That's the total limit for all the folders on the volume (including operating system files etc.) Large numbers of files in a single folder should not be a problem; NTFS uses a B+ tree for fast retrieval. Microsoft recommends that you disable short-file name generation (the feature that allows you to retrieve mypictureofyou.html as mypic~1.htm). I don't know if there's any performance advantage to segmenting them into multiple directories; my guess is that there would not be an advantage, because NTFS was designed for performance with large directories. If you do decide to segment them into multiple directories, use a hash function on the file name to get the directory name (rather than the directory name being the first letter of the file name for instance) so that each subdirectory has roughly the same number of files.
