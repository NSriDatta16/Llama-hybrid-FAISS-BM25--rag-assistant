I don't know much about working with documents, but an interesting approach to documents was taken by Hinton & Salakhutdinov and can be found in this paper (and also in this Google Tech Talk ). They used autoencoders to compress documents into low-dimensional, real-valued vectors. The documents appeared to be fairly well clustered in this transformed space, so that I could imagine that even the euclidean metric could give some decent results. Better results can probably be achieved by binarizing the document representations (as described in the talk) and using the Hamming distance .
