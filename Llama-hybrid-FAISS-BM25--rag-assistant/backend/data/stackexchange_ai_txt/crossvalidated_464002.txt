Comparing changes in a response variable over multiple proportions at different sites

Say you have a variable, like average house cost. You have values of this variable at multiple sites in a city, and want to see how it fluctuates with respect to surrounding business type proportions (multiple classes). For example, at one site, the average home cost is 10 and the surrounding proportions of business types is 30% restaurants, 60% government, and 10% agriculture. What is/are the/any recommended ways to analyze how the housing cost changes with respect to different proportions (over sites)? I am looking for statistical procedures, and have so far come across Redundancy Analysis. However, I'm having trouble figuring out if this is exactly what I'm looking for or if it is optimal. I've also looked into canonical analysis and am having the same confusion. Further, I have different proportions over different spatial scales. For example, around each site I have drawn a circle and calculated the business proportions within the circle. Then I can make the circle a little bigger, and follow the same approach. Finally, I also have data over many years, thus am hoping to add a temporal analysis aspect to this work. Obviously I need to start with a single year and circle (proportion) to keep things simple first, but am looking for guidance in sifting through these layers in the most efficient/ methodological way.
