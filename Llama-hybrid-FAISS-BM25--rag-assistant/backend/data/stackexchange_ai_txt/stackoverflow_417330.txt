You may want to take a look at Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. It offers up a lot of useful practices for ensuring your code is readable. Additionally, if your code is supported by a number of unit tests that thoroughly test your code, it offers a way for your user to understand the code by looking at what the tests are doing. You will also find that if you follow the Test Driven Development process, and you write tests for each bit of functionality, your functions tend to be small, do one thing only and do it well, and tend to flow more like a story than simply a large complex web of "stuff". Tests tend to stay up-to-date more than comments. I often ignore comments anymore due to simple fact that they become obsolete very quickly.
