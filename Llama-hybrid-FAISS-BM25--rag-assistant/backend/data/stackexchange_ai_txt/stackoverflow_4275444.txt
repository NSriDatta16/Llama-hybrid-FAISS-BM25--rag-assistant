Can I count occurrence in 1 loop in this Scala fragment?

I have a simple piece of Scala code. I loop sequentially through a List of Strings, and I want to count the occurrence of each String which I collect as tuples (String, Int) in the list r. The part in the main function should remain (so no groupBy or something). My question is about the update function: right now I do a find first, and then add a new tuple to r if it doesn't exist. If it does exist, I loop through r and update the counter for the matching String. Can the update function be modified so that it is more efficient? Can r be updated in a single iteration (adding if it doesn't exist, updating the counter if it does exist)? Thanks var r = List[(String, Int)]() // (string, count) def update(s: String, l: List[(String, Int)]) : List[(String, Int)] = { if (r.find(a => a._1 == s) == None) { (s, 1) :: r // add a new item if it does not exist } else { for (b
