understanding how shapes are combined in a CNN

I've heard CNN's explained a few times as looking for simpler shapes like edges, and then gradually combining them into larger / more complex shapes at deeper levels. However, I'm having a tough time seeing how that could take place. Say the first layer has 6 filters, detecting various sorts of edges. They output 6 of their own images, basically showing where those edges were detected. The next layer has 8 filters which presumably could combine the output of the first layers into more complex shapes. HOWEVER, the problem I see is that to combine edges, what you really want is to see that edge 1 is connected to edge 2 is connected to edge 3, forming a triangle or something like that. But the filters in layer 2 could never do that, because they are still looking at the same location of each image simultaneously. They could only detect edges in the different images that are "on top" of each other. See what I mean? How does this work? Also, maybe related but maybe not: Is there an intuition for why we want smaller images but more filters as we go deeper in the network? What purpose does that serve?
