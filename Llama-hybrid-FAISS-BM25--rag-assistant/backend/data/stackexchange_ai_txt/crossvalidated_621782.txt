Is distance from the median instead of from the mean in standard deviation calculation meaningful in case of data with outliers?

I'm borrowing from the idea of Mean of absolute deviation around the median ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_absolute_deviation#Mean_absolute_deviation_around_the_median ). Would calculating standard deviation from the median instead of the mean be a good variance measure in the situation where the data has fairly significant outliers?
