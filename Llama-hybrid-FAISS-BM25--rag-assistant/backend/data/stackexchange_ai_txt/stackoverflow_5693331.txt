I am sorry but I have to remake the question later on in the future, I noticed that without a more straightforward example, and without having time to dedicate to my website (I found myself fairly busy on various projects all week long and even after normal working hours), I do not want to keep my question open just for the sake of keeping open without trying and testing your solutions suggested. I am sorry for the losing time that I have made you spent on this question. I'll try to be better organised in the future. Thank you very much for your time. I tried to closed it, but couse of the bounty I cannot close it :(
