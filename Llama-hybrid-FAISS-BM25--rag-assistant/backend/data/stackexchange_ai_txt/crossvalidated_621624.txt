Well, our intuition would lead us to believe this is a tragic loss of information. Simulations and designs would corroborate this belief. If you lose the link IDs to join correlated records of data in a design such as this one, it is not possible to conduct, for instance, the oft recommended ANCOVA design for a difference in difference analysis in a design like this. But it behooves us to ask: what happens if we run an independent data analysis? In other words, the hypothesis that you are trying to test is this: $$ \mathcal{H}_0: \mu_{2,2}-\mu_{2,1} = \mu_{1,2} - \mu_{1,1}$$ Where $\mu_{i,j}$ represents data from the $i$ -th group measured at time $j$ . Whereas a correlated data analysis would have given us a more precise estimate of $\mu_{i,2}-\mu_{i,1}$ , you can still calculate these quantities separately, such as in a regression, and calculate the difference in difference for a significance test without accounting for data correlation. One can show this leads to a slightly less efficient analysis, but the test is still powered to detect the effect. The worst case scenario is that the test does not produce a significant finding, because you can't be assured that the nominal alpha level has truly been achieved as you are not accounting for dependence between observations.
