Is logistic regression a specific case of a neural network?

I ended up in a debate regarding logistic regression and neural networks (NNs). Is it wrong to say that logistic regression is a specific case of a neural network? I have seen a lot of explanation in which logistic regression is shown as a NN, like the following: From Tess Fernandez . Or like this: To me there are no differences, at least on the surface. There is a linear combination of the input, a fixed nonlinear function (sigmoid) and a classification based on the output probabilities, which is exactly a simple neural network with a single layer with a single node (at least in binary problem) and that use the sigmoid function as a nonlinear activation function. But someone told me that it is not exactly so, because the assumptions behind this model are completely different from a neural network. What are these assumptions? And why should logistic regression be considered different from a neural network? I know that NN can handle more complex problems (like nonlinearly separable problems), but this puzzle me a bit.
