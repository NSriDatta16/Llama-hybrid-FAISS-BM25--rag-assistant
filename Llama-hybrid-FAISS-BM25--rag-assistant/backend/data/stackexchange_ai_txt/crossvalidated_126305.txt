PCA Feature Selection

Actually, i have 540x46 matrix, (540 observations and 46 features) and after using PCA by considering 95% variance, it is reduced to 540x12 matrix. So, is it possible to know which 12 features from 46 are they? and order of these 12 features according to dominance level? I hope now question is clear and please let me know if you need any other information.
