element /PM_CT/lost+found -none The "elegant" way consists of: adding a selection rule (here " -none ") loading all PM_CT without aking any question ( load /PM_CT ), if your view is a snapshot one Note: in a config spec, always use "/": it is easier, and Windows as well as Unix ClearCase views will be able to interpret it. Caveats: the previous solution is for one vob, I do not think you could use "wildcard" for multiple vobs the ' -none ' option can cause a snapshot view to fail during a deliver or rebase (UCM merge): for that kind of operation, a dynamic view would be more suited. That is for CC 2003.06 and early 7.0. I think it works better with the latest CC7.1.0.2 Note: that selection rule can also be used for dynamic views, in order to mask some directory you would not want to see.
