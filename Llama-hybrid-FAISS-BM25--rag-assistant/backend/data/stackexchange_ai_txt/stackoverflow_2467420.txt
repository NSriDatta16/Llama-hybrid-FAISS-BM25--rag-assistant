Jehof, First of all, use TwoWay binding on the Text property of your derived my:NumberTextBox. If that doesn't solve the problem, continue on... Does the my:NumberTextBox class actually derive from TextBox? If so, there shouldn't be anything else you need to do. If you are building your own control, and implmenting the Text property in your my:NumberTextBox class, try making it a DependencyProperty to allow TwoWay binding. As an example: // The Text dependency property #region The Text dependency property public static readonly DependencyProperty TextProperty = DependencyProperty.Register("Text", typeof(string), typeof(NumberTextBox), null); public string Text { get { return (string)GetValue(TextProperty); } set { SetValue(TextProperty, value); } } #endregion Good luck, Jim McCurdy Face To Face Software and YinYangMoney
