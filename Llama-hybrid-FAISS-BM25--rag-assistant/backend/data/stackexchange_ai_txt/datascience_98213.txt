How to increase the accuracy of an imbalanced dataset (not precision)?

There's an imbalanced dataset in a Kaggle competition I'm trying. The target variable of the dataset is binary and it is biased towards 0. 0 - 70% 1 - 30% I tried several machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees etc. But all of them give an accuracy around 70%. It seems that the models always tend to predict 0. So I tried several methods to get an unbiased dataset like the following. Up sampling the dataset using SMOTE and other techniques. Under sampling the dataset Changing the weight of the model. But all of these steps reduced the accuracy instead of increasing. Area under the curve and precision was improved but unfortunately I have to increase the accuracy somehow to win the competition. So I would really appreciate it if you could tell me about the techniques to improve the accuracy in an imbalanced dataset.
