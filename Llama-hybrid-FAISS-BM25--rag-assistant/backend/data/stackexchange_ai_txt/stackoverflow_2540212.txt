ExtJS ToolBar radio group change menu item manually

How to manually change selected radio item in "Radio Options" menu? http://www.extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/menu/menus.js Don't pay attention on id absent (for menu), I just want to know which method should be use. I tried setActiveItem but it didn't work. Thanks
