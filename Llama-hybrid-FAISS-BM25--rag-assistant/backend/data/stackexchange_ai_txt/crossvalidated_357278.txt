How do you link multiple X input images to a single ground truth image in machine learning?

What I'm asking is basically manual data augmentation. I have some very specific data augmentation for my inputs so I have to create them first in another software instead of doing it on the fly. I have some basic idea on how to pair up my Xs and Ys. I would probably create an extra CSV file and pair X1_1, X1_2, X1_3, to Y1 and I will repeat this for Xn_1, Xn_2, Xn_3, Yn. During training, I would read and load the correct pair. So far I have only experimented with 1 to 1 ground truth pairs or did automatic 10 crop so I am not exactly sure if this is the best practice. Can someone critique this method? Another thing I want to point out is Xn_1, 2 and 3 will be further augmented during the actual training process.
