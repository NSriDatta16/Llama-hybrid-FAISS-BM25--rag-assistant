What happens if a dummy variable is 0 or 1 in the training set, but always 1 in the test set

I have regression models (linear, lasso and Random forest), and there is a feature that is 0 or 1 in the training set (same number of occurrences approximately) and has a small effect on the target outcome variable (when is 1, the value of the target variable is slightly less). However, in the test set, this feature always has a value of 1. Since I've added that feature, my models perform way less good. I am wondering what is happening ? Thank you
