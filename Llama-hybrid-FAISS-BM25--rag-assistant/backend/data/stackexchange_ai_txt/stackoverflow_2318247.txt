Well if you want to return HTML tag soup not conforming to XML rules then you can only return a string and then use e.g. . If you want to build a node-set of nodes or a result tree fragment then check the documentation , it shows the mapping between the XSLT types and the .NET framework types e.g. if you want your function to return an result that XSLT sees as a node-set then use the type XPathNodeIterator as the .NET return type of your extension function.
