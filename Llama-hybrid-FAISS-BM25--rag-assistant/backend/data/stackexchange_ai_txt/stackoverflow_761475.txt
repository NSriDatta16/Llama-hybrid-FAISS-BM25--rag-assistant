How to append to a word document with VBA Macros

I am writing a macro in MS word. I need the macro to parse through a list of filenames, page numbersm and notes and filter out only the file names and page numbers. Each paragraph (line) in the document refers to a different file, so I am looping through For/Next statement. For each new line, I'm pulling out the filename, and pagenumbers and placing it into a string. Along with this, I am also adds some notes into the string for each file name. Before going to the next line in the document, I want to output the string that I've built into a word document. I currently have the word document open with this code: Dim oWord as Object Set oWord = CreateObject("Word.Application") oWord.Documents.Open "C:\document.doc" oWord.visible = true This lets me successfully open the document but I need some help with figuring out how to output to this document. Conceptually, I know I need to first make it the active document, then go to the end of the document, then append to it. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
