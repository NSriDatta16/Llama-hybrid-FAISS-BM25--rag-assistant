What kind of machine learning algorithm can I use?

I have a data set of tweets regarding vaccines. They have been collected from an API because they have keywords like "flu, measles, MMR, vaccine" etc. I need to find tweets specifically about measles and the outbreak that occurred in California this past February. It isn't enough to search the data set for words like "California" and "Measles" because tweets like "MMR vaccination rates in Palo Alto on the rise" are about measles and California, but wont be captured by a naive search. Are there any unsupervised algorithms that could help me out?
