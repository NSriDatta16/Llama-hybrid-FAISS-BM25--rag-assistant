Right. Since each process has it's own copy of the environment variables, you can't magically change them all at once. If you bend your mind enough though, there are strange workarounds. For instance, if you currently have a command you run to update each one, you can automate running that command. Check the bash man page for PROMPT_COMMAND, which can run a command each time the bash prompt is printed. Most shells have something similar. As far as not putting a hashed password on disk because you are pulling it from an envvar instead of something like ssh-agent...that would be a whole 'nother topic.
