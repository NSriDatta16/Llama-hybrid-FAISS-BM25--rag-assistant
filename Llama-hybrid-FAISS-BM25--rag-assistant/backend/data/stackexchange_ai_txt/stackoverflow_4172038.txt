I have most commonly seen this implemented with acts-as-taggable. StackExchange supports using tags to organize questions. The tags can be user modifiable or not and let you organize data fairly easily. Then interactions in areas that are tagged as X mean that other areas tagged X are of interest. Like and unlike could be given more weight in tagged areas. Then you could develop relevance scores. Think simple- any post in tagged X is +1 relevance to that tag any like in a tagged area X is +5 relevance to that tag Think advanced- if likes posts from user y find relevance scores for user y. divide scores by 2 and add to core relevance scores store this as secondary relevance one or both can be reasonably implemented and stored separately to determine user preference from a test group.
