How to do data imputation and normalization when using polynomial regression?

The question is about the practical use of polynomial regression. Let's say there is a dataset with columns A, B, T where T is a dependent variable, A and B are independent variables. A and B contain missing values. I want to fill in the gaps with the mean, then normalize values by the formula: (x - u) / s , where u is the mean and s is the standard deviation. Everything is clear when I use linear regression. What about polynomial? A^2, B^2 and AB columns are added for a quadratic polynomial case. How to fill AB, if the values ​​of A and B are missing? By the product of averages? When calculating AB, should I multiply the normalized values ​​or should I normalize the result after?
