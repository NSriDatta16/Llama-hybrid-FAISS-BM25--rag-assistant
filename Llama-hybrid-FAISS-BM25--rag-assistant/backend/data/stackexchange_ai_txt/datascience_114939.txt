This is very meta. I am certain there is a field that researches this but I don't know it off the top of my head. Try perhaps synthetic data or maybe unlabeled learning. The problem I forsee here is that. create "fraud" with certain traits, attributes, etc that you have already described. "Should I check if repeating userAgents are clicking on the same videoURL every X..." Train model to detect fraud. Model simply learns the rule you created in model 1. Well, why bother with the model if it will learn what you already proposed. I could see some really deep, black boxy algorithm learning something deeper or more intuitive then the rules provided, especially if you provide many rules. But this looks to be a garbage in, garbage out situation. You really don't have any data to do data science with, at least in my na√Øve understanding.
