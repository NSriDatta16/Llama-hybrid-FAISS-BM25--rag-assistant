Ending URLs in .php is fine technically, but I think these days many people are trying to make the urls independent of the actual code/file structure. I actually think that's a good thing from a software engineering perspective as well. URLs are conceptually different (read: not related at all) to the file/directory structure used to organize the system powering the website. The "resource" that a URL "locates" is not the .php or .asp file that contains the code to display it. Look at stackoverflow for example, the URL of this question is /questions/322944/uql-etiquette , there's nothing in it that can be used to "guess" the underlying framework/system. The resource in this case is the question and all the answers to it, as well as the comments, votes, edits, and various other stuff.
