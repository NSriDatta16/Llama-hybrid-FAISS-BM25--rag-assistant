This is something I have given some thought to as well. I've generalised my view of it to this. Save as early as you can. What this means is, short of any other imperatives, which motivate you to defer your save, do your save at the earliest available opportunity. You might save directly to your main store, or you might save to transient state specifically for handling tombstoning. You might save in the background while the page is open. You might save when the user requests to navigate between pages. In situations where something unexpected can occur, such as loss of power, an exception requiring the users attention (noting no time for this if being deactivated), saving early offers a bit more dependendability to the user. Imperatives that might motivate you to defer saving, could include Depending on your architecture, it may be inconvenient to implement saving data at a page level. Depending on the volume of data to be saved, and the architecture of your isolated storage model, it may detract from performance substantially trying to save at a page or field level.
