Yes, as @DCS said, You should have a model. However, you must be trying to say that you don't know which model to use... This the problem that everyone faces when they are trying to estimate any model. Unless you have some theory to justify your choice, the best way is to start with the simple models. If you have a time series model, I mean you intend to explain the actual value of y using old values, my suggestion is that you start using the models in this order: 1) AR model 2) ARMA model and then you can try more complicated models such as nar or narma. There are some ways to compare models such as akaike http://www.mathworks.com/help/ident/ref/aic.html It seems that you are not very acquainted with econometrics. If this is case I suggest you the book of Walter Enders... It is a very simple introduction to the theme.
