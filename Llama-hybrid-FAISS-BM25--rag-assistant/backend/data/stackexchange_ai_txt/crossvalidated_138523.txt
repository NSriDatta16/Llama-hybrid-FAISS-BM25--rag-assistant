Yes, the others are right that logistic regression is the area you want to look into. You're basically going to have two options. If you have more than two outcome categories, Ordinal or 'regular old' Multinomial response will be what you want. If your data are in some meaningful order, Ordinal could yield some benefits, but the assumptions needed for that model are rather strict. Be sure to test both approaches. Another thing you should consider is what I call 'disaggregated' multinomial. If you have N categories on your response variable, then the multinomial model is N-1 logistic regression equations nested within a single model, where all the right had side variables are the same across equations. If you're up for it, you can customize these equations, so that the equation for response type 1 is different from the equation for response type 2,3...N . The wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression#As_a_set_of_independent_binary_regressions on multinomial logistic regression gives a good explanation on how to set this up. This disaggregated approach can be especially useful if accurate prediction is more important than estimating the effect of a specific variable.
