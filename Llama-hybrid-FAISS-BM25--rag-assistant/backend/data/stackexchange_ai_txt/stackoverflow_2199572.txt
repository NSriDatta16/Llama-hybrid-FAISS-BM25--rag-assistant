Problem copy+pasting CR+LF into an excel spreadsheet need soft paragraph (Alt+Enter)

I'm trying to copy a table that is created in our software into an excel spreadsheet. Some of the title headers in our application are too big to fit in a column so they are separated by a #13+#10 (CR+LF) so they sit on the next line. e.g. Strain SpikeConc Spike ng/g dpm/g ------------------------- Blah 20.0 50.1 Blah2 22.1 60.2 However, when this is copied into excel we get a strange thing happening. The CR+LF is interpreted as (you guessed it) a new line request. Hence we get something that looks totally wrong. e.g. Strain SpikeConc ng/g Spike dmp/g ------------------------- Blah 20.0 50.1 Blah 22.1 60.2 It is interpreting the CR+LF after the SpikeConc incorrectly and creating a new line in a new cell instead of creating a soft paragraph like you would get if you pressed Alt+Enter and giving you a new line in the same cell. Anyone got any ideas how to encode a soft paragraph rather than a new line? I've tried using just CR (#13) on it's own and just LF (#10) on it's own but they both have the same behaviour. I believe there are some unicode characters LS: Line Separator, U+2028 PS: Paragraph Separator, U+2029 but I can't seem to find how to encode them into the table in my App. PS We're using Delphi6 (don't ask)
