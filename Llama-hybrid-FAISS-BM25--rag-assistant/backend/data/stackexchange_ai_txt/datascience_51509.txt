Naming the Axes of my Graph on iPython Using Matplotlib.pyplot

I am new to data science. I use Anaconda on windows 7. I plotted a sine curve by doing the following on iPython: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000) y = np.sin(x) plt.plot(x, y) And I got this: But when I got ready to name the axes, the curve disappeared. I wrote this code: plt.xlabel("Time") And I got this: I also wrote this: plt.ylabel("Speed") And got this: So my question is, how can I plot a curve with labelled axes? (In other words, I will like the x-axis to be Time , the y-axis to be Speed and the curve intact)
