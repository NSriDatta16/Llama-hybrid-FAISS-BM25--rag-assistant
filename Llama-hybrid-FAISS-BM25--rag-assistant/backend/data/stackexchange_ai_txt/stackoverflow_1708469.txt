I gave the code a quick performance test, using Snippet Compiler . The code I used is as follows: public static void Main() { DateTime datStart = DateTime.UtcNow; const int timesToLoop = 1000000; for (int i=0; i Note, WL and RL are simply helper methods to read and write to the console. To test the non-constant version, I simply removed the const keyword. The results were surprising: Time Taken (average of 3 runs) Using const keyword 26.340s Without const keyword 28.276s I'm aware that this is very rough'n'ready test, but the use of the const keyword appears to count as a valid micro-optimization .
