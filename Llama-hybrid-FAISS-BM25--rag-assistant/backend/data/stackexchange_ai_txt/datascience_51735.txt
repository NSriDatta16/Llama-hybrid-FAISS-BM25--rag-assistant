How to change the neural network model to improve the accuracy of mAP without learning from 0, but retraining already trained model

how you can change the Faster R-CNN Resnet 101 or Faster R-CNN Inception Resnet V2 model to improve the accuracy of mAP detection without learning the model with 0, but retraining already trained model Accuracy mAP needs to be improved though by a small amount. maybe there are some approaches, even the name of these approaches
