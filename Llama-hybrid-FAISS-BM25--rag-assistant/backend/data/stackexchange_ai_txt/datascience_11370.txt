First, I would ask the company if there is more information about the customer. You mentioned you have 10 original columns, which might not be enough to make a good prediction. Same goes for number of rows. Usually, more data, better the model, up to a certain limit. Second, encode categorical features (demographical data in your case) is good thing to do. The increased number of columns dont have to bother you in your case. For the task itself, yes, it is doable. Start easy, simply check importance of each feature (I would let PCA for later), pick few models and test them. Also consider train simple decision tree. Your results can be easily visualized in way the business people understand. As oposed to black-box methods as K-Means.
