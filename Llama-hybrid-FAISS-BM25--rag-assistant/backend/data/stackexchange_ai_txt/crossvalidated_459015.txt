Machine Learning models and "rare-event" independent variables

I have a data set which tries to predict a continuous variable, say house prices $Y$ . My independent variables consits of things such as, square meters, number of bedrooms, bathrooms etc. However, I also have a rare event variable such as "Has a famous person previously lived in the house" (I cannot think of any other examples), the point is that the variable has a very low number of occurrences and appears on only a few houses and is a categorical variable "yes" / "no". Assuming the rare event variable has a positive impact on the prediction of house prices, i.e. houses which previously belonged to a famous person is X% higher than other houses in the area. How does XGBoost, randomForest, LightGBM etc. manage such rare events in the independent variables? I have read a lot about the predictions of rare events in the dependent variables such as fraud detection etc. but I cannot find any papers or material which discuss how to measure the impact of rare-event variables. Are there any papers which study the effects that rare-event variables have on the model? Data: price mtrs_sqrd, bedrooms, bathrooms, famous_person 100,000 100 5 2 0 123,000 80 6 3 0 80,000 90 3 1 0 150,000 120 6 3 0 110,000 80 2 2 0 170,000 130 5 2 0 # house is the same as below 200,000 130 5 2 1 # but famous person lived here and has a higher price, thus the marginal contribution of this variable when it is a "1" is higher than when it is a "0". 117,000 110 4 3 0 135,000 115 4 2 0 127,000 120 4 3 0 90,000 100 3 1 0 I am looking for any resourses which focus on these type of rare-event variables.
