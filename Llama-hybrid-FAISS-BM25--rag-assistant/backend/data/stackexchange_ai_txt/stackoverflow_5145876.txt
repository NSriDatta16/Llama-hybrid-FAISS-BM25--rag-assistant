Maybe you'll find this book useful: Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2005: The Storage Engine. Read chapters "logging and recovery" and "locking and concurrency". A lot of information from this book is applied to many of today's database systems. It's really good book. I suggest you to read about concurrency control. You can start from Concurrency_control wiki especially as of section |Database transaction and the ACID rules" If you wanna compare locks, first I would read about problems occuring in transactions and about transaction isolation levels.
