The fact that you're using a database engine to do the storing doesn't change the fact that what you have here is fundamentally a container class. In short, you should almost certainly be using a class template that's instantiated over the type of object being stored. The variation in storage engines could be handled either via inheritance or by a second template argument. Using a template argument gives compile-time polymorphism, while inheritance gives run-time polymorphism (i.e., you can change storage engines at run-time). You might want to look at DTL for some inspiration (or you might save yourself a lot of trouble, and just use it until or unless you run into a problem with it).
