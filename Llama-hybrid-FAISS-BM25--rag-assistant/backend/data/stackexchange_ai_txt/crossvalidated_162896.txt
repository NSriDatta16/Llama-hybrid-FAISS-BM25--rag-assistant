Having only information on range of your data makes it hard to make conclusions about mean, but it is still possible. As a matter of fact, it is even possible to make some educated guesses about population mean given a single data point . In this kind of cases, you have to make some assumptions about distribution of your data. Let's say that you could assume that your data comes from Normal distribution, with unknown parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$. Using Bayesian approach you could choose some prior distribution for those parameters, take samples from those distributions, assess the likelihood of your data given those parameters, and so, infer about the parameters. In this case, you could use Approximate Bayesian Computation . For example, you could look for such parameters of Normal distribution that make 95% of values fit the interval of your interest. Looking for exact match seems to be overtly strict in here, so let's assume some margin of error, say $\pm$2%. Below I post an R code that illustrates the case. x Using this approach you could also try fitting different distributions (e.g. non-symmetric ones) or make different prior assumptions. As you can see, using symmetric distribution such as Normal, leads to pretty the same result as with taking an arithmetic mean of the points, but it will not be the case with non-symmetric distributions as Till Hoffmann already noted in his answer. This is basically similar way of thinking as in dsaxton 's answer, but using only the two data points for the interval and with using a simulation.
