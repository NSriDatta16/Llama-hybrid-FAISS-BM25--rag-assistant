Animation and 2-way binding

I'm playing with WPF animation and faced a weird problem. I have a Slider and a TextBox . TextBox is bound to Slider.Value using 2-way binding: Test When I drag slider, text in textbox changes. When I change text in textbox, value of slider is updated, it works correctly. Now I add an animation, which animates Slider.Value property to 0. I start it on button press. private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { Storyboard storyboard = new Storyboard(); var animation = new DoubleAnimation(); animation.Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.5)); animation.To = 0; Storyboard.SetTarget(animation, MySlider); Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(animation, new PropertyPath(Slider.ValueProperty)); storyboard.Children.Add(animation); storyboard.Begin(); } When I press button, animation scrolls Slider to 0. TextBox is also changes to 0 synchronously with slider. And now I face the problem. After animation I cannot change text in the TextBox. I change text, move focus, and the text with slider value resets to 0. I still can move the Slider, and the TextBox updates with the Slider value. But I can't set the Slider value using the TextBox. I think when animation stops, the value somehow freezes on a value, specified in the animation.To property, but I can't figure how to unfreeze it. Or maybe it is something else?
