First, your results show the distinction between statistical and practical significance. As comments indicate, with a large study like this it's quite possible for almost everything to be "statistically significant." The ratio of a difference to its standard error is used to evaluate statistical significance. A standard error tends to decrease with the square root of the number of observations, so even a small absolute difference can be "statistically significant" in a large study. The question is whether a differences is large enough to matter in practice. Cohen's d tries to get to that issue by evaluating the ratio of the difference to its standard deviation . That doesn't necessarily indicate how much a difference in outcome will mean to any individual, however. I'd suggest that you pay attention to the actual estimated difference values and use your knowledge of the subject matter and the literature to evaluate how important an individual would think that differences of those absolute sizes in her own outcomes are. What you seem to want for comparing various classes are the estimated marginal means, sometimes called LS-means. Those are model-based estimates that use all the information from the data and model, and thus are superior to stratification into subsets. Such analysis is available in SAS . With respect to the best way to evaluate repeated measures with continuous outcomes, there are several approaches beyond GEE and repeated-measures ANOVA. Chapter 7 of Frank Harrell's course notes has an interesting summary table of those 2 methods plus 5 more, illustrating their strengths and weaknesses. The expected "effect size" is not a major reason for choosing among them.
