See http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/f9sxu . The problem is Oracle, again. I cannot deploy on SGES 2.1.1 with the connection to the internet. When I turned it off, deploy was slow, but successful. It seems the validator tries to refresh cached schemas and to download them from the schemaLocation URLs. http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd GET /xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd ... HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently to Location: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/xml/index.html But there is no such schema! I will try to find some good solution, but the best is maybe to punch up someone in Oracle ... EDIT: It is fixed at this time (27.1.2010, 20:00 CET), Oracle returns the schema - you can check it with wget. Browsers are redirected to docs. Nice :-)
