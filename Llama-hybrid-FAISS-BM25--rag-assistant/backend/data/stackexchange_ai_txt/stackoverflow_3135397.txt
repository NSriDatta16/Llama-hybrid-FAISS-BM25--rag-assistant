Convert List to delimited string list

Possible Duplicate: most elegant way to return a string from List I'm not sure the easiest way to do this. I simply want to add a ; between each value and spit it out as one string. I don't see that you can do this with ToString(). I'd have to loop through and create a stringbuilder and append & add a ";".
