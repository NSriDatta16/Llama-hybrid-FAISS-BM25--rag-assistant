Where a variable lands in memory has to do with what sort of storage its in (i.e., stack vs static data), and how your executable has mapped those segments into memory. Try statically allocating an array of 25 million integers, and take the address of the last one .. bet you see a number maybe up nearer 100,000,000. (Don't get too carried away in this vein though, unless you want to see what happens when your system runs out of ram =) You can do printf("0x%08x", &whatever) .. to get the full 8 hex digits with zero padding filled in on the left. The '0x' part isn't strictly necessary, but it helps avoid confusion if/when, three weeks later, you run the program again and the hex number you happen to be looking at doesn't have an A-F characters in it.
