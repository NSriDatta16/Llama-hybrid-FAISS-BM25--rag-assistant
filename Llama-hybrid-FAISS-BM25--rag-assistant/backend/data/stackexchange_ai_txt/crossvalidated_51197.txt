Is the issue something like this: "I want to use a model before the big uptick, and then forecast forward through the uptick -- to see whether the uptick would be predictable from what came before, or was unusual (for some probability level of "unusual")." If that is the case, I would follow the lead of Makridakis and Hibron (International Journal of Forecasting, 2000, page 459, in the M3 forecasting competition) and run single exponential smoothing, Holt and dampen -- plus their average. Each of these has a calculation for likely forecast error. This will tell you how extreme this spike is on the basis of 3 forecasting methods in very common use. If this works, thank a sailor -- all these methods have a strong historical connection with the U.S.Navy.
