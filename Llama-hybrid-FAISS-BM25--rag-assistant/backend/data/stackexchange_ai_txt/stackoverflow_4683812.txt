Android Telnet tutorial

Are there any Telnet client source Samples or Tutorials that help Beginners (ME) understand how to open Sockets and develop apps using sockets. I went through all the samples using Eclipse and various Tutorials online but none of them that I have found seem to work correctly - either old or dead code or just missing information. I assume I will need to include a java.net jar file but where is it and how do I include it? using Eclipse I went through the few tutorials but none of them did much more than Hello World and show me how to drag and drop buttons and edit text. Thanks in advance for any help
