Ideas on machine learning algorithms to paint on a canvas

I am completely new to machine learning. I explain the problem with an example. I have a two dimensional white canvas. The shape of the canvas is an arbitrary closed curve. I have a brush, it is represented as a circle having a radius small enough to reach all corners of the canvas. I have also blue paint. I would like use a machine learning algorithm to create a trajectory of the brush in order to paint all the canvas in blue. I attach a sketch of the problem. Q1) Is there any machine learning algorithm available for such kind of problems? Q2) If an algorithm does not exist, then may you indicate any reference I could study (book, paper, website) to learn how to write such an algorithm, please? Any other suggestion of where to focus my studies for this problem is appreciated. In my problem I have a "painter" acting as a reference motion. I would like my machine learning to mimic the painter.
