I haven't tried this, but it should work. In the collision handler, kick off the animation as part of a sequence and then execute the postStepCallback as the last item in the sequence: CCSequence *finalSeq = [CCSequence actions:[CCAnimate actionWithAnimation:sapusAnim restoreOriginalFrame:NO], [CCCallFunc actionWithTarget:self selector:@selector(removeCpShapeAndBody)], nil]; [sapusSprite1 runAction:finalSeq]; Then you'd create a method called removeCPShapeAndBody which would call cpSpaceAddPostStepCallback. Ideally you'd have all of this in an object that would hold reference to the shape and body (e.g. a subclass of CCSprite) so you don't have to pass those around.
