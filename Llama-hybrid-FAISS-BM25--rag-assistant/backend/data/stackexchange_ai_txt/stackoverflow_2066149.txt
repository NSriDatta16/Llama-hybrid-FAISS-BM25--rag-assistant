In C# problem grouping by value and then summing

I am trying to sum the cost for a series of items grouped by a person's organization. I believe the summation is working correctly but I am not seeing my grouping. The objects stored in rollup just contain the value of the summation. I'd expect them to have the organization in addition to the sum of the cost for that organization. What have I missed in this expression? var rollup = OrgPersonList.GroupBy( person => person.Person.Org).Select(group => group.Sum(price => price.Items.Sum(item => item.Cost)));
