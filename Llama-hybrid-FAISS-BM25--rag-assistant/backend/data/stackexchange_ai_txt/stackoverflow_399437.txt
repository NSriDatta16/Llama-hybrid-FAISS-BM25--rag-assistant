You can replicate tables across different storage engines using MySQL. You could have tables on one server in the memory storage engine replicated to an innodb table somewhere else, or any other combination of storage engines. MySQL's binary log format is compatible with all storage engine types. (Fun fact: This is just about the only use of the blackhole storage engine. It sends all writes to /dev/null but still logs its changes to the binary log, which means it can be replicated to a real table somewhere else asynchronously.)
