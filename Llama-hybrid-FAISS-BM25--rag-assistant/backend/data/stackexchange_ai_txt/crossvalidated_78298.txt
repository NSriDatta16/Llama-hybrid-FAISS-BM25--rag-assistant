There are two rules of thumb that I know of: There should be approximately 30 times more training cases than the number of weights ( Neural Network FAQ ) General generalization rule: there should be 10 times more training cases than the VC dimension of the hypothesis set. In NN case the VC dimension is usually assumed to be around the number of weights, so you should have 10 times more training cases than the weights (this rule is presented for example during this course by Dr. Abu-Mostafa. If you need a reference, then you can probably find it in his book ).
