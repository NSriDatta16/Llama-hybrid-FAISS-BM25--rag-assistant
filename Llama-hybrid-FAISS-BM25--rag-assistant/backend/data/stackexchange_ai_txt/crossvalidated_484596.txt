tests that rely on residuals

This might be an r question, which I think is not allowed here, but I figured I would try in case it is ok. There are a series of tests which as I understand it rely on residuals. One example of this is the Breusch-Pagan test. This generates apparent results from that (and the documentation seems to require a regression model rather than residuals). # load the dataset data(mtcars) # fit a regression model model Is the code extracting the residuals or am I wrong in assuming you need residuals for this test (the comments I read seem pretty clear it is run on the residuals).
