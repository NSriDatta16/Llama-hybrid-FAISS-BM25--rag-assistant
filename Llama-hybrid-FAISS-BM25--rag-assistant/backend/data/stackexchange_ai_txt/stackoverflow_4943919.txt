Galaxy S screen DPI

I am developing and testing an android application on my Galaxy S device, which should be (according to the android dev site) a normal size screen (4 inch) with HDPI (233dpi). For some reason, drawables that I put in drawable-mdpi are shown instead of the ones in drawable-hdpi. It seems the device "thinks" it's a mdpi device for some reason... Any ideas?
