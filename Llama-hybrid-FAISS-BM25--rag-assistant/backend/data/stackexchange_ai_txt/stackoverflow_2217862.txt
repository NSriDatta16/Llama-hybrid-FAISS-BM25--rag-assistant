aspNetCompatibility WCF and WinForm

I would like to use Windows Forms with a WCF service and leverage the pre-built authentication of asp.net by using aspNetCompatibilityEnabled = true in the WCF service. Is there any module or pre-built assemblies that can add ASP.NET functionality to a Windows Forms application? As far as I understand, this functionality isn't built into Windows Forms and can't be leveraged.
