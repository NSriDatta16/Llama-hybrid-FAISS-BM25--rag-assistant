How can I capture and edit network packets on the fly with Perl?

Does someone know about a CPAN module on Win32 that captures network packets and edit them on the fly? As far as I know, the only Perl module on Win32 that deals with packets on the fly is Net::Pcap but it only support passive monitoring and not affet the TCP/IP stack. Is there a such module could someone provide example /reference /documentation ?
