Extracting data from an email message (or several thousand emails) [Exchange based]

My marketing department, bless them, has decided to make a sweepstakes where people enter over a webpage. That is great but the information isn't stored to a DB of any sort but is sent to an exchange mail box as an email. Great. My challenge is to extract the entry (and marketing info) from these emails and store them someplace more useful, say a flat file or CSV. The only saving grace is that the emails have a highly consistant format. I am sure I could spend the time saving all the emails to files and then write an app to munge through them all but was hoping for a much more elegant solution. Can I programmatically access an exchange mailbox, read all the emails and then save that data?
