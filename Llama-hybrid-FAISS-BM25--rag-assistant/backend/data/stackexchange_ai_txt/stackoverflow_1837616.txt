A couple of random thoughts, that may not all be applicable together: Switch on the first character in the string, rather than the string itself, and do a sub-switch for strings which can contain more than one letter? A hashtable would certainly guarantee O(1) retrieval, though it might not be faster for smaller numbers of comparisons. Don't use strings, use enums or something like a flyweight instead. Using strings in this case seems a bit fragile anyway... And if you really need it to be as fast as possible, why aren't you writing it in assembly? :)
