How to improve a NN for signal classification

I am using a RNN with two Bi-LSTM layers to classify signals. The signals are complex valued, so what I am feeding the network are the magnitude, phase and unwrapped phase. These parameters of the signals look like such: Please note that these plots are just for 1 signal. There are 3 plots, or parameters per signal. My current network has two bi-LSTM layers, with 128 and 256 hidden units in them respectively, that looks as follows: I have 10 classes and the classification accuracy is around 15%. How could I improve the RNN so that the classification is better?
