The real performance difference comes when you the columns that you select are all available through an index. In that case MySQL (and several other DBMS) will do an "index only select" which might a lot faster than doing an index-based select from the table itself. Additionally the overhead in sending unneeded data over the wire will of course slow down retrieval as well. And finally is simply good coding practice to only select the data you need.
