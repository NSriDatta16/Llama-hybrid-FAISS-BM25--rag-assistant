Making large text box for ajax search

I am making an AJAX application where the user can input the name of a movie and the results from the database will be loaded through jquery from a PHP API, However I am unsure how to implement a text box that will: (a) Be the focus of attention on the page (i.e. quite large with a glow around it) (b) automatically execute a function that uses jquery to make an ajax request on every time a letter is entered (kind of like google instant) Any suggestions would be very greatly appreciated, thanks, RayQuang
