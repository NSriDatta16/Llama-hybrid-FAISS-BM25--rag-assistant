Is it true that the only configuration file I need to bother with is pom.xml ? Yes, Maven uses a pom.xml file to describe a project's medata and extend Maven's behavior, which also known as the Project Object Model (POM) file. Maven will also look by default for a per user configuration file in ~/.m2/settings.xml but this file is optional. Why doesn't maven use scripts for this kind of job, I don't see xml has any advantage here, which is why I don't like ant What should Maven have used in 2002 if not XML? Makefiles? In my opinion, XML was and still is a very decent choice for a declarative Project Object Model. Yes XML is verbose but it is perfect for the job and allows to benefit from nice things like validation, transformation, code completion which seem important to me. Now, nothing forces you to use Maven if you don't like it and feel free to use Gradle or Gant or Buildr (if the size of their communities is not a concern). Just in case, note that Maven 3 offers polyglot support (see this post and this one ) but as I said, writing a pom in Groovy, YAML, etc doesn't only have advantages (e.g. validation).
