Yes. The input\output of VAE doesn't need to be gaussian. The decoder can take the multivariate gaussian and transform it to other (possibly) non-gaussian distribution. The latent space of VAE is gaussian because of the following properties: It is continuous, which is suitable for generating objects which are continuous by nature, and enables continuous interpolation. It can easily be represented using only 2 parameters and is thus convenient to work with and can be represented easily. The KL divergence between two gaussian (the second loss term in VAE) has analytical solution, and thus can be easily optimized using gradient descent Gaussian is a natural pick for a prior of weights for neural network (it can be proved that it is equivalent to L2 regularization) You can easily sample this distribution and use the reparameterization trick for the optimization. However, gaussian is not the only choice for latent space of VAE (but for sure the most popular).
