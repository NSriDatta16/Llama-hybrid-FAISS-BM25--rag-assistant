Is it necessary to standardise data sets before performing PCA?

My data sets are a combination of numerical and categorical data. The categorical data are inputted in a one-hot encoding manner. I would like to ask if it is necessary to standardise the data sets first here before performing PCA? If so, what would be a good way to standardise the data set?
