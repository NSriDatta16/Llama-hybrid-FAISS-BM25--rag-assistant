Let me try to answer your question. First of all, I wanted to highlight that what you are observing here in terms of distribution of the probability of the model is a common effect especially for boosted models, SVM or even naive bayes. You tend to see a sigmoid distortion of the probabilities more prominent towards the extremes rather than an even distribution. If you look at the logic behind these models, you will see it makes sense in the way that they do the classification. Whether to use the model or not is a decision that ideally should be taken based on the metrics that you are looking for like ROC etc. Unless what you really intend to use are the probability. In that case you should check out something called platt scaling. Check out this link to get more details on it. https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/07/platt-scaling-isotonic-regression-minimize-logloss-error/ I hope I have answered your concern already. This trend is not a function of features but the result of the model you are using.
