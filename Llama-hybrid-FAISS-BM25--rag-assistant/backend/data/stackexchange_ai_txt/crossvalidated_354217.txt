A 7 second periodicity in the human brain would indeed be a discovery. To prove it to yourself, you can make a quick Box-Jenkin's autocorrelation. That is to compute the correlation between $x(t)$ and $x(t+\Delta t)$ (all data series), and plot is against $\Delta t$ (technically $\Delta t$ is called the lag ). If you see a peak at, say 7 second, then there is a seasonality of 7 seconds. This will tell you if the periodicity is 7, or 6.98. To prove it to others, you have two graphs: Plot $y(t) = x(t + \Delta t)$ versus $x(t)$. If you recognize a pattern, then you have a periodicity/seasonality. And maybe you discover more to say about it. Plot $x(t)$ as a function of a cyclic time: $t \mod \Delta t$. You can use a scatter plot or a radar plot if you want to stress the time is cyclic. If the lines aggregates around a line then you have a seasonality. The seasonality can be estimated as the average line, and the standard deviation line enables you to test if the seasonality is significant. Before to make these plots, you may have to group your data series by trend: the optimistic with an increasing rating, the pessimistic with a decreasing rating, the decided with a insignificant trend, the determined with a low variance, the ambivalent with a high variance and low seasonality, the hesitant with a high variance and low seasonality. You will then be challenged by the experimental factors. For example, all the participants may follow the same presentation, and the seasonality in though is simply the mirror of the presentation rhythm.
