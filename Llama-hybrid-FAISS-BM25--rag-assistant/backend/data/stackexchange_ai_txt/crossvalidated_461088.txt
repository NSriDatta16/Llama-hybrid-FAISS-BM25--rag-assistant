Suppose your investigator is interested in something like the Flynn effect and whether people born more recently are on average more intelligent that those born earlier. Here is some simulated data, where something takes about $10$ years to learn from birth (standard deviation of $2$ ) and where the investigator observes those who learn this thing between $2005$ and $2010$ . In the simulation there is no effect from birth date but the observed data might suggest that there is: The next picture shows the censored data but it is not totally clear what is happening but if we change the variables shown then the censorship is more obvious. If there was an effect of later birthdate reducing learning times then this should also mean that learning times should also be falling on average with learning dates, and this simulated data does not seem to suggest that
