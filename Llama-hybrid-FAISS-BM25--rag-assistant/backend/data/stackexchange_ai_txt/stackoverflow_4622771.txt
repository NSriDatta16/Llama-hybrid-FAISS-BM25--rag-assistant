It's not a good practice ( in MVC pattern ) to call session values from Model. This value should be supplied by the action. Creating hidden input is not great idea, because user can modify it. So your code should be something like. if (!empty($this->data)) { $this->Model->create(); $this->data['Model']['agent_id'] = $this->Auth->user('id'); if ($this->Model->save($this->data)) { // success } } EDIT Yes, you can read sessions from Model, but its not recommended. Because it actually breaks the MVC architecture. If you wont care much you can use // in your Model.php App::import('Model', 'CakeSession'); $session = new CakeSession(); References Using Session Vars in a MVC Domain Model library http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/163bd9b60aa8757b/80163f0de8c54ad1?lnk=raot&pli=1 http://cakephp.1045679.n5.nabble.com/Checking-user-session-in-model-td1294422.html read more
