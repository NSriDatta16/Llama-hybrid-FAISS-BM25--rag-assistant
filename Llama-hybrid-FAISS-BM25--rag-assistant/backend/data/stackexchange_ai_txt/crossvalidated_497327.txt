Best known simple CNN model for MNIST?

I want to try models to classify the MNIST dataset. now, the parameters I can play with are: Network architecture: Number of convolutional layers, Number of kernels (filters) for each convolutional layer, Size of each kernel on each layer, Number of hidden layers (fully connected), Number of units for each hidden layer, Usage of layers (like BatchNormalization and Dropout.), Usage of max pooling (or maybe other pooling strategies). Training hyperparameters: Learning rate, Optimizer (SGD with momentum, adam, etc), Number of epochs. What is the best known network where these are the parameters I can play with? Thanks!
