Google Sets API

Looking for a Google Sets API. Unfortunately Google doesn't provide one. Preferably for PHP. I was using this script but it stopped working today, I think Google blocked my IP to access to Google Sets from my machine. It returns following warning message when trying to access Google Sets: Warning: fopen(http://labs.google.com/sets?hl=en&q1=java&btn=Small+Set+(15+items+or+fewer)): failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.0 503 Service Unavailable But strangely when I open Google Sets from the browser it opens up without any problem and I could perform query in it. Where is the problem? How to resolve it? And finally does anyone know which is the best way to get results of Google Sets from PHP? Thank you so much. UPDATE 1 Have just found this PHP class also, but the error message is the same: Warning: file_get_contents(http://labs.google.com/sets?hl=es&q1=bmw&q2=ferrari): failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.0 503 Service Unavailable So, I think the only problem is that Google Administrator (Agent) blocked my IP.
