I agreed with Sabeen; javascript is the way to go, but I would use ajax methods rather than hiding other form elements... You can use js to "listen" to events happening to the first checkbox group (ie onclick, onmouseover, whatever) and when a change is made, you can use ajax methods to send the form data to a small php script. This script then figures out which sub-menus build, and returns the relevant html fragment to the calling php script. Js takes this response and manipulates the DOM to add the new checkbox group to the page, all without the need for an entire page reload. If you're new to the world of js / ajax then I can throughly recommend jQuery . Other flavours of js framework (off the top of my head) include Prototype , MooTools , Dojo . I hope that wan't too vague, you did say you wanted a push in the right direction, rather than concrete examples! :) EDIT. I should mention that I've assumed the data that's driving these checkboxes is coming from a db. If not, then Sabeen's method is simpler to implement and incurs a much smaller execution overhead.
