This discussion has been beaten to death around here. Few people defend natural keys only and most encourage surrogate key usage. Some say you can have both, which is true, of course (use natural keys so business rules are enforced.) I tend to think twice if the natural key is really a key (most of the time it isn't.). If it is, then I use it. But again, most natural keys in reality aren't keys and will have duplicates due to various reasons. For example, in countries where national ID cards are issued, there is not uncommon to find two people with the same id number. That said, if I'd go the surrogate key route, I'd set up the tables like this Level1 [ID, Title, Number] Level2 [ID, FKID references Level1] No need to store the title and number twice.
