After letting the question simmer a bit further (an embarrassingly long time lets be honest) I've come to the conclusion that the answer is simple. coverage definition The coverage definition is $$ coverage(F) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}[\![\underset{j\in Y_{i.}^{+}}{\mathrm{max}}\ \mathrm{rank}_F(x_i,j) - 1]\!] $$ What confused me in this definition was the odd way the authors wrote the formula. It became more clear when I rethought the problem using indicator functions. First of all the entire thing comes down to rewriting the expression $\underset{j\in Y_{i.}^{+}}{\mathrm{max}}\ \mathrm{rank}_F(x_i,j) - 1$ . What the function "tries" to state states is Compute the rank of $F(x_i)$ . Of the rank of $F(x_i)$ where $y_{ij} \in Y_{i.}^+$ compute the maximum of the argument and $l$ . While I got confused by the function body stating $j\in Y_{i.}^+$ , the intuitive answer is that $Y_{i.}^+$ is the set of indices of the relevant class labels and the maximum index is $l$ . It is however important to note that this is not exactly what the article states, as $max(j)|j\in Y_{i.}^{+}$ could be an empty value, as $Y_{i.}^+$ may be an empty set, so the definition of coverage only makes sense if it is defined $$ coverage(F) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}[\![\underset{j\in Y_{i.}^{+}}{\mathrm{max}}\ \mathrm{rank}_F(x_i,l) - 1]\!] $$ although I could further see this as being confusing. defunc example $m = 1$ Now with this cleared up manually calculating the example is simple. The problem only has a single correct label, so letting $F(x_i)$ be the probability function of our model. Ignoring knowledge of the specific dataset we now have 2 possibilities: The outcome is labelled using a function $H(x_i) = \underset{j}{\mathrm{arg}\ \mathrm{max}} F(x_i)_j$ The outcome is labelled similarly using $H(x_i)$ where $h_j(x_i) = [\![f_j(x_i) > t(x_i)]\!]$ where $t(x_i)$ is some threshold function. The first situation is not truly multi-labelled and we'll have a situation where $$ \underset{j\in Y_{i.}^{+}}{\mathrm{max}}\ \mathrm{rank}_F(x_i,l) - 1 \in \left\{\begin{matrix} l - 1 \\ 0 \end{matrix}\right. $$ as we can only ever have on categorized label, this is either fully correctly labelled, or we mislabelled the observation. In the example above $obs = VF$ but $y_i \in \{VF, F, M, L\}$ . For a single labelling function we have that either $pred = VF$ (in which case the rank is 1) or $pred != VF$ (in which case the observation is not in $Y_{i.}^+$ so the set is empty and the result is $l-1$ ). For the second scenario we may have set a threshold $h_j(x_i)$ , lets say this is defined as $f_j(x_i) > 0.2$ . In this case $Y_{i.}^+ = {VF}$ and $Y_{i.}^-= {F}$ and (loosely) $rank(F(x_i)) = \{ 1_F, 2_{VF} \}$ (using the subscript to illustrate the classes). Thus $$ \underset{j\in Y_{i.}^{+}}{\mathrm{max}}\ \mathrm{rank}_F(x_i,l) - 1 = 2_{VF} - 1 = 1 $$ and so is the coverage for this single observation example.
