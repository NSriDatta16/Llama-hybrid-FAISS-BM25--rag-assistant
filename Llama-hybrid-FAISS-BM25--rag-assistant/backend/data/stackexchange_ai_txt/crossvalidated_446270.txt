What is the right regression model if the dependent variable is a percentage?

I have a database where I have a population divided by income percentiles. For each percentile, I have data about the average income, and the percentage of children that attend at least some college between age 18-21. I would like to have a model that, for a given income, tells me what percentage of children I can expect to attend college. Problem is, since the dependent variable is a percentage, with a linear regression I get predicted values like 150% of kids going to college for a very high income. I've tried with the betareg package betareg(formula = college ~ par_fam_inc, data = unis) but it returns "model did not converge". Does anybody know how to help me with this? Thanks a lot, and sorry, I'm just a beginner with R. Pietro edit: an example of the data I have. Yearly parents' income in par_fam_inc, college attendance of chldren in college.
