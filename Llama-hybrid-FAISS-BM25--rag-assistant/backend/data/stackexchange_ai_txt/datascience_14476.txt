In short, the correct practice is to use the scaling/preprocessing parameters you found and used on your training set, and apply them to your test set. the motivation for this is that you should be able to deal with someone coming to you with one new observation they want a prediction on. You will be able to preprocess that single observation using your training set preprocessing parameters. Ill go through some of the issues you brought up: Dummy Variables: This might entail you using setdiff() in R to find what columns are in your training set but not in your test set, then make a column in your test set with a column of zeros. This is the simplest way to do it, but it is very data/purpose dependent. You may also want to change this or look for better options depending on what modeling technique you're using. Min/Max Normalize: When you scale your training set, save the min and max of each column, and scale your test set using those parameters (NOT the min/max of your test set). PCA: When you perform PCA on your training set, you are transform your data based on rotations that were calculated on your training set. You want to perform those pre-calculated rotations on your test set. Check out ?predict.prcomp . This will show you how to apply your rotations from your training set onto your test set.
