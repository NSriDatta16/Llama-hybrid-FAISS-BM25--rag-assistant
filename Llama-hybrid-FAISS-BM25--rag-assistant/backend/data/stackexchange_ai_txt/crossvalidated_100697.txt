Assuming you have a decent sample size, the problem is with the ordering of your data. Is your data i.i.d.? Or is it a time series? Could there be some relationship between $X_{t}$ and $X_{t+1}$, say? If you permute the data, then you lose that information, and potentially will get different results. If this is the case, perhaps try a time series version of cross validation, or try your permutations in blocks?
