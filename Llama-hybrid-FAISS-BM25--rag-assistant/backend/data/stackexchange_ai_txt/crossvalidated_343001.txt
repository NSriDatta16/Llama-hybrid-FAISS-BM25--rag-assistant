My experience lies in sparse matrices for optimization. Hopefully somebody more knowledgeable will come along to replace my answer. I took a quick look at sparse matrices in R and found this: http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2011/10/31/using-sparse-matrices-in-r/ Potential for 1000-fold storage reduction - depending upon proportion of zeros. As to approach, I would store the data for each metric in its own sparse matrix. Each matrix then consists of a series of entries: (country, year): observation. Your data file would consist of a stack of sparse matrices, one for each metric you are storing.
