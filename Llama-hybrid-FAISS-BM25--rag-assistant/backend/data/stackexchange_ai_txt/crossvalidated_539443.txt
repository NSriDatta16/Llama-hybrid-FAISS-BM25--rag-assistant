You have a couple questions/ assumptions in your question so let's break it down one by one: Model choice (fixed-effect vs. random-effects): The model choice should be done a priori (aka not driven by the statistical analysis) based assumptions of whether or not you are measuring a single effect or a range of effects (parameters). In other words, using Tau/ Chi/ I-squared to drive your model choice is not good practice. You can also run another model to test the robustness of the analyses and whether the results significantly change based on model choice. [Personal note: In the protocol for this particular meta-analysis I would have suggested the authors use the Peto-modified Odds Ratio (Fixed-effect model) for rare outcomes, but that's another discussion all together]. As Wolfgang nicely summarized it you need to pool on the log scale.
