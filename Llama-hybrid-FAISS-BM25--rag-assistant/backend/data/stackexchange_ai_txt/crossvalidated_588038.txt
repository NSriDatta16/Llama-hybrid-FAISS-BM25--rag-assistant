Here's another way to think about this: Let $\theta = Î²_0 +\sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i X_i $ be your linear predictor. If $X_j$ increases by one unit, the linear predictor increases by $\beta_j$ . What can we say about the corresponding change in probability, $|p(\theta+ \beta_j)-p(\theta)|$ ? In a logistic regression model, the probability is given by $p(\theta)=e^\theta/(1+e^\theta)$ , the inverse of the logit (log-odds) function. It is straightforward to show that the derivative of this function is maximised at $\theta=0$ , and that $p'(0)=1/4$ . We deduce that $|p(\theta+ \beta_j)-p(\theta)| . In other words, the maximum effect a unit change in the $j$ th variable can have on the probability is equal to its coefficient divided by 4. Can you work out the equivalent for the probit model?
