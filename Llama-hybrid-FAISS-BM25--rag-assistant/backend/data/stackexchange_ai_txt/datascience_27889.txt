This answer is based on my opinion and others', it might not be the answer you expect. The problem you want to solve is probably in the field of Artificial General Intelligence . The problems require AGI to solve are informally known as AI-complete . AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include computer vision, natural language understanding, and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem. Currently, we're not ready to solve these problems, and if Gartner is right, the hype won't come to peak in 10 years. This is the Gartner hype curve in 2017, and AGI is still in its early phase. The problem is, at the moment, our state-of-the-art AI models (Deep Learning) don't have the ability to explain their decision or reason about their behavior, which makes learning highly inefficient. In addition, the Reinforcement Learning framework is way too simple and it ignores the complexity of human environment. You might find this answer useful. Geoffrey Hinton, one of the leaders of the field, said in an interview that AI needed to start over . "My view is throw it all away and start again," "I don't think it's how the brain works. We clearly don't need all the labeled data." That's it. If one day AI can learn how to play Starcraft 2, it probably learns in a very different way from what it learns today.
