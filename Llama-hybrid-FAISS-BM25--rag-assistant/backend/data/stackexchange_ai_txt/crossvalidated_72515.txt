Training one class SVM using LibSVM

I hope to use one-class SVM of LIBSVM to train a training samples so as to get a model. Then, I will use the model to predict whether the new test data and the training data is same type or not. In the training process, I have some questions as follows: Should the training samples all be positive examples or not? Which kernel function can get better result, linear kernel or RBF kernel? What is the effect of nu's values to the model?
