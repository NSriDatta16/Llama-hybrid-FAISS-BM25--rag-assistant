Can you perform a multiple imputation on data that is missing not at random (MNAR)?

Is there a way to identify if your data is MNAR, MAR, or MCAR? And when performing multiple imputation, should you include all predictor variables even if only 1 or 2 variables have missing values? (SPSS) Some context: I am running a multiple logistic regression where one of my variables has almost 20% missing values. I ran a missing pattern analysis through SPSS and found that my data satisfy the monotonicity assumption. However, I don't know whether my data is MNAR, MAR, or MCAR. I suspect MNAR or MAR because it is survey data were participants were allowed to refuse to answer. I could take a wild guess, but I want to know if there is a statistical test/process I can use that will tell me if my data is MNAR or MAR. Also once I run my MI and build my logistic model, how do I decide if it is better to go with a model that excludes all missing values through list-wise deletion or with my imputed model? Do I look at changes in the Beta coefficients, standard errors, model fit?
