Is it ideal that MongoDB is using 150 MB memory?

This is the first project by me which is using MongoDB. I have hosted it on a linode (a VPS which uses XEN) and I'm checking memory usage with "top". The mongod process seem to use around 150 MB of memory. There were no connections to it when I checked. I use RockMongo to administer it. My main database stats are - Size - 464m Storage Size - 83.99m Data Size - 66.4m Index Size - 49.33m Collections - 5 Objects - 584850 A lot of queries happen when the cron job is running, around 75 per minute or even more. But, as I said earlier, when I checked the memory usage, there were no connections. Output of db.serverStatus(); Note - I had restarted mongod before running db.serverStatus(); and the memory usage was 40 MB. { "retval": { "version": "1.6.5", "uptime": 790, "uptimeEstimate": 783, "localTime": "Mon, 07 Feb 2011 00: 51: 04 -0500", "globalLock": { "totalTime": 790027671, "lockTime": 376381, "ratio": 0.00047641495838188, "currentQueue": { "total": 0, "readers": 0, "writers": 0 } }, "mem": { "bits": 64, "resident": 38, "virtual": 957, "supported": true, "mapped": 288 }, "connections": { "current": 2, "available": 9598 }, "extra_info": { "note": "fields vary by platform", "heap_usage_bytes": 152448, "page_faults": 0 }, "indexCounters": { "btree": { "accesses": 1, "hits": 1, "misses": 0, "resets": 0, "missRatio": 0 } }, "backgroundFlushing": { "flushes": 13, "total_ms": 1, "average_ms": 0.076923076923077, "last_ms": 0, "last_finished": "Mon, 07 Feb 2011 00: 50: 54 -0500" }, "cursors": { "totalOpen": 0, "clientCursors_size": 0, "timedOut": 0 }, "opcounters": { "insert": 0, "query": 57, "update": 0, "delete": 0, "getmore": 0, "command": 46 }, "asserts": { "regular": 0, "warning": 0, "msg": 0, "user": 0, "rollovers": 0 }, "ok": 1 }, "ok": 1 } A friend of mine runs his WordPress blog on a linode with same amount of ram (1024 MB). His MySQL usage show mere 20.48 and approx. 12 users are like "always-surfing" (as in always-on) on his site. This makes me feel MongoDB isn't a nice choice for me and I should have sticked to MySQL! Thank you, all.
