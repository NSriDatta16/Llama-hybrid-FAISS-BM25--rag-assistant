Suppress results from generated code

I have a project created with "Suppress results from generated code" checked in its properties. When I add a service reference, the proxy class (reference.cs) that is autogenerated adds the following attribute: [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()] [System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("System.Runtime.Serialization", "3.0.0.0")] When I compile in release mode, as I have enabled generation of xml comments, I am getting warnings as none of the proxy methods are commented. To my understanding, I shouldnÂ´t get that as I have the suppress of autogenerated code. In addition, the reference.cs class is not clscompliant. Do anybody has idea of how to solve this without using pragma disable/enable? Thanks in advance.
