JSON duplicated properties validation via Jackson

I use Jackson and want to check that input JSON string doesn't contain duplicated properties like: {"a" : 1, "a" : 0} Following Jackson fragment process input string without any errors and even return value: JsonNode jsonSelect = mapper.readTree("{ A : 1, A : 0}"); System.out.println(jsonSelect.getFieldValue("A")); // prints 0 Does I have a chance to validate duplicates via Jackson? P.S. Does JSON format support duplicated properties at all? I didn't find any restrictions about it in specification . Also org.json.JSONObject throws an exception for duplicates that doesn't give me an answer - is {"a" : 1, "a" : 0} well-formed according to standard.
