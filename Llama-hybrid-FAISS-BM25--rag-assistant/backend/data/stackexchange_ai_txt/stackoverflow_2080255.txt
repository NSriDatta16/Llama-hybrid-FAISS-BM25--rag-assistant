You may want to use a utility like Wireshark (graphical, but not scriptable from C#, AFAIK). Wireshare uses a library called WinPcap, which does the actual monitoring of the TCP streams on the computer. Decoding of the HTTP headers will need to be done in your application (this is what wireshark/tcpdump/windump should be able to do). You will need to use PInvoke to call the WinPcap DLL. You can find library wrappers by performing a web search for "WinPcap PInvoke". This question sound very similar to the following: Is there any way in .NET to programmatically listen to HTTP traffic? EDIT: Also, Capturing HTTP requests may help
