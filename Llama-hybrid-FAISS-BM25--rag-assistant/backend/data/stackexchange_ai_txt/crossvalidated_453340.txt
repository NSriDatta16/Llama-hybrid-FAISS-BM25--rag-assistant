As usεr11852 says , cross validation does make sense for optimizing linear SVMs. According to Hastie et al. : The Entire Regularization Path for the Support Vector Machine, Journal of Machine Learning Research 5 (2004) 1391–1415 , inside the cross validation you don't need to compute one SVM per C value as it is possible to compute the complete path of SVMs with varying Cs together. If you work in R, package svmpath provides this.
