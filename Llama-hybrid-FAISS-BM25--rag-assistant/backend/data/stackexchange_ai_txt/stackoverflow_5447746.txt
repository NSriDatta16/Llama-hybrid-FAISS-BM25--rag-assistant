I figured it out, stupid mistake. In my scrollViewDidScroll I had: scrollView.userInteractionEnabled=NO; and in my scrollViewDidEndDecelerating scrollView.userInteractionEnabled=YES; and in scrollViewDidEndDragging:willDecelerate if(!decelerate){scrollView.userInteractionEnabled=YES;} I had this to prevent button presses and any random things during a page transition. But when setContentOffset is called it only causes scrollViewDidScroll to be called and neither of the other two, so the UserInteraction was never set back to Enabled, but only when using setContentOffset. Simple fix.
