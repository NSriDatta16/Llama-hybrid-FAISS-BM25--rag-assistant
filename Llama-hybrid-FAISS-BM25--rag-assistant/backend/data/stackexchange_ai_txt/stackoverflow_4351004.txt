DragMove not working when quickly dragging?

I have an application that can moved by dragging the title bar with the typical pattern using DragMove: private void Window_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { DragMove(); } It works fine, but only if I click in a spot, and then drag. If I click while dragging my mouse over the title bar it doesn't move. Is there another event than MouseLeftButtonDown I need to hook to?
