Flex: What OpenSource Container Component should I use?

Please help me what container component I will use. Here is my problem, I have advance data grid with full of data about 300 by 300 row-column(data can be picture). Now I need a container that can zoom in/out, fit to screen capability and can drag around the component inside so that my data grid will be zoomable and dragable around the container(Easy for the user to read content inside my datagrid). Any suggestion for a container that fits on what I need. Thanks
