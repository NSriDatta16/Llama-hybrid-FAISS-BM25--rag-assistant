I'm actually working on this issue myself. Before, I would suggest read over this the API guide from Google as a good starting reference. If I'm reading it correctly, one begins with passing user credentials through a REST interface to get a Authentication Token. To handle that, I'm using the following: sub getToken { my %parms = @_; my $response = LWP::UserAgent->new->post( 'https://www.google.com/youtube/accounts/ClientLogin', [ Email => $parms{'username'}, Passwd => $parms{'password'}, service => "youtube", source => " >", ] ); my $content = $response->content; my ($auth) = $content =~ /^Auth=(.*)YouTubeUser(.*)$/msg or die "Unable to authenticate?\n"; my ($user) = $content =~ /YouTubeUser=(.*)$/msg or die "Could not extract user name from response string. "; return ($auth, $user); } And I call that from the main part of my program as such: ## Get $AuthToken my ($AuthToken, $GoogleUserName) = getToken(( username => $email, password => $password )); Once I have these two things -- $AuthToken and $GoogleUserName, I'm still testing the LWP Post. I'm still writing this unit: sub test { my %parms = @_; ## Copy file contents. Use, foy's three param open method. my $fileSize = -s $parms{'File'}; open(VideoFile, ' new->post( "http://uploads.gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/$parms{'user'}/uploads", [ Host => "uploads.gdata.youtube.com", 'Authorization' => "AuthSub token=\"$parms{'auth'}\"", 'GData-Version' => "2", 'X-GData-Key' => "key=$YouTubeDeveloperKey", 'Slug' => "$parms{'File'}", 'Content-Type' => "multipart/related; boundary=\" \"", 'Content-Length' => " ", 'video_content_type'=> "video/wmv", 'Connection' => "close", 'Content' => $fileContents ] ); print Dumper(\$r->content) } And that is called as &test((auth=>$Auth, user=>$user, File=>'test.wmv'));
