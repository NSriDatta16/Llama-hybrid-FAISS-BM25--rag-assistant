Is there a decent image uploading library for Rails 3?

I have tried Paperclip and Dragonfly and found them to be difficult to use if your needs are even slightly different than the poorly written examples, and the docs lack greatly. Is there such a thing as a easy-to-use image uploading library for rails?
