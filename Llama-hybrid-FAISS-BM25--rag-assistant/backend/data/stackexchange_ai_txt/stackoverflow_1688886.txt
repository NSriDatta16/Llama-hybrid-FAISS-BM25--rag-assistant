How to organize OO js code in files? Local network application

I'm currently developing an application that will be run on local network in B2B environment . So I can almost forget about micro (mini?) optimizations in terms of saving bandwidth because Hardware Is Cheap, Programmers Are Expensive . We have a well structured Object oriented js code in the project and obviously lots of js classes . If all the classes will be stored in separated files then it will be quite easy to navigate through this code and hence maintain it. But this will bring my browser to generate a couple dozens of HTTP requests to get all the js files/classes I need on the page. Even in local environment it is not super fast on first load(with empty cache), and later when you modify it and cache has to be invalidated. Possible solutions: violate rule "one class per file" use YUI compressor all the time(in development & production) for generating one big js file. But if we choose YUI compressor for this(no minify action in dev environment, and minify for production) - then we need to reload/recompile this big js file on every modification in any js file. What would you recommend for solving this problem?
