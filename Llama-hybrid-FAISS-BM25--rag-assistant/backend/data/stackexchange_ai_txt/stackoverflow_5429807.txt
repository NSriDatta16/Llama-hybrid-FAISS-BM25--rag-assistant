Showing hierarchical data in winforms datagrid

Am working on a .net 3.5/Winforms application. I need to show a datagridview with hierarchical data in the datagrid. For example, master rows will have an expand/collapse icon...and when the user clicks on a master row, it should expand and show the child row details in the grid. Using the Infragistics sample example at http://devcenter.infragistics.com/Support/KnowledgeBaseArticle.Aspx?ArticleID=1665 , am now able to see Master/Child data in my ultragrid. Now my next task is to : 1.Show editable textboxes in the child grid having order details.[Note: I tried this but did not work for me: this.ultraGrid.DisplayLayout.Bands[1].Columns[3].Style = Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.ColumnStyle.Edit;] 2.When the user hits submit button, read these textbox values and push it to the database. Could you please let me know if this is possible and how to go about it? Any sample example will be really helpful. Thanks.
