How do I turn off WS_CAPTION style of a window (using user32.dll)?

I am embedding a 3rd party app into a panel on a C# Windows form (using SetParent from user32.dll). I need to then turn off the title bar window style WS_CAPTION so that it looks like a part of the hosting application. How do I change a window's style to accomplish this? For sake of example, say _hWnd is the handle of the application to embed.
