Look at http://www.jsfiddle.net/gaby/Bek9L/ I changed the #main area to be left:200px ( and no width ). Added e.preventDefault() on the mousedown to avoid the selection of text to occur. In the code i alter the left property of the #main as well so both sides move.. Not sure what you problem really is, but what is see is that the #sidebar was resized but was going underneath the #main and so the #dragbar disappeared..
