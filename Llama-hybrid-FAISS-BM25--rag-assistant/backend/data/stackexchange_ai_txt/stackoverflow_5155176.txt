The printer driver does not have any external API for finding the filename. I assume you would be looking at creating some kind of systray agent sort of app that would be monitoring print queues for jobs being sent. If so - Refer to http://support.microsoft.com/kb/196805 for a microsoft tool that allows you to monitor print queues for print job status Refer to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff562742%28v=vs.85%29.aspx which explains how Windows supports printer change notifications. You can create an app that registers for this and get handle to the Print Queue. Once you get a handle you can call the GetPrinter and GetJob APIs to get access to the JOB_INFO_2 structure. The pDocumentName in the JOB_INFO_2 structure is the name of the file Hope this helps. If so, please vote a +1 :)
