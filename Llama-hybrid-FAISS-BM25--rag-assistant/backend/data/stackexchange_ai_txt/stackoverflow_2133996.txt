The DOCTYPE definition, in standards terms, describes the markup. Thus once the markup has been parsed by a user agent, the DOCTYPE is irrelevent in that respect . In practical terms, the DOCTYPE also triggers browser behaviors, so what you do with/to the DOM dynamically is in that way affected by the DOCTYPE.
