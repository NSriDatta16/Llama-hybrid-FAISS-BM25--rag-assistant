Configure the ext-mail of hudson

I have a grails project and I use hudson to follow different analysis. I want to send the report analysis (cobertura, codenarc, findbug) to the developer. However, I don't know how to use hudson's ext-mail. Through googling I suspect the solution is to use jelly sscript but I can seem to get it to work.
