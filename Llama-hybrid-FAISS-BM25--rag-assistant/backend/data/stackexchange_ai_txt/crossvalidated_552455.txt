What does it mean if we use eigenvetor matrix of centered matrix $\mathbf{X}$ to reduce the dimension of $\mathbf{X}$ without centering?

Recently, I was trying to use PCA to reduce the dimension of matrix $\mathbf{X}$ . Suppose a data matrix $\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{C}^{M\times N}$ , where $M$ is the number of variables and $N$ is the number of samples. The centered data matrix is denoted as $\mathbf{X}_m$ . We can easily get the eigenvector matrix of covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}_{xm} \in \mathbb{C}^{M\times M}$ of $\mathbf{X}_m$ to re-express the original data matrix. However, normally this projection is applied on the centered data matrix $\mathbf{X}_m$ . if I use the eigenvetor matrix to process the data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ without centering, what will be the result? For example, if I choose first $K$ column of eigenvector matrix $\mathbf{P}$ (eigenvalues in descending order) to reduce the dimension of data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ , we can get $\mathbf{X}_{new}\in \mathbb{C}^{K\times N}=\mathbf{P}^{H}(:,1:K)\mathbf{X}$ with lower dimension. But is it right? Can it express the data matrix with lower dimension without centering? What's the difference between this one and the outcome of data matrix $\mathbf{X}_m$ with centering? Edit: I think my problem can be revised as "If I want to reduce the dimension of data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ ( $\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{C}^{M\times N}$ , $M$ is the number of variables and $N$ is the number of snapshots) without centering, what should I do?"
