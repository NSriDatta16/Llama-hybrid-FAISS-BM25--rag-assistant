If your text editor doesn't do good code completion, you're wasting everyone's time. Quickly remembering thousands of argument lists, spellings, and return values (not to mention class structures and similarly complex organizational patterns) is a task computers are good at and people (comparatively) are not. I buy wholeheartedly that slowing yourself down a bit and avoiding the gadget/feature cult is a great way to increase efficiency and avoid bugs, but there is simply no benefit to spending 30 seconds hunting unnecessarily through sourcecode or docs when you could spend nil... especially if you just need a spelling (which is more often than we like to admit). Granted, if there isn't an editor that provides this functionality for your language, or the task is simple enough to knock out in the time it would take to load a heavier editor, nobody is going to tell you that Eclipse and 90 plugins is the right tool. But please don't tell me that the ability to H-J-K-L your way around like it's 1999 really saves you more time than hitting escape every time you need a method signature... even if you do feel less "hacker" doing it. Thoughts?
