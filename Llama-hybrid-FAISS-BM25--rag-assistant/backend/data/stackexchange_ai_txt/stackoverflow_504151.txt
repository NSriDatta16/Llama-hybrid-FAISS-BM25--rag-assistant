I would note mikeabdullahuk's answer is good but also if you use NSURLCredentialPersistencePermanent instead of per session it will store the credentials in the users keychain so next time you can check NSURLCredentialStorage for a non nil value for the default credentials for a protection space and if you get a non nil value you can just pass the credentials in. I am using this method right now for a delicious.com client I am writing and it works very well in my tests.
