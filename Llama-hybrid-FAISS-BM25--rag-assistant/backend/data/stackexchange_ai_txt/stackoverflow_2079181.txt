Malloc has to run through a linked list of free blocks to find one to allocate. This takes time. So, #1 will usually be slower: The more often you call malloc, the more time it will take - so reducing the number of calls will give you a speed improvement (though whether it is significant will depend on your exact circumstances). In addition, if you malloc many small blocks, then as you free those blocks, you will fragment the heap much more than if you only allocate and free a few large blocks. So you are likely to end up with many small free blocks on your heap rather than a few big blocks, and therefore your mallocs may have to search further through the free-space lists to find a suitable block to allocate. WHich again will make them slower.
