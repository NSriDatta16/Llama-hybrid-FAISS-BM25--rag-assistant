A little help to your intuition: First, consider what happens if you add one to all the faces of one die, e.g. the d4. So, instead of 1,2,3,4, the faces now show 2,3,4,5. Comparing this situation to the original, it is easy to see that the total sum is now one higher than it used to be. This means that the shape of the distribution is unchanged, it is just moved one step to the side. Now subtract the average value of each die from every side of that die. This gives dice marked $-{3\over 2}$,$-{1\over 2}$,${1\over 2}$,${3\over 2}$ $-{5\over 2}$,$-{3\over 2}$,$-{1\over 2}$,${1\over 2}$,${3\over 2}$,${5\over 2}$ $-{7\over 2}$,$-{5\over 2}$,$-{3\over 2}$,$-{1\over 2}$,${1\over 2}$,${3\over 2}$,${5\over 2}$,${7\over 2}$ etc. Now, the sum of these dice should still have the same shape as the original, only shifted downwards. It should be clear that this sum is symmetrical around zero. Therefore the original distribution is also symmetrical.
