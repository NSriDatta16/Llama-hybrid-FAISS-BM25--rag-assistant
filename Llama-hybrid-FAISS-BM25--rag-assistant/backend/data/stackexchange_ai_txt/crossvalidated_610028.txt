As Sextus writes , this is a case of time series forecasting. Here are some resources: Resources/books for project on forecasting models Since you write that you have daily data, this sounds a lot like retail sales to me, so you might be interested in this introduction to retail forecasting and the references therein. I basically see two possibilities. You could fit a model to the data pre-COVID, then forecast out into the COVID time frame. You could fit a model to all your data, but including one or more predictors to capture the COVID effect. (If COVID had different effects at different times, e.g., driven by different lockdowns, you may want to use multiple predictors.) Then calculate the model fit across the COVID time without the COVID predictors . The two approaches will yield different results. A simple way of dealing with this is to take the average of the two forecasts/fits. Don't worry too much that you get different results - there is a lot of uncertainty in this kind of "alternative history" in any case. In either case, your models should be able to capture the main drivers in your time series. Daily data usually has intra-weekly seasonality, but your manager is likely not interested in a particular Tuesday but in aggregate results, so you could probably just disregard this one seasonality. However, you also write that you have "quarterly" seasonality, which one could interpret in two ways: either your daily data have a pattern that repeats every three months, or you have a pattern that recurs on a yearly basis, with different quarters being noticeably different. In any case, you can capture the effect by transforming the day-of-year using sine and cosine waves (Fourier terms). Don't, e.g., use dummy coding for the quarter - this will yield a step function that simply does not make sense. You may want to take a look at our multiple-seasonalities tag. If you have promotions, you could include them in the model and also include when you would have run promotions in the absence of COVID. Yes, this adds some degree of arbitrariness. Alternatively, don't model promotions and live with the fact that your demand is smoothed out. As for the day of week pattern mentioned above, your manager is likely not interested in this.
