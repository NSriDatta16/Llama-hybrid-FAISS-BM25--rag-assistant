Here's something you can try UPDATE manganames SET display = CASE WHEN display = 1 then 0 WHEN name = @name ELSE display END WHERE id = @id There are a couple of conditions that you don't explain. First, what should happen when display = 1 and name = name? With what you show, both 0 and 1 would be assigned. In my example, the first WHEN clause would apply and 0 will be assigned to display. Second, what should happen when display <> 1 and name <> @name? In my example, the ELSE condition will assign display to display, which results in no change.
