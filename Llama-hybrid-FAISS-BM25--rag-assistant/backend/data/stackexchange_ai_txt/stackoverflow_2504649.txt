In a wider way, all that cover pattern recognition and signal processing could take great advantage of neural networks. Also, you could use neural networks to develop "pseudo-AI" for games (strategy, soccer games). Anyway, as neural network is a tool more than a "solution", it can be used in economics, physics, navigation, signal processing, etc. Also, many types of neural networks exist (perceptron, hopfield), the thing is to use them wisely according to the problem. Neural networks are not panacea, just a (very interesting and powerful) tool.
