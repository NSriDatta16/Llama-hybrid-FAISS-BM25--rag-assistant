I agree with the conclusion you included within your question. The inherent nature of neural networks - along with the fact that all features interact with each other and the associated weights - will help you in cases where you get "outlying" data. It may even turn out that with 40 features, this one particular feature may not even matter at all regardless of value. So, I think you are OK to proceed as you stated in your original question.
