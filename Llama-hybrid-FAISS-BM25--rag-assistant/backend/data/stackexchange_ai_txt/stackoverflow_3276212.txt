any good new web-developer browser addons? (as in released in the last 6 months)

I used to be pretty ontop of the latest plugins but it's lost my attention recently (probably due to so many itentical blog articles called 'the best {num here} addons for firefox' ). Last time i looked i found: firequery and firepicker which are now indespensible, so what's new? any hot new extensions that have found their way into your daily work?
