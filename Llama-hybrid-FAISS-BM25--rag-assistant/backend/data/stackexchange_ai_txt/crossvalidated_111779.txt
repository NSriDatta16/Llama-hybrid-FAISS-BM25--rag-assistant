For inference of Dirichlet Process Mixture, why the expected value $\int h(x)f(x)$ is desired?

Why the expected value $\int h(x)f(x)$ is desired for inference in Dirichlet Process Mixture? What is the intuition for MCMC in Dirichlet Process Mixture? $f(x)$ is the probability density function, and $h(x)$ is the outcome of the Dirichlet Process Mixture (I am not sure). This formula is originally from page 40 of slides .
