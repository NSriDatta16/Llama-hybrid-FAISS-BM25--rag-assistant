According to Keras documentation, the expected input_shape is in [batch, timesteps, feature] form (by default). So, assuming 626 features you have are the lagged values of a single feature, the input shape should be of size (None,626,1) , where the first None represents the batch size. If you pay attention to number of parameters for the first case, i.e. input_shape = (1,626), the first LSTM layer has significantly higher number of params compared to the second case. This is because the last dimension value, 626, represents the number of features not the time steps, as if the input is a multivariate time series and for each of them you need a weight, which makes the number of parameters go high.
