What are the consequences when large-sample asymptotics does not hold?

Lots of (frequentist) statistical inference is based on large-sample asymptotics. What are the specific consequences when a sample size is not big enough for the sampling distribution of an estimator to be approximated using the asymptotic sampling distribution? The confidence interval will not have proper coverage, but will it be too wide or too narrow?
