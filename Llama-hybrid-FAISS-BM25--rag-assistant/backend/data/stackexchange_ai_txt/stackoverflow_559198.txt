In scripting mode (or via "groovyConsole"), you need a declaration of walker with "def" before using it. A Groovy script file is translated into a derivative class of class Script before it get compiled. So, every declaration needs to be done properly. On the other hand, when you're running a script in "groovysh" (or using an instance of class GroovyShell), its mechanism automatically binds every referencing object without the need of declaration. updated : My above answer would be wrong as I decompiled a .class of Groovy and found that it's using a binding object inside the script as well. Thus my first paragraph was indeed wrong.
