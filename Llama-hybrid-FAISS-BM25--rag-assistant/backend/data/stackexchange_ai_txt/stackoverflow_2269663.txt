I know this doesn't directly answer your question, but I strongly encourage you to take a look at the Configuration Section Designer project on CodePlex . It will give you a design-time experience for configuration sections in your application, generating the class code for you from the designer, as well as templates for putting them in your config file as well. Having to do all of this on your own, by hand, is very, very tedious, and I haven't seen a situation yet that the Configuration Section Designer doesn't handle.
