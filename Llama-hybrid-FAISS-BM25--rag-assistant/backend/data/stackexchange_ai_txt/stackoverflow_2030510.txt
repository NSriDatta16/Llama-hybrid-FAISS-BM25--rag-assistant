Have your compiler generate a map file. The map file contains function names and their locations (offsets, addresses or both). Search the map file for an address and you should come up with a name for that address. In your example, ZwCreateFile is not 0x25. The processor dereferences the {pointer} value in edx and uses that value as the address for ZwCreateFile . The address of ZwCreateFile cannot be obtained from the assembly language you posted. The address of ZwCreateFile is stored in location 0x7ffe0300, which must have been initialized before this assembly language fragment. Again, consult your map file.
