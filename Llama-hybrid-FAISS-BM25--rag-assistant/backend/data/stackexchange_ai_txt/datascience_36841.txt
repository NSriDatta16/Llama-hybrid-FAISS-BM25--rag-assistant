Is GEMM used in Tensorflow, Theano, Pytorch

I know that Caffe uses GEneral Matrix to Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) which is part of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) library for performing convolution operations. Where a convolution is converted to matrix multiplication operation. I have referred below article. https://petewarden.com/2015/04/20/why-gemm-is-at-the-heart-of-deep-learning/ I want to understand how other deep learning frameworks like Theano, Tensorflow, Pytorch perform convolution operations. Do they use similar libraries in the backend. There might be some articles present on this topic. If someone can point me to those or can explain with an answer.
