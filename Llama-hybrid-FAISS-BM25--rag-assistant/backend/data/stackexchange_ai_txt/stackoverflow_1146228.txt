It shouldn't bother search engines, and divs are what you might call semantically transparent - they have no meaning in and of themselves. That's why they're suited to defining blocks of content. It's accepted practice to use divs as hooks for CSS styling and layout, but it's very easy to let the nesting run away from you. If you want to try to reduce the nested divs, see if any of them can be replaced by semantically meaningful tags. Careful attention to inheritance in the document might also help you cut some out by letting you apply specific styling without extra tags. All that said: it can't be judged without seeing your markup, but if it's even a semi-complex layout then 3 or 4 layers of div might not be remarkable or problematic.
