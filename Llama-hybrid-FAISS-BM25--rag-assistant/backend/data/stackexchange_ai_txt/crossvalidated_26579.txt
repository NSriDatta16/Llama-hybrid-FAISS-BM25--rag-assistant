(Reinforcing Peter Flom's answer) In marketing, the standard is to model whether they buy the product (yes/no, logistic) and then the number of purchases among those who buy the product. A third variable would be the average size of the purchase. In line with this, you'd have a yes/no on smoker and then only among smokers model the number of cigarettes. These analyses do not always point in the same direction; it's not unusual for advertising to increase the number of buyers but have little effect on how often they buy, for example.
