Method needed: parameters leading up to an event

I apologize, this is probably a simple question. I have 3 or 4 time series variables (temperature, depth, etc.) and I have the times that a specific event occurred (about 100 different events of the same type). I want to know which of my time series variables are most important to causing the event to happen and what are the threshold values of the time series variables that occur before the event. I will be expressing the time variables as indexes - in terms of averages over the previous 1, 2, 4, 8 hours. Therefore I will have for each event the values of several indices (temperature over the last 1 hour, temp over the last 2 hours, ... depth over the last 1 hour... etc.) Is there a model/method that can help me determine which index is most important and threshold values of each index? My question is kind-of similar to this one, but not quite: Pattern of events that leads to a goal
