Questions on Notation for PMF and Expectation

Before diving into the Stanford CS229 Machine Learning notes online, I decided to go through the course's notes on probability review and had a few questions. In section 2.2, it states A probability mass function (PMF) is a function $p_x : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $p_X(x) = P(X=x)$ However, wouldn't a PMF defined this way be a function defined from $\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ not $\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , since $X = x$ represents the set $\{\omega : X(\omega) = k\}$ , which is itself a member of $\mathcal{F}$ ? Also, another question. In section 2.5, it states Suppose that $g(x) = 1\{x \in A\}$ for some subset $A \subseteq \Omega$ . I don't understand what $x \in A$ means. $x$ here seems to be some value the random variable $X$ can take, i.e. $X = x$ . What does it mean for a random variable value to be a member in a subset of the sample space $\Omega$ ? My guess is that $x$ here is shorthand for the set $\{\omega : X(\omega) = k\}$ which is itself a subset of $\Omega$ .
