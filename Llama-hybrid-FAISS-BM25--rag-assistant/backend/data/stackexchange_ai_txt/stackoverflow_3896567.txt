how to organize interfaces and classes

I know this question has been asked and answered many times, but I am still asking the same question again... I have started working on a travelling application and for which currently I am working on creating on the creation of the underlying DAO so I am planning to create a generic DAO, its implementation and again an interface for each entity class. My query is what is the best way to organise all these interfaces as well as their Implementation. Thanks in advance
