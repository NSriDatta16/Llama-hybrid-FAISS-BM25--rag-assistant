Random Forest performed significantly better than other models for Multimodal data, Why?

Sorry about the vague question. I have multimodal human biosensory data, from eyes, body position and EEG. In my classification, Random Forest performed better than Neural Networks, SVM or Naive Bayes.. Is there any reason for this or any literature that backs this outcome? Is this to be expected? I understand that this may be due to my data and not a general outcome, however as I could not find any evidence or literature to back this statement, I was wondering if you knew of any research with similar results or if the general structure of a Random Forest leads to better outcomes with MM data? Any guidance will be appreciated. Many thanks!
