You can use jQuery's .load() method to load a page into a dialog, here's how: $("#dialog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, position: 'center' , title: 'EDIT', draggable: false, width : 300, height : 40, resizable : false, modal : true, }); $("#dialog_trigger").click( function() { $("#dialog").load('path/to/file.html', function() { $("#dialog").dialog("open"); }); }) This assumes the dialog has an ID of 'dialog' and that there's another element with ID of 'dialog_trigger' that is clicked to open it. You'd put both of these into your document's ready function so that the dialog is made on page-load, if it isn't, it will cause a slight-but-noticeable delay for the user as it's made.
