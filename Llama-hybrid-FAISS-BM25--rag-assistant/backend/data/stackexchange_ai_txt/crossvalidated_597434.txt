Interaction of weighted averages

I am investigating the effects of tax rates on tax-avoidance by multinationals using OLS-regressions. The idea is that a multinational will try to move more income to the Bahamas if the tax rates in the other countries it is active in are higher. (see example below) So, income in the Bahamas is positively affected by the weighted average of foreign taxes. Income=\beta_1*weighted foreign tax rates+\beta*controls+\epsilon However, moving income to the Bahamas is more difficult if the tax authorities are trying to stop you. Therefore, the effect of foreign taxes is lower if the tax authorities audit more frequently. An interaction between foreign taxes and foreign audit probability would capture this. There are two ways of creating the interaction. You can first create the interaction for each country and then take a weighted average, or take the interaction of the weighted averages. Germany Bahamas France Tax rate 40% 5% 30% Audit probability 10% 0% 15% Assets 100k 5k 200k Weight 100/305 5/305 200/305 Bahama's Weighted foreign tax rate 100/305*40+200/305*30=32.79 Bahama's Weighted foreign audit 100/305*10+200/305*15=13.11 Interaction option1 32.79*13.11=429.88 Interaction option2 100/305*40*10+200/305*30*15=426.23 Option 1 is a 'traditional' interaction. The interpretation and regression equation is easy to set up. Income=\beta_1*weighted tax rates+\beta_2*weighted audit probability+\beta_3*weighted tax rates*weighted audit probability+\beta*controls+\epsilon Option 2 is a bit different. Income=\beta_1*weighted tax rates+\beta_2*weighted audit probability+\beta_3*weighted interaction+\beta*controls+\epsilon Contrary to the 'traditional' interaction, I cannot really include the two terms I am interacting separately. Can I interpret the 'weighted interaction' as a normal interaction? Can I omit \beta_2*weighted audit probability from the above equation, without loss of interpretation?
