NOTE: git whatchanged is deprecated, use git log instead New users are encouraged to use git-log[1] instead. The whatchanged command is essentially the same as git-log[1] but defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges. The command is kept primarily for historical reasons; fingers of many people who learned Git long before git log was invented by reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it. You can use the command git whatchanged --stat to get a list of files that changed in each commit (along with the commit message). References https://git-scm.com/docs/git-whatchanged
