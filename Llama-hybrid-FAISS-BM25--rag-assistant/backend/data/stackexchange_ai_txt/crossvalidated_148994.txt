VAR or VECM for a mix of stationary and nonstationary variables?

I have 4 time series. One of them is stationary and rest of them are not. I need to find relation between them. I will use AIC to decide lag length. Should I use VAR or VECM to find relation between them? Will VAR or VECM give me relation in terms of equation which can be used for forecasting? Do I need to perform Johansen's test of cointegration? What good would it do?
