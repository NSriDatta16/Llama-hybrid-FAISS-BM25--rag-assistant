How to interpret ANOVA result?

I'm doing a research on factors affecting organizational culture in a company and in order to test my null and alternate hypothesis I was asked to use ANOVA on SPSS. This is the result I got for doing the ANOVA calculation for one of the independent variables and the dependent variable: ANOVA a Model Sum of Squares df Mean Square F Sig. 1 Regression .371 1 .371 1.639 .207 b Residual 10.874 48 .227 Total 11.246 49 a. Dependent Variable: Organizational Culture b. Predictors: (Constant), Type of Work How do I interpret this and have I done the calculation correctly?
