Bayesian statistics tutorial

I am trying to get upto speed in Bayesian Statistics. I have a little bit of stats background (STAT 101) but not too much - I think I can understand prior, posterior, and likelihood :D. I don't want to read a Bayesian textbook just yet. I'd prefer to read from a source (website preferred) that will ramp me up quickly. Something like this , but that has more details. Any advice?
