I believe smth is wrong with the rss xml. For instance check what xml is returned by StackOverflow rss feed . Specifically pay attention how node content looks like - it has no child xml nodes inside, only pure xml-escaped text. So if it is acceptable in your case - spend efforts on a proper rss xml generation rather than on fixing the consequences.
