The consensus may indeed be that this is not possible, but we should be looking at the JVM source to see how it can be ergonomically controlled. It would be very nice to be able to have a JVMTI agent be able to adjust the heap/perm/tenured/new/&c sizing online/at runtime. What would this do? it would allow agents to infer sizing adjustments based upon performance or footprint goals which will be important when moving JVMs into the Cloud.
