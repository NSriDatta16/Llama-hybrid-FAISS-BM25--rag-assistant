Is it okay to merge seperate MCMC chains, using different seed value?

I'm new to Bayesian analysis. I'm trying to estimate species's abundance. As I know, when using MCMC sampling, it is recommended to make more than three chains. However, the function I use can make only one chain; I used hSDM.Nmixture.iCAR() of hSDM package in R. So, I made three different models with three different seed values. Then, I merged the 3 samples and treated them like 'one big sample'. Here are my questions; Is it okay to merge seperate MCMC chains, using different seed values? Before merging the 3 chains, I checked that each chain was converged visually, and applied Geweke diagnostics. Is it right? Do I have to carry out Geweke diagnostics after merging? I'd like to calcuate Rhat for the merged sample. So, I converted the product of the hSDM.Nmixture.iCAR() function to ggs() product using ggmcmc package . Thus, I got three ggs() products including one chain. Is it possible to merge the three ggs() products, including one chain, into one ggs() product, including three chains? If merging ggs() is impossible, can you recommend some functions or packages to calculate Rhat and credible interval for the merged sample? OR... Is it okay to use one chain sample with long iteration? Then, how much long the chain should be?
