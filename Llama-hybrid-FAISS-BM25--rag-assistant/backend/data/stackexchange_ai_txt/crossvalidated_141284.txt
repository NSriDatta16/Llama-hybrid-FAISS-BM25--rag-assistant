Multivariate statistics is very broad, but given your background I'd recommend "Introduction to Statistical Learning" http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ It's a really nice intro book to modern multivariate techniques that are popular in data mining and machine learning. You can get the PDF for free.
