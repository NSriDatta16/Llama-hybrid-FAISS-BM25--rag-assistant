How to list the contents of a package using YUM?

I know how to use rpm to list the contents of a package ( rpm -qpil package.rpm ). However, this requires knowing the location of the .rpm file on the filesystem. A more elegant solution would be to use the package manager, which in my case is YUM. How can YUM be used to achieve this?
