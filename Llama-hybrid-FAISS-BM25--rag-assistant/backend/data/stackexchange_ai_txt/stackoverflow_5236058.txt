Adding a bit to Brosto's answer: It takes only a few lines of code to configure Azure Diagnostics. You decide what level you want to capture (verbose, informational, etc.). and how frequently you want to push locally-cached log messages to Azure storage (I usually go with something like 15 minute intervals). Log messages from all of your instances are then aggregated into the same table, easily queryable (or downloadable), with properties defining role and instance. There are additional trace statements, such as Trace.TraceError(), Trace.TraceWarning(), etc. You can even create a trace listener and watch your log output in almost-realtime on your local machine. The Azure AppFabric SDK Samples zip contains a sample (under \ServiceBus\Scenarios\CloudTrace) for doing this.
