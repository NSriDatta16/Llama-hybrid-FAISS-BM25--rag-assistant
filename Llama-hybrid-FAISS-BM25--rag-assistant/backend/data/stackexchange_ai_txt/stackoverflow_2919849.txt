NOTE: I worked through the excellent articles by Jon Rista on CodeProject, which led me to the "Could not find schema information for the element/attribute" errors. In any case, for the info that I wanted to store, I think an XML file, a specially built class needing to know a lot about VS config files, and an XDS file or include to bring one in is more than a bit overblown. I also read and tried things from a few dozen pages on the web... I gained a deeper understanding of the .NET way, but still nothing which I found simple or elegant enough. I find it hard to believe there is not a better way that I'm somehow missing.
