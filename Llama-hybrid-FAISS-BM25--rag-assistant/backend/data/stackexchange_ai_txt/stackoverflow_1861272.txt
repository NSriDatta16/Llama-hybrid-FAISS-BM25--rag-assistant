You've probably found this out already through your payment gateway but cards (debit, credit, custom [e.g store cards] are not easily distinguishable without a bit of help. Usually you can send the card number to the payment gateway and they'll give you this detail but you can work it out from a simple prefix table. Simply put each bank/organisation is given access to a certain set of prefixes [numbers at the start] and depending on the level of detail you want you can match any card number to an organisation using the prefix. What is nice is that Debit Cards and Credit Cards use different prefixes even from the same bank. From a web gateway point of view you don't typically care as the payment gateway will automatically tell you if they accept the card, do hotcard checks for you and validate the other information entered. The comment (above/below) about not having to enter your pin on a debit card is wrong. That is not a debit card, sometimes referred to as Garage/Fuel Cards (where I come from) they only work for certain "fuel type transactions" to speed up processing at the forecourt.
