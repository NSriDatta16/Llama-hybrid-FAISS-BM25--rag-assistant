bayesian network conditional independence test

In the book: Bayesian Networks With Examples in R, the author does this independence test: As I see it, this works both ways, we test if travel is independent of education likewise if education is independent of travel. (there is no order, we test independence) This is the DAG we are working with: What I don't understand is why only O,R were given (only the parents of travel and not the parents of education, why?)
