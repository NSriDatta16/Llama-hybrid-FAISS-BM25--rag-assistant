Stephen Wright has a good discussion of one approach to understanding convexity in this NIPS tutorial from 2010. It's in the context of machine learning optimization algorithms where he gives a good definition of convexity about 3:57 minutes into the presentation with topic "First-Order Methods." http://videolectures.net/nips2010_wright_oaml/ (Apologies for the absence of formulas in this answer -- which would help clarify things -- but I don't know how to integrate mathematical symbols into my response.)
