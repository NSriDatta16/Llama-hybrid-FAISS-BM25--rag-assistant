Setting a property can lead to notifications being sent to other objects that are observing that property. That could in turn lead to those objects attempting to do something further with your object. If you are in the middle of deallocating, this is probably not what you want to happen. So in general it is safer to release the relevant instance variable directly. Note that this sort of problem will only arise in certain cases, so it is often perfectly possible to write code using self.property=nil in dealloc and for everything to work out fine. It's just not best practice. In the Objective-C "modern runtime", it is possible to declare properties without ever specifying the ivar. The runtime will synthesise the storage to go along with the synthesised accessors. In this case you cannot release the ivar directly because as far as your code is concerned there isn't one. So you have no choice but to go the self.property=nil route.
