Pattern recognition in time series can involve a number of components. Memory i.e. auto-dependence can be characterized via an ARIMA component (stochastic/adaptive structure). Deterministic structure such as level shifts,local time trends,pulses and seasonal pulses can be found via Intervention Detection schemes. Changes in error variance and changes in parameters of the model over time can be found via residual diagnostic checking. Furthermore patterns can respond to known events , oftentimes the response is in anticipation of the event but much more frequently when the event occurs and periods following the event. If you have a pet time series please post it and I will try and develop the underlying pattern via available software.
