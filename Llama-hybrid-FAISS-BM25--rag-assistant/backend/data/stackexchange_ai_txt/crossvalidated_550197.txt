Some information is missing from the question. I have answered based on the what I could guess. Note that $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ is the standard deviation of $\bar{X}=\frac{X_1+X_2+\cdots+X_n}{n}$ . And $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ is an estimate of the standard deviation of $\bar{X}$ when $\sigma$ is unknown. So if your random variable (RV) $X$ is the average of $n$ i.i.d. RVs , use $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ when you know $\sigma$ , otherwise use the estimate of $\sigma$ , that is, $s$ . If you RV $X$ is such that it has standard deviation $\sigma$ , use $\sigma$ .
