You're exactly right. The general picture is: we want a test statistic that gives us maximal power at a given significance level $\alpha$ . In other words, a way to compute a value $\phi$ so that the points part of parameter space for which $\phi$ exceeds its $\alpha^\mathrm{th}$ quantile under $H_0$ have the least possible weight under $H_1$ . The Neyman-Pearson lemma demonstrates that that statistic is the likelihood ratio. Neyman & Pearson's original paper also discusses composite hypotheses. In some cases the answer is straightforward -- if there is a choice of particular distributions in each family whose likelihood ratio is conservative when applied the the whole family. This is what often happens, for instance, for nested hypotheses. It's easy for this not to happen, though; this paper by Cox discusses what to do further. I think a more modern approach here would be to approach it in a Bayesian way, by putting priors over the two families.
