What are the current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks?

I'm interested in understanding which neural network architecture is currently the state of the art (sometimes abbreviated "SOTA") with respect to standard image classification tasks such as MNIST, STLN-10 and CIFAR. This is challenging because new results are published frequently, and it can be hard to keep up. Is there a resource or website which tracks the best results for these tasks?
