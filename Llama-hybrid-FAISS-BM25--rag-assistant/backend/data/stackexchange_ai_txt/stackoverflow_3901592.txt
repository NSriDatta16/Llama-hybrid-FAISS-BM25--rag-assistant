What is the most elegant way in Perl to expand an iterator into a list?

I have an iterator with this interface: $hit->next_hsp The current implementation to listify it is: my @list; while ( my $hsp = $hit->next_hsp ) { push( @list, $hsp ); } Now I'm thinking that there might be better ways to do this in less code. What do you say, stackers?
