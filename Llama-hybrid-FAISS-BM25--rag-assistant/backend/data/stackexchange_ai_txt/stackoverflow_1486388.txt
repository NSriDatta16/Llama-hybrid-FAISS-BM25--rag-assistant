I'm not sure that this is what you're looking for but Etienne Studer has bloged about Confluence TeamCity Integration (it's pretty old but it's hard to be accurate without any informations on the versions you're using): TeamCity provides a widget that displays the status of a given build configuration in an arbitrary web page. With a little help by Kir from JetBrains, I was able to integrate the External Status Widget into Confluence. First, add the following section at the beginning of TeamCity/webapps/ROOT/status/externalStatus.jsp : @import "${pageContext.request.requestURL}/../../css/status/externalStatus.css"; Then, integrate the External Status Widget for the build configurations of interest into Confluence: h1. TeamCity |{html-include:url=http://tc.xy.com/externalStatus.html?buildTypeId=bt77}| |{html-include:url=http://tc.xy.com/externalStatus.html?buildTypeId=bt88}| |{html-include:url=http://tc.xy.com/externalStatus.html?buildTypeId=bt99}| That's it. Another fine feature of TeamCity. In Benares, i.e. TeamCity 3, a link will be available that also includes the CSS information as part of the returned HTML fragment and hence there will be no more need to import the CSS style information separately.
