Known measure to calculate how much a group affected the global average

I'm not a statistical expert but I guess that there's a known measure to calculate which group affects the global average. Example: consider 3 groups: A - avg 80 with 100 samples B - avg 90 with 1 sample C - avg 0 with 1 sample The overall average would be: $(8000 + 90 + 0) / 102 = 79.3$ $A$ should be the most affected group, then $C$ and last comes $B$. In this scenario, I could calculate the difference between the average with vs. without the group for each group and get the results I wanted. E.g. without group $A$ the average will be 45 (almost 35), without group $C$ the average will be 80.099 (~1.7), and without group $B$ the average will be 79.2 (~1.1). But then if I would have another group $D$, which looks like group $A$, (average 80 100 samples) it dramatically drops Group $A$ and Group $B$ to affect like Group $C$. Question: Is this is a good formula? Is there any known formula for that (something with standard deviation, mean, et cetera $\dots$)?
