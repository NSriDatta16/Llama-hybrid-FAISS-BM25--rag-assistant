might i suggest another alternative, with possibly better decoupling: business objects use data objects, and data objects implement storage objects. This should keep the business rules in the business objects but without any dependence on the storage source or format, while allowing the data objects to support whatever manipulations are required, including changing the storage objects dynamically (e.g. for online/offline manipulation) this falls into the second category above (business objects encapsulate data storage objects), but separates data semantics from storage mechanisms more clearly
