You'll need to clarify somewhat what you are talking about here: Do you mean that you want one user's actions to trigger a message to another user? Or is it merely that a user should be messaged because something has changed from the server's perspective? In sending the message, what would you expect to be using? AJAX is an option but there are other ways to send messages back and forth though I would note that AJAX can cause some problems if a user leaves the window open for a long period of time the server recycles its app pool and the session data is lost that the application requires to run properly. Could you please use paragraphs and proper English syntax? Seeing everything in one sentence is mildly confusing and doesn't help you if others are just getting confused trying to understand what you are wanting. Did you exhaustively try multiple AJAX implementations and uses to see if it could do what you wanted? Please list what you tried so that if someone knows what you may have missed this can be acknowledged. Without some answers to these it is hard to give a good answer without making tons of assumptions.
