Magento - Sendfriend Error

I keep getting this Magento error emailed to myself: URL: http://mysite.com/sendfriend/product/send/id/1/ IP Address: 66.249.65.69 Time: 2010-03-19 22:23:03 GMT Error: Front controller reached 100 router match iterations Trace: #0 /var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/httpdocs/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Controller/Varien/Front.php(184): Mage::throwException('Front controlle...') #1 /var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/httpdocs/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/App.php(304): Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Front->dispatch() #2 /var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/httpdocs/app/Mage.php(596): Mage_Core_Model_App->run(Array) #3 /var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/httpdocs/index.php(78): Mage::run('', 'store') #4 {main} The strange thing is that I have disabled the sendfriend module. I have also disallowed /sendfriend/ in robots.txt. Anyone know what could be causing this.
