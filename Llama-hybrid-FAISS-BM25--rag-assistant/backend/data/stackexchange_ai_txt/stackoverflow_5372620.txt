Android Large Image Rotation

I'm trying to rotate images taken with the camera of an Android device at around 5MP. Unfortunately it works only once. After that I get a "not enough memory" exception. Even though I release the former used image it looks like its data still occupy the internal image heap/storage and somehow prevent further rotation operations. Are any good ways known for how to handle this problem (e.g. free image memory, rotate images without needing twice the size in memory)?
