Abstract the retrieval and storage of the books into a class by itself - you don't want that persistence logic intermingled with your business logic. I'd suggest creating an interface called something like "BookStorageDAO" and then you can have various implementations of that interface. One implementation may be to store the books in an ArrayList while another may be to store the books in a Database. In this way, you can utilize the interface in your business logic and swap out the implementation at any time.
