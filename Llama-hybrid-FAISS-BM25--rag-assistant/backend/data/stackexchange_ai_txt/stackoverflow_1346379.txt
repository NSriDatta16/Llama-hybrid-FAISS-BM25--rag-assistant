I think the biggest drawback to using WPF or WinForms is that you will have to program in two programming languages, which is a big logistics overhead. I've seen this type of argument before: use C or C++ for low level, something else for high level. In this case Qt/C++ is as high level as WPF/WinForms, with the benefit of very easy integration of UI to your other C++ code. For spectrograms and other graphs check out Qwt . P.S: WPF is not all the rage on Windows, in fact the market is quite fragmented and WPF is one of the lesser used GUI toolkits. Most of the code out there uses MFC, WTL, Delphi, Win32, etc.
