If you want to add the disabled attribute to the HTML then you would do this: Html.ListBox("Organization", Model.OrgListbox as MultiSelectList, new { disabled = "disabled" }) This calls the overload of Html.ListBox where you can specify htmlAttributes that are added to the rendered HTML. Alternatively you could use jQuery, doing something like this: $("#controlId).attr("disabled","disabled");
