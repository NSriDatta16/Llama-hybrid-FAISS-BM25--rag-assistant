It sounds from your statement,"how can I have 95% belief in anything (you either believe something is true or you don't)," that you have a great deal of confidence in what statistics can tell us. Inherently, I (a proponent of Bayesian methods) ask how much to believe in something, and with new information, I am able to adjust my belief (adjust what I think). To me, belief simply represents how sure I am of the presence of an effect in combination with the totality of previous evidence, with "truth" never being given consideration. For instance, I have an effect size, d, of 0.2 and a CI spanning from 0.004-0.510. How is it you can use this to derive a binary truth? What is your truth here? Is your sense of truth based on hypothetical resampling, from which a fixed but unknown parameter is captured by hypothetical intervals that are hypothetically constructed from the aforementioned resampling that has not actually occurred? In order for that to be the way in which truth is bestowed upon us, you would have to believe it to be so. I believe that to be improbable. Based only on this effect size and interval, I would infer that, although the interval does not span zero, values very close to zero are probable. I would then pick a value based off past evidence to assess the posterior probability of an effect that can be considered important (practical significance). In this case, I would pick 0.2 (common in psychology), which would potentially result in a posterior probability of effect being less than 0.2 as 50 %, whereas there would also be a 50 % posterior probability of the effect being greater than 0.2. Based on this information, I would be very unsure of the importance of the effect, but would also consider the presence of an effect to be probable and worth consideration. For me, this is the appropriate inference based on the effect size and interval and can only be obtained using Bayesian methods. As much as we would like a statistical programming language to give us all the answers, it cannot. We actually have to think and, from what we think, we form beliefs. As such, I would suggest giving serious consideration to the limits of statistical inference and to not be shy about being somewhat sure/unsure of what the truth actually is.
