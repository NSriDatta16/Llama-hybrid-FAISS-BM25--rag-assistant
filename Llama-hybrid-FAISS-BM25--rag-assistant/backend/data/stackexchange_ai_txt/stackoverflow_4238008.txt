The only way I can tell is to query the package source code, e.g.: select text from all_source where UPPER(text) like '%PRAGMA RESTRICT_REFERENCES%' and owner = :owner and name = :package_name and type = 'PACKAGE'; Not totally reliable (this won't pick it up if the pragma definition is split across multiple lines or has an extra space or something).
