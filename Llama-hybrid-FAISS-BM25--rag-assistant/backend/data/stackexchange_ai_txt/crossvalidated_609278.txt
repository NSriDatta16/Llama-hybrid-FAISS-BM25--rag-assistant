So there are a number of issues I have to address here. First off, you should almost never use GCV, as it typically undersmooths and creates overly "wiggly" lines in your GAM (Simpson, 2018). Second, if you use a tensor product term, there is no need to standardize your variables in the model (see Baayen et al., 2017 and Pedersen et al., 2019 for more info on these). I express why standardization is problematic from a practical view in this answer. But by far the biggest issue I see in your model is you have actually modeled most of your variables as parametric coefficients, which means they have no estimated curvilinearity in your regression. In order to estimate main effects as well as the interaction of each variable, you should give each their own spline. I'm assuming what you actually wanted was something like this: mod3 An example of what this is doing is shown here in Baayen et al., 2017 (here they use ti for the main effect splines, but s for main effects is functionally equivalent): This may be partially why your interactions don't match expectation. So you should revise your model to have proper spline terms first, then try to understand what is going on thereafter. Citations Baayen, H., Vasishth, S., Kliegl, R., & Bates, D. (2017).
