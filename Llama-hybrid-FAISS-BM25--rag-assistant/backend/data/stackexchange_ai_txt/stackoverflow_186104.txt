(Almost the same as this question .) From the documentation : Use of NSCalendarDate strongly discouraged. It is not deprecated yet, however it may be in the next major OS release after Mac OS X v10.5. For calendrical calculations, you should use suitable combinations of NSCalendar, NSDate, and NSDateComponents, as described in Calendars in Dates and Times Programming Topics for Cocoa . Following that advice: NSDate *today = [NSDate date]; NSCalendar *gregorian = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar]; NSDateComponents *components = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init]; components.month = 1; NSDate *nextMonth = [gregorian dateByAddingComponents:components toDate:today options:0]; [components release]; NSDateComponents *nextMonthComponents = [gregorian components:NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit fromDate:nextMonth]; NSDateComponents *todayDayComponents = [gregorian components:NSDayCalendarUnit fromDate:today]; nextMonthComponents.day = todayDayComponents.day; NSDate *nextMonthDay = [gregorian dateFromComponents:nextMonthComponents]; [gregorian release]; There may be a more direct or efficient implementation, but this should be accurate and should point in the right direction.
