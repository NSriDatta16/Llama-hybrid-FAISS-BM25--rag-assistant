You might consider using debug_backtrace to obtain information about the function caller, including line, file, class, the current scope, and much much more. This way you don't need to pass any of the line number information into your error logging function. Be aware that generating this information can be somewhat of a drag on performance. You should also consider using an existing logging package, like PEAR's Log , Zend_Log , or Apache log4php .
