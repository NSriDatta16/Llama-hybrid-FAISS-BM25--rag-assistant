Why is e^-alpha

I'm an Education major taking computational statistics. I'm having trouble figuring out how a variable (alpha) distributed as an exponential (lambda = 1) can be expressed as e^-alpha. We're covering the Bayesian approach to estimating densities. My professor's notation is: Let us consider the problem of parameterizing the model in a Bayesian framework, and put indepen- dent exponential (marginal) prior distributions upon the parameters: θ = (α, σ): α ∼ EXP(1) and σ ∼ EXP(1) Which, in his solutions comes out to be: $exp(-\alpha \alpha_0)$ Then it's established that $\alpha_0 = 1$ : $exp(-\alpha)$ Which looks a lot like the PDF for the exponential, but $\alpha$ is used as an argument? That is, $EXP(1) = \lambda exp(-\lambda x)$ let $\lambda = 1$ $EXP(1) = exp(-x)$ let $x = \alpha$ then: $exp(-\alpha)$ It's the last step I don't understand. I'm guessing it might have something to do with conceptualizing parameters as random variables, but I'm not sure why they would be used as an input to the distribution here.
