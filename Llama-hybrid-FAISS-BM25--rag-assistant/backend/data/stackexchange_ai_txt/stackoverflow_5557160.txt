JSON-friendly database?

I have a pure jQuery app that keeps it's objects in JSON format and provides client-side editing. I want to persist the JSON to a database, but everything seems like overkill (like object mapping in C#). I am close to settling on storing the whole JSON string into a single column of a database. I was hoping there was more of an elegant, creative approach like a jQuery/JSON/database framework out there, but couldn't find anything (maybe NoSql can be of use?). Any suggestions or advise on how to persisting JSON to a database using as less server code as possible?
