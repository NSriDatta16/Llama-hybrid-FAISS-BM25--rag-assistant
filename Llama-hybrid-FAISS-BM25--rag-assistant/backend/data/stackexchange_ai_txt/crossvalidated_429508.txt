what I understand is that you know just the number $N_{\rm y}$ of events that occurred in a year time interval $t_{\rm y}$ . From that, you would like to report an estimation of how many events $N_{\rm m}$ occurred in each month time interval $t_{\rm m}$ , and importantly, what is the variability that one would expect for that estimated $N_{\rm m}$ . Answer: The approach would be to estimate the rate $\lambda$ by its maximum likelihood estimator, $\hat{\lambda} = N_{\rm y}/t_{\rm y}$ . If we were talking about a prediction for next month, then assuming that the rate parameter $\lambda$ does not depend on time you can use $\hat{\lambda}$ and obtain $$ \left = N_{\rm y}/12 $$ $$ \textrm{std}(N_{\rm m}) = \sqrt{ N_{\rm y}/12 } $$ However, it doesn't matter if we are dealing with a prediction for next month or a prediction of what already happened but you don't know, so this result is the one you are looking for. Note: if you have a prior knowledge for reasonable values of $\lambda$ , you could go further and use Bayesian statistics, which actually modify the form of $\textrm{std}(N_{\rm m})$ . Why the transformation of variables is not correct? Because in that case you are not dealing with the statistics of the monthly results, you are still dealing with the statistics of a yearly result but you consider that each individual event which counts, instead of as one unit $N=1$ , as $N=1/12$ . In that case you get estimations of the same order for the average, that's clear, but the variability is not the right one for a month. Hope it helps.
