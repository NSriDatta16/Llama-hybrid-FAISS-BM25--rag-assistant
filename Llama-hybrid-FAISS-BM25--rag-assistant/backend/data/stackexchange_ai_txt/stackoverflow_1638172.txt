Issues when moving code from one class into a new class?

I had some decryption code (using wincrypt.h ) that lived within my FileReader.cpp class. I am trying to segregate the code and push this decryption method into a MyCrypt.cpp class. However, upon moving it I'm stuck with a bunch of errors that I wasn't facing before. For every wincrypt.h or windows.h specific command, I am recieving "identifier not found" or "undeclared identifier". What gives! More details.. Sample errors: error C2065: 'HCRYPTPROV' : undeclared identifier error C3861: 'CryptDecrypt': identifier not found I am including windows.h and wincrypt.h, just as I was in FileReader.cpp. #include "MyCrypt.h" #include #include MyCrypt.h is defined as: #pragma once class MyCrypt { public: static char *DecryptMyFile(char *input, char *password, int size, int originalSize) ; private: static const DWORD KEY_LENGTH = 128; } If I rearrange my include files, I get the following errors instead: error C2628: 'MyCrypt' followed by 'char' is illegal (did you forget a ';'?) error C2556: 'MyCrypt *MyCrypt::DecryptMyFile(char *,char *,int,int)' : overloaded function differs only by return type from 'char *MyCrypt::DecryptMyFile(char *,char *,int,int) But nowhere in my code does it use this redefinition it speaks of..
