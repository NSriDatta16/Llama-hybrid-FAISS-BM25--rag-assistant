You haven't presented a precise formulation of "the problem", so it's not exactly clear what you're asking to be proved. From a Bayesian perspective, the posterior probability does depend on all the data. However, each observation of a particular serial number will support that number the most. That is, given any observation $n$ , the odds ratio between posterior and prior will be greater for the hypothesis "the actual number of tanks is $n$ " than it will be for "the actual number of tanks is [number other than $n$ ]". Thus, if we start with a uniform prior, then $n$ will have the highest posterior after seeing that observation. Consider a case where we have the data point $13$ , and hypotheses $N=10,13,15$ . Obviously, the posterior for $N=10$ is zero. And our posteriors for $N=13,15$ will be larger than their prior. The reason for this is that in Bayesian reasoning, absence of evidence is evidence of absence. Any time we have an opportunity where we could have made an observation that would have decreased our probability, but don't, the probability increases. Since we could have seen $16$ , which would have set our posteriors for $N=13,15$ to zero, the fact that we didn't see it means that we should increase our posteriors for $N=13,15$ . But note that the smaller the number, the more numbers we could have seen that would have excluded that number. For $N=13$ , we would have rejected that hypothesis after seeing $14,15,16,...$ . But for $N=15$ , we would have needed at least $16$ to reject the hypothesis. Since the hypothesis $N=13$ is more falsifiable than $N=15$ , the fact that we didn't falsify $N=13$ is more evidence for $N=13$ , than not falsifying $N=15$ is evidence for $N=15$ . So every time we see a data point, it sets the posterior of everything below it to zero, and increases the posterior of everything else, with smaller numbers getting the largest boost. Thus, the number that gets the overall largest boost will be the smallest number whose posterior wasn't set to zero, i.e. the maximum value of the observations. Numbers less than the maximum affect how much larger a boost the maximum gets, but it doesn't affect the general trend of the maximum getting largest boost. Consider the above example, where we've already seen $13$ . If the next number we see is $5$ , what effect will that have? It helps out $5$ more than $6$ , but both numbers have already been rejected, so that's not relevant. It helps out $13$ more than $15$ , but $13$ already has been helped out more than $15$ , so that doesn't affect which number has been helped out the most.
