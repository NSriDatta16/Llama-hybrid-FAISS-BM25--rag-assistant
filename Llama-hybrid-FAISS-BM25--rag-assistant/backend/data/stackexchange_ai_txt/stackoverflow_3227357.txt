One easy way to draw a circle on a panel is to inherit from Panel and override the OnPaint method. In this method you would call DrawEllipse on the Graphics object gotten from the event args. On point of interest is that the size is set to Width-1 and Height-1. This stops the right and bottom of the circle from dissapearing out of the Panel control. One enhancement I have put in this code is to constrain the width & height in the OnResize method, this ensures your panel is always a circle, in oppose to an Ellipse (which can have different width and height). Simply drag this control onto a windows form and have a play in the designer. public class CirclePanel : Panel { public CirclePanel() { } protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e) { Graphics g = e.Graphics; g.DrawEllipse(Pens.Black, 0,0,this.Width-1,this.Height-1); } protected override void OnResize(EventArgs e) { this.Width = this.Height; base.OnResize(e); } }
