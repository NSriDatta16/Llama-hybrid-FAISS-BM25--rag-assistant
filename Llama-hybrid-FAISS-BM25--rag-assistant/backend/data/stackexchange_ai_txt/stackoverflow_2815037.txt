WP plugin based on useragent

I am writing a plugin which does some js stuff, but does not work for other browsers than FF . I've thought why not execute the plugin for the browsers which support it. I've added the code, but for some reason when I activate the plugin and check the site with a FF all I get is blank page. If I visit with a IE the site is shown correctly. Basically my code is like this $agent= strtolower($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']); if (preg_match('/firefox/',$agent)){ include(plugins_url('script.js', FILE )); some more code } So when I visit with FF I get blank page, when I visit with IE the blog loads normally
