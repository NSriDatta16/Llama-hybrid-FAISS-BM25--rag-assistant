Here are some reference for you: Primary & foreign key Constraint. Primary Key: A primary key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identify a record in a table, so that an individual record can be located without confusion. Foreign Key: A foreign key (sometimes called a referencing key) is a key used to link two tables together. Typically you take the primary key field from one table and insert it into the other table where it becomes a foreign key (it remains a primary key in the original table). Index , on the other hand, is an attribute that you can apply on some columns so that the data retrieval done on those columns can be speed up.
