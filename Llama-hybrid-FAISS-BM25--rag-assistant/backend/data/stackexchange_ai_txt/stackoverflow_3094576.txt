Debugging python using Textmate?

I'd like to use TextMate for debugging python scripts. I'm looking for suggestions on the best way to accomplish this. I found these "solutions" -- is there a better approach? http://www.libertypages.com/clarktech/?p=192 Using Python 3.1 with TextMate I'd really like to find something as usable as the Eclipse PyDev plugin, if at all possible, with these key features: current debug line selected in TextMate variable inspection in TextMate debug commands as buttons in TextMate (step, stop, ...) customizable PYTHONPATH and/or launch script per project The last feature is to support my app engine testing, where I frequently launch a python shell by python2.5 appengine_console.py my-app-id localhost:8080 Finally, I am open to writing a plugin as a last resort if it is possible to achieve good integration. If you suggest custom development and have pointers on to assess the effort and get started, please include that in your answer. Thanks!
