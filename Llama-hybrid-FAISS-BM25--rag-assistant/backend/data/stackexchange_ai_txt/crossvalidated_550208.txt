Stationary Time Series with Limited Data

I have a time series that's stationary with only 42 data points. What I'm trying to do is predict the month. I have several variables, but these variables show little to no correlation with the label I'm trying to predict. Here's how my plot looks when I plot the year-month vs the label: I've tried several models: Moving average, weighted moving average, ARIMA, and some neural networks. But I can't seem to find a good fit for this data. How do I go about having the best time series for this type of data in order to have good forecast results?
