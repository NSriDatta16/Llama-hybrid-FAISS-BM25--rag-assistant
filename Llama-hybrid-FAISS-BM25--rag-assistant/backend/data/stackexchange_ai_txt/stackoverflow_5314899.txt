Google Analytics iPhone SDK (dispatchPeriod)

Greetings, I've been wrestling with Google analytics for iPhone for a bit and I'm noticing the 10 second dispatchPeriod is being ignored. All the events I'm tracking are coming through just fine on the google analytics site however I believe the only the time the data is uploaded is when the app is restarted. I was hoping the dispatch schedule would take care of any queued up events. I start my tracker like so: -(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { NSLog(@"App Delegate: applicationDidFinishLaunching"); [[GANTracker sharedTracker] startTrackerWithAccountID:@"UA-xxxxxxx-x" dispatchPeriod:10 delegate:self]; NSError *error; if (![[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackEvent:[[[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary] objectForKey:@"CFBundleIdentifier"] action:@"launch" label:[[[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary] objectForKey:@"CFBundleIdentifier"] value:-1 withError:&error]) { NSLog(@"GANTracker - %@", [error localizedDescription]); } [window addSubview:self.navigationController.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } -(void)trackerDispatchDidComplete:(GANTracker *)tracker eventsDispatched:(NSUInteger)eventsDispatched eventsFailedDispatch:(NSUInteger)eventsFailedDispatch { //The delegate method only gets called once at launch NSLog(@"Google Analytics: Events Dispatched = %i | Events Failed Dispatched = %i", eve ntsDispatched, eventsFailedDispatch); } and I track events like so: if (![[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackEvent:@"preview" action:@"preview" label:@"preview" value:-1 withError:&error]) { NSLog(@"GANTracker - %@", [error localizedDescription]); }
