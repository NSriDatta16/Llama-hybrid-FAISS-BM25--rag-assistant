rough elasticity estimates of homogeneous products

Let us say I am using a log log model to estimate the own price elasticity of a product given the unit demand data for different prices. I think this is acceptable as it is done by many practicioners. Let us also say that I combine the price and demand data of several homogeneous products by taking the weighted average of the price using demand in units and keeping the demand in units. I then fit a log log model given this data to obtain the own price elasticities. Would the results represent a rough estimate for the average own price elasticity of the combined product? Thanks.
