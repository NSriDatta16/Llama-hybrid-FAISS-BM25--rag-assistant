CCNET reports build failure with no reason

We use CCNET 1.4.4.83 on Win 2003 SP2. A few days ago CCNET started to report build failures with no specific reason. The project contains a single exec task which runs build.bat . The batch does all the job (msbuild, fxcop, db scripts, tests) but in the server log i can see that not all the commands were executed from build.bat . It looks like something kills the process in the middle but i'm sure it's not timeout issue. I tried to disable anti-virus software - no luck. The service is running under a local admin account. If i run build.bat manually on the CCNET machine it always succeeds. Here is the log fragment: 2009-11-10 11:26:48,584 [288:DEBUG] [trunk C:\integration\trunk\src\build.bat] 60 Warning(s) 2009-11-10 11:26:48,584 [288:DEBUG] [trunk C:\integration\trunk\src\build.bat] 0 Error(s) 2009-11-10 11:26:48,584 [288:DEBUG] [trunk C:\integration\trunk\src\build.bat] 2009-11-10 11:26:48,584 [288:DEBUG] [trunk C:\integration\trunk\src\build.bat] Time Elapsed 00:00:23.73 2009-11-10 11:26:48,724 [trunk:INFO] Task execution failed 2009-11-10 11:26:48,724 [trunk:INFO] Task output: -- the batch output here-- 2009-11-10 11:26:48,803 [trunk:INFO] Merging file: c:\integration\trunk\Artifacts\Tests1.xml 2009-11-10 11:26:48,803 [trunk:INFO] Merging file: c:\integration\trunk\Artifacts\FxCop.xml 2009-11-10 11:26:48,803 [trunk:WARN] File not Found: c:\integration\trunk\Artifacts\FxCop.xml 2009-11-10 11:26:49,428 [trunk:INFO] Emailing "trunk Build Failed" to .... 2009-11-10 11:26:55,506 [trunk:INFO] Integration complete: Failure - 10/11/2009 11:26:48 Any ideas to where to look at would be appreciated!!
