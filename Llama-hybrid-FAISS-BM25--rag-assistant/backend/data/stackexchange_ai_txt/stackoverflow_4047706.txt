While KeithS' answer as pretty much correct, it can be easier and more elegant than you think. If you can collect a dumpfile (instead of just a stack trace), you can use a Symbol Server and Source Server in combination with your debugger to automatically pull your correct-version code from source control. For example: if you enable PDB output and source-server integration in MSBuild, and upload the resulting PDBs to a symbol server, Visual Studio can automatically load the correct source control from a TFS or SourceSafe repository based on the information in a minidump.
