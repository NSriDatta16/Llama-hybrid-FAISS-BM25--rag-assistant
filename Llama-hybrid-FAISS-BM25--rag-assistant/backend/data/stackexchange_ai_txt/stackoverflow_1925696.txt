Implement INotifyProperty changed on Static Property in WPF and Silverlight

The question is how to implement INotifyPropertyChanged on a static property because the event you implement is not static, and cannot be called by a static property. Also, you cannot bind to a static property in Silverlight. I've seen this question pop up an a few forums with a variety of solutions, none of which were very satisfying. Well, I think I've found an elegant solution, but it's so simple I feel like I must be missing something. The answer is, to write a non-static property that accesses a static variable like so: private static double length; public double Length { get { return length; } set { length = value; NotifyPropertyChanged("Length"); } } I've tested it and it seems to work just fine. Am I missing something?
