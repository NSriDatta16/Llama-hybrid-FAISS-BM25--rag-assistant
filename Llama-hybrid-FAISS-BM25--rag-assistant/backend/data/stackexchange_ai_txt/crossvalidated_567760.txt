This is precisely because the full conditional distribution of $\lambda$ is missing its Jacobian term. You've assigned a normal distribution on $y_i^*(\lambda) = \frac{y_i^\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ , whereas your full conditional distribution is expressed in terms of $y_i$ , not $y_i^*(\lambda)$ . Therefore, you should multiply the following Jacobian: $$ \mathrm{d}y_i^* = y_i^{\lambda-1}\,\mathrm{d}y_i \Rightarrow \mathcal{J}(y^*\to y)=\prod_{i=1}^n y_i^{\lambda-1}. $$ See Kim, S., Chen, M.-H., Ibrahim, J.G., Shah, A.K. and Lin, J.
