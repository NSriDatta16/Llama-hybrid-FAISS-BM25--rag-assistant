How does skewed data affect deep neural networks?

I'm playing around with deep neural networks for a regression problem. The dataset I have is skewed right and for a linear regression model, I would typically perform a log transform. Should I be applying the same practice to a DNN? Specifically, I'm curious how skewed data affects regression with a DNN and, if it's negatively, are the same methods that would be applied to a linear regression model the right way to go about fixing it? I couldn't find any research articles about it but if you know of any feel free to link them in your answer!
