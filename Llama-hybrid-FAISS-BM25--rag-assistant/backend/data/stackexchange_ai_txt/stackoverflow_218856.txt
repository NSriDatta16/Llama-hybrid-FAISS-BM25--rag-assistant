When you say "how c++ new standards facilitate" concurrent programming, I assume you're talking about the soon (?) to be released C++09 standard. The new standard as it currently stands in draft form supports the following items that help with concurrent programming: atomic types and addresses a thread class thread_local storage (which was just added into the draft standard a few months ago) mutual exclusion (mutex classes) condition variables - this is particularly nice for Windows, since condition variables are difficult to implement correctly in Win32. This means that eventually Microsoft should provide support for condition variables at least in the MSVC++ runtime, so it will be easy to get correct condition variable semantics on WIn32.
