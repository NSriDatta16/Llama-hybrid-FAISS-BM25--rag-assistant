One can detect the number of trends and their length via Intervention Detection. This is done by simply expanding the kinds of Intervention Series to include Pulses , Level/step Shifts and Time Trends. In addition there could be needed ARIMA structure. One needs to control for and allow changes in ARIMA parameters over time and changes in the error variance over time. It is prudent to allow the data to speak to these forms rather than assume a structure/ Estimation does not overcome Model Specification Bias. You can find out more about Intervention Detection here . We have been able to routinely implement the detection of the length and the timing of time trends , each with their own slope and duration length. Time series analysis: Determine if trend is deterministic fluctuating/stable or stochastic is a quick read ...with @Aksakal contributing salient reflections.
