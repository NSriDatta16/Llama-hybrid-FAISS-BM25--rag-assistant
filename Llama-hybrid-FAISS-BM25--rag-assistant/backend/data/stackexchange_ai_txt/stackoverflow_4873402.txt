If you're selecting n/2 individuals from your population in every generation, you will eventually reach a point where you have a population of 1. What you want to do in addition to selection is create new members for your next generation using mutation or crossover, generally on those that were victors in the tournament. So, for each generation, you have a population of size n - you reduce this to n/2 through your selection, and then those n/2 members reproduce and/or mutate to produce roughly n/2 more members for your next generation (which, on average, will be 'fitter' than those that didn't progress from the previous generation).
