Logistic regression as a special case of softmax regression

I was looking at logistic regression and softmax regression. Based on this formula, $P(y=j|\mathbf {x} )={\frac {e^{\mathbf {x} ^{\mathsf {T}}\mathbf {w} _{j}}}{\sum _{k=1}^{K}e^{\mathbf {x} ^{\mathsf {T}}\mathbf {w} _{k}}}}$ How does $k=2$ make it logistic regression? I cannot seem to derive this to this $\sigma (t)={\frac {e^{t}}{e^{t}+1}}={\frac {1}{1+e^{-t}}}$
