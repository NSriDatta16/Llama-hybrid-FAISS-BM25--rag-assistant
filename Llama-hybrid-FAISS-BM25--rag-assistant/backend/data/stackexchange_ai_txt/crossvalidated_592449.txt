Remember that failing to reject the null hypothesis is NOT accepting the null hypothesis. The Shapiro-Wilk test is a test of the null hypothesis of normality. The power of a test is in part a function of sample size. Therefore, if you have few observations, you're unlikely to be able to reject the null (although there are some caveats to this I won't go into) as the test is not well-powered to detect small departures from normality. The main takeaway being the test is not very useful when you have very little data. However, the test is ALSO not very useful when you have lots of data! Imagine you have infinite data but you distribution is only a tiny bit different from what you'd expect of a normal distribution. The test will give you a p-value pretty much at 0 indicating non-normality. But of course, that's not very useful -- your test told you it's not normal, but what you really care about is just how not normal is it . The test won't get you there. This is a general feature of "testing" assumptions using point nulls. You seem to think the data being normal is the Gauss-Markov assumption. That is decidedly not the case! See the first two paragraphs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem Even if it was, the assumption is not about the data -- it's about the error term. Note that the error term is NOT the model residual. The error term is something you do not observe. The residual is specific to your model. The Gamma distribution might better fit your data, but model fit statistics can be not-so-great. Ideally you'd be able to test on out-of-sample prediction with some more data not used to train your model. More generally, the Gamma distribution is bounded from below by 0: i.e. it only has support on $(0,\inf)$ . If you data can EVER be negative, then it would be quite silly to use that likelihood since you would be using a model that cannot possibly produce the population data, even if it fits your sample well enough.
