Silly question. It all depends on the compiler and what it does for optimization. Even if it did work what have you gained? Way to obfuscate your code? Variable access is usually done via a pointer and and offset. Pointer to Object + offset Pointer to Stack Frame + offset Also don't forget to add in the cost of moving the variables to local storage and then copying the results back. All of which could be meaning less as the compiler may be smart enough to optimize most of it away anyway.
