Question on Browser Independant Multi-Column Text Paragraph Flower. (Works in IE8 IE9)

Some time ago, there was a question about CSS3 multi-columns not being supported in IE9, or any other IE for that matter. That produced the following quick simple and very functional answer. I want to brush on that and improve it as it has flaw that the bottom line is not justified. Can you see whats missing from making the bottom text line justified too? Actually, the coolest thing woulld be to make it sense when there is LESS than half a sentence on any given line, followed by a dot, not to justify that line. Sothat the next paragraph is more nicely visible. What do you think of that? Or perhaps you have better ideas to improve this browser-independant multi-column script? Live Test Result url var text=document.getElementById('text').innerHTML; var words=text.split(" "); var wordc=words.length; var length=words.join("").length; var cols= new Array("","",""); var colc= new Array(0,0,0); var col=0; for(var i=0; i length/3)col++; } document.getElementById('text').innerHTML=" "+cols[0]+" "+cols[1]+" "+cols[2]+" ";
