Here's a simple approach, which may be about as good, or not (but see caveat in last paragraph), as your linear interpolation. Let $C$ be the m by m covariance matrix of $\sigma$ values at the m $E_i$ 's. Let $A$ be the n by m matrix which produces the n interpolated points from the m $E_i$ 's. So for instance if the first interpolated point is 25% of the way from $E_1$ to $E_2$, the first row of $A$ would be [0.75 0.25 0 .... 0] . Given your interpolation scheme, $A$ will be a bi-diagonal matrix. Then the covariance matrix of $\sigma$ at the interpolated points is taken as $ACA^T$. One consequence, howwever, is that there will be non-zero off-diagonal covariances in $ACA^T$, even if the original covariance matrix $C$ has no non-zero off-diagonal covariances. If this is unacceptable, you may need an approach more specific to the "physics" of your problem.
