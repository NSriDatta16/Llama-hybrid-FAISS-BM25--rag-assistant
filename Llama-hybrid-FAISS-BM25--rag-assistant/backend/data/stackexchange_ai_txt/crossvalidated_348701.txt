Well, this may be a different way of thinking about your problem, but what if you exploit the fact that: 200 = fx200 where f = 1 400 = fx200 where f = 2 600 = fx200 where f = 3 800 = fx200 where f = 4? If I understand your problem correctly, each of your subjects will have to choose 8 different times among the set of 4 options {1x200, 2x200, 3x200, 4x200} and you are interested in summarizing the resulting information across these 8 times. Each time a subject chooses an option, all the information you need to fully specify that option is the multiplicative factor f. As an example, subject #1 might make the following choices of f: 1st time: f = 1 2nd time: f = 3 3rd time: f = 1 4th time: f = 2 5th time: f = 2 6th time: f = 4 7th time: f = 1 8th time: f = 3 So if you wanted to summarize the information corresponding to this subject, you could do it in a variety of ways, including: Typical value of f across the 8 repetitions (i.e., the average of the 8 values of f provided by the subject) - this gives you information about the typical estimate of time chosen by the subject; Number of times subject chooses a specific f value across the 8 repetitions (e.g., number of time subject chooses f = 4 - that is, the highest estimate of time - across the 8 repetitions); Number of times subject chooses a specific set of f values across the 8 repetitions (e.g., number of times subject chooses f = 3 or f = 4 - that is, the higher estimates of time - across the 8 repetitions). I hope someone else on this forum will read my answer and confirm whether what I propose makes sense. Again, this answer assumes you are interested in summarizing information for each subject across 8 repetitions.
