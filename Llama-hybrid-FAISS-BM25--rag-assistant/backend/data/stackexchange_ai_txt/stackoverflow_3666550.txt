Resolving relative paths outside the standard directories (applicationDirectory, desktopDirectory, etc)

I need to navigate to a file relative to my applicationDirectory, but as it says in the documentation: No ".." reference that reaches the file system root or the application-persistent storage root passes that node; it is ignored. But the crazy thing is that if I do something like File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath("/home/myHome/"); I can get anywhere in the filesystem. My question is: is there a workaround to navigate from my applicationDirectory to a relative path like "../../my.cfg" ?? (I need to read a config file generated by a different application)
