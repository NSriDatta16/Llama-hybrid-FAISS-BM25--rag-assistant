There's one special case: downsizing JPG's by more than a factor of 8. A direct factor of 8 rescale can be done on the raw JPG data, without decompressing it. JPG's are stored as compressed blocks of 8x8 pixels, with the average pixel value first. As a result, it typically takes more time to read the file from disk or the network than it takes to downscale it.
