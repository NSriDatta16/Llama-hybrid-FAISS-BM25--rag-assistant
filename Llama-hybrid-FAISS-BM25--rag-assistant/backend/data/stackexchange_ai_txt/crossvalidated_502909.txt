The G-test has become a favorite of mine for proportion testing. ;) The way it works is by fitting a (multinomial) logistic regression model with a factor variable as a predictor, plus an intercept. Then it fits an intercept-only model. Finally, it performs a likelihood ratio test of the factor variable by comparing the two models. (I have verified this with simulations in R, and I would encourage skeptical readers to do the same.) If you want to do something similar but for a continuous predictor, fit a model with that predictor (and intercept), fit a model with just the intercept, and perform a likelihood ratio test.
