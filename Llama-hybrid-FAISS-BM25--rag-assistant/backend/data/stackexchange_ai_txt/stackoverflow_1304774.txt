Where's the difference between UIControlEventTouchDragOutside and UIControlEventTouchDragExit?

Both appear to have the exact same effect. They come both when the finger is far enough away from the control. The "bounds" is not really the criteria for UIControlEventTouchDragExit. It gets fired only if it's far away enough...
