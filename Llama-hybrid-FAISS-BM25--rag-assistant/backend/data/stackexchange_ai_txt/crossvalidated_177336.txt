Work order completion time is exponentially distributed

I have a work order system that serves the operational needs of a big organization. It has tickets and it gets completed in x days (0 I have a hard time wrapping my head around it. My understanding of exponential distribution is "time between events in a poisson process". Why does this data fit in exponential distribution ? What would be the underlying poisson process ? Is there a rule of thumb to just look at the problem description and conclude its exponential ?
