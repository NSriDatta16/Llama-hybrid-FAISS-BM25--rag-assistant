Is it possible to optimize the Client Lifetime Value with Reinforcement Learning using Marketing Activities as Actions?

I have been researching the Reinforcement Learning topic. I have been looking if this is the correct way to optimize the marketing actions of my company given that we are looking to optimize the Client's Lifetime Value. So far I have found this: The environment is the real-life o.O Agent is our company The rewards/values can be matched to the CLV itself, meaning that any action could lead to improve or worsen the CLV The actions are the possible marketing and non-marketing actions that could be: offer product A, B, invite the client to download our app, not-doing anything, and so on. The state could be the actual portfolio, previous actions, etc My main worry is that some actions do not lead immediately to improve the CLV. For instance, making our clients download the app could lead to improvement in the CLV but it is not immediate, or even traceable, but this download could lead to having a better probability of acceptance for the products. We have the probability of acceptance for the products. Will a RL model be capable of help us improve our decisions? (Any more information which I did not specified, please let me know)
