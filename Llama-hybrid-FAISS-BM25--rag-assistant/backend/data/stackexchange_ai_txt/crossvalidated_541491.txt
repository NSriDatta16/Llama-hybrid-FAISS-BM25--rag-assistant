I think that the issue here is whether the likelihood that is used to turn a Bayesian prior into a Bayesian posterior has a Bayesian interpretation, or whether it is necessarily a long-run frequency. IF that is the question, then I would say "yes", of course it does. If we have a Bernoulli likelihood then $f(k;\theta) = \theta^k(1-\theta)^{1-k}$ for $k \in \{0,1\}$ , where $\theta$ is a parameter, with unknown "true" probability $c$ . Now I would regard $c$ as a "physical probability" (IIRC Good uses that term as well). If we are talking about macroscopic objects, like coins, then there is no such thing as "randomness". Whether a coin comes down heads of tails is entirely deteministic. The only reason we can't know whether it comes down heads or tails is that we don't have perfect knowledge of the initial condtions. So a "physical probability" is basically summarising appearance of randomness that are caused by that lack of knowledge. It is important to distinguish physical probabilities from either Bayesian probabilities or frequentist ones. It distinct from frequentist probabilities because the long run frequency normally stems directly from the physical probability being (assumed to be) the same for all possible trials. However, they are not directly equivalent. The physical probability is directly the probability that a particular coin flip will come up heads, because it describes the physics that makes that so. A frequentist probability, as a long-run frequency can't be applied to a particular coin flip (as it has no long run frequency, it happens only once). It can only make a probabilistic statement about a (fictitious) population of coin flips, of which this can be considered a particular sample. Note that something that can only ever happen at most once can have a physical probability of happening, but it can't have a long run frequency. A physical probability isn't a Bayesian probability either. Bayesian probabilities represent our beliefs (subjective or objective) about the plausibility of different values of that physical probability. The Bayesian is making a probabilistic model of the physics, it isn't the physics itself. So for me, I would view $f(k;c)$ as neither Bayesian nor frequentist, or perhaps both, but a statement about the physics of the date generating process. It is equally true for single observations, or when looking at a long run of observations. So in this case, to get our posterior, we would say $$p(\theta|X=1) = \frac{P(x=1;\theta)p(\theta)}{P(X=1)}$$ Note that $c$ does not appear anywhere in our inference to obtain our posterior belief, which is why I think the question as posed is essentially meaningless. Of course we could look at our posterior to evaluate $p(c|X=1)$ , but this would just give us the point probability of the model parameter, $\theta$ , being the same numeric value as the true "physical" probability. As this is evaluating a specific point on a continuous distribution, it is just a density, not an actual probability. Probably not very useful. At the end of the day, it is a very badly posed question, but that seems to be the most meaningful answer I can give to the most informative intepretation that is reasonably consistent with the question as posed.
