Important takeaways for analysts: Categorizing a continuous predictor will always result in a loss of information "A lot of zeroes" is not 0 inflation, regardless of skew. I can find a negative binomial parametrization that can generate an arbitrary proportion of zeroes and an arbitrarily high maximum. 0 inflation is a theoretical process, like getting input from a broken Geiger counter: you have to know what's going on in the data The usual way of handling real zero inflation is with a mixture model Be especially cautious of truncation... that is when the instrument is not sensitive to detect values below a lower limit of detection and the result comes out to 0. An EM algorithm or Bayesian approach is needed Zero-inflated Poisson is the most frequently cited zero-inflated model. It uses a mixture model for the 0s, and the Poisson GLM for the "non-zero part" (a misnomer because some of the positive-mean values may be 0) You can have a zero-inflated "anything" model by using an EM fitter to iteratively predict the 0s that are 0-inflated and the effects for the non-0-inflated part A Poisson GLM is completely reasonable for a continuous response provided: a) the log of the mean response is related to a linear combination of regressors and b) the variance is equal to the mean. But I gather this almost certainly not what you would have done, I think you were distracted by the oft cited 0 inflated Poisson model.
