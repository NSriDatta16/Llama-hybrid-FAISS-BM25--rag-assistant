Just remember, having "100% code-coverage" doesn't mean everything is tested completely - while it means every line of code is tested, it doesn't mean they are tested under every (common) situation.. I would use code-coverage to highlight bits of code that I should probably write tests for. For example, if whatever code-coverage tool shows myImportantFunction() isn't executed while running my current unit-tests, they should probably be improved. Basically, 100% code-coverage doesn't mean your code is perfect. Use it as a guide to write more comprehensive (unit-)tests.
