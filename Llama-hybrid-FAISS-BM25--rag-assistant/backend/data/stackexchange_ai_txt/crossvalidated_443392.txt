Can a deep learning model learn to understand/interpret the logical sentences?

I don't know what the development in NLP has gone so far. I'm curious about whether my machine can answer me following question? "Today is Sunday. I'll finish my project in two days. What will be day of week when I finish my Project?" So, as a human beings, we can understand and interpret this question right? Clearly the answer should be "Tuesday". But can a trained deep model answer such questions? If there is any such open source chatbot developed, then can anyone mention it please? Or, please mention which is a very good Open Source project using NLP?
