If you have objects then use if (f instanceof Double) { } Another interesting thing is method isAssignableFrom: if (f.getClass().isAssignableFrom (Double.class)) { } But in general it's a bad style. Use polymorphism to implement logic which depends on class types. Answer for comment: f instanceof Double works fine. You probably wrote something like this: float f = 1.1f; if (f instanceof Double) { ..} And smart java compiler says that you've got CE. BUT: public static boolean isInstanceOfDouble (Object obj) { return obj instanceof Double; } psvm (String [] args) { sout (isInstanceOfDouble (1.1f); } ..this works fine
