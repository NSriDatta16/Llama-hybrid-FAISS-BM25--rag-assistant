A custom dictionary, as you probably know, is just a text file containing the words, so reference the Microsoft Scripting Runtime, and use: Dim FSO As New FileSystemObject, FS As TextStream Dim Code As String, Codes As New Scripting.Dictionary Dim Paragraph As Paragraph, Word As Range Set FS = FSO.OpenTextFile("c:\...\cust.dic") Do Until FS.AtEndOfStream Code = FS.ReadLine If Not Codes.Exists(Code) Then Codes.Add Key:=Code, Item:=Nothing Loop ' Use your own method for enumerating words For Each Paragraph In ActiveDocument.Paragraphs Set Word = Paragraph.Range Word.MoveEnd WdUnits.wdCharacter, -1 If Not Codes.Exists(Word.Text) Then Word.Font.Underline = wdUnderlineWavy Word.Font.UnderlineColor = wdColorBlue Else Word.Font.Underline = wdUnderlineNone Word.Font.UnderlineColor = wdColorAutomatic End If Next Not ideal, because it clobbers underlining formatting, and doesn't provide a mechanism for suggestions (although a small form built around a listbox would suffice). The best solution would involve extending the spelling engine, unfortunately.
