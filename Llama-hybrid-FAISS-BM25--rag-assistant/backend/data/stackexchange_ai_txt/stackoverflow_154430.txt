Persistent storage of encrypted data using .Net

I need to store encrypted data (few small strings) between application runs. I do not want the user to provide a passphrase every time (s)he launches the application. I.e. after all it goes down to storing securely the encryption key(s). I was looking into RSACryptoServiceProvider and using PersistentKeyInCsp, but I'm not sure how it works. Is the key container persistent between application runs or machine restarts? If yes, is it user specific, or machine specific. I.e. if I store my encrypted data in user's roaming profile, can I decrypt the data if the user logs on a different machine? If the above does not work, what are my options (I need to deal with roaming profiles).
