I would like to see a test where you output something from your collections to see if you are seeing what you think you should see. Actually why not write a proper unit test? You are passing a lot of collections around by value. This can be quite expensive, but in addition, you may be updating something that is a copy of what you think you are actually updating, and then not seeing the results in the original. I would not pay too much attention to values in Visual Studio's "watch" window, particularly if you are running an optimised build.
