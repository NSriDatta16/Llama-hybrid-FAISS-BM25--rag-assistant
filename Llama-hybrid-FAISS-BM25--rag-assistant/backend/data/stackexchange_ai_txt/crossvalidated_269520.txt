Instead of clustering, look at statistics . Clustering is too fragile, don't use it for automation. The usual approach would be to take the mean and standard deviation, and then remove values outside of three standard deviations from the mean. Depending on your data, you may also want to use more than three, and if you have very noisy data, the median and MAD can work more reliable.
