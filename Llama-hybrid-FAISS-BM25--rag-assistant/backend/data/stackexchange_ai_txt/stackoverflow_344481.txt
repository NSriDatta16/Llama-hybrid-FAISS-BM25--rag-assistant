Unfortunately no, until they sort out, at the least, the following issue: When you visit a site that needs Flash and you haven't got Flash installed, you get a very standard looking popup asking you if you to install it, and mentioning in the notes that it may not be safe to install an untrusted plugin. When you visit a site that lets you download an AIR app, it pops up big red screaming warnings about the imminent trashing of your computer, the theft of your identity and a life of torment[1]. Unless, of course, all the bedroom programmers decide to cough up the ongoing cost of certification. User encouragement FAIL. Hobby developer encouragement FAIL. Technophobe terrorficiation avoidance FAIL. I love AIR, but I don't know what they were thinking with the installer. Laywers' office moved closer to the developers' over at HQ or something? [1]Actual message may vary.
