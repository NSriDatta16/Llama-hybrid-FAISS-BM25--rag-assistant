Convert an Integer to a string of words

Possible Duplicate: C# Convert Integers into Written Numbers I need to take an integer value and convert it to its english word equivalent (i.e. 4 => "four", 1879 => "one thousand, eight hundred seventy-nine") in .NET (3.5 to be specific). I'm wondering if there is anything built into the .NET framework for making such a conversion. Seems like it would be useful enough to belong there. I haven't been able to find anything to do the job. If it isn't included in the framework anywhere, does anyone have any ideas more elegant than a digit/place specific lookup?
