How to create indexes on multiple columns

We have the following entity relationships where a User belongs to a particular Organization. My queries either look like "select * from User where org=:org" or "select * from User where org=:org and type=:type" I have separate indexes on the User class. The first query will be fine, because of the Index on the foreign key element. Does the second query mandate a multi columnindex on org and type columns. If so how should I annotate to create one such index. @Entity class User { ... @ManyToOne @ForeignKey @Index Organization org; @Index Type type; ... }
