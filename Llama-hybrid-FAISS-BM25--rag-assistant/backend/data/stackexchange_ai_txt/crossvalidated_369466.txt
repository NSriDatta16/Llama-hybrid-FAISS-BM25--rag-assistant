Data set splitting for statistical inference?

probably a very basic question -- I am modelling companies' decisions on which mode of payment they use in M&A deals with a help of logit model. I am so far interested only in what variables are statistically significant, I am not trying to create a model for predictions so far. Is there any use for train, validation and test data sets in statistical inference or are they of use only for machine learning (predictions)? Thank you, Adam
