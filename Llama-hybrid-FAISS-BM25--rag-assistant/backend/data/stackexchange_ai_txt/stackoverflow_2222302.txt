Blackberry market share by OS

I'm looking to develop a Blackberry app with storage. Since most of my data is structured, I was looking at using SQLite for storage. Since this is only supported by devices running OS v5.0 or higher, I was wondering if there was a significant portion of B'Berry market running v4.xx OSes. Can anyone provide a breakdown of their market share? Is getting this stat even possible? Thanks, Teja.
