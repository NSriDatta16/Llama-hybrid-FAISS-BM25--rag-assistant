Organisation of data on the stack in C?

I am learning C language and have some questions. When we declare a variable such as int i = 0 . the i has the address in stack, right? I am wondering how a function is organized in memory. For instance, I have a function as: int myF() { int x = 2, y = 3; int z = x + y; return x; } How is this method organized in the stack? I mean the name " myF " has a memory address too like other varialbes? And " myF " should have something like ending address to indicate where is the end of the function? Am I wrong? Thanks a lot.
