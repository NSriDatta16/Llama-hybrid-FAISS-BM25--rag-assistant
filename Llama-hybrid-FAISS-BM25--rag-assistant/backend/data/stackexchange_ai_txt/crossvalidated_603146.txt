The "whole point of the VAE training process" is to find an approximation to $p(z|x)$ [find the encoder] and to maximize $p(x|z)$ given the data [find the decoder]. In the original paper, they give 2 possibilities for the likelihood - either a Gaussian for continuous data, or Bernoulli for discrete data. E.g., Gaussian for images with a range of pixel value, and Bernoulli for 1-bit images (pixel is either black or white). [In practice you can also use Binary Cross Entropy (the negative log likelihood of Bernoulli distribution) also on grayscale images.] As mentioned in appendix: The "reparameterization trick" is used in the encoder, on $q(z|x)$ , it's not related to the way you transform $z$ into $p(x|z)$ . Both Gaussian and Bernoulli are simple distributions . Not functions. The way you get to their parameters can be very complex.
