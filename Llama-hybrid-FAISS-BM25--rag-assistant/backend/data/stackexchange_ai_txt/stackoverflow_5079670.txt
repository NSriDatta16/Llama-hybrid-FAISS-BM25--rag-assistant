How to build a java code library for Android?

I have several android constructs like custom dialog boxes, drag-and-drop implementations, and other standard classes that I use in multiple projects. It seems both inefficient and bad practice to put a copy of each construct (each with its own set of resources and classes to maintain) into each project. Now if I find a bug in these, I have to change it everywhere. Good practice would dictate that I include that as a separate project, perhaps a jar library that my other projects can import. This works fine for constructs that are purely java classes, but some of these things have android resources associated with them and I don't know if there is a way to include those in a jar in a way the android resource compiler will recognize. Is it even possible to build a jar with Android resources included (i.e. a custom dialog box with a custom background drawable or something)? If it is possible, how?
