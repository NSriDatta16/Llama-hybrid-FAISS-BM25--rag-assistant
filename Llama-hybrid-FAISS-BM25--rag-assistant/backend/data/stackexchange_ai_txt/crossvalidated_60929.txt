Should I convert bootstrapped confidence intervals for logistic regression coefficients (betas) to CIs for odds ratios (ORs)?

I have bootstrapped my multiple logistic regression model. SPSS does report OR and its confidence intervals for a non -bootstrapped multiple regression, but when it bootstraps the same model, it just gives B (beta) and CI for B. I know OR is exponential of B and theoretically I can convert them to each other. But I don't know if I "should" do it in a bootstrapped model or not. I see SPSS refuses to compute OR alongside its CI for bootstrapped models; and instead, it gives only B and its CI for bootstrapped models. Thus I thought perhaps it is not right to calculate confidence interval from " bootstrapped " beta CIs) Am I right? Or can I compute ORs and their CIs by my own? Many thanks.
