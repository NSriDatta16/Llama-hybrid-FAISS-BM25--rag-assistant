jQuery WYSIWYG Reccomedations

I am looking for a WYSIWYG editor that matches a few requirements. ability to customize toolbar ability to customize styles of headings/paragraphs, extra styles in dropdown, etc ability to upload image (to a pre-defined folder on the same server. I do not want a full fledged file manager , just a "select image -> upload image" system) ability to do an "in page" preview (think wordpress) (php) integrates with jQuery I have looked at a lot of them out there, but I can't find one that matches all these requirements.
