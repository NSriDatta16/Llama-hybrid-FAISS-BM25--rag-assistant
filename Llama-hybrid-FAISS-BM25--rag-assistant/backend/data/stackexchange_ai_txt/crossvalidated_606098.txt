Is there a function like auto.arima which gives the best VAR model according to a metric like AIC?

The function auto.arima from the forecast package, automatically fits the best ARIMA model given a time series, by evaluating on a metric like AIC, AICc or BIC. I am looking for a similar function which does the same, but fits a VAR (Vector Auto Regression) model to a bunch of time series variables. Is there any such function in any package?
