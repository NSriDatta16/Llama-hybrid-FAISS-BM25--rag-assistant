We might consider a word embedding to be "intuitive" when it has the following properties: Semantically similar words (car, truck, sedan, vehicle) are close to each other "Embedding arithmetic" can be done: king' - man' + woman' $\approx$ queen', where i use word' to denote the embedding of word I think modern word embedding techniques manage to satisfy these requirements sufficiently that I would call them quite intuitive.
