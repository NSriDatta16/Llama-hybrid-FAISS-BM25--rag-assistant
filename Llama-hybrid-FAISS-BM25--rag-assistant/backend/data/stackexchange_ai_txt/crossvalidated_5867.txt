There are around 100 classification and regression models which are trainable via the caret package . Any of the classification models will be an option for you (as opposed to regression models, which require a continuous response). For example to train a random forest: library(caret) train(response~., data, method="rf") See the caret model training vignette which comes with the distribution for a full list of the models available. It is split into dual-use and classification models (both of which you can use) and regression-only (which you can't). caret will automatically train the parameters for your chosen model for you.
