I am not sure whether the answer to the first two questions should be "yes" or "no"; but I have a feeling that VECM CVARMA and DFM are two sides of the same coin: Both in VECM CVARMA and in DFM, the underlying processes are cointegrated; thus there actually are fewer (unobserved) integrated time series components than there are observed endogenous variables. The components are modelled either implicitly (in VECM CVARMA) or explicitly (in DFM). A special case of CVARMA is the vector error correction model (VECM). With regards to computational advantages, VECM is faster to compute (via OLS or GLS) and is readily available in most statistical/econometric packages. Meanwhile, DFM is slower to compute (it needs fitting a state space model) and apparently not readily available in the statistical/econometric software. I have not seen DFM by Pena & Poncela (2006) implemented in R . I do not have an answer regarding computational advantages between CVARMA and DFM.
