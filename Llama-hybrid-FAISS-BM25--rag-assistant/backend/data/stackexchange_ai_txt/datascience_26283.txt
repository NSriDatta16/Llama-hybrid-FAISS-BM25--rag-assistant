How can I fit categorical data types for random forest classification?

I need to find the accuracy of a training dataset by applying Random Forest Algorithm. But my the type of my data set are both categorical and numeric. When I tried to fit those data, I get an error. 'Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float32')'. May be the problem is for object data types. How can I fit categorical data without transforming for applying RF? Here's my code.
