To perform a variable selection and then re-run an anslysis, as if no variable selection had happened and the selected model had be intended from the start, typically leads to exaggerated effect sizes, invalid p-values and confidence intervals with below nominal coverage. Perhaps if the sample size is very large and there are a few huge effects and a lot of null effects, LASSO+OLS might not be too badly affected by this, but other than that I cannot see any reasonable justification and in that case the LASSO estimates ought to be just fine, too.
