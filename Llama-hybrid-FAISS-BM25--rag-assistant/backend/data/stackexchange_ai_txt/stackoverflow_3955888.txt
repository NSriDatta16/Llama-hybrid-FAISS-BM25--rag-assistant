Assuming the file is simply appended to, it would intuitively be easiest to store the previous file size and use fseek() or the offset parameter of file_get_contents to move to where the old version of the file ended. I.e.: $old_position = (int)file_get_contents("last_position.temp"); file_put_contents("last_position.temp", filesize("thebigfile.txt")); // There might be an off-by-one error here that I'm not paying attention to $new_entry = file_get_contents("thebigfile.txt", false, "r", $old_position); To get this rolling for the first time, you'll want to put 0 in last_position.temp so there's no errors or hard feelings. Hope this helps :)
