Write a simple class containing all the properties your report will need (call it eg. MyData). Use simple .NET types for each property: string, int, etc Write another class with a GetXxx method, which returns IEnumerable . This Get method should return the results of your Linq query. You can do a .ToList() before returning, to get an in-memory list, allowing you to close the connection before returning. Compile. Now open your report designer (in same solution), and you should see MyData listed in your Data Sources window, with the Get method which you wrote. If you drag the fields from this data source onto your report designer, and then refer to this report from a new ReportViewer control, the ObjectDatasource will be automatically created and linked up for you. Hope that helps!
