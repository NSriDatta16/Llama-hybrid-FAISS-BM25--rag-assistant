F# - What's the "it" keyword?

I am a newb to F#, just began learning it this afternoon. What I've noticed is that when getting type info via the fsi, I get the following info: val it : (char list -> string -> string list) = If I understand correctly, the (char list -> string -> string list) means that the function takes a list of char and returns a function that takes a string and returns a list of string. However, I don't understand the usage of the "it". Thanks for any info!
