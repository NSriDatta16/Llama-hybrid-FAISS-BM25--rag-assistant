What would be a likelihood ratio test based on nested multinomial logistic regression models for one-sample testing of categorical distributions?

(Let’s assume a multinomial distribution with a size of just one, so a categorical distribution: either dog, cat, or alligator.) I have done multinomial two-sample tests a few times lately, and I’ve gotten comfortable treating it as a likelihood ratio test of nested multinomial logistic regression models that have an intercept and then another parameter (vector) for the group membership in the more complex model. I then test the nested models, and I have come to learn that this is called the G-test . I believe something similar applies in the one-sample setting to test if all of the probability parameters of the multinomial distribution are equal. Under the null hypothesis, all of the probabilities are equal, so the null logistic regression is just a softmax applied to zero. Such a model is nested in a model that does not have an intercept but does have a parameter for each $y$ outcome. As these are nested, the same likelihood ratio test applies. When I tried to simulate this in R, my code failed to compile, seemingly for a technicality related to regressing on zero, so I have not been able to test this out. set.seed(2022) N In the two-sample case, I have gotten great results doing something like this. Does it make sense for the one-sample case? (I’ll eventually debug my code or find a different package than nnet that allows me to regress on just the zero, so I don’t want to focus on the code.)
