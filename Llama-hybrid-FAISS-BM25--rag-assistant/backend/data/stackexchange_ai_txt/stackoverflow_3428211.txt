Is the 1x1 pixel image technique a good way to capture analytics data cross-domain?

I see many web analytics application and otherwise use JavaScript to capture data on a client website, and then send it to a central server for processing/storage/presentation. For a similar purpose I've been using a JavaScript snippet which generates a 1x1 pixel image request to the server. The request contains GET attributes with the data I want to capture (which can vary in size). This request may be generated millions of times per day, across thousands of websites (and multiple times on each website). Is the 1x1 pixel image the 00's way to do it? Are alternative cross-browser techniques (JSONP or others) mature enough to replace it, when dealing with an application with thousands of client websites?
