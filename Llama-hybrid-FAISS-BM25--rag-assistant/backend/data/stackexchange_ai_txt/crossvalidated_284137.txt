The example (image + R-code to create it) below may explain the paradox by regression to the mean. 1) Regression coefficient paradox A requirement is that the group means are different. The differences in the group means rhyme with the differences in the effects. 'Women having lower education and income than man' => 'man have higher income' (the advantage effect in direct relation), but also 'man have higher education' (the disadvantage effect in reverse relation) The regression to the mean is the effect of the regression line becoming more 'flat' due to the error. Depending on which type of relation you look at this means that the regression line becomes more vertical or more horizontal. Now if the group means are different then this will interact with the 'flatter' regression line. In the below example: the smaller regression coefficient, more horizontal/vertical line, will result in a larger parameter for the gender effect (because the genders do not have the same means and are distributed unevenly over the error of the regression to the mean). (If you would like some help to improve your intuition then you may imagine the relationship with very low correlation. In that case the regression lines become very vertical/horizontal. The regression line is expressing a sum of effect+randomness, it is a prediction of one variable based on the other and the more randomness the closer the prediction is to the average, and thus is smaller than the effect alone. Then the direction depends on the relationship, which is not paradoxical as it is a different situation to predict x based on y then predicting y based on x. Imagine the intuitive idea of very low correlation for that again, in which case the prediction should be closes to the average than to the effect. The regression line coefficient expresses this prediction. The regression line coefficient is not the naked effect-size, without the random effect. See also the R-code example in which the parameter used to generate the data is not the same as the effect size from the model) 2) Table paradox The code below also generates a table like the Table 1 in your reference. For most education categories males have a higher income (males have an advantage), yet at the same time for most income categories males have a higher education (males have a disadvantage). This has to do with the genders not being evenly distributed among the classes. Say we look at education e_i which would associate according to the model with salary s_i. The females will have a relatively larger number with lower education than e_i, and the fraction of them that, still make salary s_i, will outweigh the men. So, on average, in comparison to men, women will have the lower education, for the same salary class, because at a given salary class there are more women that are overpaid than men that are underpaid. And... this is not because women have an advantage. Instead, it is because there is a larger number of low educated women! Note: other explanations may be non-linearity library(tidyr) # generate some random data # with # 1) man have higher education levels than women # 2) man have a bias (the paradox effect occurs if the bias for men is not too large in comparison to the interaction between regression to the mean and unequal distribution) we ################################################### edit June 8 evening Based on your comments I have adjusted some parameters in the model, in order to make the mathematical demonstration of the paradox a bit more dramatic. The regression line for income ~ education has the same coefficient as the parameter that was used in the model to create the data. However, regression/correlation does not equal causation. It is in the switch of meaning from correlation to causation, which can be interpreted in two (or 3) different ways, income as function of education or education as function of income (or a combination), that the paradox occurs. You should pick only one option and if you take multiple interpretations then you get the conflicts (which are only seemingly a paradox/conflict since you made at least one wrong interpretation if you picked multiple options). The regression lines should be foremost interpreted as predictors. What is the expected income for a given education and What is the expected education for a given income. (The fact that, at the same salary level, women have a lower expected education than men, should not be automatically turned into the interpretation that women have an advantage, which would mean that there is a systematic advantage, that is, a causal effect that gives women an advantage. In this example it is obviously demonstrated as men are explicitly given the advantage.) And as the new image clearly shows in an intuitive way. $E(y \mid x) \neq E(x \mid y)$. Since you will have approximately the average value for the dependent no matter what the independent value is $E(y \mid x) \sim \bar y$ and $E(x \mid y) \sim \bar x$. The image may also provide an intuition why, given the same salary, men have a higher education (which may be interpreted as a disadvantage if you see this correlation as a causal effect). The assumption that the correlation 'men have higher education as a function of salary' relates to a disadvantage, is a version of the error that a correlation is seen as a causal effect (and so this paradox is a version of that error too). n=2000 we
