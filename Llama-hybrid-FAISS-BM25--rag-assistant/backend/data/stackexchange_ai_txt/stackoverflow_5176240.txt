Android inputstream IOException - large file Android 2.2

Hi i am getting an IOException running my application using Android 2.2. I dont get that when I use Android 2.3. I am trying to copy a pdf file (size 1.6MB) from assets folder to the internal storage of the application using the following block of code. 1. private void copyFile(InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException { 2. byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; 3. int read; 4. while((read = in.read(buffer)) != -1){ 5. out.write(buffer, 0, read); 6. } 7. } I am getting the IOException when I execute line 4. It runs without any exception in the following cases - When I use small file (size 320kb) - When I build it as Android 2.3 project. Any suggestions on how to solve this issue? If size is a problem, is there a work around for that? Your help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Navin
