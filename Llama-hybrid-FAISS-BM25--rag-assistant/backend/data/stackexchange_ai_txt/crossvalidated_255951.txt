How does `rpart` in R decide on splits

library(rpart) library(rpart.plot) library(rattle) tree From my understanding, rpart fits a regression model at each partition of the tree. Since my outcome is continuous, the number at the top of each box is the averaged value of my response variable (i.e. = 5.8 at the root). My question is, how does rpart decide on which predictor to split on and at what value of that predictor? That is, how did the function decide that the first split should be on Petal.Width, and how did it decide on Petal.Width
