What sort of database will I get with an Apache Wicket Application?

So I've done my Object Oriented design, put together a database schema to go with my design, and promised an impossibly short deadline for delivery I've decided to make my life "easier" by using a Web Framework. Spring seems insanely complicated (and rather inelegant at a superficial glance) and Roo is impossible to understand and/or get help with on the forums beyond doing anything beyond a basic CRUD app. I am using (and learning!) Wicket then to accomplish my task. I am spending a lot of time trying to figure out how Wicket creates and uses the database and if I understand correctly it does this automagically from the POJOs that I will be creating. I creating objects that use objects in moderately complex ways, however, and I would like to have a better idea of what the end result is going to look like in mySQL. Does anyone have any information or links that explain what resulting schema looks like from a Wicket application?
