How to select a proper vectorization method in NLP?

Suppose we have a text classification problem. As we all know we have to convert the text data into vectors so as to train the model. So there are a couple of vectorization methods such as count vectorization, Tf-IDF, Bag of words, etc. So from these many vectorization methods how will we choose one method? Is it like that or in another way do we need to try all the methods, train the model then check the performance with each vectorization method? Please share your thoughts and help me to understand this properly.
