The view you're looking at appears to have been built by some sort of analysis of the IL of the framework. Without knowing the type you intend to look at, no deconstruction can be done. Therefore I feel that, you are unlikely to find exactly what you have said you are looking for. Allow me to suggest a few alternatives though. Disclaimer: I work for DevExpress as a CodeRush Community Evangelist. The Object Browser ( Ctrl + Alt + J ) This screen will load without attempting to show you any particular type, it will therefore be down to you to find the type in question. However all types are available and full search functionality is provided. once the type you're looking or is found, all members are listed and available. Update: If you use the ( Ctrl + K , Ctrl + R ) shortcut to launch the object browser, then it will launch focused on the Search box. This is invaluable. There are a number of CodeRush features which can prove useful when trying to locate code. TabToNextReference ( Tab ) Whilst the caret is positioned within a type, strike the tab key and the next reference to that type will be located. More Details References ToolWindow ( Shift + F12 ) When activated the References ToolWindow will show you any references to the current type or member. This toolwindow can also be used to navigate said references. The References Toolwindow can be used in both on demand and Live mode. this allows you to have the window update as you navigate your code (via mouse or keyboard) and locate all references of any symbol the caret lands upon. QuickNav ( Ctrl + Shift + Q ) : This feature is closest in style to VS2010's NavigateTo feature. QuickNav will locate symbols matching whatever you type into it's filter box. This facility also supports Camel Case search. More details QuickNav is also much more configurable than it's VS counterpart Finally Please also keep in mind that CodeRush is build upon the DXCore, a framework which allows users to create their own plugins for use alongside each other and CodeRush. This framework has been repeatedly been leveraged by the community to add additional functionality. So even if you don't see any thing quite to your needs, consider suggesting something to the community by way of the forums or even contact me directly RoryB at DevExpress dot Com I'm sure there's something we can do to help you out :)
