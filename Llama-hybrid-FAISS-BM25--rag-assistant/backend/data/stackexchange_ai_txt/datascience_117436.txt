Predict the values of variable features over timestamps

HI i am having a dataset which contain timestamps and number of users at that timestamp. Each user has resource values which change per timestamp. How can i make predictions of number of users incoming at timestamp and the resource values of each user at that timestamp. I found out that meta-learning model can be used for this proposal. Is there any conv Net or Deep neural networks can solve this proposal Thank you for your response
