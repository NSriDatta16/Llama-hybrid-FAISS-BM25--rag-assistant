This response is obviously way outdated but there is a known issue with Platt scaling. I would not be surprised if SciPy and Matlab are using similar algorithms to infer probabilities from SVM output. The accuracy of the output is dependent on the sample size and, in an unpredictable manner, the estimated probabilities may yield completely dubious results. Check out this thread on stackoverflow.
