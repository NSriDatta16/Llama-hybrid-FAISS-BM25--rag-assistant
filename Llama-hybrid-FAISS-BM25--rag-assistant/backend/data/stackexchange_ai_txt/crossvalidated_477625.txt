MCMC with missing data

I want to perform some parameter inference on a dataset. In particular, I have some data $y$ , with which I want do find posterior distributions for the parameters $\theta$ . I have a Metropolis Hastings scheme that works with a complete simulated dataset. I have now generated a similar dataset, but have made it so some of the values are missing (chosen randomly). Each datapoint is actually a vector that consists of about 8 components. Some of the components are always present for each vector. Data is deemed as missing if components 1,3 and 5 don't sum to component 7, and if components 2,4 and 6 don't sum to component 8. I don't know which components (or whether it's both) are the ones with missing data though. What's the best way for me to account for this missing data? I have tried summing over all possible states, and this gets me sort of in the right region, but still not that close to the simulated parameter values I used. If I restrict to just the data vectors where I have complete information, I don't have many datapoints. When reading the literature, I've been struggling with how to convert my data into the form $Y=(y_1,y_2,...,y_n)$ where some of the $y_i$ are missing. If anyone could help with this (or give suggestions on dealing with missing data in this situation), it would be much appreciated. Edit: To make things a bit clearer, for my data I essentially have an $8 \times N$ matrix where $N$ is the number of observations. In rows where I don't have complete information (only applies to about half of the columns, but most of the rows), I have a lower and upper bound for each piece of missing data, as well as a constraint on their sum. If I include the missing data as something I want to infer from the MCMC scheme, how can I include this information?
