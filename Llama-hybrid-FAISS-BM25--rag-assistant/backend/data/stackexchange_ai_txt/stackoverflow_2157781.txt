Making an icon "jump" with iPhone core animation

What would be the best way to make an icon seem to "jump" from a toolbar into a UITabBarItem. I have found the CAKeyframeAnimation class which looks promising but I just can't get it to work. I have been using code similar to this : http://www.bdunagan.com/2009/04/26/core-animation-on-the-iphone/ but no matter what I set my endPoint to, the icon always ends up in the top of the screen. I'm trying to achieve something similar to the effect used when you move a message in the Mail application. Is CAKeyframeAnimation suitable or is there an easier way to do this? Thanks in advance.
