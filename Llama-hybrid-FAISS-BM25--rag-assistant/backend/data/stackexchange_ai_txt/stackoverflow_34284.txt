How to fix build error in Visual Studio: '"LC.exe" exited with code -1'

I get the following error when building my Windows Forms solution: "LC.exe" exited with code -1 I use two commercial Windows Forms Libraries: Infragistics and the Gantt-Control from plexityhide.com, that's why I have licenses.licx files in my WinForms Projects. We also use Visual Sourcesafe as our Source Control. When the licenses.licx files are in the Projects I cannot build without the above error. However, when I exclude them from my projects the build works fine. But I need the licenses.licx files when I want to work with the commercial controls in the designer. This is a brand new developer machine with Windows XP SP3 (German) and Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Developers (German) with SP1. It's Windows XP 32-Bit by the way. Any suggestions?
