Select the baseline methods for ensemble time-series model

I have been reading about ensemble time series models which have often been shown to perform better than single methods. I did not manage to find any reference on how to select the baseline methods. Should I use more forecasting methods to combine (the more the better) and any basic method (ARIMA, theta, naive) will do or is there some principled way of selecting those methods (e.g. having predictions which are negatively correlated or better uncorrelated)?
