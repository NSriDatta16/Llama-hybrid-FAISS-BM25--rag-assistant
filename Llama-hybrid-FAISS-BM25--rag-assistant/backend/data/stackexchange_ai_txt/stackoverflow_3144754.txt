What's the deal with the various MySQL versions?

I haven't been paying attention for a while, but I just checked and the latest release of MySQL is at 5.5. I always use what the vendor of whatever OS I'm using provides, which has been 5.0 or 5.1 for the last couple years. This page lists two community versions, 5.1 and 5.5: http://dev.mysql.com/ There is documentation for 5.0, 5.1, 5.4, 5.5: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/insert-select.html So: What happened to 5.2, and 5.3? Why do all distros, even the newest Ubuntu which is not considered to be particularly conservative, only ship with 5.0 and 5.1?
