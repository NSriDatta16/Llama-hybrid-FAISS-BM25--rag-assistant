how to build a svn-client library for node.js

I would like to build a subversion client library for node.js. First, do you know if this already exists ? If not, do your have any insight for such an endeavor ? should I code the whole client protocol in javascript ? wrap a native library (which one?) as a node.js plugin ? wrap command line calls in a node.js module ? Do you know of an elegant subversion client API in another language that i could "clone" ? Thank you for your help
