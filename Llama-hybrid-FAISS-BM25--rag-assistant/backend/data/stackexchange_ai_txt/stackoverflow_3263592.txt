The battle against code entropy is an ongoing team effort. Minor checkins where one just 'fixes broken windows' along ones way should be encouraged, not frowned upon. The source repository is the wrong tool for keeping track of bugfixes - that's what a bug tracker is for - so the inconvenience in locating fixes when scanning the code repository and not the bug repository seems utterly negligible to me. I work in a moderate size team on a large code base (~1M LOC) with a huge history (~20Y). A lot of the code is a pile of mess - rotten branch logic, deprecated API, naming conventions, even random indentation often makes it a misery to read. I started a habit of minor "drive-by" readability improvements, to try and fight complete code rot, and am trying hard to get teammates to adopt the same habit. Unless your circumstances are radically different, I would try and think favorably on any such initiative. The alternative (which I'm familiar with all to well) is fearful stagnation, which dooms any code to rot.
