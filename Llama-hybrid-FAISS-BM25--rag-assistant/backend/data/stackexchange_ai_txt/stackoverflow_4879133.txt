I've seen the following used in core code, and it looks like its just what you ordered. $transactionSave = Mage::getModel('core/resource_transaction'); $transactionSave->addObject($model_one) $transactionSave->addObject($model_two) $transactionSave->save(); The core/resource_transaction object allows you to add Magento objects, and perform a mass save on them. Give that a try, and I'd love to hear how this does, or doesn't, work for you in the comments.
