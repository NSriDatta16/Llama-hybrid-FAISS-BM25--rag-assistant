When to use THIS keyword when working with controls on form in C#

I am still far away from mastering C#, but the child in me is pushing me to continue improving my programming day by day. When I make a WinForms application I want to change and use lot of controls pragmatically. What I do not understand is when I need to use the this.control keyword and when I should use just control . Sample: If I want to change the text of my label I can write mylabel.text = "Text for label" or this.mylabel.tex = "Text for label" Which of these is the right way? Is there a simple explanation when to use the this keyword when using controls in WinForms (such as datagrid, text, tables, etc.)?
