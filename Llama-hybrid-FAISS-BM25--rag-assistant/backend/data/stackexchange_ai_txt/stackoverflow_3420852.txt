Grails has a few methods to help with this (they leverage hibernate under the covers). If you know an object is detached, you can use the attach method to reconnect it. If you've made changes to the object while it was detatched, you can use merge . If for whatever reason, you're not sure if an object is attached to the session, you can use the link text method to find out if it is or isn't. It might also be worth reviewing the Hibernate documentation on Session .
