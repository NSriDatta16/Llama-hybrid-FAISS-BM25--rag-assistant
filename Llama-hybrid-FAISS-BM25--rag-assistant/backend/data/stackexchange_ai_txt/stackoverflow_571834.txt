If there are errors in any refernced files it will break intellisense for all files references from the same document. The next version of Visual Studio is going to be much more robust in this respect. I apologize directly for this fragility. We made some design decisions early on that we prevented us from making VS9 external references more robust. In the meantime, use the following workaround. Install SP1 from the link Slace gave you. If you have a reference a file named .js and there is a file named -vsdoc.js in the same location, then JS intellisense will pick up the -vsdoc version. If that script is empty then it won't generate an error. Identify the jquery plugin that is causing intellisense generation to fail and place a -vsdoc version next to it. You won't get intellisense for UI, but you will still get jquery and other plugins that do work. Anything you put in the vsdoc version will show up in intellisense. You could put spoofed versions of the data structures that you want to display in intellisense if you want to.
