What's a good way to organize external JavaScript file(s)?

In an ASP.NET web application with a lot of HTML pages, a lot of inline JavaScript functions are accumulating. What is a good plan for organizing them into external files? Most of the functions are particular to the page for which they are written, but a few are relevant to the entire application. A single file could get quite large. With C#, etc., I usually divide the files at least into one containing the general functions and classes, so that I can use the same file for other applications, and one for functions and classes particular to this application. I don't think that a large file would be good for performance in a web application, however. What is the thinking in this regard?
