Research paper - section dependent variable for logistic regression

In my paper, in the section methodology, I have a subsection called dependent variable . But since I am performing a logistic regression, there seem to be 2 (or even 3) things that could be named the dependent variable: First you have your Y , which is a measured variable. Second there is the predicted log-odds of the probability . Third there is the predicted probability (easily calculated from the log-odds). I am wondering which one to describe in my paper in this section? I prefer not to talk about the log-odds, since it makes no sense to make things more complicated at that stage of the paper. I wanted to say the actual Y, cause that's what people are used to in linear regression, but it seems the Y is not dependent of the independent variables, its dependent of the probability. Could I safely talk about the probability, without breaking any rules? Does anyone have any experience with this? Maybe an example of a research paper/article.
