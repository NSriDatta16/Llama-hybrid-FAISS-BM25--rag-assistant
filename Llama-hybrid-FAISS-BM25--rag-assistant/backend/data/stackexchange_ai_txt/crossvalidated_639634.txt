Categorizing responses on a likert-type scale for use in ordinal regression

I have a dataset mostly consisting of single items and I have been analyzing them with ordinal regression and other ordinal analyses. However, I also have a likert-type scale and in theory I would like to include it as an independent variable in analyses with ordinal independent and dependent variables. Another researcher told me that it is possible to essentially categorize the responses to likert-type scales in order to treat is an ordinal variable, for example like this: Scale average 1-1.99 becomes 1 Scale average 2-2.99 becomes 2 And so on. In this way, responses to the scale become a single ordinal variable. My hunch is that this is not appropriate and that I should find another way. Or does anyone know if this approach is actually valid?
