According to what you've posted, you're always grabbing the "absent" value of the gender drop-down. I believe what you're looking for, as a selector, is '#gender option:selected' which will grab the selected option. Remember that the value field is what is going to be sent to your PHP page. I would advise to check if the drop-down is still set to selected (as a .val() ) and bring the user's attention back to it before form submit so they can make an actual choice.
