For your specific question, you can just use this: >>> d={'fruit': {'orange': 'orange', 'apple': 'red', 'banana': 'yellow'}, 'vegetables': {'lettuce': 'green', 'beet': 'red', 'pumpkin': 'orange'}} >>> len(d) 2 # that is 1 reference for 'fruit' and 1 for 'vegetables' >>> len(d['fruit']) 3 # 3 fruits listed... >>> len(d['vegetables']) 3 # you thought of three of those... >>> len(d['fruit'])+len(d['vegetables']) 6 While you can use the various tools that Python has to count the elements in this trivial dictionary, the more interesting and productive thing is to think about the structure of the data in the first place. The basic data structures of Python are lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries . Any of these data structures can 'hold', by reference, any nested version of itself or the other data structures. This list is a nested list : >>> l = [1, [2, 3, [4]], [5, 6]] >>> len(l) 3 >>> l[0] 1 >>> l[1] [2, 3, [4]] >>> l[2] [5, 6] The first element is the integer 1. Elements 1 and 2 are lists themselves. The same can be true of any other of the basic Python data structures. These are recursive data structures . You can print them with pprint If you organize your dictionary a bit better, it is easier to extract information from it with Python's simplest tools: >>> color='color' >>> family='family' >>> sensation='sensation' >>> good_things={ 'fruit': { 'orange': { color: 'orange', family: 'citrus', sensation: 'juicy' }, 'apple': { color: ['red','green','yellow'], family:'Rosaceae', 'sensation': 'woody' }, 'banana': { color: ['yellow', 'green'], family: 'musa', sensation: 'sweet' } }, 'vegatables': { 'beets': { color: ['red', 'yellow'], family: 'Chenopodiaceae', sensation: 'sweet' }, 'broccoli': { color: 'green', family: 'kale', sensation: 'The butter you put on it', } } } Now the queries against that data make more sense: >>> len(good_things) 2 # 2 groups: fruits and vegetables >>> len(good_things['fruit']) 3 # three fruits cataloged >>> len(good_things['vegetables']) 2 # I can only think of two vegetables... >>> print good_things['fruit']['apple'] {'color': ['red', 'green', 'yellow'], 'sensation': 'woody', 'family': 'Rosaceae'} >>> len(good_things['fruit']['apple']['color']) 3 # apples have 3 colors
