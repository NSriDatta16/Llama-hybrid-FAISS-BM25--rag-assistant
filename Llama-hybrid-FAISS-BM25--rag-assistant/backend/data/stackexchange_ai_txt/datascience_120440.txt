Existence of a "three-point" machine learning model?

I may want to ask if there are studies that exist which utilize a "three-point machine learning model . What I mean by "three-point machine learning model is that it may use several algorithms in order to construct a model (in this case, it would be three machine learning algorithms) . An example would be coming from our study which utilizes Random Forest (RF) , Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) , and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network in order to construct a machine learning model within the context of multi-label classification . I may just want to ask also if a "three-point approach" is a feasible way to construct machine learning models like what we have in mind?
