You shouldn't html-encode the data when writing it to the datastorage - that way you could use your data also for something else (e.g. emails, PDF documents and so on). As Assaf already said: it's mandatory to avoid SQL injections by escaping the input or using parameterized insert-queries. You should, no, let's say, must however html-encode your data when showing it on an HTML page! That will render dangerous HTML or Javascript code useless as the HTML-tags present in the data will not be recognized as HTML-tags by the browser any more. The process is a little more complicated when you'll allow the users to post data with HTML-tags inside. You then have to skip the output-encoding in favor of an input-sanitizing which can be arbitrary complex depending on your needs (allowed tags e.g.).
