ARIMA model selection in R

I have run an ARIMA model on univariate time series data. I have the below statistical results with the lag differencing at 3. I am not sure which of the model to select to forecast. Any help to choose the order out of the below 2 would be much appreciated. Note: dataframe d.ratio is with 3rd lag differencing.
