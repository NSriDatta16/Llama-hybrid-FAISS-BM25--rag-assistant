Does OpenAI Gym or Tensorforce require a normalized action space?

I am learning to use OpenAI Gym to make a custom environment with continuous action and observation spaces and apply reinforcement learning algorithms using the Tensorforce library. The problem is that the action space must be normalized (values in the [-1, 1] interval) in order to work; otherwise, when using the required (not normalized) values, it gives an error. These are the lines I'm using: self.action_space = spaces.Box(np.array([4.6, 80.0]), np.array([4.8, 180.0]), dtype=np.float32) # Gives error self.action_space = spaces.Box(np.array([-1, -1]), np.array([1, 1]), dtype=np.float32) # OK, but not desired The error I get when using the required (not normalized) values: File "C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\tensorforce\environments\openai_gym.py", line 378, in unflatten_action if np.isinf(action).any() or np.isnan(action).any(): TypeError: ufunc 'isinf' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe'' where action is {'2'} . Is there something I'm missing here? Or does OpenAI Gym or Tensorforce work only with normalized action values? If so, why? And how can this be avoided?
