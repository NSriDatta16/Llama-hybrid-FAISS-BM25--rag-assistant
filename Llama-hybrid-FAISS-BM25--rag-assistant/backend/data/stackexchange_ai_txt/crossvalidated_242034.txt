Time series analysis for predicting future values

I am a newbie to this Time series analysis problem, but want to explore more and learn about it. I have a question in which I would like some experts to help me out. I have a value called as "airflow" which is measured every 5 minutes continously for 24 hours, and I have the data for the last 15 days. I want to predict what would be the airflow for the next 2 days learning the data from the past 15 days. How can I do it? Which methods should I use? I have been seeing certain videos to predict trends and seasonality but have not been successful in doing that, any help how to move forward in this problem will be much appreciated.
