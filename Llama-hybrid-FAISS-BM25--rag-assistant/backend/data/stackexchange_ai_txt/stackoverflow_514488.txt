Use whatever persistence technology you're most comfortable with, and scales sufficiently. YAGNI at least means "Don't add a new technology to your personal stack unless you can't be productive with whatever is already there." For many (most?) of us, our comfort zone for data persistence is SQL. For some, it might be XML. Just don't write your own until (see paragraph 2).
