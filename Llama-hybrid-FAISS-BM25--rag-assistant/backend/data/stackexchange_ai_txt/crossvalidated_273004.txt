Well, you could try out the Minkowski distance (which can be interpreted as the generalisation of the euclid distance). It is defined as: $$ \textrm{Minkowski}(X, Y, \lambda)= \left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^\lambda\right)^{\frac{1}{\lambda}} $$ Try to vary $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$, but pay attention that $\lambda From my own experience, I've observed in many situations a peak in $\lambda =1$ which, when plugged into to above formula, results in the Manhatten distance.
