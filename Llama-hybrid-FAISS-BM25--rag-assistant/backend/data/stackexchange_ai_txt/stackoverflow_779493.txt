Magento Web Service Errors

I am implementing a custom solution to interface with a Magento website. My code is in C#. I am trying to create products using either the v2_soap API and the xml-rpc API web services. I have attempted to create a product using both services. I cannot seem to successfully create a product. With each service I receive the error message [102] Invalid data given. Details in error message. . I have tried passing in a variety of data to the api call, but have not had any luck. I am wondering a few things: 1) Is there any way to recieve better error messages about what data is not valid when I make a web service call? The error message seems to indicate that I can get details somewhere, but I have searched through all logs, error message data I can find with no luck. 2) What are the minimum attributes required to add a new product using the web service? Here is a bit of the code I am using. This is the XML-RPC implementation. I am using the cook computing xml-rpc library. public int CreateProduct(Product product) { var entity = ConvertProduct(product); //int productId = Service.catalogProductCreate(SessionId, "simple", "0", product.Sku, entity); int productId = XmlRpcService.CallReturnInt(SessionId, "catalog_product.create", new object[] { "simple" /* product type */, 0 /* attribute set */, product.Sku /* sku */, entity /* product data */ }); return productId; } private XmlRpcStruct ConvertProduct(Product product) { var entity = new XmlRpcStruct(); entity.Add("name", product.Name); entity.Add("description", product.Description); return entity; } protected IMagentoXmlRcpService XmlRpcService { get { return this.xmlRpcService; } }
