BERT needs to be fine-tuned to do what you want. GPT-3 cannot be fine-tuned (even if you had access to the actual weights, fine-tuning it would be very expensive) If you have enough data for fine-tuning, then per unit of compute (i.e. inference cost), you'll probably get much better performance out of BERT.
