Troubles at Including (Linking) a static library inside another one

I'll try to explain shortly what I want to do: A project using a static library which have another one as depandency. It produce a project called MyProject linking on MyLib1 linking on MyLib2. Here is the compile order: MyLib2 MyLib1 (linking to MyLib2) MyProject (linking to MyLib1) I'm using Visual Studio 2008 and I have some troubles at defining include. When linking, I use the property "Additional Include Directory" (on project property C/C++ node). This seems working between MyProject and MyLib1 but not MyLib1 and MyLib2. For Exemple: I've a file in MyLib2 called foo.cpp; Using #include "foo.cpp" makes visual studio telling that foo.cpp is unknow (missing file or folder). To ensure it's NOT a wrong path I gave, I've done many attemps like following: copy-paste the path shown in Command Line (used to compile the library) into win explorer: I well see the source code of my second library. I've remake the project many times and each times I used differents names (forcing me to pay attention to this) and everything seems well defined (but not "including"). The only way I actually find to make it works: using #include "c:\\foo.cpp" as include... Very nice for portability ! Here is a Zip of the Solution to test it yourself and tell me what's wrong: MyProject.rar Thanks for taking some time to help me ! Lucyberad
