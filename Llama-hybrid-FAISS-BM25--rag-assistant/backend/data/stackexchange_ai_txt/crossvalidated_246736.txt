History of uninformative prior theory

I am writing a short theoretical essay for a Bayesian Statistics course (in an Economics M.Sc.) on uninformative priors and I am trying to understand which are the steps in the development of this theory. By now, my timeline is made three main steps: Laplace's indifference principle (1812), Non-Invariant priors (Jeffreys (1946)), Bernardo reference prior (1979). From my literature review, I've understood that indifference principle (Laplace) was the first tool used to represent lack of prior information but the missing requirement of invariance has led to its abandonment until the 40s, when Jeffreys introduced his method, which has the desired property of invariance. The arise of paradoxes of marginalization due to the careless use of improper prior in the 70s pushed Bernardo to elaborate his reference prior theory to deal with this issue. Reading the literature, every author cites different contributes: Jaynes' maximum entropy, Box and Tiao's data-translated likelihood, Zellner, ... In your opinion, what are the crucial steps I am missing? EDIT : I add my (main) references, if someone needs: The selection of prior by formal rules, Kass, Wasserman A catalogue of non informative priors, Yang, Berger Noninformative Bayesians Priors Interpretation and Problems with Construction and Applications EDIT 2 : Sorry for the 2 years delay but you can find my essay here .
