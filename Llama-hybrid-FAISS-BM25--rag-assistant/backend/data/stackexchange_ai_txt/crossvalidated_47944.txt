One could be tempted to average the standard errors over the imputations, but this does not produce correct statistical inferences. The average standard error ignores the between-imputation variance. Moreover, it is known that the pooled parameter estimate has a t distribution, which is different from the normal distribution implied by the average standard error. The correct procedure is described in Little and Rubin (2002) , pages 86-87, and is sometimes referred to as "Rubin's rule". Chapter 3 of Rubin (1987) contains the justification of the procedure. The method can be applied for estimates that are approximately normally distributed over repeated samples, which covers a lot of statistics used in practice. The pooling procedure does not depend on the imputation method used. Of course, the results only make sense if the imputation method makes sense. You could check whether that is the case on your data given knowledge you might have about the causes for the missing data.
