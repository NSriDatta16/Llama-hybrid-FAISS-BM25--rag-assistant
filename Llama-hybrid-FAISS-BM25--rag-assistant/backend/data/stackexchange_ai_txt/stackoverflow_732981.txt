Well, I don't think WoWWiki is wrong. Here is the code I am using: function myTest(arg1) return arg1 .. 10; end local retOK, ret1 = pcall(myTest,"string value"); DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(ret1); local retOK, ret1 = pcall(myTest,"string value", "bob"); DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(ret1); Here is the output I get in my General chat box: string value10 string value10 How are you trying your sample code? I just pasted my code into an existing mod lua file and made sure that mod was enabled in the addons window before selecting my character and logging in. I made a few changes to the source lua file and typed: /console reloadui To try the new changes and have the results output to my screen. I don't have much advice to offer you, because I haven't done much work with WoW addons. Have you tried this code in a blank addon to make sure nothing else is interfering? Have you actually tried the code in game? If you can provide any more information or want me to try anything else, let me know! Update : Decided to try a few more tests. Here are the tests (with the same function): local retOK, ret1 = pcall(myTest,""); DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(ret1); local retOK, ret1 = pcall(myTest, nil, "bob"); DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(ret1); And the results: 10 attempt to concatenate local 'arg1' (a nil value) It's interesting that the error I see when arg1 is nil is slightly different than the error you see. I'd be interested in knowing how you are testing your code. Or maybe you didn't copy the error down verbatim? I guess you could also try clearing out your WTF folder and disabling the rest of your addons to test this function. If it makes a difference, then you can enable them one a time until you find the problem.
