Is it possible to use LabelFor for header row in Index view

I am trying to leverage DataAnnotation values in ASP.NET MVC Index view. Interesting, code generator uses field names (eg., BlogPost) as opposed to Html.LabelFor(m => Model.ColumNames["BlogPost"]) or something similar (I made it up). Does it mean, that if the Model is IEnumerable (as in Index view), then it is not possible to get to the Display Name that is specified by DataAnnotation? Hard to believe... My code is currently a mix of MVC 2 and MVC 3, if it makes any difference.
