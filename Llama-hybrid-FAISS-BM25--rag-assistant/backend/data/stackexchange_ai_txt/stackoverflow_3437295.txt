You are attempting the impossible. You can't append objects to a file with an ObjectOutputStream and get them back again, because ObjectOutputStreams have headers that won't be understood when you read the file back, unless you can organize to know where the boundaries between appends are and create a new ObjectInputStream each time as appropriate. In general this is infeasible un;ess you have a supplementary index for the file, in whcih case you might as well using blobs in a dataase. You could read the file in and write out a new one with all the original objects plus the new one each time, or better still keep the file open while you still have objects to write, if possible.
