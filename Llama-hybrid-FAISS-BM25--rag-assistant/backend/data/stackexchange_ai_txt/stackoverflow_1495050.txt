Not quite the answer I was looking for .. but have hacked my way aroung this using a post save method in the parent controller (event) and checking through the child objects to inspect if the contact was new or existing.. I then update the intemediary table event_contacts manually... Not the most elegant solution but it works and allows me to move on... Still would appreciate any guidance as to how to do this the rails way..
