I played with this recently, starting from this or a very similar piece of code, and I think the construction of the resourceName is wrong. Try putting a breakpoint at the beginning of the resolve method, and then calling GetManifestResourceNames() on the executing assembly to see what name it is actually giving your embedded resources. I suspect it's probably "dlls.Functions.Shared" and so forth instead of "AssemblyLoadingAndReflection.Functions.Shared"
