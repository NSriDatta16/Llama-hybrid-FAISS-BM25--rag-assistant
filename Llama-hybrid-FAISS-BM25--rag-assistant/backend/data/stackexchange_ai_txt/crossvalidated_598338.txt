What is the relationship between the threshold and decision boundary in logistic regression?

I've been studying Logistic regression for a few weeks and I have a doubt. According to what I've been studying, Logistic regression fits a sigmoid function $$ \frac{1}{1+e^{-(wx+b)}}$$ to the data and gives us the probability of an example being $y=1$ based on input features $x$ . And then we set a threshold value to classify the examples, usually $0.5$ , so if $y=0.6$ , then it's classified as $y=1$ . But also, the algorithm fits a straight line $wx+b=0$ to separate data that is called "decision boundary". The relationship between the threshold, the sigmoid and the decision boundary confuses me a lot, especially when I see graphically logistic regression. I don't understand, where is the sigmoid function? And in this graph, where is the decision boundary? Sometimes I see that the threshold is called decision boundary, but I don't think that is correct.
