Negative binomial regression analysis with crossed random effects

I face a challenge in running a model comprising (1) crossed random effects and (2) a zero-inflated negative binomial regression in R. In the study, I analyze interactions between organizations. Specifically, I check how often x dyads of organizations supported each other. For instance, how often did organization A (sender) support organization B (receiver)? Next, how often did organization B support organization A? The data structure looks like this: Given that all organizations in the sample once interact with one another, it seems to be a case of crossed level effects. Furthermore, since the dependent data is a count variable (e.g., number of times one orga A supports B) with excessive amounts of zeros (many observations with no support), I think a zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis needs to be employed. So far, I discovered syntaxes for either crossed-level effects or negative binomial regression analyses. However, I did not find a syntax that integrates both kinds of analyses. Please find below these syntaxes. Are they compatible and how can they be merged? Furthermore, I am wondering how simple slopes tests can be conducted for these kinds of models to test the interaction. I would be extremely grateful for your advice. Many thanks in advance. crossed-effects lmer(Support ~ IncomeSender * IncomeReceiver + (1|SupportSender) + (1|SupportReceiver)) multilevel negative binomial regression with the GLMMadaptive package; not sure which values should be inserted for random and fixed. gm1
