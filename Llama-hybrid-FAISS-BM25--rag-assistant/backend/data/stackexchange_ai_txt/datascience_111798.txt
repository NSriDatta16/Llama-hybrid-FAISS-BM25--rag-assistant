All Categorical data

I need some feedback on a problem I have been working on. I am working with a fairly balanced dataset with all categorical features, and a categorical outcome (classification problem). The data has no continuous numerical features. To predict my outcome on testset I am using xgboost algorithm. Since I have all categorical predictors I am using one-hot encoding to handle my categorical features. Now I am a bit worried that I might be missing something in the process, so I wanted to check if I have all categorical features with a binary outcome is this a valid approach? I don't see any other way to deal with this problem. FYI the categorical variables are not things like ZIP codes, IDs...they are actually relevant to the outcome...e.g. smoker (yes/no) | high bp (yes/no) What do you think?
