Use some Javascript. Jquery makes thoose things quite easy. Do you already have the information or is it something you want to pull from the server when the mouse is hovering? With Jquery you could do something like this $(document).ready( function(){ $("divToShow").hide(); $('#objectWithMouseOver').mouseover(onMouseOver()); }); function onMouseOver() { $('#divToShow').show(); } whatever info you want to show.... when you drag mouse over here the other will show I would use addclass removeclass instead of show/hide to get better control. Its not hard to extend it to call mvc controls and populate data using ajax. Add some parameters to the function and the use jquery.ajax functions.
