rails expiring cache

I entered some products data into a table using a migration. I need to expire the page and fragment cache when I update, add, delete products from this table. I created a sweeper for this. class ProductSweeper 'ProductsController', :action => 'index') expire_fragment 'listed_products' end end Then in script/console I update the product name and saved. When I reload my app in the browser it still gives me a cache hit. Cached fragment hit: views/listed_products (0.2ms) Can someone tell me how to expire this cache. I will not be adding, updating, deleting products through a controller action. thanks, ash More info: "/layouts/product", :collection => Product.listed_products %> here is the partial.
