Geocode database

Can I download address,city,state,postalcode - latitude/longitude information, that can be loaded to a db for US alone.. Also do comment about their accuracy and coverage.. I suppose all GPS devices do this.. any pointers where I can extract this info?? I tried google maps json api.. and don't like the idea that they rate limit the number of requests per second.. Thanks, Ramya Edit: What I am looking for is "address , city , state , postalcode, latitude/longitude" in csv or dump.. that I can query locally.. ofcourse.. free of cost (non commercial).
