Interesting philosophical issues arise with very small Poisson rates. Also with the choosing of appropriate prior distributions for Bayesian analysis of low rates. Hypthetical particle. Suppose I'm looking for evidence of a theoretically predicted, but never observed G-particle. After 50 runs of my particle collider, I have seen no traces of the kind G-particles should make. So in 50 runs I have seen no evidence that G-particles exist. According to your prior, I have two possible 95% credible intervals: two-sided $(0.0005, 0.0738)$ and one-sided $[0, 0.0600)$ or "rate below 0.06." qgamma(c(.025,.975),1,50) [1] 0.0005063562 0.0737775891 qgamma(.95,1,50) [1] 0.05991465 On what grounds would you defend the two-sided interval with its lower bound $0.0005?$ Certainly, I have no empirical evidence for existence of G-particles, so that implied possibility of a non-zero rate relies altogether on (perhaps unintended) 'information' from my "noninformative" prior. You ask, "How would you argue against using a one-sided credible interval?" In this scenario, I would not make such an argument. But as always, you might find someone with a different opinion. Rare particle. How is it different if I am trying to figure out if my collider is capable of observing H-particles, which are known to exist, but to be very rare? Then I might choose a prior that focuses on the characteristics of my collider. The lower limit of a two-sided credible interval might be interpreted as a lower limit of my ability to detect H-particles.
