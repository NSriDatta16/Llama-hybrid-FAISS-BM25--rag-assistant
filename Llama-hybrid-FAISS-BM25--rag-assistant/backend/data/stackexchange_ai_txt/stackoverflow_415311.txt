I have to agree with @Grauenwolf that it seems reasonable. Depending on commonality you may want to provide a mechanism for encapsulating configuration retrieval (a way to pull out/set commandline args) or how to execute the application (Sync or ASync). If you find one that exists already, try putting a wrapper around it and continue. There is not too much effort in adding this extra layer and helps better separate application concerns. I feel that it is okay and can help enhance testability through mocking. AppLauncherBase or AppExecutorBase? There is no reason why the application needs to be external. Not the best names ever invented but I would try to encapsulate the purpose of the class, launching/executing applications. You may want to consider having a convention used to define configuration data/application path information in the App.Config and then implement the logic for retrieving it in the base class as the default. Good luck and I hope this helps.
