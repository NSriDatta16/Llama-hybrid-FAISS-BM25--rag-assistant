Visual Studio 2010 auto hide toolbox tab

In VS 2010 when you drag one control to your page (left mouse button is still clicked and cursor is on the page area) so the toolbox tab (from your left side - and auto hide) is still there and it seems auto hide not work. But in VS 2008 everything was ok! What is the problem about that / I am looking for this answer because when you drag something on your page you can not see the right element for dropping that control !!! Any idea?
