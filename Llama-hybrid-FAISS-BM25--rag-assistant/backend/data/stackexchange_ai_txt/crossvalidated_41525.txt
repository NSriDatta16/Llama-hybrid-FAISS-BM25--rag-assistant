Free data set for comparing kernel logistic regression and regular logistic regression

I'm looking for a data set that is easily accessible for comparing Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) and regular logistic regression. All the paper that I find using KLR use synthetic data sets. I'm most interested in data sets with continuous variables, so I can apply the squared exponential kernel. Data sets with a binary target and spatial predictor variables would also be interesting.
