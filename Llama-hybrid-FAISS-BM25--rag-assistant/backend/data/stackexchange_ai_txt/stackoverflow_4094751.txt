May not answer all your questions directly, nevertheless I decided to put it up here for future reference. Also please take it with a pinch of salt as this is based on my understanding of the events that have happened in the C++ Standard world, rather than the actuals. Read this . I don't have the ARM with me, but the article gives necessary details. Note 115 in C++0x says 115) Access declarations are deprecated; member using-declarations (7.3.3) provide a better means of doing the same things. In earlier versions of the C++ language, access declarations were more limited; they were generalized and made equivalent to using-declarations in the interest of simplicity. Programmers are encouraged to use using-declarations, rather than the new capabilities of access declarations, in new code. In summary: I think the ARM prohibited it initially: An access declaration may not be used to restrict access to a member that is accessible in the base class, nor may it be used to enable access to a member that is not accessible in the base class. But later on I guess when the Standard evolved this was eventually allowed
