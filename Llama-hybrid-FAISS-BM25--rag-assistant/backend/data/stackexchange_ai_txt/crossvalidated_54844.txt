I would suggest functional data analysis but I suspect you might have a lot of families with too few children to get reasonable estimates. Go ahead and read into it though, as it addresses your needs. Perhaps someone has used it with similar data already. If you don't want to do something as massively non parametric as that, you should use your clinical expertise to reduce the dimensionality of the data. For example, one variable in your model could be number of children, another could be average number of years between children, and so on. If there is any effect in these variables, it may show up even if you haven't correctly specified the functional form immediately. Further knowledge-driven model building may allow you to build a highly predictive model--just make sure you keep a validation set!
