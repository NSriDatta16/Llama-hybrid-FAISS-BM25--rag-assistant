If you have a reasonable hunch about the data generating process that is responsible for the data in question then you could use bayesian ideas to estimate the missing data. Under the bayesian approach you would simply assume that the missing data are also random variables and construct the posterior for the missing data conditional on the observed data. The posterior means would then be used as a substitute for the missing data. The use of bayesian models may qualify as imputation under a broad sense of the term but I thought of mentioning it as it did not appear on your list.
