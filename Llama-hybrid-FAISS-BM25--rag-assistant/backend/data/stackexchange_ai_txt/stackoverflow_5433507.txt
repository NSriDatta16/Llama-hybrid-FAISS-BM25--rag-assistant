The answer is to retrieve the answer by using the COUNT(*) function in SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS individual_count FROM user WHERE type = 'individual'; SELECT COUNT(*) AS organization_count FROM user WHERE type = 'organization'; SELECT COUNT(*) AS country_count FROM user GROUP BY country; The last will group your query set by the country name, and will result in one row for each country. Using COUNT on this result set will give the count of distinct coutries. You can then fetch this value by using mysql_fetch_assoc on your $result from mysql_query, and the answer will be contained in 'invididual_count', 'organization_count' and 'country_count' for each query.
