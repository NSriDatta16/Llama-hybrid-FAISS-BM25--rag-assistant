The fact that additional variables make large changes in your model doesn't mean there is collinearity nor does it mean it isn't "robust" (although I guess that depends on what you mean by "robust"). Nor does a reasonable VIF and a high F mean that additional variables won't have an effect. Only completely independent variables will have no effect on the other coefficients, and variables can be a long way from independent without having high VIF. It means that controlling for those additional variables makes a large difference in the other relationships. You haven't said what any of these variables are, so it's hard to be specific. However, let's imagine simpler models: Model 1: log(income) as effect of race/ethnic group Model 2: log(income) as effect of race/ethnic group + age The coefficients in both models will likely all be significant (if it's a reasonable sample size). But the coefficient of race/ethnicity will (I bet) drop in the 2nd model because the average age of different ethnic groups is different, and income tends to be related to age. EDIT in response to edit in post: Since you have country level and company level variables, you should not use OLS regression as the data are not independent. You need to account for this. One way is with mixed models (aka multilevel models). I don't know how SPSS does this, but in SAS it would be PROC MIXED and in R it would be nlme or lme4 .
