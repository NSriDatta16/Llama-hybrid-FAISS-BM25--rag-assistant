Mean square convergence of a series of stationary random variables

In Brockwell and Davis's book (Time Series Theory and Methods 2nd Edition), provide the following problem: Show that if $\{X_t, t=0, \pm1, \dots\}$ is weak stationary and $|\theta| then for each $n$ , $\sum_{j=1}^{m} \theta^j X_{n+1-j}$ converges in mean square as $m \rightarrow \infty $ . I tried to show Cauchy convergence in the mean square sense as follows: $$\mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{m} \theta^j X_{n+1-j} - \sum_{j=1}^{k} \theta^j X_{n+1-j}\right)^2 \quad \text { for } m > k\\ = \mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{j=k+1}^{m} \theta^j X_{n+1-j}\right)^2\\ = \mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{i=k+1}^{m} \sum_{j=k+1}^{m} \theta^i \theta^j X_{n+1-i} X_{n+1-j}\right)$$ But I am a bit stuck from here. Anyone to help?
