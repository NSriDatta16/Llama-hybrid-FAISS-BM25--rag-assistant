This is C# not C++ - you are truly working against the garbage collector here. Memory allocation is generally very fast in C#, also it doesn't suffer from memory fragmentation one of the other main reasons to pre-allocate in C++. Having said that and you still want to do it I would just use the array index and length, so you can use Array.Copy to write at that position. Edit: As others have pointed out the ArraySegment fits your needs better: it limits the consumer to just his slice of the array and it doesn't require to allocate a separate array before updating the content in the original array (as represented by the ArraySegment).
