Can only connect to SQL Sever 2008 Express remotely afer server restart

I am running SQL Server 2008 Express and can connect to it fine using port forwarding through my router, AND when I am on the same subnet. However when I am on a different subnet, I can only connect to it right after I restart the SQL Server Agent. After the restart, I can connect to it, however if I close the connection, I have to restart the service again to connect to it remotely on a different subnet. Why does this happen? thanks
