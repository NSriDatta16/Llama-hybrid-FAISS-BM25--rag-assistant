Daily repeated measures with normalization

I have 2 Groups (Control and TRT, n=6x2) run in parrallel and I would like to highligh the potential effect of the treatement on variables (mydata[,ii]) measured daily (Day) during 80 days. If I expect different reponses among the time, should I group my days by "Week" or should I keep "Days"? Some variables are with high inter-animal variability at the begining of the experiment and with different slopes so I plan to use a random and slope intercept model RandomIntercept But for some variable, this model does not converge... Other variables that I would like to test are normalized at the begining of the experiment meaning that each animal starts with the same intercept already. Which model/test do you recommand for this type of data (I also have daily measure over 80days)? Is it possible to run a mixed model with only random slope? Many thanks in advance! Edit following comments: Good point Robert, I added Days as a fixed effect , I am working on the quadratic effect, I never used splines, I need to do some research. I can defintely share a subset of my data: Random Intercept and slope model: (does not converge) > RandomInterceptNSlope $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.758143 (tol = 0.002, component 1) 3: Some predictor variables are on very different scales: consider rescaling > RandomInterceptNSlope Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerModLmerTest'] Formula: pHF48h ~ Group * Week * Days + (Days | Animal) Data: mydata REML criterion at convergence: -1613.638 Random effects: Groups Name Std.Dev.
