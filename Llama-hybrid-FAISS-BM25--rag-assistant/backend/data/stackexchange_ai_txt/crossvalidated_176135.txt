Can bagging and random subspaces method be used to assemble logistic regression models?

I am after applications and theoretical knowledge of using bagging and random subspaces to assemble logistic regression models, just like how they are used to assemble decision trees to form a random forest model. Some of the questions I would like answered are: 1) Can it be done? 2) Is it useful to do this? I ask this in the sense that random forests have proven themselves to be quite capable when benchmarked against other algorithms. 3) Does the result from random forests, that the out of bag error approximates cross validation error hold true if logistic regression models are used instead of decision trees?
