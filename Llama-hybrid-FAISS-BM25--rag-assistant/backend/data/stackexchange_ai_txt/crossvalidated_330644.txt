What does a large Relative Risk Ratio mean?

I run a multinomial logistic regression model on a dependent variable Y with five levels (with one of them set as a reference). Though the outputs of the model were in line with my expectations, I have HUGE relative risk estimates on the intercept values of some variables (in the thousands). I believe this can be due to the low number of cases in some of the levels; for example, one level has only 42 cases while the reference has 858. Could this be a factor in getting overinflated risk estimates? And is it wrong to report such bizarre estimates?
