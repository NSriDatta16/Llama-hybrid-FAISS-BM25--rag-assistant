I think the variable ticketcount does not follow Poisson distribution because its maximum is total number of tickets, but there is no upper limit for Poisson distribution. Maybe you can try logistic regression. It means assuming that ticketcount follows binomial distribution with probability $\pi$ and number of trials = ticketcount + ticketsremain . And $\log\left(\frac\pi{1-\pi}\right)=X\beta$
