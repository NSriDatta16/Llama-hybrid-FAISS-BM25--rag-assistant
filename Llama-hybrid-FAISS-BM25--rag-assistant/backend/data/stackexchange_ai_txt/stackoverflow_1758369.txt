The lcov utility is nice, and we use it. But I'm not sure if you need it for what you want. We Use ctags ( wikipedia ; sourceforge ) to find all the functions declared in the relevant header files. Run GCOV to get line coverage for every function in the binary. Compare the list of functions from 1 & 2 to produce "Functions Called" / "Functions Available". We call it "API coverage" since we apply step #1 only to public API headers. But you can do it on all headers or only a subset as you choose. I think the ratio we produce in this manner is the ratio you are looking for.
