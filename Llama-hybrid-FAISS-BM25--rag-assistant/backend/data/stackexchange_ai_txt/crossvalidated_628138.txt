Statistical difference between very small distributions

I am evaluating machine learning classifiers with 4-cross validation due to very small dataset. Is there a way to determine if a classifier is better (other than F1 averages) from only 4 performance data points for each model? Example of the data (models with F1 scores for every fold): model1 0.730547 0.734663 0.743797 0.746269 model2 0.748173 0.730182 0.742915 0.759907 model3 0.7434 0.750359 0.745455 0.772257 If I do a standard one-way Anova test with p=0.05 these tests the distributions aren't significantly diffrent from each other. I fear that I can't use Anova in this case as I can't check the prerequisites of the test, other than the data being independent from each other.
