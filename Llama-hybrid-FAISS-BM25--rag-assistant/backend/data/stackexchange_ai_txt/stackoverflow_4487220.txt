How to get an object to follow a path

I'm having some trouble getting an object to follow a path that is drawn with a touch event. The problem is more in the smoothness of which the object follows the path. /* the ACTION_MOVE code */ Hashtable ht = new Hashtable (); for (int h = 0; h I grab the coordinates as the user drags their finger across the screen using the historic methods so I don't miss any points. The problem is the smoothness that the object moves along this path. If you draw your path slow then the droid will move slowly across the screen ( because more x,y points are captured? ) But if you draw the line fast then the droid moves really fast. I need the object to move at a consistent speed across the path. I somehow need to regulate the spacing between the points added to the hashTable or the sample rate at which points are read in so its consistent and the object looks smooth following the path. I've googled this one a good bit and i'm having some trouble finding anything. Any shove in the right direction would be appreciated. Thanks so much!
