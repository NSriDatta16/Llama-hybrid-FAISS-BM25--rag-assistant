How to recognize product based on image using neural network?

Company has many products in their offer (some about 100,000), some of these are very similar to each other. In database there is available only one image per product. Company want to make possible to recognize product based on video camera and display its specification. Is it possible to train new model with this kind of data or build it using existing model?
