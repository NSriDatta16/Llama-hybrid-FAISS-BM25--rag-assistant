glm() with binary outcome not specify family = binomial

I ran glm() for a binary outcome(0/1) not specifying family = binomial. So i just found that it ran as family= gaussian. I already shared the odds ratios results with my clients and the odds ratios had a big difference..it seems went too far…..What is the best way to deal with this? Is there any way to deliver the real logistic regression model output and not really looking stupid like “i tried a different approach blah blah and found this!” Please help!!
