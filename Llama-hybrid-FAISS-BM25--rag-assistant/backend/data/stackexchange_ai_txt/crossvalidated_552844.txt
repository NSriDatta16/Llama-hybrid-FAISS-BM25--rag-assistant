As the first comment suggests, you can answer whether the two sets of covariates (V1-V30) and (V31-V53) are correlated using canonical correlations. Remember to remove one covariate from (V1-V30) since otherwise it will not have full rank: the sum of the 30 covariates is 1! Perhaps it would be sufficient to perform the general test for any presence of canonical correlation given in the wiki link, report your test statistic and p-value to show that the sets of variables are correlated. Next I recommend performing a PCA on the variables (V31-V53), remembering to center and scale them. Pick a suitable number of principal components to explain variation in the original set of covariates, and create scatter plots between each pair of these principal components while labeling country location to visually assess if the data may be linear separated by any of these principal components. If so, one can use linear discriminant analysis with the principal components acting as the covariates. It's also worthwhile to note that factor analysis or the normal linear factor model is very closely related to principal component analysis: the number of latent variables included in the factor model will be similar to the number of principal components recommended by diminishing returns in their explained variation.
