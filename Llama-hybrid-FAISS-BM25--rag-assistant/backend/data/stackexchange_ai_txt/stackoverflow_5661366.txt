In your code you split the String into an array of strings and then access the wrong index of the array, so it isn't doing what you want. Try working with a substring instead. Find the index of the last '_' and then get the substring: private string CheckAndReplace(string given, string toAdd) { int index = given.LastIndexOf('_')+1; return given.Substring(0,index) + toAdd; } But before that check the validity of the string (see other answers). This code fragment will break when there's no '_' in the string.
