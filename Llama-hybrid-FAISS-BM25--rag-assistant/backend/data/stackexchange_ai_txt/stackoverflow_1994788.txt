Extensionless URLs with Parameters, what about 404s?

I'm creating a new url infrastructure for my sites, and came across this problem: If I have an extensionless URL like this "/Products/Beverages/Minty-chocolate-drink/Distributors", I can't distinguish parameters from pages... I can find out which page was called by finding the longest match in my pages and treat the rest as parameters, but what about a page-not-found scenario? An URL like "/Prodcts/Beverages/Minty-chocolate-drink/Distributors" (note wrong spelling in "Prodcts") will not throw a 404, but instead map to the index page, with all the URL as parameters! Now, I can segment the parameters with f.ex. [page]/p/[parameters], but that's pretty unstylish and not very user friendly. Do you see another solution that would keep the URL in the first example, but enable a page-not-found scenario?
