Binary search of a C# list using delegate condition

I have a List that I want to search not for a given item but for an item satisfying a given condition. Given an item in the list I can test which of 4 conditions is true: the desired item must be to the left the desired item must be to the right this is the desired item the desired can't be in the list A quick glance at the list functions was not encouraging so I'm wondering if anyone knows off a function I can use? Edit: this is a local temp list so I known that it will be sorted correctly Edit: BinarySearch looks almost right but in my case I don't have an item to compare with. I'd use Jon Skeet's solution and ignore one arg, but I'm not sure that I can count on it always being the same arg.
