The components of an autoencoder are supposedly even less reliable than your usual clustering. Why don't you just try it: train autoencoders on some data sets, and visualize the "clusters" you get from the components? While this great answer on tSNE for clustering is specific for tSNE, I believe the results for other such encoders will be similar: they will cause fake clusters because of emphasizing some random fluctuations in data.
