What happens if you just do std::string operationalReason; ? That should have the same effect as the two examples you provided. If in fact you're experiencing problems when you use the std::string operationalReason = ""; form that may indicate that the string data storage has been corrupted, but it may equally mean that some OTHER part of memory is corrupted and that particular line causes it to manifest differently. Does your code crash immediately when you use the "" form or later on at runtime? Are you able to run this under valgrind or similar to see if it spots memory problems? What happens if you initialized the string to some literal other than "" ?
