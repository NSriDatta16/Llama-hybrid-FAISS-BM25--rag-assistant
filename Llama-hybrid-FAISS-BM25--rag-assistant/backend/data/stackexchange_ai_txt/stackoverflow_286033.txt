This is overly large because you are never going to have that many rows. The larger size will result in more storage space. This is not a big deal in itself but will also mean more disk reads to retrieve data from a table or index. It will mean less rows will fit into memory on the database server. I don't think it's broken enough to be bothered fixing.
