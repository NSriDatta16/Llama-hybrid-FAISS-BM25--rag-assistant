Why is regularization used only in training but not in testing?

From the book Hands-On Machine Learning: Note that the regularization term should only be added to the cost function during training. Once the model is trained, you want to use the unregularized performance measure to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. Why wouldn't you use the same model for both training and testing?
