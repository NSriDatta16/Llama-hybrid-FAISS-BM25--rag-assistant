Have a look at JAMon API . JAMon gathers aggregate performance statistics such as hits, execution times (total, average, minimum, maximum, standard deviation), as well as concurrency information such as simultaneous application requests. It is easy to use and provides multiple ways to view the reports. Edit: Also as suggested by @duffymo , there are already available interceptors out of the box with spring for jamon integrarion. This link may provide a direction.
