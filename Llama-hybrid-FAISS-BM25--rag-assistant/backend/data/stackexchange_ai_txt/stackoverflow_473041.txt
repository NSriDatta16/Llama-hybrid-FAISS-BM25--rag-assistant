How can I change some existing Java XSLT code using Xalan to use Saxon and TinyTree

I have some existing Java code that does an XSLT transform programmatically - originally using Xalan. I have refactored it to be able to use another (externally configured) TransformerFactory. I have tried using the Saxon (v6.5.3 and v8.7) factory, but do not see any perfromance improvements - if anything Saxon is slower and uses more memory than Xalan. I understand that I could get some performance dvantage using the Saxon TinyTree, but can not figure out how to do so with this code. My code is of the form; TransformerFactory tf = (TransformerFactory) transformerFactoryClass.newInstance(); Transformer t = tf.newTransformer(pTransformFile); t.transform(new StreamSource(pSourceFile), new StreamResult(pTargetFile)); Where 'transformerFactoryClass' is an instance of the configured TransformerFactory class - org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl for Xalan - net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl for Saxon 8.7, and - com.icl.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl for Saxon 6.5.3 Any suggestions?
