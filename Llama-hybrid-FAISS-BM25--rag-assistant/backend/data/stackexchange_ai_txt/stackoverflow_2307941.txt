As Pekka says this could turn into a big project .. your description is pretty general and as you know the devil is in the detail ! but there are a number of options .. you may be able to use Folder.WebViewURL Property of a folder that you have created in outlook and show your app via a web app (you can build that on any tech stack you like) ok drag and drop may become a little tricky to do. Outlook forms could also be used. A form can call out to your web service and display what you want. There is some info about form on SO but http://www.outlookcode.com/article.aspx?ID=35 is the best place. Subclassing .. you can then create your own tree under the outlook tree and display whatever you want in the right hand pane such as grids forms etc. these can interact with the normal outlook folders and you can do your drag and drop though you woudl have to create Outlook Items to display them in the inbox. There is a tutorial on the technique http://www.codeproject.com/KB/office/additional_panel_Outlook.aspx though not doing exactly what you want but the technique is sound. Next up build your own MAPI Message Store Provider which is probally the hardest thing to do on the list. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc842153.aspx As I said your question is no functional spec and there are always many ways to skin the cat but 2 or 3 are probaly where you shoudl look at unless it simple enough just a display a web app. Marcus
