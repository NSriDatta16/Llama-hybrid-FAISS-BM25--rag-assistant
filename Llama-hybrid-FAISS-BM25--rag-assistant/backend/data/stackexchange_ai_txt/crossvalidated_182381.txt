Sure you can use deep neural networks for many problems apart from image or speech recognition. The problem is if you really need it. Deep neural networks are far more powerful than a simple MLP however they also take more resources and are more difficult to develop. Thus they are used in really complex domains. You could use them to solve easier problems but usually simpler models obtain good results too. Using deep neural networks for easy problems will be like killing flies with a bazooka, sure you'll kill them but couldn't you find a simpler way?
