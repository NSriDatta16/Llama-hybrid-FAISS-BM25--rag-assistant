As you are probably referring to the difference between lack of correlation and independence, we can generally say the following. Correlation measures linear association between two given variables. Independence must be understood in broader sense, also non-linear (i.e. the definition of independence requires no relationship between any function of the two variables).. In the case of time series, if for example the Arma structure modeling the conditional mean is not significant, then there is not a linear relationship between a variable and its past values (no serial correlation), but there may exist a relationship between the squared variable and its squared past values (as we are supposing the Arma structure is 0, otherwise we would have said the “a relationship between the squared difference between the variable and its Arma conditional mean and its past values”) . If this happens, the Arch structure is significant. Which is why Arch refers to the modeling of the second moment of the conditional distribution. Which answers also your second question.
