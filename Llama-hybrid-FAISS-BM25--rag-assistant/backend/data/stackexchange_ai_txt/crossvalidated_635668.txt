It's unrealistic to expect the model-predicted survival probability for a group to match the results of your calculations based on the individuals. The nonlinearities in fitting Cox models make that difficult even when you have a model without frailty terms or random effects. The survival probability prediction at the average age of your group need not be the same as the average survival of your group. The problems are discussed in Chapter 10 of Therneau and Grambsch . The predicted survival probability at time $t$ in a Cox model can be related to the estimated baseline cumulative hazard function $\hat\Lambda_0$ , the vector of covariate values $X$ and the corresponding vector of Cox coefficient estimates $\hat\beta$ by: $$S(t) = \exp(-e^{X'\hat\beta} \hat\Lambda_0(t))= \exp(-\text{HR } \hat\Lambda_0(t)),$$ where $\text{HR}$ is the hazard ratio (relative to baseline) corresponding to the covariate values. Although the instantaneous hazard is proportional to $\text{HR}$ , the survival probability at any time is exponentially related to $\text{HR}$ . That's even more of a problem with frailty or random-effect terms. Predictions from such models are provided for a random-effect term of 0, so predictions and simple averages are even less likely to match (and then, only by chance). You could avoid that last problem while taking correlations among observations into account by using a cluster() term instead of a frailty() or random-effect term. That gives a marginal model for the population rather than a model conditional upon an individual's frailty/random-effect value. What's probably best is to show the survival curve over time at representative values for the covariates that aren't of primary interest. If you need something more elaborate, consult Chapter 10 of Therneau and Grambsch.
