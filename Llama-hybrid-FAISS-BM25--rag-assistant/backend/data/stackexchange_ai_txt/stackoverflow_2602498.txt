Ruby -- looking for some sort of "Regexp unescape" method

I have a bunch of string with special escape codes that I want to store unescaped- eg, the interpreter shows "\\014\"\\000\"\\016smoothing\"\\011mean\"\\022color\"\\011zero@\\016" but I want it to show (when inspected) as "\014\"\000\"\016smoothing\"\011mean\"\022color\"\011zero@\016" What's the method to unescape them? I imagine that I could make a regex to remove 1 backslash from every consecutive n backslashes, but I don't have a lot of regex experience and it seems there ought to be a "more elegant" way to do it. For example, when I puts MyString it displays the output I'd like, but I don't know how I might capture that into a variable. Thanks! Edited to add context: I have this class that is being used to marshal / restore some stuff, but when I restore some old strings it spits out a type error which I've determined is because they weren't -- for some inexplicable reason -- stored as base64. They instead appear to have just been escaped, which I don't want, because trying to restore them similarly gives the TypeError TypeError: incompatible marshal file format (can't be read) format version 4.8 required; 92.48 given because Marshal looks at the first characters of the string to determine the format. require 'base64' class MarshaledStuff Edit 2: Changed wording -- I was thinking they were "double-escaped" but it was only single-escaped. Whoops!
