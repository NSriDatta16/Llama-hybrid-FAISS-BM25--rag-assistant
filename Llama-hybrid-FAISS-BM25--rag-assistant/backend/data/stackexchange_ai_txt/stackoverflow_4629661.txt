The important portion of the error messages you're seeing is this: Failed to get agent process proxy: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Any time you see a message containing the key phrase Object reference not set to an instance of an object in Visual Studio (or in an event log message originating from Visual Studio) you should read it like this: Visual Studio integration of this feature has been implemented somewhere on the scale between 'weak' and 'craptacular'. Shut down Visual Studio, all other processes, reboot the machine, restart Visual Studio, and hope for better results next time. Or maybe the time after that. Sorry. It's just such an enormous product that there's going to always be portions of it that aren't really implemented well. Those pieces will always stick out badly from an otherwise excellent piece of software.
