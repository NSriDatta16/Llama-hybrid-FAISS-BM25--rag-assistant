Correct arguments for svm() function in R

I'm looking to implement a linear and non-linear SVM in R but having some confusion over which argument to use in svm() . For the linear SVM I want to add in the penalty $\gamma$ for soft margin. This is the gamma = argument, correct? How is it different from the cost = or epsilon = argument? Secondly, under the RBF kernel in the non-linear SVM, what is the sigma/bandwidth argument called?
