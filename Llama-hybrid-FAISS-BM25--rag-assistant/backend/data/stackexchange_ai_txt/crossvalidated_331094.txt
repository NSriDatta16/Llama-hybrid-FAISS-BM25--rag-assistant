How about the following distribution on variables $x_i \in \texttt{ascii}$: $P(x_i ... x_k) = 0$ if $x_1x_2\ldots x_k$ is not a valid program in C (or your favorite formal language) $P(x_i ... x_k) \propto w^{-1}$ otherwise, where $w$ is the number of characters $x_i$ which are not spaces. I think this is a reasonable example because It's fairly interpretable: Sample random C programs inversely proportional to their (non whitespace) length. There is no trivial solution -- simply sampling valid programs is nontrivial. Rejection sampling is also hard, since most of the mass lies with in a small number of programs. Computing the partition function is also intractable for moderate values of $k$. An MCMC approach seems feasible in this case. There are many reasonable proposal distributions. Although the mixing time might be huge.
