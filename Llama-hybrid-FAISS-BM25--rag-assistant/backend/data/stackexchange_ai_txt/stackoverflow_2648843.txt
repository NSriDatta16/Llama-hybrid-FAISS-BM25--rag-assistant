How optimizations can be configured is compiler dependent. The manual for SDCC has its optimization options listed under section 3.28. You can use both command line options or pragmas at the source code level. Try out disabling optimizations globally to see if you get the same effect. Normally stepping through code in a debugger with optimizations disabled will eliminate the problem of not being able to set a breakpoint. If this works fine you can try disabling suspect optimizations at the function level with pragmas to see which one might be causing the problem.
