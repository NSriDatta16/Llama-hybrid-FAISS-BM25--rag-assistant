Detecting manipulation (e.g, photo copy-pasting) in images

I am looking for a solution to detect photos that are manipulated with tools such as Photoshop. For a start, I want to detect copy-pasted images. Any idea how to detect photos that are manipulated by pasting another photo on the top of the original photo? For example, detecting a photo of an id card with a photo of a face pasted in the place of an original face. To make it even more difficult, let's assume we down sample the image after pasting the face in place. This will smooth the sharp edges of the pasted image. Update 1: 1) It seems that compression techniques as well as straight forward cnn training don't work. 2) This is a relevant post 3) This , is a summary of photo forensic methods. Update 2: Since there was no real progress in here, I am starting a bounty. Update 3: Thank to the bounty and @machine-epsilon, we have a valid answer! Update 4: Since this paper came out at ICCV2019, I just add it here.
