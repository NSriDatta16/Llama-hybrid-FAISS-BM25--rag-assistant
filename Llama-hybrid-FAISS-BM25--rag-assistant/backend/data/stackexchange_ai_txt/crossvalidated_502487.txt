Addressing your question at the end, it is in fact possible for statement (1) to be true: $X$ and $Y$ may be unconditionally independent but conditionally dependent given $Z$ . In the case that $Z$ is observed, the $X \to Z \leftarrow Y$ subgraph is referred to as an "activated v-structure". For an intuitive example, let $X, Y, Z$ be indicator random variables as follows: $X = 1$ iff my bus was late. $Y = 1$ iff I overslept. $Z = 1$ iff I am late to work. In general $X$ and $Y$ will be unconditionally independent: knowing whether I overslept tells you nothing about whether my bus was late, in the absence of further information. If, however, you know that I am late to work ( $Z=1$ ), then $X$ and $Y$ become conditionally dependent: knowing that I didn't oversleep should increase your belief that my bus was late, for example. I encourage you to try and come up with a concrete joint distribution over $X,Y,Z$ that respects the graph structure $X \to Z \leftarrow Y$ while also encoding the conditional dependence described above. (If you get stuck, check out the example from Wikipedia's article on conditional dependence.)
