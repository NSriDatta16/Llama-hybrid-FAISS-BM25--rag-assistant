This question is a lot more complex then it may seem and involves looking at the entire design of your software, rather than just your examples. There are good books on software design, and they cannot be summarized in a paragraph. For example, it might not be a good idea to do the database accesses in the same object that is part of the model. Database access may be seen as more of a technical service, unrelated to the logic of your program, hence may need a separate class (and this aids reusability). But it all depends.
