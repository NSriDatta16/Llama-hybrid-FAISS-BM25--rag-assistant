Wilson, Johnstone, Neely, and Boles wrote a nice paper surveying all sorts of different allocators . In my experience, the performance and overhead difference between a good fixed pool allocator and just relying on dlmalloc can be massive in cases where you're making lots and lots of short-lived small allocations in a limited address space (such as a system with no page file). In the app I'm working on at this moment, our main loop jumps from 30ms to >100ms if I replace our block allocator with simple calls to malloc() (and it eventually crashes due to fragmentation).
