Expected value of maximum ratio of n iid normal variables

Suppose $X_1,...,X_n$ are iid from $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ and let $X_{(i)}$ denote the $i$'th smallest element from $X_1,...,X_n$. How would one be able to upper bound the expected maximum of the ratio between two consecutive elements in $X_{(i)}$? That is, how can you calculate an upperbound on: $$E\left[\max\limits_{i=1,...,n-1}\left(\frac{X_{(i+1)}}{X_{(i)}}\right)\right]$$ The literature that I have been able to find is mostly focused on the ratio between two random variables which results in a ratio distribution for which the pdf for two uncorrelated normal distributions is given here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_distribution#Gaussian_ratio_distribution . While this would enable me to upperbound the expected average ratio of $n$ variables I can not see how to generalize this concept to finding the expected maximum ratio of $n$ variables.
