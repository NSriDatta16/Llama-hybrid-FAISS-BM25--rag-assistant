Response-distribution-dependent bias in random forest regression

I am using the randomForest package in R (R version 2.13.1, randomForest version 4.6-2) for regression and noticed a significant bias in my results: the prediction error is dependent on the value of the response variable. High values are under-predicted and low values are over-predicted. At first I suspected this was a consequence of my data but the following simple example suggests that this is inherent to the random forest algorithm: n = 1000; x1 = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1) response = x1 predictors = data.frame(x1=x1) rf = randomForest(x=predictors, y=response) error = response-predict(rf, predictors) plot(x1, error) I suspect the bias is dependent on the distribution of the response, for example, if x1 is uniformly-distributed, there is no bias; if x1 is exponentially distributed, the bias is one-sided. Essentially, the values of the response at the tails of a normal distribution are outliers. It is no surprise that a model would have difficulty predicting outliers. In the case of randomForest, a response value of extreme magnitude from the tail of a distribution is less likely to end up in a terminal leaf and its effect will be washed out in the ensemble average. Note that I tried to capture this effect in a previous example, "RandomForest in R linear regression tails mtry". This was a bad example. If the bias in the above example is truly inherent to the algorithm, it follows that a bias correction could be formulated given the response distribution one is trying to predict, resulting in more accurate predictions. Are tree-based methods, such as random forest, subject to response distribution bias? If so, is this previously known to the statistics community and how is it usually corrected (e.g. a second model that uses the residuals of the biased model as input)? Correction of a response-dependent bias is difficult because, by nature, the response is not known. Unfortunately, the estimate/predicted response does not often share the same relationship to the bias.
