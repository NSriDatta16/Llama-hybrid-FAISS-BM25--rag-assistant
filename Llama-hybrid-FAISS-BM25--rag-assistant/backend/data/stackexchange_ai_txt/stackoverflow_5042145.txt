The appropriate design for this would depend on the acceptable margin of error. If there is zero acceptable error, then you must present the users with the categories and they specify true/false yes/no for each one or select from a limited set of possible answers. HANDS: gloves mittens brass knuckles [Caveat: user could be wearing brass knuckles inside the mittens. You have to take into account whether values are mutually exclusive or not. Barefoot <> no socks. Someone who is barefoot is not wearing socks but someone not wearings socks may be wearing docksiders] FEET1: anklet socks sheer stockings fishnet stockings ragg wool hiking socks kneesocks gym socks no socks FEET2: mocassins running shoes sandals wing-tips uggs spike heels ... HEAD: sombrero beret baseball hat pirate's hat beanie knitted cap NECK: scarf mock turtleneck aka dickie Et cetera et cetera ad nauseam. Or if margin of error is very generous, you could allow simple freeform text-entry and match/partial-match on words. Slightly less error : you could set up a synonyms table and match on the synonyms of the supplied words.
