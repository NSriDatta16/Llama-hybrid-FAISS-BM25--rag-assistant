How do I lock a WPF window so it can not be moved, resized,minimized, maximized or dragged

I am looking for a simple way to lock a WPF window. Is there a simple window style or property I can set on a WPF window to locked the window? By lock I mean the user can not move, resize, drag, minimize or maximize the window.
