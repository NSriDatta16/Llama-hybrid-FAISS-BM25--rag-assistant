I agree to go for separate tables. Also note that if you do decide to insert multiple values into a column, you don't need to insert your own separators like [END], just store it in an array and use serialize($array) to serialise it before storage, then $array = unserialize($dbResponse); when retrieving it from the database. This is assuming that the data is sanitized and safe.
