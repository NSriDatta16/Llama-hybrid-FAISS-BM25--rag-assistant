Kruskal Wallis H test

I am doing a Kruskal Wallis H test, it looks like I am getting a significant difference between the non-vegetarian group and the vegan group. But not with the semi-vegetarian group and vegan group. This is odd because it looks like the difference in medians is larger between the semi-vegetarian group and vegan group, yet it is not significant. But the other comparison that has a smaller median difference is significant. Does anyone know why this would be?
