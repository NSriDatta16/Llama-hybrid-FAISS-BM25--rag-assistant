Time series-identify pattern-Autocorrelation

I am studying Time series. I am trying to identify if the pattern in the plot of residuals vs order to identify the type of autocorrelaiton: I think that it has a negative autocorrelation because almost every negative error is followed by a positive error and vice versa. However, analyzing some examples on the internet I am now confused. Can anyone help me on this?
