Fixing the position of a form

I am starting a winform application[.NET 3.5, C#], where in the the main form of the application starts at a particular specified location. Am calling the following code in the constructor for this private void SetFormPosition() { this.StartPosition = FormStartPosition.Manual; this.Left = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea.Right - this.Width; this.Top = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea.Bottom - this.Height; } After the application starts, I would like to keep the location of the form fixed throughout the application lifetime. Perhaps, I could 'tap' the Location event changed but am not sure if that would be very elegant. Please suggest. Thanks.
