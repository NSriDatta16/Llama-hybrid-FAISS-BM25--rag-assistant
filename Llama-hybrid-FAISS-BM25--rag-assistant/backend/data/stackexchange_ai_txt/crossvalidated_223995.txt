Explanation of a timeseries bootstrap to a layperson

I am trying to explain the output of a time-series bootstrap to someone who knows nothing about them. I recently learned about them myself and wanted to make sure my explanation was correct. Is this explanation correct statistically? You can use a time-series bootstrap to estimate the chance that a certain price is reached (1.3568) or exceeded within 20 timepoints. Based on a random bootstrap with 100 samples I have 2.21% chance of reaching or exceeding the value 1.3568 within 20 timepoints. set.seed(42) library(boot) myfun Output: > tsboot(log(data), statistic=myfun, R=100, l=20, parallel="multicore", sim="fixed") BLOCK BOOTSTRAP FOR TIME SERIES Fixed Block Length of 20 Call: tsboot(tseries = log(data), statistic = myfun, R = 100, l = 20, sim = "fixed", parallel = "multicore") Bootstrap Statistics : original bias std. error t1* 2.215443 0.002299522 0.2373952 Edits in bold are an attempt to clarify in response to comments.
