As for references, Data Mining Using RFM Analysis should help as far as terminology and further references go. One of the simplest (and popular) ways to model the probability of customer response is to use logistic regression with RFM as explanatory variables (among other available variables). For modeling monetary value, one could just regress revenue on RFM directly (by using a simple linear model for starters) which usually does surprisingly well. More advanced/non-linear models (such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Machine) do better than linear models in my experience. Another popular approach is to build a slightly more complex model for predicting monetary value based on two sub-models: one for probability of response (e.g. using logistic regression as a function of RFM), and the other for revenue conditional on response (again, it could be as simple as a linear model of RFM). Expected monetary value is the product of the two predictions. If randomized test/control data are available then uplift/netlift based techniques are quite popular for modeling the incremental benefit of a treatment. As for customer life cycle value, see Modeling Customer Lifetime Value for a review and further references. With regards to modeling in R, I am not aware of any "off-the-shelf" packages for that type of modeling. R does provide all necessary building blocks for that though (unless you have enormous amount of data - in that case you may have to rely on more scalable tools)
