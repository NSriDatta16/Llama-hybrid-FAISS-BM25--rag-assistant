Logistic regression is a model that estimates probabilities . For the first dataset, it will predict the probability of "success", on average, to be $\tfrac{200}{20+200}$ , in the second $\tfrac{20\,000}{20+20\,000}$ . The predicted conditional probabilities will differ depending on how exactly the datasets differ. It is a feature, not a bug. Logistic regression is a well-calibrated , so what follows, the estimated probabilities would be consistent with empirical probabilities. If, given only this data, the model told you that the probability of "success" to be $50/50$ you would be considering that something is deeply wrong with the model, as it gives predictions that are inconsistent with the data. TL;DR in both cases models would give predictions on the "scale" of probability. The values would differ depending on how the data differs, but not only in terms of total count, but also the proportions of two groups and other related characteristics.
