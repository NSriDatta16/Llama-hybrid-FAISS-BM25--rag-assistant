How to organize my servlets?

I am looking at such previous questions as: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/98334/creating-a-java-servlet-web-application How many actions should a servlet perform? There are answers in these threads that contradict each other; some people say use a servlet for each page, and other say use only ONE servlet for your entire app. I have the same problem. So, how to I decide what my servlets will be? If I use a single (or a few) "Front Controllers," how do I parse the requests to delegate them to other objects? For example, if a single page has 3 different forms on it, how do I tell the difference between their requests? How do I tell the difference between forms and requests from different pages? Assign multiple servlet-mappings for each form + page? Look at the parameter names? URL-encode a "request-type" parameter? So many ways to do things... P.S. I'd rather NOT use a framework like Struts - I want to know the best way to do this using the Servlet API. I'm using Tomcat7.
