As you do not specify which kind of model you want to implement, there is no direct answer to what you are asking. But in your last paragraph you are kind of implying that you were aiming to do a linear regression - so I am going to refer to that. The data itself does not have to be normally distributed. This again means that you do not have to meet any kind of assumption concerning homoscedasticity. However the residuals of the linear regression have to be normally distributed and homoscedastic in order to properly decide wether an estimator is significant or not. (The estimators are consistent and unbiased regardless of those assumptions, if the other Gauss-Markov assumptions are met.) So I guess you might want to create a linear regression model and estimate it. Then check if the residuals are normally distributed/homoscedastic. If this is not the case, you can use robust standard errors for example.
