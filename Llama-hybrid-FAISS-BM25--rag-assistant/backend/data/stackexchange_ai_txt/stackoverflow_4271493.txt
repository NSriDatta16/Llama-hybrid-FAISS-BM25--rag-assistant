Another possibility is result = ConstantArray[0, Dimensions[array] + {0, 1}]; result[[All, 1 ;; Last[Dimensions[array]]]] = array; result[[All, -1]] = column; which seems to be faster on my computer for large numeric matrices, although it requires an additional variable. If you're dealing with real-valued entries you'll want to use result = ConstantArray[0.0, Dimensions[array] + {0, 1}]; to keep the speed gains. There's also MapThread[Append, {array, column}] which is also fast (and elegant IMO) but will unpack the result. (But if you have symbolic entries as in the example, that's not a concern.)
