Linear Regression: Treat binomial dependent variable as normal due to large n

Say I wish to do a linear model and my dependent variable $Y$ follows a binomial distribution: $Y_i \sim Bin(n_i,p_i), i = 1,...,N$ . Usually I would use a generalized linear model and perform a logistic regression. But if the $n_i$ 's are large enough, the $Y_i$ 's will approximately follow a normal distribution, $Y_i \sim N(n_ip_i, \ n_ip_i(1-p_i))$ . So in that case shouldn't I be able to simply perform a simple linear regression, without using a generalized linear model?
