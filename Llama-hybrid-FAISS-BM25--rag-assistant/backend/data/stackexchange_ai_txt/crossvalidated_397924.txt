What does it say about your underlying system when the granular level is not predictable, but aggregations are?

This might be too "discussion-y" rather than black-or-white-answer for here, but thought I'd try. If there's a better direction someone can point me, that's fine. Example: One McDonald's store daily sales might show extremely non-patterned variability - so that forecasting methods just output a mean forecast. But when one aggregates to say the city level, of all McDonalds' in the city, the sales time series becomes more patterned. And continuing up that hierarchy to say the country level, one might have something close to complete predictability. Same applies to other dimensions like time. Hourly sales could defy forecasting beyond the mean, but as you aggregate up to day, week, month, year, extremely robust forecastable patterns can "pop up". My question is: what does this phenomenon of pattern-appearing-out-of-unpatterned-aggregations indicate about the nature of the atomic level system (in my example, the way in which McDonald's works) ? On the one hand, it sounds very central limit theorem-esque, and on the other hand I'm looking into hierarchical time series forecasting for more info. What confuses me I guess is that in fourier function approximation, the atomic level IS patterned (functions of a given set frequency), and then summed together to achieve whatever output desired. My questions seems like the opposite situation.
