Partial effect interpretation and zero conditional mean assumption

Let's say we have the following population equation. $$ y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2} + u $$ Then to explain the interpretation of $\beta_{1}$ or $\beta_{2}$ , we can look at the partial changes. $$ \Delta y = \beta_{1} \Delta x_{1} + \beta_{2} \Delta x_{2} + \Delta u $$ Now, holding all other factors fixed essentially means $\Delta x_{2}=0$ for $\beta_{1}$ . But how do we guarantee $\Delta u=0$ ? I was thinking the zero conditional mean assumption( $E[u|x_{1},x_{2}]=0$ ) should play a role, but this is saying that conditional on covariates, the average of error term is zero. It doesn't necessarily mean $\Delta u =0$ . How should I get that $\beta_{1}$ is a partial effect of $x_{1}$ on y from the equation on partial changes?
