Detect whether the ie8 xss filter is enabled

Is there a method by which we can detect if a user using ie8 has the XSS filter enabled? As far as I can tell, nothing changes in the User Agent or in the http headers when ie8 has the XSS filter enabled vs when it does not. That leaves some client-side detection of the use of the filter. Would it be possible to write a test page that will tell me if the filter is active?
