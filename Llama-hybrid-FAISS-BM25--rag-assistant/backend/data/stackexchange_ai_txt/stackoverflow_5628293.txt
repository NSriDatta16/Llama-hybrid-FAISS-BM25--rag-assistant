RenderPartial renders on Dev but fails on Production server

I'm calling a RenderPartial from a primary view where 'user' exists: @{Html.RenderPartial("DisplayTemplates/uInfo", user);} Works on my dev machine but the production server is tossing that runtime error: The partial view 'DisplayTemplates/uInfo' was not found or no view engine supports the searched locations. The following locations were searched: ... The following locations were searched: ~/Views/Account/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.aspx ~/Views/Account/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.ascx ~/Views/Shared/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.aspx ~/Views/Shared/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.ascx ~/Views/Account/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.cshtml ~/Views/Account/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.vbhtml ~/Views/Shared/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.cshtml ~/Views/Shared/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.vbhtml My file _is listed - Shared/DisplayTemplates/uInfo.cshtml and works locally. In case it's relevent - i'm taking the liberties of freely switching back and forth between Razor and legacy .aspx views. Initially was concerned about possible complications of intermingling the two but up to this point everything i've tried has worked. thx
