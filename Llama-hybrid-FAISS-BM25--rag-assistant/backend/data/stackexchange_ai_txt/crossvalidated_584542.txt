Bayesian chronology building with archeology, genetics and linguistics

Is it possible to predict the date distributions of historical events like Out Of Africa Migration? I know that archeological findings already use a bayesian method to build a chronology with bayesian statistics. Is it possible to combine that with genetic data and linguistics into one quantitative chronology that can take hints from all of all of these different sources?
