how to debug application as root in eclipse in Ubuntu?

I'm programming application using libpcap. when I debug the application in normal mode, pcap cannot get the network device. it seems that I have to debug the application in root. How can I debug the application in root? I have the root password. I think eclipse has such an option that can add root for the debugging application,but I don't know how to do it. please help.
