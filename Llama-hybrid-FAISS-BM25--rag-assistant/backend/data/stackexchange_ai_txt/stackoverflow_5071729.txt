What type of replication can be used with Oracle Database 11g R2 Standard Edition One?

My organization plans to buy two servers with two Oracle 11g R2 SE1 licenses. It is need to set up bidirectional replication between servers' databases (both databases are fully identical in DB structure and practically identical in data except table with server-specific data (application parameters values, such as server ID and so on). I think about Advanced replication (multimaster), is this match with the 11g R2 SE1 license? Is there any other Oracle solution, suitable for my circumstances and the 11g R2 SE1 license? Or, in other case, what third-party Oracle replication engine you can advise? Thanks.
