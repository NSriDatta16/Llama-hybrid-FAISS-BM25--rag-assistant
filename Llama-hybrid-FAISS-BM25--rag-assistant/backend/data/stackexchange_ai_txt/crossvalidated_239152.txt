When reporting mean values should the standard error be included?

I'm trying to understand when to report the standard error. When reporting results in a scientific paper or essay, should any mean values also have the standard error reported alongside? For example, let's say you measure the amount of toys a child buys each week over a year. You decide to calculate monthly averages. Should you also calculate the standard error and report this alongside? Such as "In January the monthly mean of toys bought were 4 (+/- 0.7)" Example Dataset Toys Bought each week Week 1: 4 Week 2: 3 Week 3: 4 Week 4: 1 Monthly average: 3 Standard Deviation: 1.41421 Standard Error: 0.707106781187 Summary Question Should you always report the standard error when reporting a mean value, or is the standard error only applicable to certain things?
