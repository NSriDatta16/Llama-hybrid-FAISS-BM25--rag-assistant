Perhaps it is a typo, but the files you are searching and the files you are creating are different. That is, the OUTPUT=... line says DAY-MONTH-YEAR , but the grep lines say MONTH-DAY-YEAR EDIT : OK, you posted the output file. There are all kinds of special chars in there, from the top command. Can you add the batch ( top -d1 -n1 -b ) arg to top to hide that? ANOTHER EDIT : Your grep commands appear to be case-specific. Is that intentional? The result has no matches for several of your grep filters. Try adding ignore case (grep -i) to the commands. Also, you are searching for "load avg" but the output says "load average" so you should never find it.
