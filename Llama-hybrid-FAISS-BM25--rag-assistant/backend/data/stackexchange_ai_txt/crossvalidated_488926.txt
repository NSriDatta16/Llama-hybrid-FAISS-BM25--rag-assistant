How do I interpret the regression output using Artificial Neural Network in R?

I'm working on a covid-19 dataset, and I'm interested in using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to measure the effect of some independent variables namely: confirmed cases , new cases , and total deaths on the response variable new deaths . The attached is the output using R Kindly explain how to explain this output, it does not look like the normal linear regression I'm familiar with. .
