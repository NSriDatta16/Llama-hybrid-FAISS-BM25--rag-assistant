Interpretation of Binary Logistic Regression

I am currently doing my master thesis and have difficulties fully understanding how to interpret the results of my binary logistic regression, since I have not a lot of experience with statistics. Background info: In Switzerland, almost all judges belong to a political party. I would like to analyze how this party political affiliation might influence the decisions judges take. Since my field of research is migration, I do this in looking at the decisions on asylum application appeals. My dependent variable is therefore the decision (coded 0 for rejected, 1 for accepted). My main independent variable is the party political affiliation; i.e. the party the judge belongs to. The party political affiliation is coded as factor (i.e. actual party names). Furthermore, I have the control variables "Amtszeit" (duration in office) and "Geschlecht" (gender). In the model, the reference level is a party called SVP. If I have understood it correctly, my results for the other parties are always compared to/in reference to the reference level. Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. first_judge (Intercept) 0.1566 0.3957 Number of obs: 19950, groups: first_judge, 52 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.855990 0.143361 -19.922 If we take the comparison of the parties SVP and SP, the log(odds) is 0.498532. If I convert this into odds and probability, I receive 1.6463 for the odds and 0.6221 for the probability. Here's my question: Do I interpret the data correctly when I say that a judge from the party SP is 62% more likely to accept an asylum appeal if compared to an SVP judge? Or more general, an asylum appeal is 62% more likely to be accepted if it is decided by an SP judge rather than an SVP judge? Thanks in advance.
