You should be as specific as possible with catching errors in your code. Catching specific errors appropriately increases code maintainability, makes your code structured and organized. It is also good practice as a convention, especially if you later work on team-based projects and you're not the only one looking at the code. Personally throwing everything into one try catch block seems to be a code smell .
