Trying to access javascript elements inside a page

I hope someone can help me. I'm trying to access the text box inside a webpage so I can do some scripting, e.g. placing text in fields, checking a box and clicking submit, to automate my employees' workflow. It's confusing as heck because I cannot find the name/id/whatever that will allow me to manipulate the form. I can see the name of the field I'm trying to get at using Firebug ("history[comment]") and the id, if that helps ("history_comment") but no matter what I do, the form will not be manipulated. Based on the other scripting I've done, this Applescript: do JavaScript "document.forms[1].history_comment.value='Testing';" in document 1 should do the job, telling the browser to put "Testing" in the appropriate field. I've substituted other names I think might be what it wants, and tried referencing any other forms (forms[2], forms[3]), all for naught. I'm actually confused a bit more because there are no statements in the HTML, so it could be I'm screwing up there. I've posted an HTML dump of the form at http://images.jlist.com/testform.html (with dummy information of course) in case any kind soul can take a gander and give me some direction. My goal is to be able to put information into the Comment field. Is there a script I can run that will tell me the complete name (as far as the browser is concerned) of every element in the form?
