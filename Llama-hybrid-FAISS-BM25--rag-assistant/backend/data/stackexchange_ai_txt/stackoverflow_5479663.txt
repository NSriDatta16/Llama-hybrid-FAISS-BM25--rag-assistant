The network tab on the chrome developer tools will let you see the order the images are loading in, and the average time fetching each from the server. I've seen issues where a certain higher res image can cause a browser to stutter a bit when rendering the page (usually IE :s), so this might help you pinpoint if its a particular image causing the issue. http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/overview.html
