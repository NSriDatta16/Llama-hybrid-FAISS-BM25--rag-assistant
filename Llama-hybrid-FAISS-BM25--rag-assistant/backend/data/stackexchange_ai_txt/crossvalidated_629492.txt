Formula for a two-sample t-test where each group is made up of multiple pooled groups

I am working through Chapter 13 of the 2nd edition of An Introduction to statistical learning (the R version, see here ), on Error Correction. On page 569, in the section discussing the Scheffe method, the authors discuss testing the null hypothesis that the returns from two fund managers, one and three, in a fictional scenario are the same as the returns from three other fund managers, two, four, and five. These are the data presented in the book. Here is the passage describing the proposed test. . The line that intrigues me is "It turns out that we could test [this null hypothesis] using a variant of the two-sample t-test presented in 13.1, leading to a p-value of 0.004" The authors do not say what this variant is or how it works. I was not aware you could pool multiple groups into a single group for each group in a two-sample t-test. The equation 13.1 that they refer to, for the two-sample t-test, is here The numerator for the t-statistic equation is straightforward enough to adapt to the example: you simply average the mean returns from managers one and three to get one group mean, then do the same for the returns from managers two, four, and five to get the second. What I don't know how to do is adapt the equation for $s$ in the denominator (I assume the n's for each group are the sum of the n's for each of the two and three managers. i.e. 2 x 50 = 100 for the first group and 3 x 50 = 150 for the second group). Does anyone know the formula for this type of t-test?
