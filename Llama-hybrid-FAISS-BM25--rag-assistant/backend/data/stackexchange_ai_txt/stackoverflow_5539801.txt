Django query: Want to count a set in template

I have a list of item which only displays the latest status of each item. What I want to do now is count. Problem is that is the count function will only work properly if latest is removed - however that would give me something like this. item1=1 item2=33 item3=12 item4=0 Basically it will count all statuses for that item, but it needs focus on counting the latest status so the answer in this case should be 3. This is why I need the latest latest . There is also a foreign key relationship between a storage item and status, an item can have many statuses or if not, no status at all. #views.py client = models.Client.objects.get(pk = client_id) items = client.storageitem_set.all() template {% for item in items %} {{item.itemstatushistory_set.latest}} {% endfor %}
