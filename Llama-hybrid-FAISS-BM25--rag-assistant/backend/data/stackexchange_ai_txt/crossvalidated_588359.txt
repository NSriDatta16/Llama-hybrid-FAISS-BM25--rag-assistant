Should I average the raw components and then solve using the formula, or formula first before averaging?

Suppose I was trying to find the average BMI of three of my friends. I have recorded each of their heights and weights (that is, a total of 3 heights, and 3 weights). Should I: average their heights and weights first, then solve for the BMI or should I solve each of their BMIs first, and then average these three BMIs? My bet is on the second option, but I'm not sure if there's an existing general rule about this one. I also can't explain why my bet is on the second option, just purely instinct.
