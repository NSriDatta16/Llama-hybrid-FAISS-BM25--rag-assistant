I don't think you want to call drawRect directly. In touchesBegan capture your touchLocation as you have then while still in touchesBegan update the frame of your tagButton. There is a sample app called MoveMe that Apple provides which is quite simple and helps illustrate this. Also, those points are expressed as floats not ints so use %f instead of %i to respond to your new "problem": you seem to be over-releasing newButton. Remember the rules...if you get the object by alloc, new or copy then you need to release it. If not, then you don't. So your app is crashing because you're over-releasing that button. remove [newButton release] and things should be fine...
