Prior for mean unknown parameter

We know that there are two versions of exponential $\big(1\big)$ $exp(\lambda)$ with pdf $$f(x;\lambda)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$ ,$\lambda>0,x>0$ and $\mathbb{E}[x]=\frac{1}{\lambda}$ for this version we know that a conjugate prior is $gamma(a,b)$. $\big(2\big)$ $exp(b)$ with pdf $$f(x;b)=\frac{1}{b}e^{\frac{-x}{b}},$$ $, \mathbb{E}[x]=b$.For version $\big(2\big)$ which is the conjugate prior ? In the following link they mention only the conjugate prior for $\lambda$ version https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior I started wondering because I was asked to simulate exponential data with unknown mean parameter let's say $\theta$ and then fit a non informative prior distribution for $\theta$. At first I was confused and I did bayesian inference for $\theta$ following the $\big(1\big)$ exponential distribution $exp(\theta)$, but then I clarified what the question was asking and now I'm stuck. Any help or idead would be great.
