Two questions regarding this iPhone UI

I'm taking a look at some basic UI principles that the mint.com team put into the iPhone application. A quick screenshot that I'm referencing: I have two questions regarding this UI: 1) There is an elegant space between the UITableViewCell's in which you can see the mint green background of the UITableView. I don't happen to see any delegate method that allows to set a spacer between cells. How is this typically done? 2) The last cell has what appears to be a UIView with the last updated time from the server. This UIView scrolls in sync with the table. Is it just an additional UITableViewCell styled differently from the rest of the cells and appended to the table?
