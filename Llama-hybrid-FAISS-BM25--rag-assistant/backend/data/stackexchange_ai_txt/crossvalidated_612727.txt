Mean Squared Error (MSE) formula for data points in higher dimensions

The form for MSE for $N$ data points with scalar values $Y=[Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_N]$ is given by the formula: $$ MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2 $$ How I see it, $ d_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$ , where $d_i$ is the Euclidean distance between the actual and predicted values for the $i^{th}$ data point. Thus, extending this to higher dimensions, say $D$ dimensions, $Z=[\vec{Z_1},\vec{Z_1},...,\vec{Z_N}]$ . Thus, the MSE should be: $$ MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N d_i^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \|Z_i - \hat{Z}_i\|^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^D (Z_{ij} - \hat{Z}_{ij})^2 $$ However, although I did not see any direct result which mentions this, it seems most implementations of MSE use a different formula (not too different from what I thought above): $$MSE' = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{D} \sum_{j=1}^D (Z_{ij} - \hat{Z}_{ij})^2$$ Is this $MSE'$ the correct form? If the MSE should provide the Mean Squared Error, where the error is measured by the Euclidean distance between the points, then why is this averaging over $D$ too? I do know that it doesn't make too much of a difference (a constant factor) if we use one of the measures consistently, but which one is standard? Is there a unique definition of MSE in these cases?
