Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. If two variables have a positive covariance, it means that they tend to increase or decrease together. If they have a negative covariance, it means that they tend to move in opposite directions. If they have a covariance of zero, it means that they are independent and do not affect each other. To explain covariance to someone who understands only the mean, you could start by explaining that the mean is a measure of the central tendency of a distribution. The mean tells you the average value of a set of numbers. Covariance, on the other hand, measures how two variables vary together. It tells you whether they tend to increase or decrease together, or whether they move in opposite directions. For example, suppose you have two sets of numbers, X and Y. The mean of X tells you the average value of X, and the mean of Y tells you the average value of Y. If the covariance between X and Y is positive, it means that when X is above its mean, Y tends to be above its mean as well. And when X is below its mean, Y tends to be below its mean as well. If the covariance is negative, it means that when X is above its mean, Y tends to be below its mean, and vice versa. If the covariance is zero, it means that there is no relationship between X and Y. So, in summary, covariance measures the tendency of two variables to vary together, and can be positive, negative, or zero.
