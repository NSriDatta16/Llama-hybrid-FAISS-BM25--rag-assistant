Two different kinds of parameters can be adjusted during the training of an ANN, the weights and the value in the activation functions. This is impractical and it would be easier if only one of the parameters should be adjusted. To cope with this problem a bias neuron is invented. The bias neuron lies in one layer, is connected to all the neurons in the next layer, but none in the previous layer and it always emits 1. Since the bias neuron emits 1 the weights, connected to the bias neuron, are added directly to the combined sum of the other weights (equation 2.1), just like the t value in the activation functions. 1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. Consider the AND boolean function represented by the following neural network: (source: aihorizon.com ) w0 corresponds to b . w1 corresponds to x1 . w2 corresponds to x2 . A single perceptron can be used to represent many boolean functions. For example, if we assume boolean values of 1 (true) and -1 (false), then one way to use a two-input perceptron to implement the AND function is to set the weights w0 = -3, and w1 = w2 = .5. This perceptron can be made to represent the OR function instead by altering the threshold to w0 = -.3. In fact, AND and OR can be viewed as special cases of m-of-n functions: that is, functions where at least m of the n inputs to the perceptron must be true. The OR function corresponds to m = 1 and the AND function to m = n. Any m-of-n function is easily represented using a perceptron by setting all input weights to the same value (e.g., 0.5) and then setting the threshold w0 accordingly. Perceptrons can represent all of the primitive boolean functions AND, OR, NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR).
