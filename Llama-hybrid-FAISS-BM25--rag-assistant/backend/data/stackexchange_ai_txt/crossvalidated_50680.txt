I'm just going to throw out three more approaches, mostly for the reaction, since these methods are newer and I'm curious about them... First, the MIC (maximal information coefficient) introduced by Reshef et al. (2011) to determine nonlinear correlations. Described as 'a correlation for the 21st century' when it made a splash in the media. Second, the distance correlation statistic, dCor , a standardized Brownian covariance introduced by Szekely, Rizzo, and Bakirov (2007) and favoured by Simon & Tibshirani (2012) in their critique of the low power of MIC. Third, the HHG test of Heller, Heller and Gorfine (2012a, b), noted by them as an superior alternative to MIC with better power characteristics. # Using @Jeromy Anglim's gist on github with the data library(RCurl) writeChar(con="data.txt", getURL("https://raw.github.com/gist/1320989/40be602c43b5f29d79af50bf2b63ba6c1a839807/data.txt", ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)) # read downloaded data into R x MIC : No difference between untransformed and log transform data. Quite similar to the absolute value of the pearson on log-log data. ## distance correlation statistic on untransformed data library("energy") with(x, dcor(x, y)) [1] 0.2352139 # distance correlation statistic on log-log data with(x, dcor(logx, logy)) [1] 0.3638021 dCor : Lower values than MIC, and sensitive to log transform. Similar to the spearman correlation. ## HHG test download.file("http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~ruheller/Software/HHG2x2_0.1-1.tar.gz", "HHG2x2_0.1-1.tar.gz") install.packages("HHG2x2_0.1-1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source") library(HHG2x2) writeChar(con="myHHG.R", getURL("https://raw.github.com/andrewdyates/HHG_R/master/R/myHHG.R", ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)) source("myHHG.R") xs HHG : Actually I'm not sure how to get a comparable distance metric out of the HHG...
