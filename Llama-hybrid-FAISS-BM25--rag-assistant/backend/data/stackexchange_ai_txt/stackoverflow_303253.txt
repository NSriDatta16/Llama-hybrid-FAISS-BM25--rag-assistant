jcooper, To paginate a simple grid of image/text elements, I'd almost prefer to see you use the Paginator without using DataTable. DataTable is a powerful component, but it's working hard to be a lot of things you don't need. Carousel ( http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/carousel/ ), on the other hand, seems like it's trying to be just what you want. http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/carousel/csl_imagentext.html , for example, might be a good place to start. If that's not quite what you want, you could definitely do this with DataTable. Just create the markup snippets you want to use for each cell, store them in an array, and follow the directions for using an array datasource and pagination. Regards, Eric
