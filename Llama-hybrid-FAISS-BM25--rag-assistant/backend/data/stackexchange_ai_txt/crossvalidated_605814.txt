Which of the two variables that are correlated should I eliminate?

I want to run a binary logistic regression. After pearson test I have 2 correlated variables, one continuous and one categorical. I guess I should eliminate categorical variable. But I want to know the theory of eliminating correlated variables. Thanks.
