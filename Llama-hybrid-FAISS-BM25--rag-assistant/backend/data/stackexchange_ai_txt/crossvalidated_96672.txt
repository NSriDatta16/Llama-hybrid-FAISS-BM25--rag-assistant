Statistical test for a class versus multiple classes

We are given n classes of real values. The number of elements in each class is not too high and can be different between classes. We want to test whether there exist a class with significantly higher (average) values from all other classes or not. The case is somehow similar to ANOVA, but slightly different. What test do you propose?
