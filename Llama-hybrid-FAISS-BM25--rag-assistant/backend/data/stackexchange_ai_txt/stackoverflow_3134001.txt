What tools are available for flex code coverage?

I have been trying to get Flex Cover to work correctly for some time but the problem we are encountering is that it only provides code coverage for classes that are currently being hit by our unit tests. How do we get flex cover to provide correct instrumentation for our entire source directory? I have tried several different compiler parameters to include all classes with no luck. Also getting the flex cover fat client to work in a CI environment consistently has never been achieved so we are left to just run Flex Cover manually. At this point I don't feel like flex cover is mature enough to be used reliably. Are there any other tools available to get correct code coverage for flex that we should try?
