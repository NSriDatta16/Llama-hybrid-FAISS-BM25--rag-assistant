How can I get the directory (file path) separator in Perl?

In case of Java, we can get the path separator using System.getProperty("path.separator"); Is there a similar way in Perl? All I want to do is to find a dir, immediate sub directory. Say I am being given two arguments $a and $b ; I am splitting the first one based on the path separator and joining it again except the last fragment and comparing with the second argument. The problem is my code has to be generic and for that I need to know whats the system dependent path separator is?
