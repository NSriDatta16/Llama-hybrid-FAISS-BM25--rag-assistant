This is a very controversial subject (in fact, I expect this to get closed!). I would argue that RoR can deliver faster development, but only if you're doing it right. The fact that it's so opinionated about some of the common tasks that come up during most development encourages you to do it right... it makes testing easier, for example, and virtually forces you to keep view logic separate from models. And that said, performance wise, Rails 3 isn't exactly slow! In fact, I've found it (in my own, completely unscientific experiments) to perform better than Zend Framework for PHP.
