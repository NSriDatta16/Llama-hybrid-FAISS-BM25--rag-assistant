Causality means "dependent on information only up to the present", in the context of time series and stochastic processes. There are no non-causal data generating processes in finance, or economics in general. (There are very basic economic reasons for this.) To say that $dr_t=\mu_tdt+\sigma_t dW_t$ is "non-causal" is fundamentally incorrect. Brownian motion $W_t$ does not depend on its future value. Indeed, mathematically it's a Markov process, and a martingale. So is its discrete-time version, the random walk. A quick casual browsing will tell you that such a process by design depends only on information up to present. In less elementary settings, in order to be economically and mathematically correct, in economic/finance models such processes are always considered together with a filtration . Standard empirical interpretation of a filtration is "increasing flow of information". In layman's terms, asset prices evolve as information, up to the present, becomes incorporated into prices. No future information. (Note a forecast is not information from the future.) Further Comments Causality and stationarity should not be conflated. In time series, one usually first encounters the notion of causality in the context of stationary linear processes---a linear time series is non-causal if it depends on future innovations. However, causality, or lack thereof, can be considered regardless of stationarity, as well as for continuous-time processes. Causality is about direction of information flow---from the past to future or vice versa. In the stationary time series setting, for every non-causal model there is a causal model that is observationally equivalent---e.g. consider the AR(1) case. Statistically, you cannot distinguish these two cases. Therefore one chooses to consider only causal models for both statistical and non-statistical reasons. To claim asset prices in an asset bubble is "non-causal" is an incorrect statement building on an already incorrect statement. Asset bubbles occur when prices deviate from its fundamental value, without getting into the precise economic notion. The first such historical episode is the South Sea Bubble of 1720 . More recently, there is the US housing bubble . Bubbles occur not because market participants can see into the future. That would be absurd. Indeed, bubbles always burst precisely because people cannot see into the future. They tend to be driven by irrational beliefs and/or excessive risk-taking. A "live" example of a bubble occurring at the present moment is here . The reason people buy the stock of a bankrupt company, thereby drive up its price by 400%, is not because they have information about the future.
