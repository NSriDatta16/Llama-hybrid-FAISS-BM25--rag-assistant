C# if-null-then-null expression

Just for curiosity/convenience: C# provides two cool conditional expression features I know of: string trimmed = (input == null) ? null : input.Trim(); and string trimmed = (input ?? "").Trim(); I miss another such expression for a situation I face very often: If the input reference is null, then the output should be null. Otherwise, the output should be the outcome of accessing a method or property of the input object. I have done exactly that in my first example, but (input == null) ? null : input.Trim() is quite verbose and unreadable. Is there another conditional expression for this case, or can I use the ?? operator elegantly?
