Is there a more elegant way to do this in Rails (has_one association)

Hey, I'm very new to Ruby and Rails. I was wondering if I was doing this the right way. @user = User.new(params[:user]) @student.user = @user @student.save if @user.save ...rest of the code In my app, a Student has one User, and each User belongs to a Student (think of a User as an Account). The association itself isn't my question though; is the block of code above the best way to save a new User that's associated to a Student?
