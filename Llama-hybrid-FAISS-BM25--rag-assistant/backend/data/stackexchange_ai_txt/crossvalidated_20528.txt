Linear Principal Component or Factor analyses are based on linear regression model and this implies that the input similarities must be covariances , correlations , cosines , or sum-of-cross-products (all these similarities are known as scalar products ). You may input any other sort of similarity, such as Jaccard measure or Kendall correlation, but only keeping in mind that the analysis will "think" it is scalar product, i.e. usual Pearson correlation or cosine, in this case. When applied to true Pearson correlations or other type of scalar product, PCA reduces dimensionality with minimal distortion of data cloud's shape in terms of sum of squared euclidean distances between the data points. With Jaccard measure or such, you can't say that PCA reduces dimensionality with the above mentioned objective function.
