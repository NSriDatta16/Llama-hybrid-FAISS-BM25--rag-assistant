Interpret Ordinal Data on Likert Scale

I am curious to know whether it is current practice in the statistical field to interpret and report data obtained on a Likert Scale (1: Strongly Agree to 5: Strongly Disagree), by finding the median value rather than averaging all the values for a particular item. Please see link here My second question is how do we decide whether we should use 1: for Strongly Disagree rather than Strongly Agree such that: 1: Strongly Disagree 2:Disagree 3:undecided 4:Agree 5:Strongly Agree 1: Strongly Agree 2:Agree 3:undecided 4:Disagree 5:Strongly Disagree
