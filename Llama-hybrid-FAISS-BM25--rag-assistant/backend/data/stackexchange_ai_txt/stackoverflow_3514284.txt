Is a database the right choice for data storage for my C# application?

I am developing a C# application and want to be sure I choose the best choice for data storage that fits these specs. The program can have a infinite amount of data, but that data will only be used by a single user that is using the application. Each time the application is closed, I need to save the data, and it needs to be loaded in when the application is started. I have looked at databases, but am unsure as to which would be best suited for my needs. Also, I wonder if I need a database at all given the above specs, maybe I should just use a binary file/XML file implementing serialization and deserialization. Point me in the right direction please! Thanks, OC EDIT: One important factor I forgot to include is the necessity to allow one user to save all the entries he/she entered and export it to an external file that can be easily shared between applications/users.
