I did not reproduced the issue either with the: Package Explorer Project Explorer with a fresh Eclipse installation: Do you have any plugin installed? Do you reproduce the problem with a clean installation? Can you move some type of files (like .txt instead of .java ) without any confirmation message popping up? Are your files read-only ? (which could prompt a confirmation message, as illustrated below) Note: regarding PDT2.1 (and even the upcoming PDT 2.2 next July), the drag and drop or the move of resources still has a lot of bugs , including bug 256278 which concerns an odd message on a drag and drop: I confirm this is PDT related (it would not happen with JDT) org.eclipse.ltk.internal.ui.refactoring.RefactoringWizardDialog2 is being called here. Every time a drag&drop is performed. And no preference seems to be there to cancel that behavior.
