Performing PCA on multistate variables (vector rather than scalar values)

I have a data set of individuals genotyped over thousands of polymorphic (variable) loci. At each locus, each individual has two nucleotides from the set {A,C,G,T}, either a pair of identical nucleotides e.g. A/A or two different nucleotides e.g. C/G So each individual has the following data structure, e.g. for the first 3 loci of the first individual, we may have something like A C G T Locus1 2 0 0 0 Locus2 0 0 0 2 Locus3 0 1 1 0 ...etc while individual 2 may be A C G T Locus1 0 2 0 0 Locus2 0 0 1 1 Locus3 0 1 1 0 ...etc I have ~200 genotyped individuals in the data set, and I'm trying to determine the best way to perform a PCA on this data set. One approach I tried was (for each site) to select the most common nucleotide, so that each individual is characterized by a frequency 1, 1/2, 0 based on whether the nucleotide is present or absent at that site. However, this discards information about all but the most common allele at each locus. Is there a standard way to perform PCA where each variable isn't a single numerical value but rather a multistate variable like the example above, so that I can leverage information about all of the possible states rather than reducing it to a PCA on the frequency of the most common allele at each site? A related problem occurs if I subdivide my 200 individuals into regional subpopulations, so that rather than nucleotide counts for each individual, I do so for every subset, so that at some loci there are non-zero values for each nucleotide. In that case in particular, using the frequency of the most common nucleotide in order to provide a single state measurement at each locus loses a lot of information. What I'm looking for is how to perform PCA on a set of measurements where each measure is vector rather than scalar-valued.
