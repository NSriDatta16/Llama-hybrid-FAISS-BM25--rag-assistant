Displaying tooltip on mouse hover of a text

I want to display a tooltip when the mouse hovers over a link in my custom rich edit control. Consider the following text: We all sleep at night . In my case the word sleep is a link. When the user moves the mouse under the link, in this case "sleep", I want to display a tooltip for the link. The following came to my mind, but they are not working 1) Trapping OnMouseHover if(this.Cursor == Cursors.Hand) tooltip.Show(textbox,"My tooltip"); else tooltip.Hide(textbox); But this does not work out. UPDATE The links mentioned are not URLs, i.e these are custom links, so Regex won't be of much help here, it can be any text. The user can choose to create it a a link. Though I have not tried GetPosition method, I dont think it would be that elegant in terms of design and maintenance. Let me say I have the following line, in my richedit box We sleep at night. But the bats stay awake . Cockroaches become active at night. In the above sentence, I want three different tooltips, when the mouse hovers over them. sleep -> Human beings awake -> Nightwatchman here active -> My day begins I trapped OnMouseMove as follows: Working- with Messagebox OnMouseMove( ) { // check to see if the cursor is over a link // though this is not the correct approach, I am worried why does not a tooltip show up if(this.Cursor.current == Cursors.hand ) { Messagebox.show("you are under a link"); } } Not Working - with Tooltip - Tooltip does not show up OnMouseMove( MouseventArgs e ) { if(cursor.current == cursors.hand ) { tooltip.show(richeditbox,e.x,e.y,1000); } }
