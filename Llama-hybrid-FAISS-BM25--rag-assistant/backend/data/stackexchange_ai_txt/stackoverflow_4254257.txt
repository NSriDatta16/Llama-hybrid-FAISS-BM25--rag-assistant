Gantt Chart with jQuery

http://jsfiddle.net/JeaffreyGilbert/VkghS/ Currently sorting between rows can be done by dragging barWrap (grey). To move gantt bar can be done by dragging the bar. What I want is sorting and moving can be done at once by dragging the bar. How to achieve this? Any helps would be appreciated, thank you.
