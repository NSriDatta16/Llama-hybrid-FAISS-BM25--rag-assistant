Optimising a date query in MySQL

I have a series of tables which have MySQL date and time attributes where each table can consist of thousands of rows. I need to be able to read these tables interactively so as to retrieve these rows satisfying a date range. So my SQL might be: select column_1, column_2 from table_name where createddate between '2011-01-01' and '2011-01-31'; Some queries may also work from time p on day x, to time q on day z. The dates are of MySQL type DATE, and times are type TIME. Does anyone know what might be a good way to optimise such queries? I can create indexes on the date and time columns, use a TIMESTAMP as an alternative etc. Thanks Mr Morgan.
