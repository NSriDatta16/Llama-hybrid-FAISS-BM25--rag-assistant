i tried the following workaround for the getBoundingClientRect() unspecified error whilst drag n drop, and it works fine. in the jquery.1.4.2.js ( i.e base jquery file, where the error is thrown exactly ) replace the elem.getBoundingClientRect() function call in js file //the line which throws the unspecified error var box = elem.getBoundingClientRect(), with this.. var box = null; try { box = elem.getBoundingClientRect(); } catch(e) { box = { top : elem.offsetTop, left : elem.offsetLeft } ; } This solves the issue and drag n drop will work quitely even after post back through update panel Regards Raghu
