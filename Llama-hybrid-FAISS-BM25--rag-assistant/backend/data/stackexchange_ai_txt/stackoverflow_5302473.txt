Simulate mouse move in 3D games?

Hi I made a human computer interface to control mouse using fingers using C++ and OpenCV in CodeBlocks IDE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q5aXTg0pVE I want to use this in a 3D game like medal of honor First I used SetCursorPos(x,y) it did not work so I switched to SendInput and mouse_event. They did work with a bug the character began pointing in all random directions and changing directions on its own. Should I use directinput as the game uses directx. If so how? I have tried many tutorials but all speak about how to get data from mouse but not how to insert into the mouse stream I used both absolute and relative positioning but both failed the character is behaving odd
