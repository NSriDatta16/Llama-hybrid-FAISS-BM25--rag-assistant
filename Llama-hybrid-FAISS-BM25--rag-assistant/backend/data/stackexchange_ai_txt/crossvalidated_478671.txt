When to preprocess data for neural network

In https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-2/ , the authors say that preprocessing should only be done on the training set, and then the mean, variance, etc. of the training set should be used on the validation and test sets. I can't find any other source on why this should be done, and I'm wondering how important this is compared to taking the data mean and variance and normalizing based on those at the beginning. Also, if it is very important to only normalize the training set and apply that to the rest of the data set, how would that be implemented with cross-validation in keras?
