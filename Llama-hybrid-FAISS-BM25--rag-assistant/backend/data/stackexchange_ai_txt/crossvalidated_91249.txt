EDITinfo : "accuracy" for multiclass was changed according to Moens (2006, p. 183) EDIT: Sometimes (seemingly often) agreement and accuaracy are computed similarly. However, they seem to be used for different fields. Agreement is typically for inter-annotator tasks, while accuracy is the basic standard for classification (and other statistical tasks) performance assessment. Agreement between coders in order to achieve reliability according to Artstein & Poesio (2008, p. 558) "the percentage of judgments on which the two analysts agree when coding the same data independently" Coder 1 +-------------+ | P | N | +---+------+------+ | P | tp | fp | Coder 2 +---+------+------+ | N | fn | tn | +---+------+------+ SUM_all = sum of all elements (sometimes called items) NO_classes = cardinality classes SUM_diagonal = the sum of all elements on the main diagonal TWO classes Agreement = (tp + tn) / SUM_all (SIMILAR to accuracy) i>2 classes Agreement = SUM_diagonal / SUM_all (NOT similar to accuracy) EDIT: Accuracy of classification in order to measure the classification effectiveness (in context of classification denoted as performance -- qualitative) is computed at least two variants (1) Moens (2006, p. 183) accuracy AND (2) Sokolova & Lapalme (2008, p. 430) average accuracy ) Real Class +-------------+ | P | N | +---+------+------+ Hypothesized | P | tp | fp | Class +---+------+------+ | N | fn | tn | +---+------+------+ TWO classes Accuracy = (tp + tn) / SUM_all (SIMILAR to agreement) i>2 classes (1) Accuracy = SUM_diagonal / SUM_all (according to Moens (2006, p. 183)) (2) averageAccuracy = SUM_i[(tp_i + tn_i) / SUM_all] / NO_classes (not similar to Agreement or Accuracy (acc. to Sokolova, 2008, p. 430)) ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Note this are calculated relatively for each i => if the matrix is larger then 2x2 the tn are ALL other elements in the matrix which are NOT associated with the i-class (i.e. from all other classes -- not only on the diagonal)!
