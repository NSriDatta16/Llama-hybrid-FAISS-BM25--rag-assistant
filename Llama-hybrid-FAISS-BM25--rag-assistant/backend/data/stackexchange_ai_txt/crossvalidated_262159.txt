For a prediction situation AIC is more relevant than BIC or p-values. However, to pick a single model on the basis of any of these and then to analyze the data as if no model selection had been done, is likely inappropriate (unless one candidate model is so vastly better than the others as to remove all model uncertainty). Model averaging is usually more appropriate, if the goal is prediction.
