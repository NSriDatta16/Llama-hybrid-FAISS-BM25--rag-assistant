Why are point clouds and meshes considered to be non-euclidean data structures?

I was reading about geometric deep learning and non-euclidean data. I get that graphs are considered non-euclidean. But how come point clouds and meshes are also considered non-euclidean? I don't know a lot about point clouds. But as an example let's assume the point cloud exists in a 3D space, could I not just assign each point a (x,y,z) coordinates and represent the cloud in euclidean space? Maybe someone can explain why this is not true?
