Time Series Forecasting (to my way of thinking ) purely uses the past of the endogenous series as the basis of the model (ARIMA or Box-Jenkins) . Time Series Regression also uses causal (exogenous)series and their lags in addition to the history of the endogenous series. These models are generally called Transfer Functions or Dynamic Regression Models or more frequently SARMAX models https://autobox.com/pdfs/SARMAX.pdf . Both approaches are best employed while detecting and incorporating latent deterministic structure such as pulses, level shifts and local time trends and possible transient effects of parameters or model error variance over time.. Please see http://www.autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf which I wrote a number of years ago to provide more details/contrasts on "Regression vs Box_Jenkins"
