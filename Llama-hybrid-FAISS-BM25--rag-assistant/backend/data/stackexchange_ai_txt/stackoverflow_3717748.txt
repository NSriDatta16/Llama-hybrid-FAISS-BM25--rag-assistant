To make the button appear (written from a Visual Studio 2005 perspective, but probably the same or at least very similar for Visual Studio 2008): Right click on somewhere on the Visual Studio toolbar and select Customize... , then on the Commands tab in the Categories list, select Build . You should now have a list of Build commands in the Commands list, one of which should be Batch Build... . Drag and drop that to somewhere on the toolbar. However, I'm not certain if batch builds are supported for Visual Basic, so I'm not sure if this will help you.
