What's wrong with this Magento code? - Simple example

I am trying to follow this very popular tutorial at this url: http://alanstorm.com/magento_admin_controllers I tried the very first test - under "Testing It Out" I did not get redirected to my log in screen and then to the control panel with a blank page. Instead I got ... Response to the url http://mymagentotest.com/index.php/adminhelloworld/ produces the message below. I tried this over and over, I get the exact same results every time - which tells me that I'm learning how to do it WRONG by my making the same mistake over and over again. I need help, or we need help because I'm sure I'm not the only one. Whoops, our bad... The page you requested was not found, and we have a fine guess why. If you typed the URL directly, please make sure the spelling is correct. If you clicked on a link to get here, the link is outdated. I cannot see what is wrong, everything looks fine to the best of my limited knowledge, I had to guess the structure of the config file. I think that's where the issue is. Here is my code .... The config file in app/code/local/Alanstormdotcom/Adminhelloworld/etc ... admin Alanstormdotcom_Adminhelloworld adminhelloworld The index controller in app/code/local/Alanstormdotcom/Adminhelloworld/controllers loadLayout(); $this->renderLayout(); } } Alanstormdotcom_adminHelloworld.xml in app/etc/modules .. 0.1.0 Signed: Baffled, and feeling doomed. I have to try to learn this stuff, for my job, which if I fail, I end up living in a nice box in an alley.
