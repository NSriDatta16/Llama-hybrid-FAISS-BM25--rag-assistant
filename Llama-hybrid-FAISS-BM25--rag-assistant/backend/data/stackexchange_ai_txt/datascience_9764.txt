The term may best be expressed as a Recurrent , Heavy Subgraph . That is, a subgraph which is both Recurrent and Heavy . Heaviness of a subgraph refers to heavily connected vertices- that is, nodes which are connected many times ("many" being relative to the network in question). Recurrent refers to the propensity of a subgraph to occur more than once. Thus, a Recurrent Heavy Subgraph is a densely connected set of vertices which occurs several times in the overall network. These subgraphs are often used to determine properties of a network. For example: In a network of emails interactions within a company organized into 4-person teams with one member acting as the lead, each team's email activity (if they email between themselves sufficiently to be considered "heavy") could be described as a Heavy Subgraph . The fact that these subgraphs occur many times in the network make them Recurrent Heavy Subgraphs . If one was searching for structure in the network, noticing that these recurrent, heavy subgraphs exist would go a long way toward determining the organization of the network as a whole.
