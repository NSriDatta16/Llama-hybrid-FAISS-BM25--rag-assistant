Can I control the draw order in FX Composer?

I'm using Nvidia FX Composer to write a semi-transparent CgFX shader. Everything is fine, expect that in my render view, objects in the back of the scene are getting drawn on top of my shaded object. here's my technique: technique Main { pass p0 { DepthTestEnable = true; DepthMask = false; CullFaceEnable = false; BlendEnable = true; BlendFunc = int2(SrcAlpha, OneMinusSrcAlpha); DepthFunc = LEqual; VertexProgram = compile vp40 std_VS(); FragmentProgram = compile gp4fp std_PS(); } } If I turn on DepthMask, then objects in the back get masked out entirely, which defeats the purpose of transparency. It seems like the objects are not being drawn back-to-front. Is there a way to confirm that, and can I control the order in which FX Composer's renderer draws items to the screen?
