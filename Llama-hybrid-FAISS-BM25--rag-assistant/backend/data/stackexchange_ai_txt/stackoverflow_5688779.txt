You cannot target text nodes with CSS. I'm with you; I wish you could... but you can't :( If you don't wrap the text node in a like @Jacob suggests , you could instead give the surrounding element padding as opposed to margin : HTML The text node! CSS p#theParagraph { border: 1px solid red; padding-bottom: 10px; }
