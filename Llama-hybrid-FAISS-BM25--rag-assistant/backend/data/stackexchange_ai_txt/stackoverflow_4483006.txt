I just found this thread when searching for a solution so others might too... Lazerscience answer looks good so far but I also notice that the Django core devs have accepted a patch that will cause a Signal on log-in/log-out. This might be a more elegant solution once it makes it into an official Django release. And for reference, the docs on Signals .
