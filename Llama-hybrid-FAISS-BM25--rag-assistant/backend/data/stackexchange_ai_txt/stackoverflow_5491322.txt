Subclassing uibutton is a real pain. They don't usually work as expected since UIButton is an abstract class. Therefore to make a fully working button you may have to override quite a few methods to get the button to do everything the the Apple subclasses do. Instead if you just need to add storage you can use associative references . you must #import to use the functions. The best way to do this is to define a string constant NSString *const buttonTagName = @"com.youapp.buttonTag"; and store tags with this as the key objc_setAssociatedObject(button, buttonTagName, tagForCurrentButton, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN); .
