Problem updating Eclipse Ganymede

I am predominately a .NET developer so forgive me if I am missing something obvious. I use Eclipse Ganymede (3.4.0) for Blackberry development. I have Blackberry JDE Plugin 4.3.0.8 installed and would like to install 4.5.0. I try using Help -> Software Updates to get it but get the following error: "Cannot launch the Update UI. This installation has not been configured properly for Software Updates". Any ideas on how to fix this? Failing that any ideas how to install 4.5.0 without using the Update facility in eclipse? I have installed the 4.5.0 component back but it has not put it into eclipse, just installed files in c:\Program Files\Research In Motion. I'd rather not do a fresh installation of eclipse!
