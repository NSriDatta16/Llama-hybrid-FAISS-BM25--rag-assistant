Unfortunately not. Even if IL allows an attribute value to be a member reference token (e.g. a PropertyInfo effectively) there's no C# operator to get one for you 1 . You could pass it in as a string literal and then use reflection to get the PropertyInfo though. Ugly and fragile, but probably the closest you'll get. 1 This is a well-known feature request, possibly called the "infoof" operator. There's no sign of it being implemented though.
