Both Tweetie and Facebook implement their own 'custom' swipe detection. What I mean is that instead of using the standard UITableView hooks for swipes, you override touchesBegan:withEvent: , touchesMoved:withEvent: , et.c in your own subclass of UITableView. You can then start detecting swipes yourself and call whatever methods you want on your UITableViewCell's. (Hint: to get the cell given an UITouch, use the UITableView method indexPathForRowAtPoint:) There's also a another plus to managing your own swipes: you get a lot more control over how accurate each swipe needs to be.
