Good models for predicting whether a customer would make a purchase given details like age, gender, ethnicity, salary, etc?

I have around 30,000 data points and for those data points I have some numerical fields like customer_age , customer_number_of_previous_purchases , etc and also some categorical string fields such as customer_gender , customer_ethnicity , etc. I have lots of different fields like the above. Finally I also have an output field did_customer_make_purchase which is a binary yes or no depending on if they made a purchase or not. I have around 30,000 data points. I am wanting to figure out the best way of using a model to make use of the above information so I can essentially plug in things like customer_age , customer_number_of_previous_purchases , customer_gender , customer_ethnicity , etc and it tell me whether it thinks a new customer will make a purchase or not (this can either be a yes or no or better a probability of that occurring). I don't know what type of model is good for this kind of scenario. Could someone give me some ideas of which types of models may work good for this scenario please? I have used neural networks before (maybe too fancy for this use case?), and know python so implementation should be fine but I am struggling with what model to investigate. Should I try to classify customers into purchase and non purchase using some classification algorithm or is there something better? Thank you.
