I think there's some confusion about PCA and CFA in this question. PCA summarizes the observed variables into orthogonal components, and does not assume latent variables, nor error variance for the observed variables. CFA assumes latent variables, which may be correlated, and latent error terms. SEM is typically used to estimate CFA, as it is a latent variable model. I have not seen PCA implemented in SEM, but perhaps that is because my SEM experience is limited to MPlus. In the SEM framework, I would approach your problem as follows: Build a CFA model on the training data Build a CFA model on the testing data Constrain the parameters of the model from step 2 to be equal to the values of the parameters in step 1 Perform a log-likelihood or chi square test to see whether imposing these constrainst significantly deteriorates model fit
