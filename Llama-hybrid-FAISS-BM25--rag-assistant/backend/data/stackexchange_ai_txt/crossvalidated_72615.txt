Each image is composed of 32 $\times$ 32 pixels, so for a given pixel (say row 13, column 31) something measured is averaged over all the images, and the standard deviation (SD for short) for the same something is also calculated. (value âˆ’ mean) / SD is often called a z-score and is a way of standardizing values to take account of mean and SD. Presumably that's done for every pixel, meaning every pixel position. It is spelled out that they are "dividing by the standard deviation of all pixels over all images" [my emphasis] and that SD would usually be calculated with reference to the corresponding overall mean. However, division by that SD would be dividing by a constant, so it won't have any effect on the images beyond a question of units.
