To elaborate on what Jerry Coffin said: the standard makes accessing a const object undefined, only if that access occurs during the object's lifetime. 7.1.5.1/4: Except that any class member declared mutable (7.1.1) can be modified, any attempt to modify a const object during its lifetime (3.8) results in undefined behavior. The object's lifetime begins only after the constructor has finished. 3.8/1: The lifetime of an object of type T begins when: storage with the proper alignment and size for type T is obtained, and if T is a class type with a non-trivial constructor (12.1), the constructor call has completed.
