the simplest Bayesian estimate?

The textbook A first Course in Machine Learning, by Rogers & Girolami first covers ML, $$ \arg \max_M P(D|M) $$ then MAP, $$ \arg\max_M p(D|M) P(M) $$ However in transition to the Bayesian case, the example it gives is of estimating data^1, rather than estimate a model parameter, so the example is not parallel to the previous two cases. My question: Is this a simple valid example of a Bayesian parameter estimate: $$ M_{\text{Bayesian}} = \int \frac{P(D|M) P(M)}{P(D)} dM $$ It looks wrong to me, in that it is somewhat saying that "the parameter M is an average of the parameter M". End of question. Footnote 1: Specifically the introduction Bayesian example is $$ p(x|D) = \int p(x|M) p(M|D) dM $$
