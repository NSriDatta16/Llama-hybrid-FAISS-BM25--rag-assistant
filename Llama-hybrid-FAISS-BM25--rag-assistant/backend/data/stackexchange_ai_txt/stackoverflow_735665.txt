I recommend bookmarking the predef SourceForge . There's no one answer, but it can certainly help you get started. EDIT: For GCC-only code, you can use __i386__ to check for 32-bit x86 chips, and I suggest trying __X86_64__ or something similar to check for 64-bit x86 chips. (Note: It has come to my attention that the previous answer involving __ia86__ is actually a different chip, not a 64-bit x86 chip. This just shows my lack of hardware experience. For those more knowledgeable about hardware than I, consule the SourceForge page on predefined macros that I link to above. It's much more accurate than I am.) There are some other ones that would work, but those two should be fairly universal amongs GCC versions.
