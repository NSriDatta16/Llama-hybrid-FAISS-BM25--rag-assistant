If you have control over the .left class, add some padding or margin to the right side of the image. .left {float:left;padding-right:2em;} or .left {float:left;margin-right:2em;} The exact amount of padding/margin you need depends on how the list is styled - you want to add enough so that the list bullet doesn't overlap the image, but the paragraph and other stuff doesn't go too far to the right. Which of padding-right or margin-right to use depends on what else is going on in the page, what browser(s) you are using, and somewhat also on personal preference. Try each and see which one works better in your situation.
