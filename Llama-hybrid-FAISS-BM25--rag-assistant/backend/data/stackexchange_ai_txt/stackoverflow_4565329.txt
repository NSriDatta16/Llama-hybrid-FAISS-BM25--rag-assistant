Arr you referring to the following mention in the docs for setInterceptorNames ? NOTE: Specifying a target bean as final name in the "interceptorNames" list is deprecated and will be removed in a future Spring version. Use the "targetName" property instead. This refers to an odd feature of this property where the last item in the list of interceptors can actually be the intercepted bean itself, rather than being an actual interceptor. This is confusing, though, and discouraged - you're supposed to specify the target using the targetName property. So interceptorNames is still the way to specify interceptors.
