If you are interested in test-retest reliability, set up your data in a matrix such that each row corresponds to the data from a single subject and each column corresponds to a single test. It sounds like the test was taken twice per subject, so you will have two columns (although more could be accommodated). Thus, if you have $n$ subjects, you will have an $n\times2$ matrix where each cell $x_{ij}$ corresponds to the average "score" (e.g., reaction time or error percentage) of subject $i$ on test $j$. Do not include the scores from individual trials in this analysis. Question 1: It does sound like the fixed model is appropriate to your measurement situation. However, although the ICC population parameter definitions vary based on whether the column effect is assumed to be random or fixed, the process for calculating the sample estimator is identical in both cases. That is, the estimate will be identical in numerical value for both models and only the interpretation of the estimate will vary (i.e., in how generalizable it is). Question 2: If you plan to use subjects' scores from a single test to make decisions or for statistical analysis, then use a single-measures ICC. If, however, you plan to test each subject twice and then use their average score across both tests to make decisions or for statistical analysis, then use an average-measures ICC. I assume the former case and thus would recommend ICC(2,1).
