@tom: Not sure what you mean by "real", but if it is happening in the real world, it appears that it is real enough. The question is perhaps one of validity, and I would encourage you to search this site for questions and answers on reliability and validity. This is a very, very large field. If you wish to discuss this in any depth, it would be good to become familiar with the loaded terms that are used. Basically, the question rests on the quality of "the real test" at the end of the year and the quality of the classroom tests during the year. The school district should have evidence upon which to base its actions, so I sincerely hope you could retrieve that evidence by contacting the district. If the evidence does not exist, then this is a research project in the making. School and district decisions should be evidence based. Again, this is a huge field, please have a look at this site in more depth.
