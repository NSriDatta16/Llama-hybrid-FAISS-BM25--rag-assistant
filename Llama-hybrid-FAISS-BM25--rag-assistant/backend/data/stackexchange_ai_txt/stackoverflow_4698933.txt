Searching a list of tuples in python

I'm having a database (sqlite) of members of an organisation (less then 200 people). Now I'm trying to write an wx app that will search the database and return some contact information in a wx.grid. The app will have 2 TextCtrls, one for the first name and one for the last name. What I want to do here is make it possible to only write one or a few letters in the textctrls and that will start to return result. So, if I search "John Smith" I write "Jo" in the first TextCtrl and that will return every single John (or any one else having a name starting with those letters). It will not have an "search"-button, instead it will start searching whenever I press a key. One way to solve this would be to search the database with like " SELECT * FROM contactlistview WHERE forname LIKE 'Jo%' " But that seems like a bad idea (very database heavy to do that for every keystroke?). Instead i thought of use fetchall() on a query like this " SELECT * FROM contactlistview " and then, for every keystroke, search the list of tuples that the query have returned. And that is my problem: Searching a list is not that difficult but how can I search a list of tuples with wildcards?
