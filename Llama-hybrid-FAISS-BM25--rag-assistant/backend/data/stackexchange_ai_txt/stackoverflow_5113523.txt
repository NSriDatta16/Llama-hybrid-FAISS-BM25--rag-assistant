Storing huge randomized list of similar items in Redis

Redis 2.0.3 I need to store a huge list of items in Redis. Each item is a short string (less than 256 characters). I need to do two operations on the list: Add many (several thousands to a million) identical items. (Several times a day) Remove one random item from the list. It is not necessary to have "fair" random. Any "good enough" approach will do. (Up to several hundred times a second) I do not have enough RAM to store all items in a list one by one. I think that I need to store items in batches, name and a counter. (There will be up to several thousands distinct items, more like several hundreds.) But I'm not sure how to organize this effectively. Any hints?
