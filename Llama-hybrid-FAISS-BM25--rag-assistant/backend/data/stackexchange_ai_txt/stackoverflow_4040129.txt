Personally, I would not spend money or time with books. There are hundreds, even thousands of PHP tutorials to get you started, and once you have the basics, the online PHP manual and stackoverflow should be all you need. As for eCommerce systems, there are numerous open source PHP systems readily available. A quick google for 'open source php ecommerce' should give you a start, but off the top of my head, and from my own experience, here's a short list: Magento http://www.magentocommerce.com/ - complex but very powerful osCommerce http://www.oscommerce.com/ - for your own sanity, and long term prospects, avoid this! OpenCart http://www.opencart.com/ - a very good option, can be as complex or simple as you like. PHPShop http://code.google.com/p/phpshop/ - simplistic, but easy to get into.
