Putting ListBox in ScrollViewer: mouse wheel does not work

My mouse wheel does not work when putting a ListBox in a ScrollViewer . Does the ListBox somehow "steal" this event? Test 1 Test 2 Test 3 Test 4 Test 5 Test 6 Test 7 Edit: as requested by Joel, added the reason why I did this.. I did this because I don't like what the ListBox 's internal ScrollViewer does with my layout. I have a background image, and on top of that a ListBox as shown here: alt text http://robbertdam.nl/share/1.png Now when the scrollbar appears, the following happens: alt text http://robbertdam.nl/share/2.png I've created a Style for a ScrollViewer that shows the scroll bar on top of the ListBox item's content. In the ListBox item's datatemplate I've reserved some space for the scrollbar to appear. Thanks, Robbert Dam
