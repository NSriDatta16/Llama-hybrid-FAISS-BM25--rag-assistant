DTW - What is fan-in nodes and why not just take the nearst points from each timeserie?

It has been a while that I am trying to understand the dtw (dynamic time warping) algorithm but I steel can't figure out the loginc behind this algorithm.. In many references it's explained that to compute the path between to time series I need to implement this recursivity: I have many questions here and I hope some one can give me an answer: What we mean exactly by the path between two time series ? What is the (cost path matrix described here: Why not just compute the distances between a given point of t and other points of r and select the closest one an repeat this until matching all points from t to points from r ?? Thanks in advance for any helpfull answer / comment.
