Client Browser detection in Vaadin

I want to set different themes to my Vaadin application, depending on the user agent. In particular I want to distinguish at least between mobile devices (iPhone, Android,...) and desktop web browser. Vaadin's API reveals two interesting classes: BrowserInfo WebBrowser BrowserInfo seems to do the job perfectly for my needs, but fails on instancing via its get -method: SEVERE: javax.servlet.ServletException: ... Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: com.vaadin.terminal.gwt.client.BrowserInfo.getBrowserString()Ljava/lang/String; Couldn't find a way to access WebBrowser from within my application either. Did I choose the right approach for browser distinction? Why does accessing BrowserInfo fail?
