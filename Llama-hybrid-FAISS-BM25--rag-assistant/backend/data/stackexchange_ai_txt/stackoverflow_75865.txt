not dumb, this isn't something that MySQL does, inserting the empty date values. I do this in perl with a two-step process. First, load all of the data from the query into a hash organised by date. Then, I create a Date::EzDate object and increment it by day, so... my $current_date = Date::EzDate->new(); $current_date->{'default'} = '{YEAR}-{MONTH NUMBER BASE 1}-{DAY OF MONTH}'; while ($current_date where final date is another EzDate object or a string containing the end of your date range. EzDate isn't on CPAN right now, but you can probably find another perl mod that will do date compares and provide a date incrementor.
