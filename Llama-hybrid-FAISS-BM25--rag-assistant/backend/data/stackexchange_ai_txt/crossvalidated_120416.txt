The area under the PR-Curve is ill-defined. Because there is no well-defined precision at recall 0: you get a division by zero there. You also cannot close this gap easily - it may be anything from 0 to 1, depending on how well your retrieval works. There is a common approximation to this - AveP, average precision.
