One can't answer yes or no that this is the best design for your data. You've described the items you want to store, but not how you intend to query it. The relational model is great for designing storage that has minimal redundancy, and supports the widest range of queries. The document-oriented model is great for optimizing specific queries. But you need to know in advance what types of queries you need to be most efficient. See TANSTAAFL .
