Saving Image embedded in Silverlight RichTextBox

I am currently working on a Silverlight project and I am using RichTextBox. User are allowed to drag and drop images on to the RTB. I know that the Xaml property a Silverlight RichTextBox doesn't not include any UIElement objects that are present in the content and I need to save the content of this RTB and later load it. Does anyone know of a way to achieve this? Thanks.
