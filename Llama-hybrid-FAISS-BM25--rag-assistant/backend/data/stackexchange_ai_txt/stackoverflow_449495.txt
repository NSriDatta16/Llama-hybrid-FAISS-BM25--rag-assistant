The Addhandler way is probably the way to go as mentioned. Your other option is to declare your button in the following way: Dim withEvents button1 As New Button() Private Sub button1_ClickHandler(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles button1.click 'Handle stuff End Sub This way simulates what VS does for you if you were to drag the button on the form in the designer. The advantage to the AddHandler way is that you can remove handlers dynamically as well if you ever needed to.
