Project files' tree

Are there any articles or recommendations how to organize file hierarchy in your project? I am interested in how to name folders, to separate sources and headers or not. I have project written in C++, a library and project using it. Library has many components, they are separated from each other but some of them use common files. Should I create directories for them? I will be glad to hear all recommendations.
