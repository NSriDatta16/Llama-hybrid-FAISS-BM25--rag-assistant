This is based solely on my experience with Active Directory - but I would assume other LDAP directories will handle it similarly: No, a user exists only once and therefore can only be located in one single container (typically an OrganizationalUnit). There's no concept of "symbolic links" to users, as far as I know. And why would you really want a user to exist in multiple places anyway?? If you want the user to be part of several subtrees in order to handle permissions, you're doing it all wrong - you shouldn't base your decisions whether or not to permit some user a given operation on his "location" in the LDAP hierarchy, but rather on group membership. LDAP groups are what are intended to handle permissions, and a user can be member of any number of groups - there you have your 1:n relationship - user can be member of groups, and those groups are responsible for handling permissions.
