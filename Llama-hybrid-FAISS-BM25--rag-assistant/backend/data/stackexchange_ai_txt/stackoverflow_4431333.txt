I recently wrote a PCAP dump file unpacker in C and then afterwards wished I'd just used the open source libraries instead (when I realised they existed and were so easy to use). I have to say that as it's a binary file format it's probably easier to do in C than Perl, but I'll no doubt get boo'ed by all the Perl fanatics out there. What I will say is that using existing code will be quicker all round than coding it yourself, but if you really really want to, the file format is freely available online and is really quite simple. As for searching for a pattern, it almost certainly won't work. It's a binary file format and the packets can be fragmented and/or duplicated, so the only reliable way to know where a message starts and ends is by unpacking the headers, checking the packet flags, reading the content length field, etc. etc. Doing pattern searches may work 90% of the time, but at some point you'll find a packet capture log that means you need to change your code. And then a while later find another packet that means another change, and so on and so forth.
