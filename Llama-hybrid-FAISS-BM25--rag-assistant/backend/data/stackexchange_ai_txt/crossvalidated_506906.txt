Just to add more information to @Andrew 's comment. First of all, bias and variance that you are talking about are properties of an estimator, not the data. In this case, if my estimator is a static function which always returns 1. It's clear that getting more data doesn't reduce bias or variance. But most of the time, we are talking about machine learning estimator which it's capable f learning given data. Its bias can be seen as a limitation of that model. So you cannot reduce the bias by adding more data -- but it might be reduced if you apply a transformation to the data to make it easier for a model to learn. When people say that adding more data will decrease variance(not bias), as I understand, it is because that additional data reveal more information about the relationship that you are looking for so the model doesn't have to guess so it can be certain about the answer.
