I want to start by clarifying. When you're using PHP session storage, the sessions are being stored in a file (usually in /tmp). Each session becomes it's own file. When you use memcached or redis to store sessions, nothing in your PHP code changes. You can simply configure php to use redis or memcache to store the sessions instead (configured via session save handler in php.ini). Pros: session storage/retrieval becomes much much faster cons: you need to configure php.ini (or implement the session save handler yourself) now, I would actually recommend using redis instead of memcache, simply because the sessions will become permanent, so if you need to reboot the server, all your users wont get logged out. For redis: https://github.com/owlient/phpredis (see "session handler" lower on the page)
