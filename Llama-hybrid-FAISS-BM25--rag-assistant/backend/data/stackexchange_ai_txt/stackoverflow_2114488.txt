How to serve a file with JSP?

This may sound totally stupid, but is a case of real life :( I'm able to display a HTML table with a "virtual" link name. Something like this: Xyz description document.doc Xyz description documentB.doc Xyz description documentC.doc This doc id represents an id in the database ( for these docs are stored in a blob as byte[] ) Anyway. I'm able to get that id, query the database and retrieve the byte[] ( and even store it in a tmp file ) What I can't figure out how to do, is, that when the user click on the link ( and after I perform the db retrieval ) "serve" the byte[] to the user. Now the very worst part, and what makes me ask this question here is, I need to do this with JSP only ( no servlet ) and without 3rd party libraries ( just... don't ask me why I hate it too ) So. How do I serve in a jsp the binary content of a byte array stored in the server file system My first guest is: Am I close to the solution? Would this work to the client as if he had clicked really in the server for a real file? Thanks in advance.
