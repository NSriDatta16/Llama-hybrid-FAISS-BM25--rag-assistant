Connecting A Second Site To Current SQL Database

Ok - long story short. Have an e-comm site hosted on Windows VPS using SQL Server 2005, site been up for years and works just fine. I am now trying to set up a new site hosted on another Windows VPS Server that will share the same database. Both sites are using classic asp and I have put up a duplicate page to each server that has a simple SQL query to display back a product name on screen. On the new site I get the 500 error listed below: GET /testConnection.asp |49|800a0bb9|Arguments_are_of_the_wrong_type__are_out_of_acceptable_range__or_are_in_conflict_with_one_another. Line 49 in the code is: rsProdDetail.Open SQL, cnn, adOpenForwardOnly, adLockReadOnly, adCmdText As I mentioned the page is identical on the 2 servers. The adovbs.inc is there and the path for the file include is correct on the new server. Where do I look next?
