Django formsets are not the way to go: They are used if you need to edit multiple objects at the same time. HTML fieldsets are more like the correct way. I imagine you could group the name and company fields into one fieldset, and then the interest fields into another. On DjangoSnippets you can find a template tag that aids the grouping . Using this snippet, you would define the grouping in your view as fieldsets = ( ('', {'fields': ('name','company')}), ('Interested in', {'fields': ('foo','bar','baz')}) ) Pass it to the template along with the form, and render the form with {% draw_form form fieldsets %} I would prefer not to define the grouping in the view, as it's mainly presentational issue and should belong to the view, but what the heck, this seems to do the job! muhuk 's solution though looks more elegant than this...
