ReportViewer - Remote Mode Question

We're considering using the VS 2010 Microsoft Report Viewer in Remote mode. My question has to do with is where data retrieval takes place. Let me give an example. Say we have a report with two parameters. These parameters are then passed as stored procedure parameters when data is retrieved. So, my question is, when is the stored procedure called? Is it called from the SSRS 2008 server and then the data and report sent to the report viewer client or, is the stored procedure called from the report viewer client? Secondly, let's say the report is being displayed in the report viewer client, and the user changes the parameter values and refreshes the report. Is the stored proc called from the client or is the stored proc somehow called from the server?
