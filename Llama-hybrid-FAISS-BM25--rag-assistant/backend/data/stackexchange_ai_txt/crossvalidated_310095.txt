Your problem is that your $\mu$ is really an estimator $\mu=\bar x_i$, not the expectation. As an estimator it is not equal to zero. Yes, in average $E[\mu]=0$ but not the realization in a given sample. So, when you calculate $(x_i - \mu)^2$, you can't set $\mu=0$, then you don't have $(x_i - \mu)^2\ne x_i^2$. Instead you plug your $\mu=\frac{1}{p} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i + \sum_{i=n+1}^{p=n+m}x_i\right)$, and a get a bunch of cross terms in the sums when squaring the deviations from the average $\mu$. These cross terms will bring up the correlation $\rho$
