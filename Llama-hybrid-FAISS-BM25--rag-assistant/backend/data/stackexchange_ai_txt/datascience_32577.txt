I found very intuitive the explanation of the GAE in the Supplementary material of this paper: DeepMimic . You do not need to read the paper. Just go straight to the Supplementary material section on page 143:15. For the Î»-return you can find lots of information in the Reinforcement Learning book of Sutton and Barto. Hope it helps!
