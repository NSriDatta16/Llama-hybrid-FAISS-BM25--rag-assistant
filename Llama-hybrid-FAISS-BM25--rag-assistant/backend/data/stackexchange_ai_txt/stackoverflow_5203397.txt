Those are actually very different constructs. This form is the only way to actually allocate memory for data: string MyData; This is called a "field". This form is called an "automatically implemented property": string MyData { get; set; } The compiler translates this onto something like this: string myDataField; string MyData { get { return myDataField; } set { myDataField = value; } } So as you can see they are very different, yet they both end up creating a field for storage. However, using the property allows for much more future flexibility.
