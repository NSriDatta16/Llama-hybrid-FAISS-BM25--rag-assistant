Some questions on multiple logistic regression

Let's say we have k binary (binomial) variables, and a sample size of n observations per variable, where each variable occurs (positive case) at a given frequency/probability f. We would like to check if there is a correlation between these variables by multiple logistic regression, so the null hypothesis assumes that they are all independent from each other (no correlation). Some questions: Does it matter which variable we pick as the dependent variable? Or to put it another way, is there a way to do multiple logistic regression in a symmetrical manner, so that it doesn't matter which variable we pick as the dependent variable? What test statistic should be used to measure the degree of correlation between these binary variables? Is there a "symmetric" one, where it doesn't matter which variable we pick as the dependent variable? What is the appropriate distribution (f, t, z, chi^2, etc.) for this test statistic, and how does the CDF depend on various parameters, such as n, k and f? Is there a formula to define this? What is the best way to calculate the minimum sample size n required to identify a "significant" correlation (p And finally, is multiple regression (logistic or otherwise) really the right approach to test for a correlation between these binomial variables, or is there a simpler way?
