iphone storing password locally and sending it across to a server securely

I am writing an iPhone app which will start with asking the user to register with a login/passwd. These should be : Saved securely locally Send securely to a remote web-server What do I need to achieve the above? Say, for local storage, shall I save them in a file or database? Shall I encrypt it? For sending it over, is HTTPS sufficient?
