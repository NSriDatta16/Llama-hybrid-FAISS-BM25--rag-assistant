Is it possible to display just the preview with markitUp?

Is there a way to display only preview window with markitUp!, http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/ , during text input from the user? I found nothing about this in markitUp! documentation. In fact, I think viewing source code of a message can be embarrassing for an average user.
