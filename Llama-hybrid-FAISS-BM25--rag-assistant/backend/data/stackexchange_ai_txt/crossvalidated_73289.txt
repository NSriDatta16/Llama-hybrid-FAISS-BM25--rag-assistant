PCA tries to project your data onto a new set of dimensions where the variances in your data are captured such that you can classify/cluster them visually or by using a hopefully simple algorithm. The variance plot tells you how much the new set of dimensions capture variances in decreasing order. Biplot is the projection of your data on the first two principal components (where the variances are the highest).
