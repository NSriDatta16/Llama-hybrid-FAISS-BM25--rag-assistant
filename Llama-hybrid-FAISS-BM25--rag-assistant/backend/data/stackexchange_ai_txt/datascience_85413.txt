Which metrics for evaluating a recommender system with implicit data?

I am currently in the process of creating a recommender system. This recommender system works with a neural network and then searches for the closest neighbors and thus gives recommendations for a user. The data is implicit. I only have in the data which products a user has bought.On the basis of this data, I create the recommendations. What are the best metrics to evaluate this recommender system with implicit data? Can I evaluate the model and then the search algorithm? If so, are the metrics different? Which metrics do I have to use for what?
