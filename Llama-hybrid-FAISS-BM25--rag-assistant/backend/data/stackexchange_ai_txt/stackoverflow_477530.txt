The error message is not a out of bounds but an access violation. This means you are accessing memory that is not yours to access. This happens mostly when a class variable (which is a pointer to a class) is not initialized or is already freed. The code, which I presume is a method of form1, can use some change (which already is mentioned): OpenDialog.execute; // crashes here if fileexists(OpenDialog.FileName) then Address.Text := OpenDialog.FileName; But what is OpenDialog, is it a component dragged to form1? In that case form1 is probably not initialized. But most likely is that OpenDialog is a local variable. In that case you can initialize it: OpenDialog := TOpenDialog.Create; try OpenDialog.execute; if fileexists(OpenDialog.FileName) then Address.Text := OpenDialog.FileName; finally OpenDialog.Free; end;
