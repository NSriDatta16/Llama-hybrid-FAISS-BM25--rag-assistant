As other answers mentioned, using VGG like pre-trained models will help. But when you are saying its always coming as 0, following things you can check in your code: Are class labels proper? It can be the case that all are 0 class. See softmax value of predictions, are they different. If not then we have a problem. Try without Drop out and batch normalization. Check if predictions are fine on train data. It might be possible that there is an error in your invocation code. (Like you are processing image differently while training as compared to invoking) After CNN layers, as @desmond mentioned, use the Dense layer or even Global Max pooling. Also, check to remove BatchNorm and dropout, sometimes they behave differently. Last and most likely this is the case: How different are your images in the train as compared to validation. If they are from different camera or something it will be different and these things cause issues
