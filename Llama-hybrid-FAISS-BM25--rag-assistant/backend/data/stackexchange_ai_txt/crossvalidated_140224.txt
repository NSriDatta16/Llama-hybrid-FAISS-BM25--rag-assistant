Multiple Imputation: If "Pooled" isn't "averaged" then what is it?

I used MI for a couple variables, and just want to be sure I know what SPSS did when it pooled test statistics. I've read that "pooled" is not "averaged"...so what is the calculation being done when it pools results? Maybe it depends on the statistical test? To be specific, I will be running t-tests, bivariate correlations, linear regression (all of which are MI-support analyses in SPSS 22). Thanks in advance!
