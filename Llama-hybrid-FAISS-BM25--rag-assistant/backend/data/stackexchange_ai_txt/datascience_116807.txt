SSD_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_640x640 The architecture of ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_640x640 is a combination of the MobileNet v2 architecture for feature extraction and the Single Shot Detector (SSD) architecture for object detection, with the addition of a Feature Pyramid Network Lite (FPN Lite) module. MobileNet v2 is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is designed for efficient computation on mobile and embedded devices. It uses depthwise separable convolutions and residual connections to reduce the number of parameters and improve the performance of the network. MobileNet is used for feature extraction , which means it is responsible for identifying key features in the input image that can be used for object detection. SSD is a popular object detection algorithm that uses a set of default bounding boxes, called anchor boxes, to predict the location and class of objects in an input image. It combines the predictions from these anchor boxes with a non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm to produce the final detection results. SSD is used for detection, which means it takes the extracted features and uses them to identify the location of objects in the image. FPN Lite is a lightweight version of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture , which is commonly used in object detection tasks to combine high-resolution features from shallow layers with low-resolution features from deep layers to improve detection accuracy . In the ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_640x640 model , the FPN Lite module is used to combine the output of the MobileNet v2 and SSD layers, providing additional contextual information for the object detection task to improve the accuracy of the object detection by incorporating information from multiple scales.
