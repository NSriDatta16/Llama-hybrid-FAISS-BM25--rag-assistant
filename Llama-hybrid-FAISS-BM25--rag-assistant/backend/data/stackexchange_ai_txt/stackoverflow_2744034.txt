Use render to texture: Create a new (target) texture texHSL with the size of your source texture texRgb Set up a viewport with size of texHSL using an orthogonal projection Create and bind a framebuffer and use texture texHSL as a render target Render a screen size quad (may be larger) using a shader. For the shader bind texRgb using a uniform The shader reads the texture value for the currently rendered value (see by answer there), computes the RGB->HSL conversion and writes the HSL value to gl_FragColor Unbind and delete the framebuffer Voila, your converted image is in texHSL
