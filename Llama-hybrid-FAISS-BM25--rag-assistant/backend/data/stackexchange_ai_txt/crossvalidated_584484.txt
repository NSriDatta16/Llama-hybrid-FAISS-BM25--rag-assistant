Your code brings in an amazing amount of dependencies just in order to handle a trivial recode (see alternate below). And you have not demonstrated equivalences of doses vs. outcomes in order to pool unequal doses. You will find that the outcome depends on how much greater than 1 is the dose. To your question, you refer to outcome groups but then say you want to combine groups on the basis of baseline variables. p1 and p2 use the same outcome, supp . Decide on which probability you'd like to estimate, and estimate that, optionally converting it to odds after the fact. Are you wanting to estimate the average probability over the two improper dose groups? (Why not estimate a dose-response curve with continuous dose?). If you want the (almost uninterpretable) average probability you can average the predicted values. You'd have to do a little programming (perhaps using the bootstrap) to get confidence limits.
