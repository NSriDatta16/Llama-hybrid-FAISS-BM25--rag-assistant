IMHO, you are creating a monster. As your app grows more and more features and global screens are going to be baked into that base view model. It inevitable will be a god code-behind class like .aspx.cs files MVC tries to avoid. Its better to use things like MVC2's RenderAction or the SubController stuff from MVC Contrib even if it means breaking the MVC pattern a little bit. Look at a site like CNN or even Stackoverflow.com, you'll have a dozen methods in there before you know it.
