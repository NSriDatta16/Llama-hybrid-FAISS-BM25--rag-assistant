No, this decision tree is unable to "generalize in the same way as the original random forest". The author also clearly states this in section Does this aproximation hold for unseen data? : '... the only problem is that this strategy applies strictly only on the seen/available data' . At least no guarantee. The main use of this method is its explainability - using a simple, easily explainable model to mimic the behavior of a more complex model so to gain insight on how the complex model make decision. However, again this explainability does not hold for unseen data in general.
