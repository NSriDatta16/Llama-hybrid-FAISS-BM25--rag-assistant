Have you ever looked at Alfresco ( http://alfresco.com )? It serves many of the same purposes as SharePoint, but does it from an Open Source J2EE application. It will leverage your existing collaboration / content management experience and expose you to a whole bunch of open source technologies. Full disclosure: I work for Alfresco.
