Javascript: Any reason to use 2 seperate arrays for key value pairs over a hashtable?

I saw some code which was storing key,value pairs in 2 arrays. The only purpose of this storage was to use the 2 arrays as a hashtable, 1 array stored keys, the other values. Is there any performance advantage to doing this? This particular example consisted of 2 arrays of strings.. e.g q[0] = "key" v[0] = "value"
