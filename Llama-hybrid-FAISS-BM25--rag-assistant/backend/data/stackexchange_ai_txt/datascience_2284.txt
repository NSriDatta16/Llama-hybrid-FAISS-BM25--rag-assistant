Is it possible to identify different queries/questions in sentence?

I want to identifies different queries in sentences. Like - Who is Bill Gates and where he was born? or Who is Bill Gates, where he was born? contains two queries Who is Bill Gates? Where Bill Gates was born I worked on Coreference resolution, so I can identify that he points to Bill Gates so resolved sentence is "Who is Bill Gates, where Bill Gates was born" Like wise MGandhi is good guys, Where he was born? single query who is MGandhi and where was he born? 2 queries who is MGandhi, where he was born and died? 3 quries India won world cup against Australia, when? 1 query (when India won WC against Auz) I can perform Coreference resolution (Identifying and converting he to Gandhi ) but not getting how can I distinguish queries in it. How to do this? I checked various sentence parser, but as this is pure nlp stuff, sentence parser does not identify it. I tried to find "Sentence disambiguation" like "word sense disambiguation", but nothing exist like that. Any help or suggestion would be much appreciable.
