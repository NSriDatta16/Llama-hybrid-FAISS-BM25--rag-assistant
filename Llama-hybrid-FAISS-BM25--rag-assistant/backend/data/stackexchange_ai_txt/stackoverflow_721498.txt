There has to a business benefit to the redesign, and by business benefit I mean "this redesign will reduce our time to market significantly in future releases". Are you going to be porting this code elsewhere in the future? Will you be making future releases with significant new features? If so then it sounds like there's definitely a case to be made for at least investigating a redesign. Or, is the project mostly in maintenance mode with no new development scheduled? In my experience, re-architecting/redesigning code in this state is usually just a developer exercise and provides no tangible business benefit to the organization.
