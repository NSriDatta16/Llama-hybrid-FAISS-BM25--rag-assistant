Does DTW return smaller distance measure than Euclidean Distance?

QUESTION 1: When computing the distance between two time series, shouldn't the DTW distance measure return a smaller distance than the Euclidean distance (assuming DTW internally uses the Euclidean Distance (ED))? In my understanding, the DTW algorithm will choose the index $i$ of a time series $T$ that best matches a given index $j$ of the other series $Q$ . This should only yield a better result than merely taking $i = j$ like the Euclidean distance, shouldn't it ? I know that there are a few constraints on the DTW algorithm, but in my mind, these do not explain why the distance is greater in DTW than in ED. I've been trying to find a bug in the code but the library I'm using seems solid. I'm trying to do similarity search and using both separately yields the same results on artificial datasets however, I would like to compare the two algorithms on real data. If DTW yields better results, I could use an approximation like FastDTW to overcome the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time and space complexity of DTW and have the same complexity as ED $(\mathcal{O}(N))$ . QUESTION 2: If comparing the distances is not the right option, how do I compare the two algorithms (apart from visually) ?
