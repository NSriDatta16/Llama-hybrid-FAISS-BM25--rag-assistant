Not very clear average of what values you wanted to calculate. I assume, it's y-coordinates. I would use RBBOX function to select set of points on the plot. Try this code: % sample data data = rand(1,100); datax = 1:numel(data); % draw simple plot plot(data,'.') % select the points with mouse and get coordinates k = waitforbuttonpress; point1 = get(gca,'CurrentPoint'); % button down detected finalRect = rbbox; % return figure units point2 = get(gca,'CurrentPoint'); % button up detected point1 = point1(1,1:2); % extract x and y point2 = point2(1,1:2); pmin = min(point1,point2); pmax = max(point1,point2); % find the data selected and get average of y values idx = data >= pmin(2) & data =pmin(1) & datax I have to claim large portion of this code is from rbbox documentation.
