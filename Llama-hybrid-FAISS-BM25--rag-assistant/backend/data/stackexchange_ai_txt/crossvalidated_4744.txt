There are symmetric confidence intervals for the Binomial distribution: asymmetry is not forced on us, despite all the reasons already mentioned. The symmetric intervals are usually considered inferior in that Although they are numerically symmetric, they are not symmetric in probability : that is, their one-tailed coverages differ from each other. This--a necessary consequence of the possible asymmetry of the Binomial distribution--is the crux of the matter. Often one endpoint has to be unrealistic (less than 0 or greater than 1), as @Rob Hyndman points out. Having said that, I suspect that numerically symmetric CIs might have some good properties, such as tending to be shorter than the probabilistically symmetric ones in some circumstances.
