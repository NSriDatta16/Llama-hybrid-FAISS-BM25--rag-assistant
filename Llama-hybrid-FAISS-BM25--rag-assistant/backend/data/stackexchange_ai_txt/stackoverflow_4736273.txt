As self-aggrandizing as it is, I'm throwing my hat into the pool of nominations. =) When I initially became a member of SO, I was self-centered, there was a healthy concern about increasing reputation and comparing myself to others. While I wouldn't judge anyone and say this is bad behavior, it runs contrary to what a moderator does. However, over time, I came to value the importance of maintaining the health of the ecosystem rather than my own reputation; this is evidenced by the flattening of my reputation curve and the increase in the number of edits for clarity (while maintaing the author's original meaning and style), retagging, voting (up, down, to close) and flagging for attention (even flagging my own question for because it was too specific). Yes, content is king on SO, but without the participation of the community in these areas, it becomes like any other web board, and as we know, it isn't just another web board. Now, while there are many who can do the same things on SO, and those that have even more ability if they have over 10K using the admin tools, it's not the fact that I use these tools that I believe makes me a good candidate. It's the fact that I believe it is my responsibility to use these tools to contribute to a healthy ecosystem that makes me a good candidate. Being nominated (and hopefully, elected) to a moderator would help further my ability to fulfil that responsibility. Thank you for your consideration and best wishes to everyone that is nominated. Looking at some of the other nominations, it appears that I haven't engaged in enough politicking and elaborated on what I feel the responsibilities of a modeator are and how I would fulfil them. I've touched on it breifly in stating the importance of maintaining the health of the ecosystem and that as a part of that community, I have a responsibility to contribute to that goal. As far as a specific guideline as to how that will be achieved, I think that Chip Uni came the closest on meta with his reply to the question "Moderator Accountability Request." : In my opinion, moderators should only do what the rest of the community cannot. Stack Overflow does not need a moderator to close down somewhat-questionable questions. Dozens of 3000+ reputation users already rapidly vote to close down questions. Let the community make those decisions. On the other hand, plenty of things can't be done by non-moderators. We need you to look for suspicious voting patterns. We need you to be a neutral arbiter. We need you to use the tools that you have, and that we don't. I absolutely agree with this, and doing the work that other users cannot would be my first priority every time I am on SO . That's not to say that I would not contribute in non-moderator ways to the community. However, when doing so, I would not use the abilities of a moderator to hasten a result that the community will come to on its own. An example would be voting to close a thread. If I see that a thread has three votes to close, I will not auto-close it, the community is trending in that direction, and the community should be the arbiter of that decision. If I have a personal opinion that the thread should be closed, I'll do what everyone else does, cast my vote to close, and move on. And since I didn't mention this before, if there are specific questions that you have, feel free to post them in the comments, and I'll adjust my nomination accordingly to answer.
