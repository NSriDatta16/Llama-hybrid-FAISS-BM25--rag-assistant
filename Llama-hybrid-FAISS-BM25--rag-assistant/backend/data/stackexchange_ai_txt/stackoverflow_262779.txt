I would use a vector of char as the buffer. std::vector buffer(size); read(input,&buffer[0],size); Basically you don't even want to call new if you don't need to. A vector provides a run-time sized buffer that you can use just like an array (buffer). The best part is that the vector cleans up after itself and the standard guarantees that all element in the vector will be in contigious storage. Perfect for a buffer. Or more formaly the guarantee is: (&buffer[0]) + size == (&buffer[size])
