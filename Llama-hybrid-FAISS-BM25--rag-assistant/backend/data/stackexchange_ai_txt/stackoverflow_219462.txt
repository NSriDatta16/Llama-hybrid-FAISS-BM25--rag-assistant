In my last project, we had three kinds of JS files, all of them inside a JS folder. Library code . A bunch of functions used on most all of the pages, so they were put together in one or a few files. Classes . These had their own files, organized in folders as needed, but not necessarily so. Ad hoc JS . Code that was specific to that page. These were saved in files that had the same name as the JSP pages they were supposed to run in. The biggest effort was in having most of the code on the first two kinds, having custom code only know what to call, and when.
