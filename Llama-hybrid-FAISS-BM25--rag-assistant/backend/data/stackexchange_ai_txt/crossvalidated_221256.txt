In Markov chain, what is meant by "natural ordering"?

I came across the term in the title in the seminal work of Dwork et al. . "Rank Aggregation Methods for the Web", p616, column 2, lines 24-26 Let $M$ be the stochastic matrix for a homogeneous Markov chain defined on a finite space, $S$. Suppose that this Markov chain has a stationary distribution, $y$. Then, $yM = y$, i.e. $y$ is the principal left eigenvector of $M$. The authors then say that the entries in $y$ define a natural ordering on $S$. They then call this ordering the Markov chain ordering of $M$. I do not understand what they mean by "the entries in $y$ define a natural ordering on $S$". I found another paper that shows an application of the ideas in the first paper. When I compute the principal eigenvectors of the $M$ matrices in the second paper and order the elements of the eigenvectors in the usual sense I get an ordering different from the result on page 5, columnn 1, line 9 of the second paper. I know this is a long shot but maybe someone here has had exposure to this sort of stuff.
