Decoupling noises

This is an experimental physics problem: Say I have 3 random variables $P_1, P_2, P_3 $ such as : $\Delta P_i=\Delta_Q P_i +\Delta_0P_i \ \ \forall i$ , where $\Delta$ is the variance, this equations means that the variance of $P_i$ is the sum of two variances (experimental noises are independent and added quadratically). These noises are different in nature, they are due to two different physical effects, the first one indexed $Q$ correlates the three variables in the sense that : ${\rm cov_Q}(P_i,P_j)=\overline{P_i}\times\overline{P_j}$ , where the bar denotes the average. Here ${\rm cov_Q}(P_i,P_j)$ is the covariance of the two variables would have, if they were only affected by the physical effect Q (I hope it makes sense). The other one does not correlate the three variables : ${\rm cov_0}(P_i,P_j)=0$ Question: Is it possible to extract the value of $\Delta_Q P_i$ or equivalently $\Delta_0 P_i$ knowing that I have experimental access to all $\overline{P_i}$ and $\Delta P_i$ (and any other variance or average of observables I can construct with the $P_i'$ such as $P_i+P_j$ ...) ? Thank you all
