Explanation of I-map in a Markov/Bayesian network

I am finding the concept of an I-map (Independency-map) in the context of Markov networks and Bayesian networks difficult to understand. From Probabilistic Graphical Models, Koller and Friedman, 2009: We first define the set of independencies associated with a distribution $P$. Let $P$ be a distribution over $X$. We define $I(P)$ to be the set of independence assertions of the form $(X \bot Y|Z)$ that hold in $P$. We can now rewrite the statement that "$P$ satisfies the local independencies associated with $G$" simply as $I(G) \subseteq I(P)$. In this case, we say that $G$ is an I-map for $P$. Where I'm getting confused: Does this represent every possible independence in a graph given every possible subset of the set of variables $Z$? Or are you able to define $I(P)$ because the graph structure is specified? The whole last sentence is confusing to me. Maybe it's because I can't think abstractly enough, but I don't understand how the I-map of G is a subset of the I-map of P. Any help is appreciated!
