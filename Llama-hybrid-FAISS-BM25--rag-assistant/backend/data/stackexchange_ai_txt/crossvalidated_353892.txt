Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension

My question has to do with the VC dimension of the class of convex polygons with $m$ vertices. A solution to this problem is given in the following: Advanced Algorithms . Call the class of all ellipses in the Cartesian plane centered about the origin $\mathcal{E}_{0,0}$, then all possible ellipses of the form $f(\theta, r) \in \mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ can be described by rotations and translations of elements in this class. Suppose now that the set $\mathcal{C}$ describes the class of all convex polygons on the Cartesian plane. For any arbitrary $e \in \mathcal{E}$, any subset of points $\{ p_1, p_2, ... , p_m\} \in e$ define the set of vertices forming a convex polygon. It should be convincingly realized that for $\rho \in P$ with vertices $V_{\rho} = \{ p_1, p_2, ... , p_m\} \in e,$ $\forall p \in \rho: p \not\in V_{\rho} \implies p \not\in e$, and this statement is true for all $|V_{\rho}|=m \in \mathbb{N}$. Hence, there exists a convex polygon containing all finite subsets of $e$. Hence, $VC(P) = \infty$. This same result can (of course) be proven more simply using just the unit circle. This example was introduced merely to reinforce the fact that a convex polygon may shatter any representative from a family of sets that covers the entire Cartesian plane. Now suppose that $\mathcal{C}_m \subset \mathcal{C}$ describes the set of all convex polygons on the Cartesian plane with strictly $m$ vertices. Again, consider an arbitrary ellipse $e$. Suppose that there are an odd number $2m+1$ of points chosen from the ellipse given by $V_{\rho}$, then any subset $V^{(1)}_{\rho}$ of these $2m+1$ points defines a convex polygon in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and further, $V^{(1)}_{\rho}$ has a complement $V^{(2)}_{\rho} \in V_{\rho}$, and as the cardinality of the superset is $2m+1$, the maximum size of the smaller subset is $m$. Hence, a convex polygon with $m$ vertices may shatter a set $V_{\rho}$ with cardinality $2m+1$. In this context, if the size of $V_{\rho}$ is greater than $2m+1$, it will take more than $m$ vertices to shatter the set, as in any other case the maximum size of the lesser subset will be greater than $m$. Now, let's consider an arbitrary ellipse $e$ given by some $f(\theta, r)$, and define an associated ellipse $e'$ given by $f(\theta, r')$ where $r'=r-\delta_r$ ($\delta_r > 0$). Suppose we label, for any $\theta$, the associated vertex and co-vertex of $e, e'$ which bound all points in the quadrant. Then, for each value $\theta$, the associated (co-)vertices will have the same labelling (say $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$) in the case of both $e$ and $e'$ Now, for any set of points $\{ p_1, p_2, ... , p_m\} \in e$, there is, as before an associated convex polygon $\rho$. Suppose now that we define all points on the edges of an ellipse as belonging to the polygon $\rho$, rather than merely the vertices ($V_{\rho} \neq \rho$). Hence, for any $p \in V_{\rho}$ where $p$ lies between (co-)vertices $v_i, v_i+1$, there exists $p_{a}', p_{b}' \in e'$ between $v_i, v_{i+1}$ (which holds only for cases where original point is not on the (co-)vertex of $e$, $\delta$ sufficiently small, the other case being ignored for now) wherein $p_{a}', p_{b}' \in e'$. Hence, for any $m$ points on $e$, we may define $m'=2m$ points on the associated $e'$. Now define $V_{\rho}' = \{p_1', p_2', \dots p_{2m}', p_{2m+1}', \dots p_{4m}'\}$ where $p_1', ... p_{2m}'$ are points defined by intersections between $e'$ and $\rho$, and $p_{2m+1}', \dots p_{4m}'$ are $2m$ additional points of $e'$. Clearly, any subset of the $V_{\rho}'$ forms a convex polygon on $e'$. What is a lucid way to show that there is no arrangement of the additional $2m$ points wherein one may form an analagous surjection from every subset of $V_{\rho'}$ (of size $\leq 2m$) (call it $i$) to some set $V_{\rho}^{(i)} \in e^{(i)}$ (of size $\leq m$) where $e^{(i)} \in \mathcal{E}$ and $V_{\rho}^{(i)}$ where $V_{\rho}^{(i)}$ forms a convex polygon for some subset $i \subseteq V_{\rho}'$ as being an ellipse containing intersections of lines intersecting all points $p' \in i$. Furthermore, how do I state (simply) that this proof defines an equivalence class of propositions confirming the maximum of the size of the set that $\mathcal{C}$ shatters (No Surjection $\equiv$ VC-Dimension bounded at $2m+1$). $\dots$ Hence, $VC(\mathcal{C}_m) = 2m+1$. $\dots$ Elif this analagous surjection may be defined for any subset of $V_{\rho}'$, does the class $\mathcal{C}_m$ defined not shatter the set $V_{\rho}'$ by similar argument ($\implies \operatorname{VC}(\mathcal{C}_m)=4m$)? if so, does the class of polygons mentioned in 1 reference a class exclusively described by the vertices? If the context in which this question is posed is nonsensical/unnecessary, please explain. It seems to me that paragraph 2 explains only a case involving convex polygons defined on the unit circle (or some arbitrary single ellipse). How does one demonstrate that this is a satisfactory solution in general?
