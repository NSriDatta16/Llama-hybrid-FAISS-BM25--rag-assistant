First, RNDIS as standard delivery available on windows xp onwards, not Jungo's host stack, but MS's. Secondly, do you know what driver you have ready on the device side? Is it Jungo RNDIS target side stack? To communicate between host and target for RNDIS device, try the following two links from MS help you understand the control and data channel, as well as the EP set up: http://207.46.16.248/en-us/library/ee483123(WinEmbedded.60).aspx http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/0/B/B0B199DB-41E6-400F-90CD-C350D0C14A53/%5BMS-RNDIS%5D.pdf RNDIS uses two channels, one control channel and one data channel. The initial communication starts from control channel then data starts flowing on the data channel, which uses two BULK endpoints, IN and OUT. However, you should pay attention to the fact that RNDIS spec requires that after submitting RNDIS control message to control channel endpoint the host will listen for even on the interrupt endpoint.
