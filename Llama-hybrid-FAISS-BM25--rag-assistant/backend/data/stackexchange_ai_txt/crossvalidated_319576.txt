Estimating the distribution over number of clusters in clustering

I'm reading Murphy's Machine Learning- A Probabilistic Perspective. The introductory section on discovering clusters says: It seems that there might be various clusters, or subgroups, although it is not clear how many. Let $K$ denote the number of clusters. Our first goal is to estimate the distribution over the number of clusters, $p(K|D)$; this tells us if there are subpopulations within the data. For simplicity, we often approximate the distribution $p(K|D)$ by its mode, $K^âˆ— = \arg \max_K p(K|D)$. ($D = \{\textbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ is the training data set) Earlier, it's stated that in unsupervised learning, we're essentially performing density estimation, i.e. we want to build models of the form $p(\textbf{x}_i | \theta)$. So I'm confused by the above quoted paragraph- instead of estimating the probability distribution of the feature vector, we seem to be estimating the most likely value of the hyperparameter $K$, which is completely different. Is the $K$ estimation a preliminary step before we get to estimate $p(\textbf{x}_i | \theta)$?And what is exactly meant by "estimate the distribution over the number of clusters"? Distribution of what?
