The comparison is a little odd, HMMs as the name suggests encode a specific set of modeling assumptions, while deep learning is an umbrella term used to describe learning a series of non-linear transformations of the input data. It is possible to come up with a bad deep learning based model for a simple NLP task like part of speech tagging which does worse than an HMM. But with a reasonable model (e.g. a RNN based pos tagger) deep learning almost always does better. A key advantage of deep is that it uses/learns distributed representations (e.g.a word is represented by an "embedding") while graphical models (like HMM) typically do not. Like many other fields, deep learning based methods are now state-of-the-art in many NLP tasks.
