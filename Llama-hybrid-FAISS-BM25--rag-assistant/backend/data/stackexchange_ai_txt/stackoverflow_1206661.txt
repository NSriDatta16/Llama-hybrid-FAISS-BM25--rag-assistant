Calculate draggable divs - jquery

I have two divs on the page, which represent two columns. Both are floating left, have 49% width and padding-right for 0.5%. In each columns there are various divs positioned vertical down. Now I want to make a function, which will allows user to resize each div in column, or if this isn't achieveable, a function which will allow user to resize each column. I have managed to make one div in column resizable ( $('#divid').resizable(); ), but I want to modify script, so auto calculation is on. To explain. If user resize right columnn for xx%, I want that left column reduce size for xx% How to manage this?
