The SQL Server 2008 version has a new feature called FILESTREAM. Part of their documentation also has a section on best practices , in which the MS folks state that FILESTREAM should come into play if the BLOB objects are typically larger 1 MB. That MSDN page states: When to Use FILESTREAM If the following conditions are true, you should consider using FILESTREAM: - Objects that are being stored are, on average, larger than 1 MB. For smaller objects, storing varbinary(max) BLOBs in the database often provides better streaming performance. So I guess with a 3 KB TIFF, you could store that nicely inside a VARBINARY(MAX) field in your SQL Server 2005 table. Since it's even smaller than the 8k page size for SQL Server, that'll fit nicely! You might also want to consider putting your BLOBs into their own table and reference your "base" data row from there. That way, if you only need to query the base data (your ints, varchars etc.), your query won't be bogged down by BLOBs being stored intermingled with other stuff. Marc
