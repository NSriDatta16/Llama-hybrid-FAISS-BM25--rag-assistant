How can I use html agility to grab everything between and

I poorly asked about this same project last week and didn't receive any suggestions. I will try to be more clear. I am trying to work with data from the website www.gtin13.com . For example if you enter peanut butter into the search, I am trying to grab the description:**Nabisco Nutter Butter Sandwich Cookies Chocolate Peanut Butter 4 Ct The * Size :Size: 12 oz The GTIN: 0044000003562 *ean :**00-44000-00356-2 upc: 044000003562 and upca: 04400000356. I have tried using nodeCollection with SelectNodes (" ") and all I get are errors. Is it even possible using html agility to grab the data between the as well and then parse between the /s? With my lack of experience I just can't make any headway on this. It doesn't appear that the returned page has what I would consider true nodes. If html agility can't do this can anyone suggest a better approach? Eventually I would like to send each piece of the data to a sql table. I hope I have presented in a way that makes better sense. The page returns the information in this source format: Nabisco Nutter Butter Sandwich Cookies Chocolate Peanut Butter 4 Ct Size: 12 oz GTIN/EAN-13: 0044000003562 / 00-44000-00356-2 UPC-A: 044000003562 / 04400000356 Tags: Chocolate , Cookies , ..
