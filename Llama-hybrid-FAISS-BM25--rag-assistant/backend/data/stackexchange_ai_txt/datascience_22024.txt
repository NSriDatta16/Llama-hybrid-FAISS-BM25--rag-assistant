Binary predication from binary variables

Logistic Regression generates a binary outcome for a non-binary variable. I need a binary outcome from a binary variable. This is the requirement. How to predict binary A using previous values of A? or How to predict binary A,B,C,D values from previous A,B,C,D values? I know I can gather data and calculate basic probability. I that the most suitable approach? Thank you in advance.
