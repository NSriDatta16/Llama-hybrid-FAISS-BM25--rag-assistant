in Xcode 4 if you archive an application it is signed with the provision profile that you have indicated to use under its build configuration. Most likely a settings that was carried over from an Xcode 3 project. An archived app can be resigned with a different provision profile at a later time (though the organizer or command line), so in a way, yes they are independent of provision profile. Two suggestions for managing building for AdHoc and AppStore: 1) The first is taking advantage of Xcode 4 schemes, and creating a new schemes for AdHoc and AppStore Under the Schemes Menu: Edit Scheme -> Duplicate Scheme, then under the Archive you can select your desired build configuration (AdHoc, AppStore, etc...), you can then name this scheme AdHoc, AppStore to match too. When you want to build for release just select the target scheme and it will sign it with the associated provision profile from the build configuration. 2) Maintain 1 scheme, remove code signing from your build configurations, and code sign apps exclusively though the organizer after archiving.
