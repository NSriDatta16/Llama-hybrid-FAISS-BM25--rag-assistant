All sample size calculations are built on top of a proposed inference that will be made from the data. This might be a confidence interval for an unknown parameter, or a hypothesis test for a set of hypotheses, or a Bayesian posterior inference, etc. Whatever the inference being made, there will be some appropriate measure of how "accurate" the inference is, and this accuracy will be a function of the sample size. For example, if you are computing a confidence interval then the accuracy is usually measured by the width of the interval (relative to an unknown standard deviation) at a given confidence level. If you want to formalise a sample size calculation for a continuous measure of size (e.g., the weight of the sampled soil), you will need to formulate the inference that is being made with the sample, and write out the accuracy of the inference as a function of the continuous size measure. So long as you can write out the accuracy of the proposed inference as a function of the size, you can determine the minimum size required to obtain a stipulated minimum level of accuracy. This can be done regardless of whether the sample size is specified by a discrete unit or a continuous measure. Example: Suppose you have an experiment where you will sample a weight of $w$ grams of soil and determine the proportion of some mineral in that sample. Suppose you are willing to stipulate that the sample proportion $p$ is related to the true proportion $\theta$ by the sampling distribution: $$p \sim \text{N} \Bigg( \theta, \frac{\theta (1-\theta)}{w} \Bigg).$$ In this case you might make an inference about the true proportion $\theta$ using the confidence interval : $$\text{CI}_\theta(1-\alpha) = \Bigg[ p \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{p (1-p)}{w}} \Bigg].$$ The length of this confidence interval is: $$L= 2 z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{p (1-p)}{w}}.$$ A higher accuracy for a confidence interval requires a smaller length for the interval (i.e., a narrower interval is a more accurate inference). Thus, to stipulate the minimum required accuracy for our inference, we would stipulate some maximum length $L_*$ that we are willing to accept. For a given value $\alpha$ and a given sample proportion $p$ , getting this stipulated length requires us to set the sample weight to: $$w = 4 z_{\alpha/2}^2 \frac{p (1-p)}{L_*^2}.$$ Note that this formula will generally yield a non-integer value, which is okay in the case where our sample weight is continuous. As you can see, there is nothing fundamentally different in this computation to the case where we have a discrete sample size. (The only difference here is that we do not need to round the required sample size up to the next integer at the end of the computation.) What is needed is for us to be able to write out some measure of the accuracy of the inference as a function of the sample weight, and then find the minimum weight that gives some stipulated minimum accuracy.
