Using an OOP vs a non-OOP approach there may be a slight difference in performance , with non-OOP being a bit faster, but the difference would be practically negligible. I think OO design patterns would be beneficial for code organization, but the design issues are left up to you. I think you would benefit more than the user. The user can see the same result whether you use OOP or non-OOP.
