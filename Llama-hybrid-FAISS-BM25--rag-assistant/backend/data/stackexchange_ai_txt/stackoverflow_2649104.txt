I finally found the problem. ASIHTTPRequest creates a user-agent based on your applications name, and requests from this user agent is ignored by Yahoo somehow (bug?). As stated in the documentation, you can override the user-agent as follows: [request addRequestHeader:@"User-Agent" value:@"My-User-Agent-1.0"]; I used the user-agent string of Safari on iPhone, and it worked immediately! BTW; the same problem applies for Android, and the same fix works.
