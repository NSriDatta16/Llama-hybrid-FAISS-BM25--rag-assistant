In the ORM designer, why don't the server objects get refreshed properly with new changes?

Whenever I use the ORM deisgner in LinqToSql I have real problems trying to get the latest objects from the server explorer after i've updated them in the database. For example, I have dragged in a stored procedure to handle my insert/updates, which creates the method for me to call. Problem is I then have to go and change one of the parameters of the sp in the database. When I drag the sp back into the designer, my new parameter isn't there. Even after refreshing the server explorer object (db level) it still reverts to the previous parameters. When I look at the parameters in the server explorer it shows my new parameter, but doesn't bring it in when i drag it on. A work around is to close the whole of VS and then it works. This is obviously not ideal, so any help on this would be great. thanks.
