Storing in file system is easier to implement and you can take advantage to use the Directory Structure. However, if you need anything more than simple hirerachy structure(like tagging for instance), most likely you need an database to do the index (can be SQL server or XML Dbs). Here comes the second problem. If you need indexing, the meta data is stored in DB, how about the actual binary image data? Putting binary in SQL is easy to maintain, but you need to implement custom caching strategy from your web server (dumping the image data to web server local disk drive), to avoid too much traffic between web/db. On the other hand, you can just keep the key in db, and save the image in local disk (of web server), this is easy to implement, but two problem may arise: More difficult to scale. Imagine you need more than one web server, syncing content like this might be a problem. File system indexing. If you store the file in local, chances are all files are stationed in one single folder. For any file system, the more file stored in one location means the slower it can look for or fetching content from it. An image gallery can grows to thousands and millions of files, it may cause the problem. (Of course, you can employ some strategy to separate the storage, but this increase the complexity).
