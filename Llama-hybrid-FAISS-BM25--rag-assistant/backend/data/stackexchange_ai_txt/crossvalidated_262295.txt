Difference between variable selection technique and WOE screening

I am using the WOE technique in logistic regression. Using Information Value (IV) of the variables, I am considering the variables with IV > 0.1 and discarding ones with I feel even the multiple-variable selection techniques like stepwise regression also does the same. I found an R package 'Information' documentation here https://github.com/klarsen1/Information which tells otherwise. Note that the purpose of this step should not to be confused with that of multiple-variable selection techniques, such as stepwise regression, where the variables that go into the final model are selected. Rather, this is a precursory step designed to ensure that the approaches deployed during the final modeling phases are set up for success. I am confused after reading this. Can anyone please state the difference in different words.
