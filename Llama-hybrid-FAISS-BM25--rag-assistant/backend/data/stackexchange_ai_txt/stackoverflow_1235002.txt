I was working on a mapping program a few years back, like a native Google Maps. I put little markers on the map for locations, but a lot of markers were clustered closely at certain locations. My boss said "let me make it so I can just drag the markers away a little" (and it'd have a line or speech-bubble-pointer-thingy going from the marker to the actual location). I thought it was silly to make the user do this, especially since he'd spend 5 minutes making it perfect, and then change the zoom level, and then everything would be wrong. I decided to try writing a function to find a way to lay out labels such that the total screen distance from each label to its location was minimized. I believe I convinced myself at the time that this was NP-complete, but that the number of points might be small enough for it to still be feasible, at least in many cases. (I remember thinking we spent way too much time in class on NP-completeness proofs, and not enough on alternative solutions: if your boss wants something done, you can't just say "NP hard, won't do" -- you still have to come up with something .) Then Google Maps came along and just splatted all the labels on top of each other, which totally sucks (and I curse it every day), but I can't compete with their other features so I gave up. :-(
