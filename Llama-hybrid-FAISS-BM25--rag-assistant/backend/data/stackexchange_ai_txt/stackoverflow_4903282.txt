View Html in ios/ipod Apps

Hi i want to make a few http request and generate html from within my ipod app. I hear i want a WebView to view the html as if it were a browser. So my question is how do i make the http request? How do i parse json (or xml) and how do i save/load data? I figure i can use webstorage to load/save the data however i am thinking since its an ipod app i have a better way of storing it?
