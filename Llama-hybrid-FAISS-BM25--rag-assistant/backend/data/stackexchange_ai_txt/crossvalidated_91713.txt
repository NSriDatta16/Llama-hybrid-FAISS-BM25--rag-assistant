Finding interactions using randomForest

I am trying to use randomForest in R to find interaction terms to add to a model. My plan was to fit trees with maxnodes=4 (two deep stubs), then compute how often var A is a child of var B and its improved accuracy to measure the importance of the A*B interaction. Essentially this is leveraging randomForest for the sampling. To make this work I also wanted mtry=# variables, so all variables would have a chance at being the child of the root variable. This strategy failed in my data because all trees after the first few were identical. I did decrease cp , but that did not help. I removed mtry=#vars , and still got all 95% of trees the same (the last 95%, the first few are different). When maxnodes=32 , I got a good set of trees, but that's not what I needed for determining interactions. I need to do this because I can't deploy a randomForest in production. Any ideas why this wouldn't work? I am coding this myself now using rpart on 2 variable models iterating over the potential good pairs.
