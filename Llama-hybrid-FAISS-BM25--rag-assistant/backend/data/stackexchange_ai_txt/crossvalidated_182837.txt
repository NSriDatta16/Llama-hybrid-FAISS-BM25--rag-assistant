Predict class label at time t given time-series of vectors up to time t

Given a series of $k=4$ vectors (in $\mathbb{R}^n$), with $n=70$ at time $t=-3$, ..., $t=0$, and class labels for vectors at $t=-3$, ..., $t=-1$. Which machine learning approach would be best for predicting the class label at $t=0$?
