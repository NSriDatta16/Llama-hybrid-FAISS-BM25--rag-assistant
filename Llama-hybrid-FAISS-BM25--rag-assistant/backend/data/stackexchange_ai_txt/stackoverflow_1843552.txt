javascript within php

The following code does not work for me popup_show(\''.$a.'\', \'popup_drag\', \'popup_exit\', \'screen-top-left\', 20, 20) "; } ?>" > I even tried this with an alert . alert('Hello') "; } ?>" > Even this did not work. I need to be able to call the popup_show function for all the values of the array$arr. Thanks for any help. I would really appreciate it.
