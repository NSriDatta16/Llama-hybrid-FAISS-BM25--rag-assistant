database (mysql) data type choice: Text vs Binary

What are the tradeoffs in choosing a TEXT datatype as compared to a BLOB or BINARY datatype? I don't intend to index on the column or use it in a WHERE clause, it's just data in the database, that happens to be textual. If there's a performance or storage advantage to my choice of datatype though, that would be good to know... Thanks!
