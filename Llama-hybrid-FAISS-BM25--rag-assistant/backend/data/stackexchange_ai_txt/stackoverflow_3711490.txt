Even you can make this work, you might want to consider if this is the best architectural choice. You could run into all sorts of versioning hell trying to maintain such a beast. If you really can't find an equivalent Ruby library (or it's a big investment in Python you want to leverage,) consider using a queue (like RabbitMQ) to implement a message passing design. Then you can keep your Python bits Python and your Ruby bits Ruby and not try to maintain a Frankenstein build environment.
