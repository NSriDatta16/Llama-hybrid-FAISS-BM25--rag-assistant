Can I use a GLM in R to analyse the relationship between time-series environmental variables?

I have a water quality sensor which is measuring various parameters every hour for one year in the same location. I would like to analyse the relationship between each of these parameters and determine whether it is significant over the time series, would a GLM be appropriate for this or not given the potential interdependence of the variables? Thanks
