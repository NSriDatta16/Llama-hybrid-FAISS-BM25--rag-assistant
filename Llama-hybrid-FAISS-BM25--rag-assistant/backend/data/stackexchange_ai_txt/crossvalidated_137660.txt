by going to suggested link i created below code and though it might be useful. ###Define factor and level in below code cand.list = expand.grid(Storage = c("8 GB", "16 GB"), Brand = c("Samsung", "Apple", "Nokia"), RAM = c("1 GB", "2 GB"), BrowseTime = c("24 hour", "36 hour"), Weight = c("3.95 oz OR 111 gram", "5.04 oz OR 142gram"), ScreenSize = c("4.7", "5.5", "5.7")) ###same as SPSS orthogonal design 'seed'. Can put any number. Does not matter. set.seed(69) ###Generate 16 alternatives in an optimal orthogonal design optFederov( ~ ., data = cand.list, nTrials = 16) ###End of code I have a question for you all though. I got below values for design efficiency D =0.2519353; A = 5.462121; Ge = 0.748; Dea = 0.714. Which value should we be looking at for D-Eficiency? I assume it's D and how much it should be in order for this design to be usable in a choice experiment as alternatives? is current D value of 0.2519353 good enough for use?
