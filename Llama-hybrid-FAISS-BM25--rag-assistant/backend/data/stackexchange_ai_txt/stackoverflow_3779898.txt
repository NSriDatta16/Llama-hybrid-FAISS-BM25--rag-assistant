I used to identify outliers by calculating the standard deviation . Everything with a distance more as 2 (or 3) times the standard deviation from the avarage is an outlier. 2 times = about 95%. Since your are calculating the avarage, its also very easy to calculate the standard deviation is very fast. You could also use only a subset of your data to calculate the numbers.
