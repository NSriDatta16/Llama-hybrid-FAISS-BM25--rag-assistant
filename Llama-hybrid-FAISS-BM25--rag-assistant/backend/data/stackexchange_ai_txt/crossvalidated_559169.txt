The straightforward approach would be to compute the Bayes factor (and possibly use prior beliefs to arrive at a posterior probability), as mentioned in my answer to the previous question. There is a good paper by David Barber on this topic, for the classification case, and it is also discussed in his book "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning".
