I tried going through all the slides on the propaganda twice but I didn't come across any problem. I don't know what is going on, but you can make your code a little cleaner and more readable by just making an array to store the contents of each "slide", and simply loop through it on mouse click. I guess you don't really need to set the background property of that div and you could just include an image. Just an advice, not sure if it will help with your problem, but will make this thing more manageable and easier to add more stuff.
