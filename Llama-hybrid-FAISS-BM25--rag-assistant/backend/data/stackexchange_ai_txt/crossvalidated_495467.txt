Intuitive/Practical meaning of non-stationarity of GDP Data

As i just read in a time series book that a particular GDP data under consideration is non-stationary verified through various tests. From stationarity definition this means that the process has infinite memory and also specifically 'persistence of random shocks' i.e. shocks do not die away. But can someone enlighten me how I can think this intuitively or practically like say during recession GDP sinks but it eventually recovers from that period to new highs, so how does this infinite memory of old shocks or significant change in value affects the random walk of GDP over such long period of time or say in coming period after event has been happened more than 2-3 decades ago? Please bear with the question, studying into basic intro time series subject. Thanks :)
