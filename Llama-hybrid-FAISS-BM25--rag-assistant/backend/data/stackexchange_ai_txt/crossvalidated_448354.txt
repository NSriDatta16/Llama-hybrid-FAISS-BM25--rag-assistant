Bayesian hypothesis test to compare theta >= 1 vs. theta < 1

Brand new to Bayesian statistics. I'm working a problem in R where I've used a Jeffrey's prior with a Poisson distribution to get a Gamma posterior. It's a simple problem where I've been able to compute the expectation of the posterior mean both algebraically and with a simulation in R. I now need to do a hypothesis test with Ho being theta >= 1 and H1 being theta
