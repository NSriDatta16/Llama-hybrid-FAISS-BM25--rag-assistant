I'm a little confused by your notion of coefficients interacting (I think you mean covariates, $x$'s). But I'll add some clarity around what it means to add coefficients. Can you add two log odds together, and then convert them to make a combined conditional probability of, in this case, B5+B6? We don't really say the "probability of $\beta_5 + \beta_6$", since these are coefficients. We can however ask about the change in log odds associated with a 1 unit increase in covariates $x_5$ and $x_6$, for example. Let's say you have the following logistic regression model: $$\text{logit} (P(Y=1|X=x)) = \alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_1x_2$$ You want to know if you can add $\beta_2 + \beta_3$? It's important to understand what the coefficient represents: Let's say $X_2$ increased by 1 unit, the new log odds $P(Y=1|X)$ are: $$\text{logit} (P(Y=1|X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2+1)) = \alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2(x_2+1) + \beta_3x_1(x_2 +1)$$ So the change in log odds associated with a 1 unit increase in $X_2$ is: $$\frac{\text{logit} (P(Y=1|X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2+1))}{\text{logit} (P(Y=1|X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2))} = \frac{\alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2(x_2+1) + \beta_3x_1(x_2+1)}{\alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_1x_2}$$ $$ = \beta_2 + \beta_3x_1$$ So you can add the coefficients if you know your $x_1$ doesn't change. Of course, if it never changed then you should be modeling it as part of the intercept, $\alpha$. Also, I am following a paper published in a journal that does this and then converts B5+B6 to probability by p = (exp -(B5+B6)) - 1. This is not the way I have read how to convert log odds to probabilities. Hence I am wondering if the conversion process (from log odds to probability) changes when using combined coefficients? I'm also not familiar with this notation. In fact if $\beta_5 + \beta_6 > 0$ then $e^{-(\beta_5+\beta_6)}-1$ is negative $\beta_5 + \beta_6 both of which are quite odd for a probability.
