How to convert binary category feature to numeric feature, like 'Gender'?

In a machine learning or data mining problem, suppose I have a original feature named "Gender", and now I want to convert this feature to numeric feature, there are two ways to do that, but I realy do not know which one is better? Convert to one feature, and 1 represented 'male' and 0 represented 'female' Convert to two diffent feature, just like one-hot encoding, like 'ismale' and other one is 'isfemale' thx
