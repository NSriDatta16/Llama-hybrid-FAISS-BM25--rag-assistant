The first formula, with divisor N, is usually used. It is slightly biased, but generally has smaller mean square and gives an autocorrelation function which is positive semi-definite. This means, for example, that if you estimate autoregressions using the Yule Walker equations, you always get a solution. There is detail in, for example, Priestley's book "Spectral Analysis and Time Series" around p 323.
