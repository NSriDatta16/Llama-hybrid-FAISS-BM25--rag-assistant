Calculating the Probabilities Subjectively - Bayesian

I ran across this problem when I was trying to review my probability. It seemed easy enough, but I'm having a difficult time understanding the logic behind solving it. The country of Chile is divided administratively into 15 regions. The size of the country is 756,096 square kilometers. How big do you think the region of Atacama is? Let A 1 be the event that Atacama is less than 10,000 square kilometers. Let A 2 be the event that Atacama is between 10,000 and 50,000 square kilometers. Let A 3 be the event that Atacama is between 50,000 and 100,000 square kilometers. Let A 4 be the event that Atacama is more than 100,000 square kilometers. Assign probabilities to A 1,..., A 4. Atacama is the fourth largest of 15 regions. Using this information, revise your probabilities. The smallest region is the capital region, Santiago Metropolitan, which has an area of 15,403 square kilometers. Using this information, revise your probabilities. The third largest region is Aysen del General Carlos Ibanez del Campo, which has an area of 108,494 square kilometers. Using this information, revise your probabilities. Any help would be great, thanks! edit: Sorry I didn't mention this, the problem said that I just needed to determine the probabilities subjectively.
