Questions regarding correlation

I'm writing a thesis about cooperating competition between companies. I have a few problems with the last two research questions: RQ7: Are there any differences between the perception of costs and benefits of the cooperating competition between the companies that have previously experienced the concept of cooperating competition and those who had not. RQ8: Are there any differences between the perception of costs and benefits of the cooperating competition between different kinds of industries in which the companies conduct their business. So, for RQ7 I have 3 major perceptions of costs which are scales ranging from 1(I highly don't agree) to 7(I highly agree), the same goes for perceptions of benefits and i have a nominal variable for previously experienced cooperating competition, which is just yes or no. RQ8 is similar to RQ7 except it has a nominal variable with eleven possibilities for different kind of industries. I used custom table, dragged perceptions in columns and previous competition in row and I got the means for every perception for yes and for no (previous competition) and for different kinds of industries. Looking at the results I don't know if I answered my questions, is there maybe a better tool to for answering these questions, I'm thinking about correlation of some sorts, but don't know how to put it all together. please take a look and tell me what you think.
