A simple techinque would be to grid your data into 0.0005-degree bins and average the readings within each bin. In fact, you could've done this instead of running: picked out a grid and taken, say, 5 readings at each grid point and averaged them. (Or carry three or four GPS devices with you and average them.) On a more sophisticated note... If you process each trail separately, it's common to use something like Kalman Smoothing to smooth location data. A common technique for calculating a smooth surface is Kriging (Gaussian Process regression) smoothing. (See here also.)
