Core Data Image Won't Load Into NSTableView Image Cell

In my code I am storing an image into my Core Data model (works fine). If I set up my view to have an NSImageView and bind its Data to Controller Key: selection and modelKeyPath: myImagePath, it works. It will show each image for the selected row. I then create a new column in my NSTableView and drag an image cell onto the column. However, I cannot get my Core Data bindings to have the image show up in the cell. I have tried binding both value and data, but no luck. Since I am sure the image is stored properly, what am I doing wrong in my binding to prevent the image from showing up in the table cell? Thanks so much. (My background: new Cocoa developer who has recently gone through the entire Hillegass book.)
