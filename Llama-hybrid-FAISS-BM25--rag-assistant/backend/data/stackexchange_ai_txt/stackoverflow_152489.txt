Some questions to consider before switching: [1] Are you fine with sticking to Windows? There are .NET clones for other OS's, but your app is not going to just run transparently. A complexity you might not need. [2] Are you considering switching just for the garbage collection support? If so, you can just use some C++ garbage collector libraries. And if you figure out how to leverage std::shared_ptr, you might not feel the need for garbage collectors. An overhead you might not need. [3] Are you considering C++/CLI because of the garbage collection & all the useful .NET classes that you can leverage? If so, why not just switch to c#. C++/CLI is a transitional technology, and it is best not to invest resources in such things. c# is getting pretty mature and usable. Personally, I would just stick with C++ ;).
