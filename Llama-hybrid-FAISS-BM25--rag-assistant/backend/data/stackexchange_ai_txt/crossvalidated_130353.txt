Whether training a SVM takes long or not depends on the data you are dealing with and the value of the parameters. Concretely, if the different classes overlap and you use a high value of C, then training will take long. Also, if you have very skewed data, you are forced to use a higher value of C, which again leads you to a long training time. There is a solution for this problem though. Lastly, do you pre-process your data? Normalizing your data can help reducing the training time. See the FAQ (previous link) and also this guide for advice on how to make use of SVMs.
