Compiling historical information (esp. SLOCs) about a project

I am looking for a tool that will help me to compile a history of certain code metrics for a given project. The project is stored inside a mercurial repository and has about a hundred revisions. I am looking for something that: checks out each revision computes the metrics and stores them somewhere with an identifier of the revision does the same with the next revisions For a start, counting SLOCs would be sufficient, but it would also be nice to analyze # of Tests,TestCoverage etc. I know such things are usually handled by a CI Server, however I am solo on this project and thus haven't bothered to set up a CI Server (I'd like to use TeamCity but I really didn't see the benefit of doing so in the beginnig). If I'd set up my CI Server now, could it handle that?
