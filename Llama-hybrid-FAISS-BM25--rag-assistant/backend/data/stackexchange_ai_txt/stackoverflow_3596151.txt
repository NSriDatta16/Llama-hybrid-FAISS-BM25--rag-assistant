I do essentially this in so many modes that I've squashed them all together: (mapcar (lambda (hooksym) (add-hook hooksym (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "C-m") 'newline-and-indent) ))) '( clojure-mode-hook emacs-lisp-mode-hook erlang-mode-hook java-mode-hook js-mode-hook lisp-interaction-mode-hook lisp-mode-hook makefile-mode-hook nxml-mode-hook python-mode-hook ruby-mode-hook scheme-mode-hook sh-mode-hook )) Just stick scala-mode-hook in there somewhere and it'll work for you too :)
