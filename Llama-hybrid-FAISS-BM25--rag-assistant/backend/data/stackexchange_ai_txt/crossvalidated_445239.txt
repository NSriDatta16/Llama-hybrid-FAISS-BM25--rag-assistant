Expert description of data visualization figures

There are good sources that teach the different kinds of plots to visualize data analysis results. Especially there are some good statistics books that show different plots to visualize data in various ways. In research papers, however, beyond insightful plots one needs to also describe the technical details of the figure in the best possible way. Are there books or websites that list out research data-plots and then couple it with quality technical descriptions that are professional and technical in nature? For example, there is a simple bar plot. Now what is the most expert technical description I could come up with to write in a research paper ? Maybe something like: "The number of cars are shown to be strictly decreasing with the number of gears with an average drop of 20% per unit increase in the number of gears." In the above example, could you describe more numerical details? Could you explore the technical details of the plot in a more expert way? These are the types of questions on which I seek expert supervision all collected in one place. Are there online resources that do this for various examples on data visualization?
