Man, you really should be using CodeDOM: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y2k85ax6.aspx The CodeDOM provides types that represent many common types of source code elements. You can design a program that builds a source code model using CodeDOM elements to assemble an object graph . This object graph can be rendered as source code using a CodeDOM code generator for a supported programming language. The CodeDOM can also be used to compile source code into a binary assembly. I'd like to draw your attention to the object graph. Using the object graph, you should be able to do what you need to do. EDIT: Sorry for the misdirection, actually what you're trying to accomplish is the reverse of what I suggested - my bad! You may want to look at the following projects, which offer the capability to build an object graph from the code, rather than generate code from an object graph: http://csparser.codeplex.com/ http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/Default.aspx?Page=NRefactory&NS=&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1
