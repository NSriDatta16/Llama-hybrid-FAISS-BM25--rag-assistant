Can we use sentence transformers to embed sentences without labels?

I was trying to use this project : https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers for embedding non english sentences, the language is not a human speaking language, its machine language (x86) but the problem is i cannot find a simple example where it shows how can i embed sentences using a custom dataset without any labels or similarity values of the sentences. basically i have an array of sentences lists without any labels for sentences or similarity values for them, and i want to embed them into vectors in a way that it preserves the semantic of the sentence the best way possible, so far i have used word2vec and doc2vec using gensim library so i wanted to try this method to see if its any better?
