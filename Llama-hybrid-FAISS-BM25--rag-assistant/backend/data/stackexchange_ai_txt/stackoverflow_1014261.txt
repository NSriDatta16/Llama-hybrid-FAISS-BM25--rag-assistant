\mbox is the simplest answer. Regarding the update: TeX prefers overlong lines to adding too much space between words on a line; I think the idea is that you will notice the lines that extend into the margin (and the black boxes it inserts after such lines), and will have a chance to revise the contents, whereas if there was too much space, you might not notice it. Use \sloppy or \begin{sloppypar}...\end{sloppypar} to adjust this behavior, at least a little. Another possibility is \raggedright (or \begin{raggedright}...\end{raggedright} ).
