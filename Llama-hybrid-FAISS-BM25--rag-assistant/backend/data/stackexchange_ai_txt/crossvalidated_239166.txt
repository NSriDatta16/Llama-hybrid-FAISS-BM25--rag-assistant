Train accuracy < Test accuracy with regularization

With a friend we were playing with the notMNIST data, logistic regression and regularization. Without regularization, we could achieve a training accuracy (10k samples) of 78%, and test accuracy (15k samples) of 82%. With regularization, we achieve a training accuracy of 84% and a test accuracy of 88%. I cannot understand these results: training accuracy is not higher than testing accuracy, so I think there is no overfitting. So, regularization shouldn't help much, but in our case we get a significant improvement. Can you help me understand what is happening here? Thanks in advance
