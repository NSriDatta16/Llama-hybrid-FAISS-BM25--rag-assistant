Can empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis be used as a predictive model?

I am wondering if I can use the results of EOF to "predict" the EOF loadings of a second set of data? I have a data set $X$ that consists of sampled light spectra (each column represents a sample and each row is the amplitude of the spectra at a given wavelength). So I first construct a covariance matrix of my data: $C=XX^T$ This is then decomposed using an eigendecomposition: $C=E \lambda E^T$ with $E$ being the EOF loadings. I then project my data $X$ onto the loadings to get the principal components $Z$ : $Z = XE$ Now my question is if I can use the results of the EOF to project a second set of spectra data $Y$ into EOF loadings $E_{\mathrm{pred}}$ using the principal components $Z$ : $ZY^{-1} = E_{\mathrm{pred}}$ I haven't come across EOF being used in such a way (e.g. as a predictive model) but, given the amount of literature around EOF and PCA, I'm probably just missing something. Is there a problem with this approach? Does anyone know of examples using such EOF as a predictive model? Many thanks for any advice.
