Does P(E|H) > P(E) => P(H | E) > P(H) explain correlation between bayesian and frequentialist results?

I have just noted in the Ross book that given P(E|H) > P(E) If the occurrence of B makes A more likely, does the occurrence of A make B more likely? we can conclude that P(E|H) / P(E) > 1 and, because P(H | E) P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) it follows that P(H | E) /P(H) = P(E|H)/P(E) > 1 , which says that P(H | E) /P(H) > 1 or P(H | E) > P(H) . That is, if evidence has higher chances in the column that used by frequentist then hypothesis will also enjoy the higher probability in the bayesian table . It seems that there is a correlation between two types of inferences. Why is correlation not absolute, why are the differences, can you say that in the broad lines?
