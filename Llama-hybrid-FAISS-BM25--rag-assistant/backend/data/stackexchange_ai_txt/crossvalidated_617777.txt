Yes, for instance multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks (with two layers of modifiable weights), support vector machines, Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks, Kernel Logistic Regression, Gaussian Processes. There are a lot of "shallow" learning methods, and they are still very useful even if not very fashionable at the moment. Linear regression and standard logistic regression are also "shallow learning". Oddly enough, shallow learning methods can out-perform deep learning methods in some applications, but I suspect publication bias means that this isn't as widely appreciated as it should be.
