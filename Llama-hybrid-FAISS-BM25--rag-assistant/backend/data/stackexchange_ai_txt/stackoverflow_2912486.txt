When you append a script to the document, it is downloaded asynchronously. In IE, the following script... try{ jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery.getScript("/CalendarViewer/js/utils.js", function(){ jQuery.getScript("/CalendarViewer/js/groupcatselector.js", function(){ jQuery.getScript("/CalendarViewer/js/calendarportlet.js", function(){ jQuery.getScript("/CalendarViewer/js/calendarportletmain.js", function(){ var cpm = calendarportletmain; cpm.doEditDefaults("V_7f208bca412b42a68c19eb104bf46f14", "/CalendarViewer", groupCats_V_7f208bca412b42a68c19eb104bf46f14); }); }); }); }); }); }catch(err){ alert("error in view.jsp="+err.number+" "+err.description); } ...is parsed and executed before IE has finished downloading and parsing the jQuery script. This may not be the case in Firefox if Firefox has already cached the script, it would take no time to download and can be parsed immediately. It could the parsers working differently, Firefox parsing the script as soon as it is downloaded and IE queuing the parsing until the thread becomes idle. You could move this code to the end of the setUpJquery function, which means it would only be executed when the jQuery object is available. Alternatively, you could put the code inside its own function and call that function from the setUpJquery function.
