How to check assumptions for Bayesian Linear Mixed Models in R?

I'm trying to create a Bayesian mixed linear model for my master thesis but having trouble to check all assumptions (especially normality of errors)/ I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, because I'm an R/statistics noob. My model looks like this: mymodel What I found/tried (does this all make sense to you?): Regarding linearity visual plot(mydata$y, resid(mymodel)) mathematical MISSING (is there even a way?) Regarding homoscedasticity: visual plot(fitted(mymodel),resid(mymodel)) mathematical mydata$residuals Regarding normality of errors: visual plot(density(resid(mymodel))) MISSING: Q-Q-PLOT; something like qqmath() would do for non-Bayesian models mathematical MISSING (is there even a way?) Regarding independence of errors: mathematical durbinWatsonTest(residuals(mymodel)) Thank you for any help!
