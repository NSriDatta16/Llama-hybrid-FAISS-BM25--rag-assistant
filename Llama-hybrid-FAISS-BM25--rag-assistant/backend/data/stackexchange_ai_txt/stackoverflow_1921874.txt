Receiving a nillable element from a .NET webservice using Blackberry

I have a .NET webservice sitting on my local IIS. I'm calling 1 method from it, ClientSearch, using a Blackberry. The method is: [WebMethod] public List ClientSearch(string Surname, string Forename, string DOB, string Postcode) { List clients = new List (); // Populate list return clients; } When I call this from my Blackberry simulator I get the error: "not nillable element of array type in response is missed". I'm accessing the webservice using stubs generated by the Sun Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2. The wsdl file for the client type contains: This is where the nillable comes from but the values are hardcoded in the web method so it should always have a value. The code i'm using to call the webservice is the same as I use in every BB app to call them so I know that it works. Service1Soap_Stub stub = new Service1Soap_Stub(); result = stub.clientSearch("", "", "", ""); I'm using Eclipse 3.4.0 (Ganymede) and the Blackberry JDE Plug-in 1.0.0.67 and component pack 4.5.0. I've seen this on a few different forums but can't find how to solve this issue.
