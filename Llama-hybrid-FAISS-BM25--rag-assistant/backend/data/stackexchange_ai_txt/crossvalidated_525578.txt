How to calculate 95%CI of basic reproduction number from an available (linear) equation?

I am working on my thesis and Prof. asked me to add 95%CI on the basic reproduction number R0, but I don't know how to do in R. As I have an equation: R0 = Re/(1-p*VE) where: R0 is the basic reproduction number to be estimated; Re: Effective reproduction number (I have already estimated at 1.27 (95%CI: 1.22 - 1.33)); p: vaccination coverage (p = 0.946); VE: vaccine effectiveness (VE = 80.19% (95%CI: 70.41-89.98)) I have not much exposed with statistic, please help me with this.
