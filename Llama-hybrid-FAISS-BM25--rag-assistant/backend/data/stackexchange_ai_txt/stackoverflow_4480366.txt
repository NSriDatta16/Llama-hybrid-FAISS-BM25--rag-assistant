session_destroy() does not destroy all user's sessions. You would need to write to a persistent storage media (database, text file, etc.) and then call session_destroy() to kill it's own session. Then, have all pages check it when they load. If it has some special command in it (for example, normal is 0 , destroy command is 1 ), have them call session_destroy() .
