You are describing (1) split sample validation (2) cross-validation K=5. Both are forms of internal validation with their own strengths and weaknesses. In particular, split sample validation - (30%) test set - can be unstable with small sample sizes. EDIT (1) for the lm model above, there is no utility in doing both forms of internal validation. Just choose one, realizing that either form of internal validation has its own limitations. (2) For machine learning algorithms with hyper-parameters, both forms of validation might be used. So in your example cross-validation may be used to choose mtry value for the randomForest model and then split sample validation could be used to estimate model accuracy. The cross-validation and split-sample are being used with different objectives in mind.
