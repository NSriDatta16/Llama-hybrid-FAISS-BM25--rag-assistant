What you're trying to do has been published last year in this paper (10.1016/j.cma.2020.113533 "The statistical finite element method (statFEM) for coherent synthesis of observation data and model predictions", a preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06391 ) by Girolami et al. The statFEM approach works by applying Bayesian statistics to incorporate data: The stochastic FEM, modeled as a GP as you stated, serves as a Bayesian prior. Using the likelihood of the data, also modeled Gaussian, you are able to create a posterior GP which can be considered an updated FEM solution given your data. Unfortunately there is no code snippet or a single equation I can show you because the whole approach is rather lengthy. You can nevertheless have a look at my github where I have a working solver. https://github.com/herluc/Masterarbeit/blob/master/MA_LucasHermann/Python/statFEMSolver.py
