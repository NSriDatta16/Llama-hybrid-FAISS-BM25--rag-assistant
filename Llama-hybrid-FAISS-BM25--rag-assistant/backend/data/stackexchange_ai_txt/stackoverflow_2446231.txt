Merging datasets with 2 different time variables in SAS

Hye Guys, for those regularly browsing this site sorry for already another question (however I did solve my last question myself!) I have another problem with merging datasets, it seems that accounting for time in datasets is a real pain in the ass. I succesfully managed to merge on months in my previous datasets, however it seems I have a final dataset which only has quarter as a time count variable. So where all my normal databases have month 1- xxx as an indicator of time, this database had quarter as an indicator of time. I still want to add the variables of this last database, let's call it TVOL, into my WORK database. Quick summary QUARTER: Quarter 0 = JAN1996-MAR1996 Month: Month 0 = JAN1996 Example: TVOL TVOL _______ Ticker __________ Quarter 1500 _______ AA ________________ -1 52546 _______ BB ________________ 15 Example: WORK BETA _______ Ticker __________ Month 1.52 _______ AA ________________ 2 1.54_______ BB ________________ 3 Example: Merged: BETA _______________ TVOL _______ Ticker __________ Month 1.52 ________________ 500 _________ AA ________________ 2 I now want to merge this 2 tables using following relationship if the month is in quarter 1, the data of quarter 0 has to be used, so if i have an observation i nWORK with date 2FEB1996 the TVOL of quarter -1 has to be put behind this observation. Something like IF month = quarter i use data quarter i-1. Also, as TVOL is measured quarterly and I have to put in monthly I have to take the average, so (TVOL/3) should be added as a variable. Thanks!
