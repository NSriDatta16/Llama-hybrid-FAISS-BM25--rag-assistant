You are probably no longer looking for an answer. But here it is, anyway. I am unfamiliar with Matlab, but if you know R , then I think the R package mcmcse has coded the effective sample size similarly. They are also in their vignette using the VAR example as motivation, so you will find a lot of similarities. It looks like most of their code is also in C++, so if you know that as well, you might be able to translate the logic. Basically, they are using batch means estimators to estimate the infinite sum variance. This is a strongly consistent estimator, and is much better than using the naive estimator. You can find more information here , including some of the math for the VAR model.
