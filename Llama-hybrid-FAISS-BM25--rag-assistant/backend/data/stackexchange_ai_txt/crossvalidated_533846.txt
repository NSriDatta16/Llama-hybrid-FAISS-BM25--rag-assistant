Yep. The estimator of $\hat{\beta}$ in OLS is a linear estimator. So we can get the SLLN by expressing it as a sample average. $$\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \bar{X})Y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \bar{X})^2}$$ with some clever algebra it's not too hard to express the above display as a sample average in the usual form of $\sum{T_i}/n$ .
