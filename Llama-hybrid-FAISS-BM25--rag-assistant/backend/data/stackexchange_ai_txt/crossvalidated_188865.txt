That's a great question. The real difference between ARIMA models and multiple linear regression lies in your error structure. You can manipulate the independent variables in a multiple linear regression model so that they fit your time series data, which is what @IrishStat is saying. However, after that, you need to incorporate ARIMA errors into your multiple regression model to get correct coefficient and test results. A great free book on this is: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/9/1 . I've linked the section that discusses combining ARIMA and multiple regression models.
