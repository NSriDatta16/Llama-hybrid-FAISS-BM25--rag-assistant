That's not (quite) how I think of it. It's about finding the common causes (common factors) of the measures. But it's close. If you only have one factor, then you could do that. You might want to run a factor analysis to determine if there is one factor. You can, if you really can only use one variable, then use the one with the highest loading. In intelligence research, people talk about the g-loading of a test, which is its loading on the general (g) factor. If you want to measure general intelligence, use a test with a high g-loading. If you are doing PCA, and you are not rotating, then yes. PCA and EFA are often confused - and software tends to stick them together, but they are different techniques with different goals (but they can give similar results). PCA is done through eigenvalue decomposition. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis For EFA, it depends on the extraction method that you are using.
