This depends on how you normalized your data: calculated z-scores for the whole set of data OR used group-by-group standardization. If you transformed your data into z-scores using the mean and the standard deviation of the whole set, then the result should not be different. If, however, you standardized your data for each of the groups separately (i.e. using group averages and standard deviations), then the Levene's W statistic is diminished. The first case is very simple to check, using R 's in-built set of data Moore . Merely try out the following two commands, where the first one performs the Levene's test (from car package) on the untransformed data and the second one on the z-scores. leveneTest(Moore$conformity,Moore$fcategory) leveneTest(scale(Moore$conformity)[,1],Moore$fcategory) The result is the same in both cases, namely: Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median) Df F value Pr(>F) group 2 0.046 0.9551 42 The option center is irrelevant for the purpose of this illustration. Showing why, analytically, is not straightforward. Some intuition can be gained, however, by studying the equation for Levene's W (taken from the Wikipedia's article with the test's name): $$W = \frac{(N-k)}{(k-1)} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k N_i (Z_{i\cdot}-Z_{\cdot\cdot})^2} {\sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{N_i} (Z_{ij}-Z_{i\cdot})^2}$$ with $Z_{ij}=|Y_{ij} - \bar{Y}_{i\cdot}|$ and $\bar{Y}_{i\cdot}$ the mean of i-th group, $Z_{\cdot\cdot} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{N_i}Z_{ij}$ the mean of all $Z_{ij}$, and $Z_{i\cdot} = \frac{1}{N_i} \sum_{j=1}^{N_i} Z_{ij}$ again the group mean. While the denominator of the second fraction does not differ no matter how you standardize the data (which is not immediately apparent at all), the numerator is smaller when you standardize each group separately. This is because $Z_{i\cdot}$ and $Z_{\cdot\cdot}$ are closer together in this case. An analytic derivation would be much more convincing here, but for illustration purposes your own example and the one I mentioned above will have to suffice. Edit To see an example, where the variances are non-homogeneous for raw data and how this changes with z-scores, you can use the mtcars dataset: leveneTest(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$am,center=mean) Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = mean) Df F value Pr(>F) group 1 5.921 0.02113 * 30 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 versus attach(mtcars) df F) group 1 0.0818 0.7769 30
