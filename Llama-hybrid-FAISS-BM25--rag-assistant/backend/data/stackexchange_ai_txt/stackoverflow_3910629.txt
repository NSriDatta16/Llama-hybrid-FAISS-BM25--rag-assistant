Why does UIScrollView cancel my touches on the iPad, but not on the iPhone?

I have an UIScrollView subclass where I implement all of those 4 touch event handling methods like -touchesBegan:withEvent: , etc. On the iPhone, the tracking works fine. I get plenty of -touchesMoved:withEvent: calls while the finger moves along the scroll view. I've set the self.canCancelContentTouches = NO; . I've also overwritten this: - (BOOL)touchesShouldCancelInContentView:(UIView *)view { return NO; } After dragging about 5 points or so, it already cancels the touches. Always. I have nothing else than this UIScrollView in my view hierarchy. I can start dragging anywhere I want. After about 5 points touches get cancelled. Always. Anywhere. And the strange thing: Only happens on the iPad, but not on the iPhone or iPod touch. A bug in UIScrollView?
