Are two duration sequences related?

I've segmented a video using two methods: One by listening to it (audio content) and one by watching it (visual content). Therefore, I have two sequences of segments. From the audio analysis I have sections and subsections like this: From 7:02 to 7:54 the professor talked about "different types of attention systems", which breaks as follows: From 7:02 to 7:17 she said she's going to explain what ADHD means. ... From 7:54 to 9:15 the professor gave examples for "automatic attention". From the video analysis I have, for example: From 7:04 to 7:18 the professor was shown. From 07:18 to 07:26 a slide was shown, from 07:26 to 07:36 the professor was shown, and so on. So, I have two sequences of time segments (where the audio one, by content analysis, can be broken to smaller time segments). What I want to know is whether these sequences are related. Is there a synchronization, perhaps the view of the professor (left profile/ full body/ from afar) or slide are synchronized with the rhythm of the content, or is this random?
