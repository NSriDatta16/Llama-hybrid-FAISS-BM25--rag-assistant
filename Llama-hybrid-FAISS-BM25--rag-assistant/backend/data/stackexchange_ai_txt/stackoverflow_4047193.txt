That will work just fine. You can export an entire calendar with File > Exportâ€¦ , or individual events by dragging them to the Finder. iCalendar ( .ics ) files are human-readable, so you can always pop it open in a text editor to make sure no private events made it in there.

You'll mostly find VEVENT sections (each of which represents an event) and VTIMEZONE sections, each of which represents a time zone that's referenced from one or more events.
