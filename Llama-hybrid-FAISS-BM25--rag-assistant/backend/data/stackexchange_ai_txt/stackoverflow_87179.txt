What are some good Module Development Solution/Environments/Best Practices for Dot Net Nuke Modules

I've been developing modules for DNN since version 2 and back then I was able to easily able to run my module as I developed it on my environment and still easily deploy my module as a DLL. When version 4 came out and used the web site solution (rather than the Web Application solution). It seems like there was something lost. I can continue to develop in my test environment and immediately see changes as I make them, but releasing for me has become a headache. I mostly do my development for one site in particular have just been using FTP deployment of the modules to the main site after I was done making changes. I'd like to set up a good environment for multiple developers to be able to work on the module(s). When adding stuff to source control, are people generally putting all of DNN into source control so they can bring the whole solution down to work on, or just their module and each person needs to set up their own dev DNN environment? I'd like to start getting my modules projects organized so more people could work on them and I feel a bit lost for some best practices both in doing this and deploying those changes to a live site.
