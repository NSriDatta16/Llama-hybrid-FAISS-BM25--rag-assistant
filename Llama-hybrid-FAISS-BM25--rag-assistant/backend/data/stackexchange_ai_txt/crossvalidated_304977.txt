Can I use a tiny Validation set?

I understand the reasoning behind splitting the data into a Test set and a Validation set. I also understand that the size of the split will depend on the situation but will generally vary from 50/50 to 90/10. I built a RNN to correct spelling and start with a data set of ~5m sentences. I shave off 500k sentences and then train with the remaining ~4.5m sentences. When the training is done I take my validation set and compute the accuracy. The interesting thing is that after only 4% of my validation set I have an accuracy of 69.4% and this percentage doesn't change by more than 0.1% in either direction. Eventually I just cut the validation short because the number is stuck at 69.5%. So why slice off 10% for Validation when I could probably get away with 1%? Does it matter?
