As @Aksakal writes, try a traditional time series forecasting algorithm first. Cash withdrawals will definitely have a weekly seasonality, so try seasonal exponential smoothing. You may have monthly seasonality, in which case you could use bats or tbats to model the multiple-seasonalities . If you have external drivers, like festivals, you can first regress withdrawals on these drivers, then model residuals with smoothing, BATS or TBATS. This would be similar to regression with ARIMA errors. Your "constraint" is unclear to me. However, it sounds like you are conflating the forecast with the subsequent decision , i.e., with how much cash to supply the machine. Separate the two. First calculate your forecast, then make the decision based on the forecast.
