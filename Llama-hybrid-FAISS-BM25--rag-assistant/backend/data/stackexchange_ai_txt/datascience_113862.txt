Same: Both charRNN and wordRNN are auto-regressive models Diff: CharRNN uses a smaller vocab table than WordRNN, with little OOV (out of vocabulary) occurrence. Whereas wordRNN needs to handle OOV explicitly to avoid zero probability. This also means wordRNN needs to handle vocab table carefully to avoid data leakage. (using words from test data only is essentially cheating.) CharRNN needs more autoregressive steps than wordRNN.
