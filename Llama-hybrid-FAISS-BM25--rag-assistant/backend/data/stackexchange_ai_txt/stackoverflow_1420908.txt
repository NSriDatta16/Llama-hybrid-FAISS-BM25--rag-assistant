What is the reason for the creation of LLVM?

What are the differences between an LLVM and a regular compiler? Is it more dynamic and thus can be used to compile normally very dynamic languages (i.e. Javascript) into static binary code? What are the principles behind creating one? I know the Dragon Book for compilers, but is there such a thing for a LLVM? EDIT: I have found this interesting project.
