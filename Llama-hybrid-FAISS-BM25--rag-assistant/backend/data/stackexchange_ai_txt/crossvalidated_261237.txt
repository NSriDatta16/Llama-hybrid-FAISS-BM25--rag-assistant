Neither . Let's try to understand how machine learning works in practice . Machine learning is not something you run in isolation, you don't just take your raw data and feed everything into it. Instead, you would develop a pipeline where you process or transform your data. Machine learning or predictive modelling is simply part of the pipeline, usually after the filtering process. Not everything in the raw data would go into your model. Your outcome depends on how exactly the pipeline is implemented. What does that mean for your example? The pipeline would simply use the "cheating" variable (if present) to make a prediction. No machine learning here, just some if statements in your code. Very standard programming. If the cheating variable is not present. Feed the data to your trained data. Thus, you should train a model without the cheating variable. This is not something statistics can tell you, but it's how the industry works. Maintaining a model with a cheating variable like your example costs money and complicates the modelling.
