Calculating significance with data set

I have a data set of words for which I've calculated the average frequency of every letter (e.g., the letter "a" accounts for 9.8% of letters). I also have letter frequency data from Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency ) that shows the instance of letters for "all" English words. What I want to do is compare my percentages and the expected percentages to determine if the variation between the values is significant. Is there a way to do this without having the word counts in the Wikipedia data? What other data would I need? What test would be appropriate? Thanks!
