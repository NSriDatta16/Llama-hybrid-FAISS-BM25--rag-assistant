I would strongly advocate always using braces, even when they're optional. Why? Take this chunk of C++ code: if (var == 1) doSomething(); doSomethingElse(); Now, someone comes along who isn't really paying enough attention and decides that something extra needs to happen if (var == 1), so they do this: if (var == 1) doSomething(); doSomethingExtra(); doSomethingElse(); It's all still beautifully indented but it won't do what was intended. By always using braces, you're more likely to avoid this sort of bug.
