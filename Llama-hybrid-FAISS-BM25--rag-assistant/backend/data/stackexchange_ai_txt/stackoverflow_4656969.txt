Find a substring in a String returns -1 although substring is available

I have again a strage C++ thing on the following: l is an incomming line (string.c_str()) > becomes line pos is the position from where to start searching s is a string (string.c_str()) to look for > becomes command It all works fine until command is "-1". In this case the string "-1" is not found although line is containing it. Am I missing something ovious? Code: bool Converter::commandAvailable(const char* l, int pos, const char* s) { string line = l; string command = s; int x = line.find(command, pos); if (x != -1) { return true; } return false; } Thanks in advance!
