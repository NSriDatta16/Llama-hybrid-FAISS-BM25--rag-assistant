Required field validator for multiple dropdown lists in an aspx page

I have an aspx page which has 18 (yes 18) dropdown lists and 18 text boxes. Each dropdown needs to be selected and each textbox needs to be filled. Dragging and dropping required field validators on these 36 controls and maintaining them is a painful task and does not seem to be the logical option as all I need is for the user to select a value from the dropdown. Is there anyway I can loop through all these dropdown controls and textbox controls, check if they are empty and display warnings to users accordingly? Client-side validation solution or server side validation solution is fine with me.
