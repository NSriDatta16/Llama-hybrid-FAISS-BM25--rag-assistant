Is it possible for a ML model to perform worse than random classification?

I implemented different machine learning algorithms on a matrix with binary data to predict a univariate target with two classes. random forest (accuracy = 62.01) Neural Network(acc= 58.9) svm-radial kernel (accuracy = 58.02) linear discriminant analysis(accuracy = 57.9) logistic regression(accuracy = 57.6). My baseline accuracy is 52.55. But in case of Naive Bayes in same setting gives only 48.5 accuracy that identifies only one class in y. predict. Is it possible for a machine learning model to behave worse than a random classification?
