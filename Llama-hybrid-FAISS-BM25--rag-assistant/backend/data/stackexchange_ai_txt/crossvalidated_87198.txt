Low variance components in PCA, are they really just noise? Is there any way to test for it?

I'm trying to decide if a component of a PCA shall be retained, or not. There are a gazillion of criteria based on the magnitude of the eigenvalue, described and compared e.g. here or here . However, in my application I know that the small(est) eigenvalue will be small compared to the large(st) eigenvalue and the criteria based on magnitude would all reject the small(est) one. This is not what I want. What I am interested in: is there any method known that takes the actual corresponding component of the small eigenvalue into account, in the sense: is it really "just" noise as implied in all the textbooks, or is there "something" of potential interest left? If it is really noise, remove it, otherwise keep it, regardless of the magnitude of the eigenvalue. Is there some kind of established randomness or distribution test for components in PCA that I am unable to find? Or does anyone know of a reason that this would be a silly idea? Update Histograms (green) and normal approximations (blue) of components in two use cases: once probably really noise, once probably not "just" noise (yes, the values are small, but probably not random). The largest singular value is ~160 in both cases, the smallest, i.e. this singular value, is 0.0xx - way too small for any of the cut-off methods. What I'm looking for is a way to formalize this ...
