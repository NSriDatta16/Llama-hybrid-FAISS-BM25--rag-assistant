How to study the causal impact on multiple time series of interest against multiple baselines

My data consist of time series of Wikipedia hits for football players. I want to use the CausalImpact package to explore the effect of the World Cup on their popularity which I base on their Wikipedia page hits. This is effectively seeing if the tournament works as a marketing campaign for their popularity on Wikipedia. I use the Wikipedia hits from players who featured in the previous tournament as a baseline and exclude the players who featured in both as that would confound things. date Messi Ronaldo # 2018 players 01/01/18 756 871 02/01/18 660 743 03/01/18 523 453 04/01/18 412 654 05/01/18 488 568 06/01/18 515 345 date Lahm Xavi # 2014 players 01/01/18 253 171 02/01/18 164 443 03/01/18 323 351 04/01/18 312 654 05/01/18 183 263 06/01/18 325 145 In R, I loop over each one of the time series for the players in this World Cup and compare them against a predictor series which is all of the players at the previous tournament. But this seems a bit unwieldy because the time series are so variable. Some players barely get any hits, others have marked seasonality and others are constant. What is the appropriate way to select the predictor time series in a case like this? I've seen this answer but it refers to datasets being contemporaneous. List = NULL for (i in 1:length(levels(wikiHitsWC2018$article))){ data Hope you can help!
