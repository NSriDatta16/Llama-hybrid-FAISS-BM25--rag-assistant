Overlapping time series: is there any better way to visualize them?

I have this time series dataset: The graph shows trend lines for 7 stock prices. They are very close and overlapping, but you will be able to get an idea that trend lines are layered (i.e. brown on the top and red/orange at the bottom, though far from conspicuous). Is there any way to better visualize this data? like transforming $y$-axis to another scaling, mapping the whole thing onto cylinder/cone etc.? I tried with moving average, but the improvement is not so good. NOTE: This is not an ML/DM problem. I am looking for a better/alternative/suitable visualization technique, that's all.
