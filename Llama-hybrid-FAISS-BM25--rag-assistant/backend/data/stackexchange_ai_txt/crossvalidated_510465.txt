Briefly Principal components have what is called "loadings" and "scores". Loadings specify the weight that each variable contributes to the principal component. Scores show the value each sample has on each principal component. So in the case of prcomp() function rotation are the loadings and x are the scores. Example Let's take example of using prcomp() on USArrests dataset. pca Notice that pca$rotation has as many values per component as there are variables in the USArrests data. And pca$x has as many values per component as there are cases (states). pr$x is simply derived by applying the principal component loadings (rotation) to the original data, and we can double check this: dat Now scr has our principal component scores. They are the same as the ones returned by the function: all.equal(pca$x, scr)
