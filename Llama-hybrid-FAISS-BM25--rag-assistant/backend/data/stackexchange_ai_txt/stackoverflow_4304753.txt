Well it sounds like you are exposing your own LDAP server - but perhaps on a differnt host? OR You mean they don't provide a version of PHP compiled with LDAP support to act as a client. A few thoughts: 1) "Security Issues" is an easy excuse for anything. That is not to say the LDAP libraires don't require certain security measures, but to avoid a technology altogether is not the most elegant solution. So I would scrutinize your selection of provider. 2) However, you can, assuming some elevated access (root, sudo) just compile your own version of PHP with LDAP http://www.php.net/manual/en/ldap.installation.php
