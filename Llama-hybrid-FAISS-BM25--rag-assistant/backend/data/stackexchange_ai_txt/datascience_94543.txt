How Sklearn-crfsuit interpret text features

As we see here , to build an NER model we can pass text features (parts of the word, pos tag, structure of the word etc.) to Sklearn-CRF. I was wondering how does this package convert the text features to numerical features? What strategy do they use - any specific type of embedding?
