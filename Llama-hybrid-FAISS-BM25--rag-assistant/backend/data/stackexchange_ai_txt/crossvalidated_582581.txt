It is possible to fix a coefficient at any value, though that would be dubious without a strong justification (such as a known physical constant). Omitting the variable would be the same as fixing its coefficient at 0. A more reasonable approach is to use an informative Bayesian prior. This will affect the final coefficient value but will also take into account patterns in the data. Note that this is only true if one defines the prior so that it captures the distribution of possible values well. It is possible to define a prior that constrains the coefficient so narrowly that the data doesn't really affect the final coefficient estimate, and this would be just as dubious as fixing the coefficient. So you'll need to think carefully to define a reasonable prior.
