Consider using a surrogate key (an int primary key) as the primary key/clustered index key. The trouble with using a nvarchar(50) as a primary key/clustered index key is that your table will be ordered by that key which means it is likely to get highly fragmented, and that any other indexes will have the burden of referencing this heavy primary key. Another issue is that presumably you are needing to JOIN on other tables by this type of value which is a more expensive operation as the size of the key grows. I think there are very few situations where an nvarchar(50) primary key would make sense. Generally, primary keys should be a surrogate UNLESS you have a small natural immutable key. Arguably, SSN, for example, could be considered a natural immutable key.
