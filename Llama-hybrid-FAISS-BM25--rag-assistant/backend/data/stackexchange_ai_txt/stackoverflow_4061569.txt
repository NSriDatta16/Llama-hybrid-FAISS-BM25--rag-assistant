If you use a long key, I'd say the key was pretty safe. Some things to concern yourself with: You are offloading data storage to the client. NEVER TRUST THE CLIENT. This doesn't mean you can't do this, just that you either have to treat the data in the cookie as untrusted (don't make any decisions more serious than what 'theme' to show the user based on it) or provide for a way to validate the data. Some examples of how to validate the data would be to: include a salt (so that people with the same session data don't get the same cookie) and a checksum (so that someone who changes even one bit of the cookie makes it useless).
