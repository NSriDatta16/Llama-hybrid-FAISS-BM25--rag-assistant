If you want to learn about what relational means, I recommend the book " SQL and Relational Theory " by C. J. Date. Relational in this context doesn't refer to relationships. It refers to relations which are basically what tables are called in the mathematical theories that led to the relational model . The reason that relational databases have become ubiquitous is that they are the most general-purpose solution for organizing data with minimum redundancy. There are valid reasons to use non-relational solutions. They often solve specific tasks of data-management extremely well, but are weak in other areas. Whereas SQL and relational databases strike a compromise, solving a larger set of problems adequately, with fewer areas of weakness. Other technologies currently available that are not based on the relational model are listed in " The Next-Gen Databases ."
