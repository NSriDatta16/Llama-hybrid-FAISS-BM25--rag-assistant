To compute or display the HDI, the scripts call the function HDIofMCMC() which is defined in DBDA2E-utilities.R. An argument of HDIofMCMC is credMass (i.e., the mass of the credibility interval), which defaults to 0.95. You can change it to 0.90 by specifying credMass=0.90. The plotPost() function calls the HDIofMCMC() function, and is designed with the same argument. For example, inside Jags-Ymet-Xmet..., find the relevant calls to plotPost() and include another argument in plotPost, namely, credMass=0.90.
