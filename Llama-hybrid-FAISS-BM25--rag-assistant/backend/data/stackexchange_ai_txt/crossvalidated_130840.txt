It can also model your population so that when you input a new vector, you can check how different is the output from the input. If they're "quite" the same, you can assume the input matches the population. If they're "quite" different, then the input probably doesn't belong to the population you modeled. I see it as a kind of "regression by neural networks" where you try to have a function describing your data: its output is the same as the input.
