Most Bayesian time series models are based on dynamic models. For simplicity, let's consider the random walk with noise model. $$ y_t = x_{t\phantom{-1}} + v_t \qquad v_t \sim N(0,V) \\ x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t \qquad w_t \sim N(0,W) $$ and $x_0\sim N(m_0,C_0)$. Since we have "known parameters", we know the values for $V$ and $W$. The one-step ahead predictive distribution is $$ p(y_t|y_{t-1}) = \int \int p(y_t|x_t)p(x_t|x_{t-1})p(x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1}) dx_t dx_{t-1} $$ Let $x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1} \sim N(m_{t-1}, C_{t-1})$ where $y_{1:t-1}$ is all the data up to time $t-1$. Then the one-step ahead predictive distribution is $y_t|y_{t-1} \sim N(m_{t-1}, C_{t-1}+W+V)$. Other dynamic linear models (with known parameters) will also have a normal one-step ahead predictive distribution. Non-linear models or linear models with non-normal errors will generally not have a closed form predictive distribution. If parameters are unknown, you will also have to integrate over your current uncertainty in those parameters, i.e. $p(\theta|y_{1:t-1})$ and this will also typically not have a closed form predictive distribution.
