How to include nested data in a mixed-effects model using R?

I am analyzing data from bird foraging surveys using the lme4 package in R and I am interested in the effects of field size (area), among other variables, on swallow rate of use. The surveys took place over 2 years, and Iâ€™d like to include year as a fixed effect in the model. Each field (n = 31) was surveyed 6 times. So the data look like: Field Survey Year Area RateOfUse 1 1 2017 3.06 0 1 2 2017 3.06 0.327 1 3 2017 3.06 0.327 1 4 2017 3.06 0.327 1 5 2017 3.06 3.92 1 6 2017 3.06 0.327 1 1 2018 3.06 0 1 2 2018 3.06 0.392 1 3 2018 3.06 2.55 1 4 2018 3.06 2.94 1 5 2018 3.06 0.588 1 6 2018 3.06 0 2 ... In order to include field as a random effect (accounting for the fact that each field has data from 6 surveys), does this make sense: lme(RateOfUse ~ Area + Year, random = ~1|Field/Survey) Alternatively, I could included Survey as a fixed effect to account for the fact that rate of use might have dropped off during later surveys: lme(RateOfUse ~ Area + Year + Survey, random=~1|Field) I also have a separate variable Field_Survey which is Field_Survey Year 1_1 2017 1_2 2017 1_3 2017 1_4 2017 1_5 2017 1_6 2017 1_1 2018 1_2 2018 1_3 2018 1_4 2018 1_5 2018 1_6 2018 ... So instead I could do something like: lme(RateOfUse ~ Area + Year, random = ~1|Field_Survey) Which of these models makes more sense? Is 31 groupings (fields) way too many? I am a bit rusty with mixed effects models and want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly.
