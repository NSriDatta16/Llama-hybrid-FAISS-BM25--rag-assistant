Unlike standard maven projects, the convention for eclipse plugins/OSGi bundles is to have tests reside in separate projects. This is because there is no such thing as a maven dependency scope "test" in OSGi. Thus keeping your tests inside the same project as your code under test would force you to mix up test code/dependencies an productive code/dependencies. As you mentioned, Tycho provides a separate maven packaging type "eclipse-test-plugin" which you should use for dedicated test plugins/fragments. See https://docs.sonatype.org/display/TYCHO/PackagingTypes There is no support in Tycho for plain unit tests residing in the same project.
