***UPDATE*** Wasn't even paying attention that this was a flash question. Below is a link to a video tutorial on getting started with the maps API in flash + adding custom overlay objects. The video also has the project files downloadable in the top right of the screen. http://gotoandlearn.com/play.php?id=104 ***Original Answer*** I did a quick google search and found this: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/overlays.html#Custom_Overlays I've never really messed with the google maps API's before, just a little bit in flash. Anyway from having a quick read over this looks like what you'd be after. You can define custom overlay objects and you can also tie them to long/lat so you're not restricted to any location. Basic tutorial of adding a builtin overlay with jQuery: http://marcgrabanski.com/articles/jquery-google-maps-tutorial-basics And a random link I found that has a boatload of maps api's tutorials: http://econym.org.uk/gmap/
