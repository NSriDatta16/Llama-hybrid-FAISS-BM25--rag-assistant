Organize your objects… var myObjects = { people: someObject, notPeople: someOtherObject }; var parameters = 'people'; myObjects[parameters].initialize(); If you are playing with globals ( don't play with globals) then you can get away with: window[parameters].initialize(); … but organizing them in logical objects is a better bet.
