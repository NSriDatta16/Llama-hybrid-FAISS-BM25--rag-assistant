Shane is correct. Both multicore and Rmpi are winners. Slightly broader coverage of the topic is in the CRAN Task View on High-Performance Computing . This also links to a fairly recent survey article on Parallel Computing with R from JSS. Lastly, a few hands-on examples and tips are in the Intro to HPC with R tutorial I give once in a while -- see my presentations page for the most recent copy from last week at useR.
