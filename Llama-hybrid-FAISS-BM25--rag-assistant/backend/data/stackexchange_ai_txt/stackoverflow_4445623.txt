Can I get siblings with PHP's DOMDocument?

I have gotten some h3 references in PHP's DOMDocument. $dom = new DOMDocument(); $dom->loadHtml($content); $h3s = $dom->getElementsByTagName('h3'); foreach($h3s as $h3) { var_dump($h3->nodeValue); } I need to get the next elements after the h3 s. In this case, it will be all elements up to the next h3 or end of document. It worked easily with a regular expression, but I don't want to use one here to parse HTML. For reference, that regular expression is... preg_match_all('/ ([^ (.*?)( (Which is fragile, hence the desire for proper parsing). So how would I get using DOMDOcument the data I expect in $matches from the regular expression above? I checked the documentation , but couldn't find a equivalent of JavaScript's nextSibling property.
