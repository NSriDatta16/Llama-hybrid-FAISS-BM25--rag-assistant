Codeigniter has a class called User Agent . However you may have to create your own class for mobile browsers. The User Agent Class provides functions that help identify information about the browser, mobile device, or robot visiting your site. In addition you can get referrer information as well as language and supported character-set information. Example: When the User Agent class is initialized it will attempt to determine whether the user agent browsing your site is a web browser, a mobile device, or a robot. It will also gather the platform information if it is available. $this->load->library('user_agent'); if ($this->agent->is_browser()) { $agent = $this->agent->browser().' '.$this->agent->version(); } elseif ($this->agent->is_robot()) { $agent = $this->agent->robot(); } elseif ($this->agent->is_mobile()) { $agent = $this->agent->mobile(); } else { $agent = 'Unidentified User Agent'; } echo $agent; echo $this->agent->platform(); // Platform info (Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.)
