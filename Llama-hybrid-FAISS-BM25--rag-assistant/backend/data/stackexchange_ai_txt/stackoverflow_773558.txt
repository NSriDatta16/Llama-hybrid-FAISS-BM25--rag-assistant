The device is bombarded by touchesEnded calls

I have a simple OpenGL:ES application running (it is a game). The game loads and presents the user with a "new game button" and then you are in the game. I'm using touchesBegan / touchesEnded to handle the touches. Then I take the coordinates and process them accordingly. I also have an NSTimer running at 30Hz that calls renderScene which draws the on screen graphics. Every once in a while on the device (I have yet to have this happen on the simulator) I don't get anymore touch events after the first one. I have attempted to debug this on the device and it appears that after I get the first touchesEnded event come in, the device is bombarded by touchesEnded calls. I NEVER get another touchesBegan call when this happens. If I press home and come back into the game, everything will usually work fine. Here is the code for my input, as it exists in my EAGLView.m code #pragma mark #pragma mark UserInputStuff #pragma mark #pragma mark #pragma mark touchesBegan #pragma mark - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; firstTouch = [touch locationInView:self]; lastTouch = [touch locationInView:self]; [(MyGameAppDelegate*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] HandleTouchEvent:firstTouch]; } #pragma mark #pragma mark touchesEnded #pragma mark - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; lastTouch = [touch locationInView:self]; [(MyGameAppDelegate*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] HandleTouchEnded:lastTouch]; } And here is the code as it exist in my app delegate #pragma mark #pragma mark HandleTouchEnded #pragma mark A function to react to the touch that is no longer present on the screen #pragma mark - (void)HandleTouchEnded:(CGPoint)coordinate { if(_state == kState_Title) { [self TitleCollisionDetection:coordinate]; if(_buttonHighlighted) { _textures[kTexture_Background] = [[Texture2D alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"T4Background.png"]]; glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, [_textures[kTexture_Background] name]); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_NEAREST); [self resetGame]; } } } And here is the code that configures the timer that fires to handle the renderer. //Start rendering timer _timer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:(1.0 / kRenderingFPS) target:self selector:@selector(renderScene) userInfo:nil repeats:YES]; [UIApplication sharedApplication].idleTimerDisabled = YES; I'm obviously doing something dumb. What am I missing? Why is touchesEnded firing so often?
