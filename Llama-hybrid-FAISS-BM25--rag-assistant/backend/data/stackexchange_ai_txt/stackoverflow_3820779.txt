Like said before, there is no easy solution. A more enhanced version of a regex could be: /^(.*?(? . It does not stop at mid sentence acronyms (but also not, if they are at the end of a sentence...), the next sentence has to start with an upper case letter oder digit.... If you know a list of acronyms that you dont want your regex to stop at, you migth add them like: /^(.*?(? . If you know what language you are going to use, there might be some Natural Language Parsing (NLP) toolkit - but this would go beyond the scope of this question.
