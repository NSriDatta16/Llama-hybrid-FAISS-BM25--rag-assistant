Pragmatic Programmers ( http://pragprog.com/ ) publish a variety of good to excellent programming books, all of which are available in ePub format from their website. You can purchase text, digital, or a mix (where digital is available in both epub and pdf format). That said, I'm afraid little of their content is towards python, php, or jquery. It's mostly ruby, ruby on rails, iphone/mac, and general programming issues and techniques. Still, the content is excellent. I would also repeat @Hagge's comment that OReilly has quite a bit available in ePub format, and they do cover the python, php, and (to a small extent) jquery topics. Dig around in the site at http://oreilly.com/ebooks/ for more details.
