As others have alluded to, you need to test the return values of Unix system functions...all of them!...in order to interpret errno values in a bulletproof fashion. I refer you to item 6 of the canonical guidelines, Henry Spencer's The Ten Commandments for C programmers : If a function be advertised to return an error code in the event of difficulties, thou shalt check for that code, yea, even though the checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy typing fingers, for if thou thinkest "it cannot happen to me", the gods shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance.
