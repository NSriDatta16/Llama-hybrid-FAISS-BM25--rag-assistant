I think you are getting the problem wrong and this has nothing to do with ABC. If your posterior distribution is such that the parameter $\theta$ is not entirely identifiable from one dataset, $x_1$, but is identifiable from a $N$ sample, $x_1,\ldots,x_N$, what you need to consider is the "single" posterior conditional on all of those datasets: $$ \pi(\theta|x_1,\ldots,x_N) $$ not a product of posteriors (which is not defined from a Bayesian viewpoint anyway). This major point being straightened, the ABC implementation of your problem means that you need to run the loop 1. Generate theta from the prior 2. Generate N dataset x[1:N] from the sampling distribution with parameter theta 3. Accept theta if x[1:N] is close enough to the observed N dataset because your data is then the $N$ dataset. You mention a million summary statistics: do you mean a summary statistic of dimension one million or one million replications of the summary statistic?
