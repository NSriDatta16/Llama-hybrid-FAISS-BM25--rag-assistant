How to adjust for non-linear inverted-U relationship confounding variable?

In a multivariable regression model, if a potentially confounding variable has an inverted-U shape relationship with the outcome variable, what would be the best way to control for the confounding variable? For my specific case, AGE is the confounding variable that has a highly non-linear relationship to the outcome, a disease. The relationship between AGE and disease incident rate is an inverted U-shape. Disease incidence rate starts low at young ages, rises to a sharp peak at a certain age, and then drops sharply for older ages, as seen in this image: AGE is linearly correlated to the exposure of interest (a long internal half-life chemical) so will be a potential confounder. Wouldnâ€™t entering untransformed AGE into a logistic regression model or a linear regression model be inadequate for controlling its confounding effects? Would entering a transformation of AGE be appropriate? The only curves that fit well are splines or similar smoothing methods. Can AGE be transformed with splines, entered in a regression model, and then appropriately control for confounding? Are there other ways to control for a confounder that has an inverted U-shape relationship with the outcome? Thanks
