For some distributions there is a positive bias due to measurement errors. If you assume the noise has mean $0$, then if you sample people from the top decile, their average measured income will be the average income of the top decile. However, the top decile of your sample will include some people who have displaced people from the top decile. The difference between the measured incomes of the incorrectly included people and the displaced people is always nonnegative, and the average value of this indicates the bias from this source of error. For some distributions, there is a negative bias due to sampling. I think this is a rare situation which you may be able to ignore based on some assumptions about the income distribution and noise distribution. Here is an artificial distribution which exhibits such a negative bias: Suppose $11\%$ of the population has a job and an income of $1$ unit, while everyone else is unemployed with an income of $0$, and there is no noise. The average income of the top $10\%$ is $1$, but there is a chance that the employment rate in your sample is under $10\%$, so the expected income of the top decile of a sample is less than $1$, so the bias is negative. If you want to get a ballpark estimate for the size of the bias, you can do a Monte Carlo simulation based on a distribution you fit to your sample and model for noise. There might be more accurate techniques, but this should be fast.
