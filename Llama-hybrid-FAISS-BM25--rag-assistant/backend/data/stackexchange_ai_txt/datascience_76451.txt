Can 1D-CNN method apply to real-time time series classification?

So I got an EEG dataset with shape (data points, 19), each row's shape (1,19) represent 1 second of EEG. I read much research on EEG classification that used many Deep Learning method and 1D-CNN is one of that. My question is as the input of the 1D-CNN must have multi-row data, ex (50,19) for my dataset so it can filter a input matrix. But I want to predict new data row by row ((1x19) shape), can 1D-CNN use this input for predict new data?
