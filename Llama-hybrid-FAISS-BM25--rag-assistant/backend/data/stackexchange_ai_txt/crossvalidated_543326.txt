nn.Embedding is a generic way to allow for learning an embedding for arbitrary discrete data. This can be useful for encoding other types of categorical variables. For example you might have make/model information for cars and want a representation that allows for having the embedded representations for "Ford F-150" and "Dodge Ram" be similar since they are both pickup trucks. This is not so much about NLP, there is no grammar involved, just a way of representing this type of information.
