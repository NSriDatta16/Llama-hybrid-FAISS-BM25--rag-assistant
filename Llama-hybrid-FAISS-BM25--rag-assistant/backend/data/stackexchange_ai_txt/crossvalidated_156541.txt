While I agree that multi-level modeling is an option for data with this structure, it's not the only option, especially given the lone time series dimension. Typically, the nestings within a heterarchical model are by category, e.g., students within classes or teachers, classes within schools, and so on, not ordinal dimensions like time. Gelman and Hill's book is great, I agree. Perhaps even better is Singer and Willet's book Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis which, to one poster's point, goes into much greater depth than G&H on some topics, e.g., growth models, issues related to constructing an interpretable intercept, curvilinearity and survival analysis but S&W lack a Bayesian focus. If you had an additional factor called "industry", then I would lean more strongly towards a heterarchical model. Given that you don't (i.e., you haven't posited "industry" as a factor. Do these companies belong to a single industry? How about by 6 or 8 digit SIC or NAIC codes?), another consideration would be pooled time series or event history analysis as it's called in sociology. Here, the advantages are that the models can be estimated in OLS, a more tractable functional form than multi-level models and that the industrial, organizational and economic literature has a long-standing history of published papers in this domain, beginning at least with F.M. Scherer but continuing up to the near-present with books like Wooldridge's Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data . My personal favorite in the field of PTS is Lee Cooper's ebook, Market Share Analysis , available on his UCLA website. Ignore the "share" part and even the "marketing" part. It's simply a great introduction to this class of models and it's quite accessible without sacrificing scientific rigor (he's an emeritus professor of mktg science). Not to mention that he develops different and carefully specified functional forms in terms of the data structure, elasticities, cross-elasticities and very practical advice on how to build these into your model. Depending on what your X factors are, this could be quite useful information.
