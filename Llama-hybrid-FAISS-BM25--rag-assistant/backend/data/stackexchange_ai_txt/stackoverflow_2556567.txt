data structure algorithms for database searching

I was used to the traditional way of doing database searching with the following using wildcards for term searches using where clause for specific data like addresses and names but at other times, I found these common methods to produce code that is so bloated, especially when it comes to complex searches. Are there algorithms out there that you use for complex database searching? I tried to look for some but had a hard time doing so. I stumbled accross the binary search but I can't find a use for it :( EDIT : Here's a pseudocode of a search I was working on. It uses jquery range sliders for maximum and minimum searching query = 'select * from table' if set minprice and not set maxprice if minprice = 'nomin' query += ' where price minprice' else query += ' where price > minprice and price minprice' else query += ' where price > minprice and price this may not be the codebase by which you base your answers. I'm looking for more elegant ways of doing database searching. EDIT by elegant I mean ways of rewriting the code to to achieve faster queries at less lines of code
