R predict function and Model Object

I'm doing machine learning in R. I would like to know how we can create a model object that we can pass to "predict" function along with new data so that we obtain predicted values. To elaborate, I'm trying to write a new machine learning algorithm in R. Till now I have only used predict function but don't know how to create "model" objects to pass to predict function. If we're doing a linear regression, calling lm would create "lm" object. If we're doing naiveBayes classifier, and call it from e1071 package, it would create naiveBayes classifier object, which we will pass to predict function. Now, if I'm writing a new algorithm, how do I create an object of that algorithm? And how exactly predict function will process that? What class variables/methods that "model" object should have so that it can be processed by "predict" function available in R? I know this is a bit open ended question, but I couldn't find any proper documentation. A basic/prototype example in terms of code would be highly appreciated. Though I've been using R, I'm not familiar to classes/objects concept in R. Thank you very much.
