Select estimators for Voting classifier

I don't know the efficient method to select the best subset of the estimator that saves time and highest accuracy. How to choose the best estimators for the Voting classifier? Voting Classifier is an ensemble technique for combines the predictions of several underlying machine learning models (estimators). It makes a final prediction based on either majority voting ("hard") or averaging probabilities ("soft"). Example: I have 20 estimators. I want to select the subset of these estimators that achieve the highest accuracy by saving time. dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lcfDLwnJ1TVQfGbn7x0LrZwaWRonP57Z/view?usp=sharing target: term_grade
