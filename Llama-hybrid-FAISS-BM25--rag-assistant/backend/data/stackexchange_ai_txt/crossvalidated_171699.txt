In machine learning, what can be called a classifier?

Is the word classifier used for algorithms that solely classify things, such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, or Neural Networks, or can it be used for all Machine Learning algorithms? In other words, can Linear Regression be called a Classifier? If not, what word can be used to refer to any and all machine learning algorithms (I feel like algorithm is too generic). Update: All the answers state that Linear Regression should not be considered a classifier . According to SeanEaster , a better term would be Regressor . I've decided to go with that. Thanks to everyone who took the time to explain this to me.
