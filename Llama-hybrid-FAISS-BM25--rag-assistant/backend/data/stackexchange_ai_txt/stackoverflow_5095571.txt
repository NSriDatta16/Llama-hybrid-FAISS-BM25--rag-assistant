Magento stock management

I have created new product type whose aim is to sell goods such as digital photos, serial codes or other multimedia files via email. The idea is similar to build-in downloadable product type but in my implementation each file must be different. The problem is to calculate stock levels, which indicate how many files remain available for sale. How can I calculate product stock data based on count of associated rows in foreign table instead of user input in product editor?
