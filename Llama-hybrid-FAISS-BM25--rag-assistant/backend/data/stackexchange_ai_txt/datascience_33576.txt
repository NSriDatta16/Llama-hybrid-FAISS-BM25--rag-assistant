Reinforcement learning(RL) is the intersection of machine learning, decisions & control, and behavioral psychology. The intersection can be approached from all the three sides, and a detailed explanation is beyond the scope of a answer. SO, I'll try to give a short account of all the three perspectives. Reinforcement Learning (RL) field, I give you here an illustrative simple example to understand the concept and also what is the relationship between Supervised Learning (SL) and Unsupervised Learning (UL). Imagine that you are teaching your child to play super mario and you have two option given the child the control stick and let him try to gain as many points as he can. or you play one level at a time and ask him to do as you did so as to reach the end of the level like you did, that is you teach him how to play one level and ask him to play that or a similar level of the game. This is SL as you will have for every input state of the road a mapping to the proper speed and points of jump and other attributes . The main point here is that you know what is the optimal thing and you try to teach your child to follow the similar steps. by doing so you teach him by examples. In a RL setting, you just let the child try whatever it wants and you let the game give him a reward/punishment regarding the action(s) it takes. In the SL example the child tries to minimize the error between your recommendation and its choices. In the RL example the child tries to maximize its reward by finding on its own what is the best to do. The SL approach at its best will lead you to a child to "mimics" what you taught it. In the RL approach at its best, the child will have a behavior that will be optimal in terms of playing Super Mario and also might be better than yours. In other words it will create its own strategy. To sum up, in SL you have a teacher that tells you at every single time step exactly whats the correct response(think of math class where the teacher explains a identical problem to you on broad before giving you a problem to solve on you own). In RL you try and find it on your own and the teacher gives you a reward/punishment (think of a practical class where you are given a chemical and you have find its element/composition of the chemical and you follow you own intuition and do some trail and error to find the composition of the chemical. In UL you don't have any external feedback. So uL falls between SL and RL(think of bio class where teacher gives you example about some classes of animals and ask you to do some classification. say, dog, cat, lion are vertebrate but snail, crab, earthworm are invertebrate so without knowing the meaning of invertebrate and vertebrate tell me which of these are invertebrate and vertebrate: frog, snake and grasshopper. I simplified a lots just to give you a hint on the learning techniques with the example.
