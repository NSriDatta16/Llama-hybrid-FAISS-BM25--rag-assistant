How do I interpret this cross correlation function (CCF) plot?

I am working on some exchange rates data. I have two series: $X_t$ with the official exchange rate (e.g. forex) $Y_t$ with the exchange rate on the "black market" (e.g. currency exchange houses at airports). I am interested in modelling the relationship between these two series. It is reasonable to model $Y_t$ as a function of $X_t$ and lagged values of this series (because the black market kinda follows the official market). I would like to get insight on two questions: Average lag in the response of the black market (how long does it take for currency exchange houses to react to changes in the official market). The magnitude of the reaction (do currency exchange houses overreact?, or they kind of smooth the movements in the official market?) Here's how the data looks like: I've read that the "cross correlation function (CCF) is helpful for identifying lags of the $X$-variable that might be useful predictors of $Y_t$". (link) So I produced such plots for 20, 50 and 150 lags (I have in total 520 obs) with the following code in R . ccf(x = toy$xa, y = toy$ya, lag.max = 20) ccf(x = toy$xa, y = toy$ya, lag.max = 50) ccf(x = toy$xa, y = toy$ya, lag.max = 250) And here's how they look: Does it mean that up to 170 lags might be useful predictors?, or am I doing something wrong?
