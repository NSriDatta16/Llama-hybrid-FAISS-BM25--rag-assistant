I have seen this sort of behaviour before when you do simulations and the assumed true value for the simulations is in the centre of reasonably informative priors (e.g. you have a regression coefficient with a N(0, 1) prior and simulate it as being 0). In contrast, if you sample simulation scenarios from your priors, you should on average get a coverage frequency that matches the nominal level. I.e. the reason is likely that you "sample" (or just fix them) parameter values from a much more narrow distribution at/ close to the centre of your prior.
