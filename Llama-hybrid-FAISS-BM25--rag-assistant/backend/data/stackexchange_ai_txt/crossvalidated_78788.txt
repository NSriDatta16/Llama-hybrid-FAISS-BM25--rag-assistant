Can I use Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to test pairs of data in a time series?

I have a dataset of measurements (non-normally distributed). Each line of this dataset is composed of two measurements of the same variable at a specific time (i.e. XYY [time, meas1, meas2]). This dataset contains 24 lines. Is it correct to use the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to compare these two measurements? Is it correct to use this test to compare the mean value of these measurements between different experiments? Thanks
