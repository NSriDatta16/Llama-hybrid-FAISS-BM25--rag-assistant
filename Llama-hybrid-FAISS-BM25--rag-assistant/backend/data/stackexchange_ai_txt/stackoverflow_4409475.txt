It depends on the implementation driving the memory allocator, for instance: On widows, it pulls memory from the process heap, under under XP, this heap its not set to be the low fragmentation implementation, which could really throw a spanner in the works. Under a bin or slab based allocator, your few extra bytes might push it up to the next block size, wasting memory madly and causing horrible virtual memory thrashing. Depending on your memory usage needs, you might be better served by using a custom allacator to replace ::new , something like hoard or nedmalloc.
