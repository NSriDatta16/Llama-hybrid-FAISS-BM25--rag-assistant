Google Map API and Links

I am trying to add a link into the pop-up text bubble of a marker in Google Maps through the API. I have successfully run the below code: echo ' '; But once I actually try to add the link it fails. Like this: echo ' '; Does anyone know how to successfully write this code? I am writing it into PHP because I have some other functionality that won't let me just write it in XML. Update: I got it to work like this for some reason... $window2a_url = '&lt;a href=&apos;http://www.albertus.edu/admission/index.shtml&apos;&gt;Admissions'; echo ' '; I had to escape the apostrophes... If anyone has a more elegant solution, I am all ears!
