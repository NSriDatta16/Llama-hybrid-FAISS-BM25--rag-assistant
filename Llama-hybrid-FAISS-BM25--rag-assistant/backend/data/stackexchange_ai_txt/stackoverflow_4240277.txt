1) From @sb in an answer to Cocoa Objective-c Property C structure assign fails That won't accomplish anything, because [t member] returns a struct, which is an "r-value", ie. a value that's only valid for use on the right-hand side of an assignment. It has a value, but it's meaningless to try to change that value. Basically you just have to live with the fact that you can't set the fields of struct directly when returned from a function. 2) Yes 3) Unfortunately I don't think there is a built-in convenience method for adding two CGPoint . If you find your self doing this frequently you can make your own: CGPoint CGPointAdd(CGPoint p1, CGPoint p2) { return CGPointMake(p1.x + p2.x, p1.y + p2.y); } and then use it like: obj.pointA = CGPointAdd(obj.pointA, pointB); not as elegant as obj.pointA.X += ... but sometimes life isn't fair.
