I'm in the same boat as you (somewhat). I've been developing in C# for 7 years, ever since .NET 1.0. Over the past couple weeks I've been teaching myself Cocoa and Objective-C. Here are my impressions (note for note with yours) Agreed in that clutter can be a problem. I tend to use Spaces heavily when developing in XCode (put XCode in one space, Interface Builder in another space, Instruments in a third space). If you don't have Leopard (and thus, no spaces), then use Command-H to hide your active window. Using that tends to clean things up quite a bit (however it'd be nice if you could command-h automagically the current window when command-tab'ing to another app). I'm liking XCode more and more. I hate Visual Studio - I find it to be unstable, slow, and well, just kind of a crappy IDE. Comparatively I've found XCode to be fast, stable, and I like how it organizes and filters your files. I'm not too up on my XCode shortcuts, but I'm hoping there's a way I can quick-switch from one class to another (similar to ctrl +n shortcut in ReSharper). Intellisense could be better with regards to how it displays to the user, but I really like how it essentially creates a template and you can ctrl + / to jump to the next argument in a message. I'm hating the documentation in XCode. The help system sucks, and for whatever reason it never finds what I'm searching for. I end up just googling for anything I need to know... I hope they improve the documentation. This is my biggest beef right now. Not quite there yet, as I'm going through the full Cocoa framework for Mac desktops. So far I'm really, really liking what I see. One thing I will say is that it would be nice if the iPhone SDK allowed for garbage collection... Objective-C - I've never used it, this is my first foray into it. At first I was kinda wierded out by the syntax and the square brackets for messaging, but it's really growing on me. It's so quick to skim a method and see the message calls that method makes. The more I use it, the more Objective-C just feels nice... however templating/generics would be a welcome addition to the language. All in all, my foray into Mac development has been enjoyable, and I'm excited to start working (today! yay!) on some actual mac/iphone projects.
