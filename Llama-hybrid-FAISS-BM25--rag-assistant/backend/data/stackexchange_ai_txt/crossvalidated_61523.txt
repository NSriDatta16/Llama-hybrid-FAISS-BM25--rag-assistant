You basically have to create a wide format dataset with the all the characteristics that are relevant for the matching procedure, perform the matching on this cross-sectional dataset, and then use the ID to identify the matched pair in the panel dataset. Here are some more details: Use reshape to create a wide format dataset. Format the pre-treatment variables in the way you want to use them in the matching procedure. You can just take the average of your variables if you have multiple observations for one individual but you can also come up with other ways (you can also keep multiple observations of the same variables such as health1, health2 and use all of them in the matching). The goal is to have a dataset with one observation per individual . Using this dataset, perform the matching procedure with psmatch2 . Merge the information about the matched cases with the original dataset. Drop cases that are not matched etc. I am not sure about the details here because I don't really know stata and psmatch2 but I think you get the idea. Using these steps, you can match cases based on all pre-treatment information and you only have one match per treatment unit.
