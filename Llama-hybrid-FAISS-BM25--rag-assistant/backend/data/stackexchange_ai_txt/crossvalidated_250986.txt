I had a short chat with the author of MCMCglmm, Jarrod Hadfield . He said There is no option for doing sequential tests in MCMCglmm [..] Certainly, if two predictors are confounded and one (or both) has an effect, then sequential tests can report significance for the first predictor while non-sequential tests may report significance for neither, but this can often be revealed by jointly testing the two effects or looking at the posterior correlation between the two parameters.
