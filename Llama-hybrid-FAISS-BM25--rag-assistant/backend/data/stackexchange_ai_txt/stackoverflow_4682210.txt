If you intent to render your selected object with a specific shader, then you have to create a shader that has the same behavior as the regular rendering of your objects (lighting, texturing, ...). That means you have to compute that color of the pixel by yourself. If you intent to render all your objects, and then add your selection, then it is impossible to retrieve the color of the framebuffer pixel from your fragment shader (you need to create a texture out of your framebuffer and use it, but it is out of scope, I think).
