I'm a fan of using the WITH clause in SELECT statements to organize the different steps. I find that it makes the code easier to read. WITH max_date(max_date) AS ( SELECT MAX(Date) FROM my_table ), max_seq(max_seq) AS ( SELECT MAX(Sequence) FROM my_table WHERE Date = (SELECT md.max_date FROM max_date md) ) SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE Date = (SELECT md.max_date FROM max_date md) AND Sequence = (SELECT ms.max_seq FROM max_seq ms); You should be able to optimize this further as needed.
