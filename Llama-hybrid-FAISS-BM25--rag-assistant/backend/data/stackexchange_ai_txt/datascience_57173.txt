Splitting training and test set with financial data

I am using trees algorithms (decision tree, random forest and XGBoost) to forecast the sign of the returns in the stock market (classification). I am using this article as a reference: http://rpubs.com/raaraa/412512 When splitting the training and the test set, the author uses the following R code: index Is it correct to use a random set of dates to split the test and the training set with time series financial data? It looks like look-ahead bias to me. This would be the alternative: train But with this split I cannot get significant accuracies even trying with different datasets. Do you have any suggestions?
