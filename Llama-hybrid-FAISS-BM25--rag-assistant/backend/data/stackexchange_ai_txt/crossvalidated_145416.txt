Not quite enough information to go on. But a glm (generalized linear model) should work. If the outcome is continuous then linear regression may be an appropriate glm, if binary then logistic regression. Just include all the variables and the p-value for each variable is adjusted for the effects of the other variables. For categorical variables many software packages output the p-value for each level of the category rather than the variable as a whole, and so sometimes an extra command is needed depending on software of choice. Some of this is addressed: Significance of categorical predictor in logistic regression As well: How to test the statistical significance for categorical variable in linear regression? How to interpret insignificant categorical variables for logistic regression
