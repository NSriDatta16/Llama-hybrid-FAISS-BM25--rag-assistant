Interpreting PCA results of first two components

I don't like the looks of my PCA graph here. PCA coordinates should be uncorrelated, yet the variance between the coordinates of the second component increases as the first component decreases. What's the explanation for this? Colors represent various groups. I also should specify I have over 1000+ variables in my original matrix. I need 26 components to reach 80% of the variance explained, which is probably bad.
