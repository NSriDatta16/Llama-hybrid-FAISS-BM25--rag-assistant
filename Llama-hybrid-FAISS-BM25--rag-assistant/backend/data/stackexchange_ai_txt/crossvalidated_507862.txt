Random forest fits multi-dimensional staircase to your data. It produces sharp edges in predictions. If your data are of continuous nature, then probably there are better methods to fit them. That doesn't mean however that "you should avoid random forest to fit them" :-) I don't think there is any kind of data where you "should be worried" about using RF. And, I wouldn't say RF is "leatherman", it's definitely not, in the sense that "it will do everything for you". It's just a basic universal method you can use on wide variety of data. I would say it's more like " first simple thing to try ", or a "baseline" for benchmarking better methods . I also use it when I want to see which predictor variables are important ; there is an excellent R package Boruta for this purpose.
