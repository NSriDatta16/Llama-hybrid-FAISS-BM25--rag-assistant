Averaging results from different experiments where errors may be underestimated

Let's say we have three different published results that measure the same physical quantity $x$ using completely different methods. Experiment 1 says $x=100\pm0.1$, Experiment 2 says $x=102\pm0.2$, and Experiment 3 says $x=99\pm0.3$. Obviously these results are inconsistent, and we suspect that all three experimenters have underestimated their errors. Is there any rigorous way to average together these three numbers an get a sensible answer for the error of the mean? I would think the answer is no and the only way to deal with it would be to scale all three errors by some ad-hoc factor to make the results more sensible. What I would like from a "sensible" procedure is that we acknowledge that the error in experiment 1 is likely greater than 0.1, but it is still likely that experiment 1 is the most precise experiment, and experiment 3 is the least precise. Like I said, it seems kind of hopeless, the only reason I'm asking is because wikipedia seems to suggest that there is a solution to exactly this problem . However the wikipedia article doesn't provide any references or any justification for the formula it gives. It says you should compute the mean in the normal way (weighted by $1/\sigma^2$) and that the error on the mean is $$\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 = \frac{ 1 }{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^{-2}} \times \frac{1}{(n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{ (x_i - \bar{x} )^2}{ \sigma_i^2 } .$$ So my question is: what is the source of this formula? Does it apply to the situation I described above?
