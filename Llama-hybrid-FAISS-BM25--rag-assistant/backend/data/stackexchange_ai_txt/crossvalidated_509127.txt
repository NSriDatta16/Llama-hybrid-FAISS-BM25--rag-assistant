(1) H0 is a formal model and (as far as I think at least, and I'm not alone) no formal model will ever be true in reality, so the probability that H0 is true will be zero whatever the test outcome is. (Tests don't say anything about H0 being true, all they can say is whether the data are compatible with H0.) (2) Within a Bayesian model (which is different from "in reality") you can have a probability that H0 is true, but this requires you to set up a prior distribution, including a prior probability that H0 is true. So you need to specify P(H0 is true) before data, then you also can compute its probability conditionally given the data ("posterior probability").
