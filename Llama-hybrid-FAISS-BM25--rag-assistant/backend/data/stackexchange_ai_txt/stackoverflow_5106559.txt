runtime error in eclipse android

few days before when i was trying to run my apps the following type of error used to occur [2011-02-24 20:33:41 - FlashCard] Installation error: INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE [2011-02-24 20:33:41 - FlashCard] Please check logcat output for more details. [2011-02-24 20:33:41 - FlashCard] Launch canceled! i used to close the eclipse or shut down my system, then it gets cleared. Later it happens to occur often, i got a suggestion from stack overflow to enter command adb start-server and adb kill-server in run cmd, the idea worked only for two days. Right from today morning i am trying to run all my apps and the same error continues. The adb server idea is not working, i have tried updating my eclipse too. i am posting this just to get an idea about this problem, as i am new to android development and java. if anyone have any solution or idea pls share it.
