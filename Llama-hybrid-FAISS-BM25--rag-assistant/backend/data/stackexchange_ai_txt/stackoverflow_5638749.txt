Get User Agent in my app which doesn't contain a webview

I can ask WebView.getWebSettings().getUserAgentString() to get the user agent, but this doesn't work all that well for my app as I need to instantiate a WebView first even though I don't need. Is there another way to get to the User Agent without using a WebView.getSetting, because in my application, I don't need a webView ? Help me please
