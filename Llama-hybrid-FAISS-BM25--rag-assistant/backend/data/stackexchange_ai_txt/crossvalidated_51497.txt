I wouldn't use the FFT here at all unless you have some model that suggests it is the right thing to do, and, from the information you've given, I don't see any reason to believe simply looking at the FFT of your data is appropriate. I suggest instead of looking at the FFT, which is likely to be a dead-end, consider other approaches. More appropriate methods might be a moving average filter (eg, the average sales in the last N days) or a weighted moving average filter (same except more weight is given to values that are believed to be more significant, either because you have a model/hypothesis that supports this, or actual data that indicates that this is how it's been in the past. For example, you might weight more recent figures, or you might weight data from mondays because you have data that suggests that monday sales are predictive for some reason). Another approach might be to simply use regression (especially logistic regression). This may seem traditional and boring, but it works.
