Could you group the data set into much smaller data sets (say 100 or 1000 or 10,000 data points) If you then calculated the median of each of the groups. If you did this with enough data sets you could plot something like the average of the results of each of the smaller sets and this woul, by running enough smaller data sets converge to an 'average' solution.
