jScrollPane theme with CSS

I want to apologize now for my bad english, i hope you will understand what i want: I recently used the plugin jquery 'jScrollPane' on my website malossane.fr/sqf/. Everything is ok, but i appeared to not be able to make the only little change i wanted. In fact , it is very simple in the idea, but my css scripting level is very bad. Just now, i have something like that :http://malossane.fr/usb-file-723 And i want something like that : What i want In fact, i want the .jspDrag to be larger than the .jspVerticalBar that should have a width of 5px. But if i put a width of 5px for the vertical bar, the .jspDrag width become also of 5px although i want him to stay at 16px. Is someone able to help me? Thanx a lot, Tim
