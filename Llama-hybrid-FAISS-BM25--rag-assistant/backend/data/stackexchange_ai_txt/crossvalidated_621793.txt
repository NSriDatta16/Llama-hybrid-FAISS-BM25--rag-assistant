Linear regression: Coverage rate of confidence interval of mean response is poor

My understanding of the 95% confidence interval is the interval should contain the true value 95% of the time. Therefore, I test it with the linear regression confidence interval for the mean response. Here is a reproducible r code: set.seed(1234) n =y) mean(result$inside) [1] 0.24 The results show the coverage rate of the 95% confidence interval for the mean response only has coverage rate of 24% . Why is this happening and what am I missing?
