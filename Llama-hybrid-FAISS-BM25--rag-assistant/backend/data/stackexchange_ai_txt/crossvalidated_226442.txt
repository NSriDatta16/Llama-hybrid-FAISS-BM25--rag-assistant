I would argue that it makes no sense to say there is a "linear relationship" between a dichotomous response variable and an independent variable. That's one reason we use logistic regression (or other transformations of the response). Also, perhaps it's just a sort of typo, but variables can't be linear. Did you mean "non-continuous"? Finally, if you need a mixed model (to deal with dependent data) then any model which does not account for the dependency may be very misleading.
