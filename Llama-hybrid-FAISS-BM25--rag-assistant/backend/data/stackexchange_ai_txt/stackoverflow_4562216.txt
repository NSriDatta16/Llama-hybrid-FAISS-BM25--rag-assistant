Android apply styles for different screens

I have an application, that need to run in 2 different devices: 600x1024 & 480x800 . For these devices, I want to apply different styles (they has different ratio). How I can do it, as both of them has hdpi?, e.g. values-hdpi , values-mdpi have no effect.... P.S. Android 2.2 .
