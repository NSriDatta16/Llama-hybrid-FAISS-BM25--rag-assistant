It's not clear enough what you try to do. If I understand correctly, you want to train a K-Means clustering and visualize the results. However, you have 8 dimensions in your dataset and obviously, you cannot plot such a space. What you can do is to reduce the dimensionality in 2 dimensions and then create that plot. For example, import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from sklearn.decomposition import PCA from sklearn.cluster import KMeans # read my data with pandas into a dataframe data = pd.read_csv("data.csv") # run a KMeans model with 3 clusters. Change that number to what you want clustering_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, precompute_distances="auto", n_jobs=-1) clusters = clustering_kmeans.fit_predict(data) # run PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 2 dimensions reduced_data = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(data) # create a new dataframe that contains the 2 dimensions and the cluster label results = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data,columns=['pca1','pca2']) results['label'] = clusters # plot the results with a scatterplot sns.scatterplot(x="pca1", y="pca2", hue=label, data=reduced_data) plt.show()
