How do you define the steps to explore the data?

I'm falling in love with data science and I'm spending a lot of time studying it. It seems that a common data science workflow is: Frame the problem Collect the data Clean the data Work on the data Report the results I'm struggling to connect the dots when comes to work on the data. I'm aware that step 4 is where the fun happens, but I don't know where to begin. What are the steps taken when you work on the data? Example: do I need to find the central tendency or the standard deviation? Is machine learning needed? Ps: I know these are broad questions, so please answer it within your own domain expertise.
