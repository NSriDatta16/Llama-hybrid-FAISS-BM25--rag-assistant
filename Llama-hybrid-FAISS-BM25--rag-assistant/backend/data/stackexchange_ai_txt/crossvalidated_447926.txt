Time series analysis video resources

I am kinda new in Data Science. My background is in Mathematics. I took some graduate-level statistics courses like the generalized linear model. I am interested to forecast future student enrollment of my university. I was wondering if you could give me some video resources links on Time series analysis. I never took any time series course. I appreciate your help!
