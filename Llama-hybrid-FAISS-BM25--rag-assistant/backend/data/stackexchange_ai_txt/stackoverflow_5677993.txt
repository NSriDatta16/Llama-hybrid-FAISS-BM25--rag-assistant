How do I drag multiple elements at once with JavaScript or jQuery?

I want to be able to drag a group of elements with jQuery, like if I selected and dragged multiple icons on the Windows desktop. I found the demo of threedubmedia's jQuery.event.drag : http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag/demo/multi http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag#demos I think this plugin is great. Is this good and popular library? Do you know websites or applications which use it? Are there any other libraries or plugins to drag multiple objects? Can jQuery UI drag multiple objects?
