How do you determine the best, worse and average case complexity of a problem generated with random dice rolls?

There is a picture book with 100 pages. If dice are rolled randomly to select one of the pages and subsequently rerolled in order to search for a certain picture in the book -- how do I determine the best, worst and average case complexity of this problem? Proposed answer: best case: picture is found on the first dice roll worst case: picture is found on 100th dice roll or picture does not exist average case: picture is found after 50 dice rolls (= 100 / 2) Assumption: incorrect pictures are searched at most one time
