Metric to evaluate words generated by Neural Network

I have this task at hand and I would be grateful for some directions. Perfectly not the final solution as I would like to do it myself. Let's say I need to create new fruit names based on existing ones. I made it using textgenrnn library. Now I have a list of potential new names. I would like to build a metric which would calculate that e.g.: (Fabic, Alis, Brooty, Morange etc) are potentially good fruit name (Ssae, Sriew, Adeoie, Seeea) are potential bad fruit names. Is there any list of metrics for word generating? As of now, I found following resources: Evaluating Generative Models for Text Generation https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports/2737434.pdf Character-Level Language Modeling with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks http://150.162.46.34:8080/icassp2017/pdfs/0005720.pdf Graves A. Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf Subword language modeling with neural networks. http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~imikolov/rnnlm/char.pdf But since I learnt about them today, I would need a more vanilla introduction to this topic of validation.
