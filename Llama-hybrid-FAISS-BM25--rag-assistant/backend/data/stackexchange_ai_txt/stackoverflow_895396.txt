How do I find the average in a LARGE set of numbers?

I have a large set of numbers, probably in the multiple gigabytes range. First issue is that I can't store all of these in memory. Second is that any attempt at addition of these will result in an overflow. I was thinking of using more of a rolling average, but it needs to be accurate. Any ideas? These are all floating point numbers. This is not read from a database, it is a CSV file collected from multiple sources. It has to be accurate as it is stored as parts of a second (e.g; 0.293482888929) and a rolling average can be the difference between .2 and .3 It is a set of #'s representing how long users took to respond to certain form actions. For example when showing a messagebox, how long did it take them to press OK or Cancel. The data was sent to me stored as seconds.portions of a second; 1.2347 seconds for example. Converting it to milliseconds and I overflow int, long, etc.. rather quickly. Even if I don't convert it, I still overflow it rather quickly. I guess the one answer below is correct, that maybe I don't have to be 100% accurate, just look within a certain range inside of a sepcific StdDev and I would be close enough.
