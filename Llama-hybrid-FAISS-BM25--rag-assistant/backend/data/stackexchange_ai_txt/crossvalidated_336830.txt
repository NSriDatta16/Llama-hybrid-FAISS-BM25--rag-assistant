You mention weighting points in linear models as a method of incorporating uncertainty. This is possible to do in random forests as well. In an unweighted RF, $n$ random subsamples of points are selected, and regression trees (jointly comprising the forest) are independently fit to each of them. Weights are incorporated in the random forest by altering the probabilities with which points are selected in each random subsample. A point with a higher weight will be present in a greater proportion of trees, and consequently have a larger influence on the random forest.
