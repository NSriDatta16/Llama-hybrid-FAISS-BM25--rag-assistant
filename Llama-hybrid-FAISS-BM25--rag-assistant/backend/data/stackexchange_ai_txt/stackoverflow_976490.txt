We had the same problem. What we did was to use a local database, you can do the same, for example using SQLLite it's a good idea. It's also feasible to store the data using XML. Well, we did this, we have two separates threads: i) a thread (A) that scans the source of the data (PLCs in our case) and puts the data in the temporary storage (in your case XML files). ii) a thread (B) that scans the temporary data and sends it to the central database. The data sent to the central server can be either deleted or marked as sent. This works very well. When (B) cannot connect to the server the data stars accumulating in the local database / xml. When the connection to the server is available again the data is sent properly.
