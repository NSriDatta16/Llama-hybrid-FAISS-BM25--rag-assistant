Largest effect being ignored. Is this acceptable?

I am doing some statistical analysis for researchers who want to publish the results as a paper. I have done a logistic regression to predict an outcome given various demographic variables, and found which variables were significant, etc. Standard stuff. As it turns out, one variable is twice (or more) as indicative as all the others, however it turns out it is politically unpalatable to include this variable in the final analysis, and they don't want to even control for it in assessing the other variable's impact. I feel like this is sweeping the largest effect under the carpet, and I'm not sure I want to be included in the final publication after having the results twisted in this way. Is this kind of thing ever justified? What should I do?
