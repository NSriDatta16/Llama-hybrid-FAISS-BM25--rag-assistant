Information Visualization: which parameters should a data scientist plot to best explain the work behind a Neural Network?

I'm a beginner in the field and I wrote and trained my first Convolutional Neural Network from scratch. I would like to know what types of graphics and parameters a data scientist uses to plot to explain a neural network in the best possibile and mathematical way. As far as I know I use to plot loss and accuracy graphics using matplotlib.
