How to speed-up trained Tensorflow model with FC layers for production

I have deep FC model (7 layers, 500 units per layer) and I need to speed up it in the production. Memory requirements don't matter. What tools or approaches can you advise except quantization. There are several works about that with several times speed up, but I can't find any tool for Tensorflow. I found the only tool for CNN compression/speed up.
