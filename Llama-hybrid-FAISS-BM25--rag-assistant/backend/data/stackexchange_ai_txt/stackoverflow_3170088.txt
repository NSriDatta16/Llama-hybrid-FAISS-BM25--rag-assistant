Flash, ActionScript 3: define a variable as a variable from its creator without constantly using creator.var

I am trying to split up my code in classes. but there is a issue what really bothers me. when i create a class for functions i am giving its own stage. like this dragf:Dragfunctions = new Dragfunctions(this) and in the class i use this var stage:Object; public function Dragfunctions(stage:Object) { this.stage = stage; } as you can see i can now call a variable of the stage using stage.var1 = "hi" but when i need to ajust that varable many times it gets a quite messy... there is a way to tell that when i call var1 he knows i mean stage.var1 without need to call stage. its: var var1 = stage.var1 and then using stage.var1 = var1 but that is quite unhandy too is there a better way?
