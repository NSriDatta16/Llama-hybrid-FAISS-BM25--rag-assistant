UIView's are not positioning correctly

I have a nib with a 2 UIViews and 2 UILabels with IBOutlet's in my controller. I am increasing and decreasing the height of these UIViews to look like a bar to indicate when something is 100% or less - like a bar chart almost. I am using the following method for both bars (reuse) however the first UIView (bar) positions correctly but the second is too low down - the Y axis is wrong. However the height of both is correct. Anyone have any ideas? I have positioned them in interface builder already all I am actually doing in this method is changing the height (basically) //Position the point, size and label of a rating bar - (void)configureRatingBar:(UIView *)vRatingBar andRatingLabel:(UILabel *)lRatingLabel usingRating:(NSDecimalNumber *)rating { //NSDecimalNumber *foodRating = [self calculateRating:self.currentHotel.foodAndBeverageRating]; NSString *formattedRating = [self formatRating:rating]; lRatingLabel.text = formattedRating; float newHeight = [rating floatValue]; //The height will be based on the rating 100 max CGRect currentFrame = vRatingBar.frame; //Current frame of the rating view //CGPoint currentPoint = // [vRatingBar convertPoint:vRatingBar.frame.origin toView:vReviews]; CGPoint currentPoint = vRatingBar.frame.origin; //Current point of the rating view float newYaxis = currentPoint.x + (100 - newHeight); //Y axis must move down with the decreasing rating from 0 (100 %) down [vRatingBar setFrame:CGRectMake(currentPoint.x, newYaxis, currentFrame.size.width, newHeight)]; [lRatingLabel setFrame:CGRectMake(currentFrame.size.width / 34, newHeight - 20, 34, 21)]; }
