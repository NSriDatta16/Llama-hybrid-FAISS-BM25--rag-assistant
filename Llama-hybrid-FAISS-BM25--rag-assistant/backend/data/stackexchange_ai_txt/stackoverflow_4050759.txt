The best advice I can give you is: Don't comment bad code; rewrite it! If methods are very complex, most of the time you are doing something wrong (not always, but very close to always). Writing readable code is hard, but it pays of, because writing good comments that you (or your colleges) will understand a year later is hard as well (and perhaps even harder). Ways to make things clear is by breaking methods up in smaller well named methods and using very clear variable names. A book that has helped me a lot in creating better code was Robert Martins Clean Code . If you haven't read it, please do. And let all the developers in your company read it. Good luck.
