Level change and trend change in the interrupted time series regression, does collinearity matters?

In the interrupted time series regression, we are interested in the level change or trend change due to a policy change or an intervention event occurance. If the dates of those interventions are known, the model then can be expressed as y = intercept + coef.time*time(t)+coef.intervention*intervention(t)+coef.time after intervention*time(t) after intervention+error(t). In my analysis, there is another type of intervention which is a cumulative intervention, which measures the cumulative number of people participate into the intervention program. The underlying interest is on the contribution of those people in the change of the series. Therefore there is additional variable in the model which is y = ...... + coef.cumulative*number.cumulative(t)+error(t). The problem is that the cumulative intervention happens in the same period of external interrupted event, say policy change. For example, a simple simulated data t Someone strongly argued that there are collinearities based on correlation matrix among those variabes especially between cumgp and second intervention. t int.1 trd.1 int.2 trd.2 cumgp t 1.0000000 0.7860058 0.9739927 0.7361619 0.6799093 0.7375151 int.1 0.7860058 1.0000000 0.6840924 0.3559026 0.2983724 0.3438636 trd.1 0.9739927 0.6840924 1.0000000 0.8000324 0.7472221 0.8049856 int.2 0.7361619 0.3559026 0.8000324 1.0000000 0.8383540 0.9274249 trd.2 0.6799093 0.2983724 0.7472221 0.8383540 1.0000000 0.9377249 cumgp 0.7375151 0.3438636 0.8049856 0.9274249 0.9377249 1.0000000 Based on second plot above which is the true process, if say we do not recognize the second intervention, and all the contributions of change in the series go to "cumgp", Personally I don't think it is a collinearity problem, as cumgp and second intervention contribute to the change of the series independently, but around the same time. Therefore could any one suggest how to interpret such a problem to convince "someone"?
