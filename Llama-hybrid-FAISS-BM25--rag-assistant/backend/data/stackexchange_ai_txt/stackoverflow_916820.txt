How can I get jcifs to play nicely with apache axis

I need to connect Apache Axis 1.4 to a Webservice that uses NTLM authentication to restrict access to its operations. I'm expecting to use Samba Jcifs to handle the NTLM handshake. I found http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client/ntlm.html which gives me fantastic directions for how to wire up HttpClient 4.0 with jcifs. Trouble is, Axis wants to use Http Client 3.0 and the two apis look very different. There are 2 possibilities that I can see Write an object for Axis that lets it plug into HttpClient 4. Figure out how to wire HttpClient 3.0 up with Samba Jcifs. Number 1. looks non-trivial, but possible Number 2. I cannot find any encouraging messages on the web describing how to do this. My question is: has anyone successfully connected samba jcifs with HttpClient 3.0 ? Has anyone already created an Axis HttpSender object that works with HttpClient 4 ? Is there some better alternative that I have not considered?
