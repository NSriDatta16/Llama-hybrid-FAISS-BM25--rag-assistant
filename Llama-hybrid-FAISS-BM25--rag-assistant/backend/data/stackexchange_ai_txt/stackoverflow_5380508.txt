Does Csh have an autocomplete setting that deal better with case?

I have auto complete turned on in my .cshrc: set autolist set correct=cmd set complete=enhance works pretty nicely, except when it comes to case. I have a directory that contains these files: ToolConfig.pm* ToolConfig.pm_bak* Toolconfig_init.pm* ToolConfig.pm.orig* ToolConfig.pm~* At the prompt, I type, "tool -tab-" and it gives me: Toolconfig ok. I then type ".pm", yielding Toolconfig.pm at this point, it sure would be nice to hit -tab- again and have it finish the job by making upcasing the 'c'. I have a complete filename, sure there are additional possibilities, but for the current sting, I have to move the cursor back to do it myself. Kinda negates some of the utility of completion. Surely, I am not along in this frustration. There must be some special sauce to fix this.
