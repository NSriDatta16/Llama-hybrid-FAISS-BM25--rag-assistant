How to predict probability of an event when we have a month to month data?

I'm trying to find references about how to proceed to get the probability of an event happening when we have "temporal data" in our table My data is basically: hex_id: id of the object date: monthly date (2018-01 to 2022-12) var1: binary variable var2: binary variable event: binary variable (can happen more than once) So, I have +-160 ids and 50+ entries of each of these IDs (50+ months of each IDs); I would like to understand what should I try to solve this kind of problem, because of I'm a little scared to see that there are almost nothing about predicting categorical data on a "time series"/temporal data Any reference or answer will be welcome.
