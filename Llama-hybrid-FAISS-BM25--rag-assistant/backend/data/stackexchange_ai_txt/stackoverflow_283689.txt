You can't connect to a SQL server using the express versions of VS but what you can do is use a tool called sqlMetal.exe to generate a dbml from your SQL server, then you can just add that dbml to you project and pass the connection string to the datacontext that it generates. To use Open Visual Studio command line and type "Sqlmetal" and it will show you how to use it, more information can be found here . The only problem is that you can't drag n drop tables into the dbml once its generated as you can't connect to the server in the database explorer.
