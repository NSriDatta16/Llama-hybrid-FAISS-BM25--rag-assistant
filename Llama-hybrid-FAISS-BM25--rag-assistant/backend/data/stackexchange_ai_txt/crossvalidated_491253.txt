can the tsoutliers package be applied on non-stationary time series and standardized level residuals?

can the tsoutliers package be applied to standardized level residuals to obtain better locations of changepoints or is the package applicable only on the original time series data? for example i tried applying the package to the original data and obtained: Outliers: and when I applied the package to the standardized level residuals I got this: Outliers: also, is the package applicable to Non-stationary time series?
