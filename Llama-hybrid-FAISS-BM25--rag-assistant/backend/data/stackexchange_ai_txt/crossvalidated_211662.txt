Following the guidelines of Blackwell ("all models are wrong, but some are useful "), you have no obligation of including an interaction term, since: you may not afford including an interaction term due to a small number of observations in your dataset; you may have too much noise in your phenomenon so that including interaction terms can be futile, since you seldom will get them statistically significant; and higher degree interaction terms (like $x_1^3 x_5^2 x_9^5$, for instance) will very, very, very rarely have any meaningful interpretation in terms of your real phenomenon (and it only gets worse if your $y$ is multivariate). OK, in strict mathematical speak, you can (perhaps ought to) include them, but considering strictly modeling issues, most of time it will not make sense for your first approach to a phenomenon, albeit it can and will make more sense in the course of a series of improvements of an initial model, like, for instance, in the regression of the concentration of one product in function of the concentration of several reagents and catalysts in a very complex chemical reaction. But please notice that all of it will make sense only if your experiments are extremely well controlled and if you have a horribly awful lot of observations, both conditions more compatible with a rather long series of experiments in a well consolidated research, not in a very first attempt to get to understand, say, a social phenomenon. And, last but not least, as asked, $$ y = \sum_{i_1=0}^{3} \sum_{i_2=0}^{3-i_1} \sum_{i_3=0}^{3-i_1-i_2} \sum_{i_4=0}^{3-i_1-i_2-i_3} \beta_{i_1i_2i_3i_4} x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}x_3^{i_3}x_4^{i_4} +\varepsilon, $$ which, according to my calculations, will be a hell of a long expression. =) Something like $$ y = \beta_{0000} + \beta_{1000} x_1+ \beta_{0100} x_2+ \beta_{0010} x_3+ \beta_{0001} x_4+ \beta_{2000} x_1^2+ \beta_{0200} x_2^2+ \beta_{0020} x_3^2+ \beta_{0002} x_4^2+ \beta_{1100} x_1x_2+ \beta_{1010} x_1x_3+ \beta_{1001} x_1x_4+ \beta_{0110} x_2x_3+ \beta_{0101} x_2x_4+ \beta_{0011} x_3x_4+ \beta_{3000} x_1^3+ \beta_{0300} x_2^3+ \beta_{0030} x_3^3+ \beta_{0003} x_4^3+ \beta_{1110} x_1x_2x_3+ \beta_{1101} x_1x_2x_4+ \beta_{0111} x_2x_3x_4+ \ldots+ \varepsilon. $$ Edit: I took the time to write a lazy script in R to generate an expression in LaTeX with all the terms of the sum above, which output this: $$ y = \beta_{0000} + \beta_{0001} x_4 + \beta_{0002} x_4^2 + \beta_{0003} x_4^3 + \beta_{0010} x_3 + \beta_{0011} x_3 x_4 + \beta_{0012} x_3 x_4^2 + \beta_{0020} x_3^2 + \beta_{0021} x_3^2 x_4 + \beta_{0030} x_3^3 + \beta_{0100} x_2 + \beta_{0101} x_2 x_4 + \beta_{0102} x_2 x_4^2 + \beta_{0110} x_2 x_3 + \beta_{0111} x_2 x_3 x_4 + \beta_{0120} x_2 x_3^2 + \beta_{0200} x_2^2 + \beta_{0201} x_2^2 x_4 + \beta_{0210} x_2^2 x_3 + \beta_{0300} x_2^3 + \beta_{1000} x_1 + \beta_{1001} x_1 x_4 + \beta_{1002} x_1 x_4^2 + \beta_{1010} x_1 x_3 + \beta_{1011} x_1 x_3 x_4 + \beta_{1020} x_1 x_3^2 + \beta_{1100} x_1 x_2 + \beta_{1101} x_1 x_2 x_4 + \beta_{1110} x_1 x_2 x_3 + \beta_{1200} x_1 x_2^2 + \beta_{2000} x_1^2 + \beta_{2001} x_1^2 x_4 + \beta_{2010} x_1^2 x_3 + \beta_{2100} x_1^2 x_2 + \beta_{3000} x_1^3 + \varepsilon $$ The script itself is d 0) (" x_1" %$% if (i1>1) ("^" %$% i1))) %$% (if (i2>0) (" x_2" %$% if (i2>1) ("^" %$% i2))) %$% (if (i3>0) (" x_3" %$% if (i3>1) ("^" %$% i3))) %$% (if (i4>0) (" x_4" %$% if (i4>1) ("^" %$% i4))) %$% " + " } } } } formula At last, notice that it generated no fourth degree terms, like $\beta_{1111} x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4$, since you required a third degree polynomial ($d=3$) with four variables ($p=4$).
