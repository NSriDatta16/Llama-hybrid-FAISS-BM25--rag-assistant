It depends on what kind of machine learning you are working with. Supervised machine learning models require labeled data in order to distinguish between various categories and detect patterns. They are often more popular due to the fact that they are often more successful than their unsupervised counterparts when labeled data is plentiful. Unsupervised models, on the other hand, require no labeled data at all. They just survey the data and determine similarities, which can be advantageous in certain circumstances where the amount of unlabelled data is large enough to give the model the resources it needs to learn effectively. Examples of these would be deep-belief networks, cluster analysis, and autoencoders. Semi-supervised models are a bit of a combination of the two and can learn from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data. The labeled data gives the network a basis on which to draw verifiable conclusions. Hope this helps.
