Since you are scaling down by a factor of 4, each 4x4 block of pixels in your original image will correspond to a single pixel in your output image. You can then loop through each 4x4 block in the original image and then reduce this to a single pixel. A simple way (perhaps not the best way) to do this reduction could be to take the average or median of the RGB components. You should note that you cannot do image scaling without losing image quality unless for all the blocks in the original image, each pixel is the exact same colour (which is unlikely).
