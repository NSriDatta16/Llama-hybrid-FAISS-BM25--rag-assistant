When I was in college, I took several courses that encouraged the adoption and use of Agile practices. They were mostly a mess and although I learned a lot of from them they generally weren't the things the professor was expecting us to learn. I do agile development professionally now and love it, but here are the things I wish that I had known when I was doing agile in school: Getting things squared with your schedule is really, really hard, which makes daily standups more important, not less. If you can't sit in the same room (very hard) then use Twitter or Yammer or just email. A lot of Agile's benefit is simply in getting you into a rhythm. That doesn't just mean weekly meetings; it means set goals, commitment to points, and weekly deliverables. This is tough to pull off in an academic context but should go a way towards helping you with your procrastination problem. It's tough to get used to pairing; everyone has their own computer and style of development. Try to hook a second keyboard/monitor/mouse up to your existing laptops if possible, or use screen sharing software, and standardize on an IDE. Pairing also really, really helps with procrastination but trying to do it without good tools is an awful lot of trouble. Don't skimp on unit testing, even if you think of it as a silly, academic, one-off project. I've done projects before that I figured were too small to bother with testing and it's never failed to come back and bite me on the ass. Sharepoint might be a bit heavyweight. Believe it or not, we still do an awful lot of things on whiteboards or with index cards. You may be your own customer but that doesn't mean you can't have stories (discrete, estimable features, basically) and goals. It's helpful to be able to visualize it: these features are planned, these are in development, these are ready for testing. If you'd like software recommendations I can give you those but I do recommend simple paper for a lot of the planning process.
