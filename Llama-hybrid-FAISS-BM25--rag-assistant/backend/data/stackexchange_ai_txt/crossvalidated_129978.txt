I am unclear if the units of interest are patients within hospitals or purely aggregated hospital data. The former seems a more natural structure for the data. The recording bias is probably not resolved by a percentage adjustment. If a person was definitely admitted to a hospital with an infection, some antibiotic would be given. If an admission occurred and no antibiotic was given, one hospital is certainly better than the other. A statistical test may not be required. Overall, measuring the association between hospital and use of any given antibiotic or aggregate classes of antibiotics requires adjustment for types of infections and identified organisms. I do not use R, so my comments below don't have the benefit of working with your provided data. If you would like to compare the number of antibiotics classes administered to a single patient, you should use poisson regression, as the use of an antibiotic is neither binary, nor rank-ordered. You could then regress the count of antibiotic classes used per patient using hospital as the variable of interest. Confounder adjustment could then be handled straightforwardly. Overall, I believe this would be the best approach and would make the best use of all data available. If you would like to assess the likelihood of a single class of antibiotic being used for any given patient by hospital, this would also be poisson data, as the denominator is not clearly defined (many different types of infections, allergies to antibiotics, etc) and the use of a particular antibiotic for any given case is not a Bernoulli trial.
