In the wonderful book Statistics as Principled Argument Robert Abelson notes that often, in statistics, it's not a question of what you "can" do but what you can defend sensibly. Technically, adding Likert scales is wrong - we don't know that the intervals between levels are equal, so they are only ordinal variables and we could just as well code them 1 2 4 8 12 or even 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 4000 as the more usual 1 2 3 4 5. But people add them all the time, because although we don't know that the intervals are equal, we can posit that they are and have sensible results. So, for your first question, think about whether it makes sense in your situation to say that a 1 in the first scale is like a 1 in the second, and so on. Certainly "never" = "never" but is "1 to 2 times" = "rarely"? Well, "rarely" is context driven; in your context, does it mean something like 1 to 2 times? (Think about the question you're asking.... "How often do planes crash?" vs. "How often are planes delayed?" the response "rarely" will mean different things! For your second question, you could take the average value per question (if adding the questions makes sense, taking their average should, as well).
