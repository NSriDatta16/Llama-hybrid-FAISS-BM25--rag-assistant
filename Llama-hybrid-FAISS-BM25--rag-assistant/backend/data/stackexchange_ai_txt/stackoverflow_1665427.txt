Generate C++ code for BNF grammar

I have looked at the following software tools: Ragel ANTLR BNF Converter Boost::Spirit Coco/R YACC ANTLR seems the most straight-forward, however its documentation is lacking. Ragel looks possible, too, but I do not see an easy way to convert BNF into its syntax. What other tools are available that can take BNF input and generate a corresponding, Unicode-friendly, cross-platform, standalone, C++ parser? Many thanks for all suggestions. Edit: Changed Objective-C requirement to C++.
