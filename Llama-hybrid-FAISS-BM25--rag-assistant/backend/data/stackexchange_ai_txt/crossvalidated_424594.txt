You should compare maximum entropy with maximum likelihood, not Multinomial Logistic Regression. The duality of maximum entropy and maximum likelihood is an example of the more general phenomenon of duality in constrained optimization. Berger, A. L., Pietra, V. J. D., & Pietra, S. A. D. (1996). A maximum entropy approach to natural language processing. Computational Linguistics , 22(1), 39â€“71.
