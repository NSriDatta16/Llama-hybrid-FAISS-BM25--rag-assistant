If it is possible to auto-format code before and after a source control commit, checkout, diff, etc. does a company really need a standard code style?

If it is possible to auto-format code before and after a source control commit, checkout, diff, etc. does a company really need a standard code style? It feels like standard coding style debates that have been raging since programming began like "put the bracket on the following line" or "properly indent your (" are no longer essential. I realize in languages where white space matters the diff will have to consider it but for languages where the style is a personal preference is there really a need to worry about it anymore?
