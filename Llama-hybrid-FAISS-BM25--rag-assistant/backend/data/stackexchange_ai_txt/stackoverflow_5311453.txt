Technically it is possible to do this by filtering packets in a manner similar to a firewall, but it is much harder to do and not as elegant. The biggest problem is that you have to reassemble HTTP responses into HTML documents and parse them yourself. Then you have to strip out the elements that display ads or popups, reassemble the HTTP response, and send it back out to the destination (e.g. the browser). If you are running in the browser you get the HTML document assembly for free and don't have to worry about network traffic at the packet level. Also, in the browser you can have UI elements (toolbar, configuration/statistics dialog, etc). We actually do ad filtering at the packet level in our current product; trust me - it sucks.
