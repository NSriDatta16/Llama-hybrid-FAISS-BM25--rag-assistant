MySQL queries testing WHERE clause search times

Recently I was pulled into the boss-man's office and told that one of my queries was slowing down the system. I then was told that it was because my WHERE clause began with 1 = 1 . In my script I was just appending each of the search terms to the query so I added the 1 = 1 so that I could just append AND before each search term. I was told that this is causing the query to do a full table scan before proceeding to narrow the results down. I decided to test this. We have a user table with around 14,000 records. The queries were ran five times each using both phpmyadmin and PuTTY. In phpmyadmin I limited the queries to 500 but in PuTTY there was no limit. I tried a few different basic queries and tried clocking the times on them. I found that the 1 = 1 seemed to cause the query to be faster than just a query with no WHERE clause at all. This is on a live database but it seemed the results were fairly consistent. I was hoping to post on here and see if someone could either break down the results for me or explain to me the logic for either side of this.
