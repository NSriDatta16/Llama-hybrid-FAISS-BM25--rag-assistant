How is training data generated

Very new to Machine learning process. I am curious as to how researchers, companies, academics get training data for their research. Do they pay some users to train data. If yes, how do they guarantee accuracy of it. Do graduate students (on PhD track) do it for their professor. (This is meant to be a joke)
