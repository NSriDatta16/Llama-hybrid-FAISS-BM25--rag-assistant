Irregular Time Series

Please consider the following code (in R) library(forecast) tt The results of the auto.arima function is puzzling ... There is a clear seasonality in the data (this is the balance of an account: every month a salary is cashed in and there is a spike in the value of the series, followed by a decrease until the next salary is received). I would like to forecast a couple of cycles, but the auto.arima forecast is nothing like I expect. Does anybody have any suggestions (also outside the auto.arima )? Any suggestion is welcome.
