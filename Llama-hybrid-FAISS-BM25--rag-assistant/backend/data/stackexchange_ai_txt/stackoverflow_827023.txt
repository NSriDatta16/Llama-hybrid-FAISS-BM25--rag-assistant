This happened to be an issue with RadInput for ASP.NET in one of my previous projects at some point. I got latest from the Telerik site and the exception was gone. Btw, I switched to the ASP.NET AJAX version of the control already and encourage you to try it out. It is more advanced and have RadInputManager as an addition to speed up the performance when having many textboxes on the page. Dick
