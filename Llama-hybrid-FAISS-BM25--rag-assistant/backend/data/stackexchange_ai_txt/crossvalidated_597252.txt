(Note: This is (meant as) a self-answer.) Update 1: Using https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/mathreg.htm , that is, the formulas $SE_R = \sqrt{1 - \bar{R}^2} \cdot \hat{\sigma}_y$ and $\bar{R}^2 = 1 - \frac{N-1}{N-k-1}(1 - R^2)$ I do arrive at $R^2 \approx 0.4491$ , but it seems to me that this result can be reached more easily (that is, without computing $\bar{R}^2$ ), but how? Update 2: Yes, indeed, there is. We already know that $SSR = 39.3601$ , so in order to compute $R^2$ using the simple formula $R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}$ we only have to determine $SST$ . We have that $\hat{\sigma}_y = 0.8861$ (average sample standard deviation (of the dependent variable)), so $MST = \hat{\sigma}_y^2 \approx 0.7852$ (average sample variance) and it then follows that $SST = 91 \cdot MST \approx 39.3601$ (total sample variance) and ultimately that $R^2 \approx 0.4491$ (which was the correct answer). Remaining question: Can the formula $SE_R = (1-R^2)\hat{\sigma}_y$ also be used to calculate $R^2$ ? If so, what goes wrong at $(*)$ ? Solution The correct formula is $\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{u},\color{red}{unbiased}} = (1-R^2)\hat{\sigma}_y$ . It is important to realize that $SE_R = \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{u},\color{red}{biased}}$ ! We can determine $\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{u},unbiased}$ by using the formula $SE_R = \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{u},unbiased} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{N-1}{N-k-1}}$ (i.e. by performing a bias correction), which yields $\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{u},unbiased} \approx 0.6577$ . Finally, using $\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{u},unbiased} = (1-R^2)\hat{\sigma}_y$ we find that $R^2 \approx 0.4491$ (which was the correct answer).
