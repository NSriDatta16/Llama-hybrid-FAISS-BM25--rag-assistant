Statistical method for modelling of disease incidence for NGO

I am trying to provide help to an NGO in the non-profit sector that is running a disease screening program: The program visits thousands of villages a year. A village has a population (on average around 800), with an unknown number of infected individuals. Each village is visited by the NGO for mass screening. For a given population in a given year: An infected person will attend the NGO screening and get cured with a probability of S (e.g. 50%) An infected person might independently self-diagnose himself, seek treatment and get cured in a health clinic outside the screening program with probability P (e.g. 10%) An infected person will infect another person per year with probability R (e.g. 50%) An infected person can live for 4 years. There might a fixed probability that a new infection will jump over from another village (J) These probabilities (S, P, R) will differ per village (within a estimated prior distribution), but are constant per village over time. The NGO has data going back 7 years for each village. The NGO would like to predict the number of infected people in the population for each village in year 8. I am trying to help the NGO, but have struggled to apply statistical learning to this problem, due to the stochastic nature and path-dependency. Most of my approaches try to fit a max. likelihood estimate to a forward projection of a starting population variable in year 0 with sampling of parameters from the prior distributions. I understand we are limited by the many hidden parameters and very limited data per village, but I feel there must be at least some predictive value in the data, but struggle to find the right approach. Hence â€“ I was wondering whether someone can give their perspectives on what is the best approach / are the best tools to perform predictive modelling on such a problem, and help me understand which might be possible in terms of predictive accuracy? Any tips, links or advice much appreciated;
