How to use UIView's contentStretch

I want to use an image of size 27x27 with the center 1 pixel stretchable as the backgroundImage of an UIButton. Here is my code: [button setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"button_image"] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; button.frame = CGRectMake(0.f, 0.f, 27.f, 27.f); button.contentStretch = CGRectMake(13.f/27.f, 13.f/27.f, 1.f/27.f, 1.f/27.f); [button setTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"long title", @"long title") forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [button sizeToFit]; CGRect buttonFrame = button.frame; buttonFrame.size.width += 18.f * 2; button.frame = buttonFrame; But the result is no different from that without setting contentStretch at all. So how to correctly use contentStretch to achieve what I want? Please don't tell me again and again that I can achieve the same effect with stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight: . I know that and it's apparently not what I'm asking for. I just want to know how to properly use contentStretch . Thanks.
