K-fold validation for logistic regression in R with small sample size

I used SPSS to develop a logistic regression model from 274 cases. The final model uses 6 independent variables to predict a binary dependent variable with an event rate of 18%. The model is purely descriptive and has not been validated internally or externally. I am learning R and want to re-develop the model in R. I am interested in validating the model using either K-fold or leave-n-out cross-validation. What are the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches for my model / dataset? Is it valid to use these methods with a small sample size like mine?
