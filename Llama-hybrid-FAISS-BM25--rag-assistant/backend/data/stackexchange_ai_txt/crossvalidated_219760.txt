My answer is mostly more questions: Correlations based on very small samples are naturally not very trustworthy. In particular, a Spearman correlation of 1 could just mean that your sample is not large enough to catch the uncertainty in the data. If it makes sense to average the correlations, why not pool the data and calculate an overall correlation? Why do you think you need an average correlation any way? Why not just report a distribution of correlations?
