Unfortunately, It appears that Qt does not support getting icons for a specific theme. There are ways to do this for both KDE and Gnome. The KDE way is quite elegant, which makes sense considering that Qt is KDE's toolkit. Instead of using the PyQt4.QtGui class QIcon, you instead use the PyKDE4.kdeui class KIcon. An example of this is: from PyKDE4.kdeui import * icon = KIcon("*The Icon Name*") see the PyKDE documentation for this class, here . One way to gain support for this for gnome is to use the python gtk package. It is not as nice as the kde way, but it works none the less. It can be used like this: from PyQt4 import QtGui from gtk import icon_theme_get_default iconTheme = icon_theme_get_default() iconInfo = iconTheme.lookup_icon("*The Icon Name*", *Int of the icon size*, 0) icon = QtGui.QIcon(iconInfo.get_filename()) See the documentation for the Icon Theme class and Icon Info class . EDIT: thanks for the correction CesarB
