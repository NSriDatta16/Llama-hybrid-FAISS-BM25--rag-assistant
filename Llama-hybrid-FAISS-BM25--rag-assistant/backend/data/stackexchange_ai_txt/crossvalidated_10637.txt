Merely computing the covariance matrix--which you're going to need to get started in any event--is $O((Nf)^2)$ so, asymptotically in $N$ , nothing is gained by choosing a $O(Nf)$ algorithm for the whitening. There are approximations when the variables have additional structure, such as when they form a time series or realizations of a spatial stochastic process at various locations. These effectively rely on assumptions that let us relate the covariance between one pair of variables to that between other pairs of variables, such as between pairs separated by the same time lags. This is the conventional reason for assuming a process is stationary or intrinsically stationary , for instance. Calculations can be $O(Nf\,\log(Nf)$ in such cases ( e.g. , using the Fast Fourier Transform as in Yao & Journel 1998 ). Absent such a model, I don't see how you can avoid computing all pairwise covariances.
