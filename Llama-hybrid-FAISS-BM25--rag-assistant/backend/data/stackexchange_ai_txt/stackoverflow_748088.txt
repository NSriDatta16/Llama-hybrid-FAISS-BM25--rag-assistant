I think, the transition between states should be in the class. For Example, when you perform some kind of action in the order, the order knows how to move to other state. For Example: public void setPaid(int amount) { //Code to pay. this.State = new PaidState(); //State implements the IState Interface } Other alternative could be to create a new Class for Example Transformer that implements a method like this. public class Transformer { public static void setState(Order o, IState s) { //Change the State. } } Or yoy can use an Enum to set the States there: public class Transformer { public static void setState(Order o, StatesEnum s) { //Change the State. } } But I recomend the class to manipulate its own state. But remember the complexity you will have on the other hand. Best Regards!
