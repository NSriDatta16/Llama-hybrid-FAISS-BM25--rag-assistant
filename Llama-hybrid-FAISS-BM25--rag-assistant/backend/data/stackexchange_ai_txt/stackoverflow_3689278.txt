I'm not a MongoDB expert, but 1000 isn't "huge". Also I would seriously doubt any difference between 1 top-level document containing 4000 total subelements, and 4 top-level documents each containing 1000 subelements -- one of those six-of-one vs. half-dozen-of-another issues. Now if you were talking 1 document with 1,000,000 elements vs. 1000 documents each with 1000 elements, that's a different order of magnitude + there might be advantages of one vs. the other, either/both in storage time or query time.
