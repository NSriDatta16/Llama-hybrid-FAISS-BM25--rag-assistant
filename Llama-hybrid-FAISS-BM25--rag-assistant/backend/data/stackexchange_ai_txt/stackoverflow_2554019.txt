You can remove it as long as you put the data next to the map on your page. From Google's Permissions page: http://www.google.com/permissions/geoguidelines.html All uses of Google Maps and Google Earth and Content MUST provide attribution to Google and our suppliers. In no circumstance do we approve of any use of Content without proper attribution. Requests for exceptions will not be answered. Attribution is the line(s) shown on the bottom of the Content in the products along with copyright notices, such as "© 2009 Google, Map Data © 2009 Tele Atlas." (The exact text of the attribution changes based on geography and Content type.) The attribution text must be legible to the average viewer or reader. The automatically-generated Google logo and attribution text may only be removed or obstructed if reintroduced in a visible form elsewhere within the Content. In print use, if for some reason attribution cannot be placed within the Content, separate attribution text must be provided directly adjacent to the Content. In video, attribution must appear on-screen for the entire duration the Content is displayed; we cannot approve requests to move attribution to end credits. Below is a demonstration on where to find attribution in Earth and Maps.
