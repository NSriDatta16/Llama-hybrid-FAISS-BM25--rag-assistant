For Bayesian analysis (including imprecise analysis), I'm going to put in big plugs for: Bernardo, J.M. and Smith, A.F.M. (2000) Bayesian Theory . Wiley: Chichester. Gelman, A. et al (2013) Bayesian Data Analysis (Third Edition) . CRC Press: Boca Raton. Walley, P. (1990) Statistical Reasoning with Imprecise Probabilities . Chapman and Hall. That last book, by the brilliant Peter Walley, is an eye-opener on different ways of doing sensitivity analysis, and the fact that this can be built into probability theory at an axiomatic level.
