webclient headers class

I am using the WebClient class with cookies as mentioned here: Using CookieContainer with WebClient class What steps are required to add a custom user agent to every request made by this WebClient? I tried to put the Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent, "...") line into protected override WebRequest GetWebRequest but that did not work: "This header must be modified using the appropriate property".
