Diebold-Mariano test for evaluating 40 different forecast horizons

I have a question about the Diebold-Mariano test. I have different forecasting horizons (n-ahead = 1 to 40) and different forecasting origins (26). I.e. I employ a rolling origin evaluation approach. I want to compare the forecasting results of two empirical models. Now, should I: Compare all n-ahead=1 forecasting errors for the two models, set h=1, and perform the test. Then, I would do the same for n-ahead=2 forecasts, but set h=2, and so on. Alternatively, is it more common to compare the average errors over all forecasting origins? However, this would result in information loss, wouldn't it?
