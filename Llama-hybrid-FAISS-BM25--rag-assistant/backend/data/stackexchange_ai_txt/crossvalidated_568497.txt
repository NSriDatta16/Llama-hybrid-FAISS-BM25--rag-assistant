Disease Control Rate for a Clinical Trial problem

Recently, I have come across a 2-armed clinical trial problem which attempts to find a "Disease Control Rate" (DCR) for patients in the treatement and placebo arms. On the Internet I found DCR to be defined as follows: "Disease Control Rate is defined as the percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents". Although, I am completely fine with the definition, I am having problems on how to interpret the DCR mathematically. Say, I have two groups of cancer patients, one receiving treatement and one placebo. Say, intially during treatment, they have abnormal CA-125 levels. So, should my DCR be the percentage of patients who experienced stable CA-125? Is there any time limit which I should be considering for acquring this complete or partial response ? Any article or book which describes the calculation of real time DCR will be very helpful. Please help me with this.
