What is the best way to organize WPF styles and ResourceDictionaries in a large project?

I have a large WPF application that uses a large number of styles, brushes, and theming. Managing the large number of styles with multiple developers is becoming difficult. Right now, most of our application-wide styles are in one resource dictionary and the theming brushes are each in their own resource dictionary. The issue is that finding the style that we want to use is difficult because the main resource dictionary has gotten so large. Any recommendations on the best way to reorganize this? I've considered breaking it into separate resource dictionaries for the type of control the style is for. Such as a ButtonStyles.xaml dictionary, but I'm not sure if that is the right way to go. If anyone has any suggestions on how they organize their large resource dictionaries I'd appreciate it.
