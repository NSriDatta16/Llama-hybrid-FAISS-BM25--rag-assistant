Logistic regression: class probabilities

I am using logistic regression to solve the classification problem. g = glm(target ~ ., data=trainData, family = binomial("logit")) There are two classes (target): 0 and 1 When I run the prediction function, it returns probabilities. p = predict(g, testData, type = "response") However, it is not clear to me how to understand which class has been assigned? Real p 1 0.17568578 1 0.41698474 1 0.19151927 1 0.25587242 1 0.25604452 0 0.39976069 0 0.39910282 0 0.16879320 I appreciate if someone can explain me how this works based on the above example. Thanks
