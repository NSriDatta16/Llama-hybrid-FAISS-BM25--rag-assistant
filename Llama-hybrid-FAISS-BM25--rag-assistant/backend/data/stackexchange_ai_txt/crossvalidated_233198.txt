Rejection sampling + bootstrap

Suppose I want to draw $S_q$ samples from measure $q$, and that I already have available $S_p$ samples from a distribution $p$. For a given constant $M$, I could use rejection sampling by drawing $S_p$ iid random variables $U[0, 1]$ and then accepting if the usual condition holds $$ \text{Accept if: } u_s , \> \forall s=1,...,S_p $$ This procedure would get me, on average, about $\frac{S_p}{M}$. I could improve this marginally by choosing $$ M^* = \max_{s=1,...,S_p} \frac{q(x_s)}{p(x_s)} $$ Hence, the largest sample from $q$ I could get would be around $\frac{S_p}{M^*}$, which still could be much lower than the desired $S_q$. Enter the bootstrap. I was wondering if the above procedure could be modified like this: $s \leftarrow 0$ $S = \{\}$ While $s Draw $u\sim U[0,1]$ Draw with replacement a random $x_t$ from the $p$ samples. If $u Accept: $S \leftarrow S \cup\{x_t\}$ $s \leftarrow s + 1$ So my question is: would this procedure give me "good" samples from $q$?
