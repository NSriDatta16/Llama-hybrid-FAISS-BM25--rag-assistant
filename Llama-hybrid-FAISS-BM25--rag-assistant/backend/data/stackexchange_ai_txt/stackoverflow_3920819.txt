I would not recommend using an ini-formatted file like you've posted. I think you have two general options: * Use a database, such as sqlite as @ghostdog74 suggests * Use a flat file using a common, easily-parsable data structure For flat file, XML or JSON is probably the best bet. There are built-in parsers to both in most languages now. JSON is a bit more efficient, but XML is a bit more readable and structured. The downside to this of course is that you basically have to parse/read the entire file in order to do a lookup. The upside is it should be a trivial amount of code. You are talking about creating your own indexes, effectively, so you can easily lookup by ZIP or metar, etc. I'd suggest it's unnecessary. If you REALLY wanted to, you could use a hash-table in memory to store references to the objects, but unless you're reading the file once and then doing multiple lookups, the overhead of building the hashtables will likely be way more than just looping through to find what you need. I get the impression this is a web app where you read the file, do one or two lookups, and spit out a web page. If your data is at the point where the act of looping through all records is causing a noticeable performance impact, then you're into the territory where you should be using a real database, such as sqlite, mysql, postgresql, etc. Anything less, and you'll just be re-inventing what they've already done with indexing and file storage in a not-as-good way.
