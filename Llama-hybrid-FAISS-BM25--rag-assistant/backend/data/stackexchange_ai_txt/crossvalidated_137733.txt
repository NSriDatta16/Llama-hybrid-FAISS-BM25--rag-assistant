You only have 8 features in your data, it is not so many. The simplest approach is to conduct 8 ANOVAs, one for each feature, and correct for multiple comparisons with e.g. Bonferroni or Holm-Bonferroni correction. If you had 8000 features, then this would probably result in no feature being significant, and one would need to think about more suitable approaches, but with 8 features you can safely start with simple ANOVAs. Crucially, your PCA analysis can not be considered as a way out of the multiple comparisons problem. If you had decided to test your 8000Hz feature a priori , then you would not have needed to use a Bonferroni correction. But if you look at the PCA plots first, it is by definition not a priori anymore. You looked at the features and tried to select the "best" one; whether you did it with PCA or with conducting all possible ANOVAs is immaterial -- you have already run into the multiple comparisons territory.
