Asymptotic distribution of a recursive statistic

I have a (time series related) test statistic which is asymptotically normal. I would like to know what is the asymptotic distribution of its maximal value obtained by a recursive estimation. For example, lets say that I am estimating $$y_t=\beta x_t+\varepsilon_t,\quad t=1,\dots,T$$, and that I use the t-test for testing the null of $\beta=0$, i.e., $$\tau=\hat{\beta}/\text{SE}(\hat{\beta})$$. If I know that $\tau\xrightarrow{d}N(0,1)$, how does the maximum of the recursive version of this statistic behaves asymptotically? i.e., $$\tau_{\text{max}}=\max\limits_{t\in[t_0,T]}\{\tau^{t_0}_t\}\xrightarrow{d}? $$ where $t_0$ is the number of observations in the minimum window size and $\tau^{t_0}_t$ is the $\tau$-statistic calculated for the sample period $[t_0,t]$.
