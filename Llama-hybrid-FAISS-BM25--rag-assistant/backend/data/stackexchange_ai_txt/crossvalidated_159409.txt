Because of the no free lunch theorems , there is no definite answer to your question. It depends on your data, more specifically how its structure happens to align with the implicit assumptions made by various learning methods. In reality, the only way to know which method works best is to try them all (and properly optimize hyperparameters of every method to ensure a fair comparison!). That said, you are primarily interested in a high precision model. Most general purpose methods (RF, neural networks, SVM, ...) allow you to specify misclassification costs per class in some way. To get a high precision classifier, use a very large penalty on misclassification of negatives and you will get a very conservative model (= that is one that yields very few positives, but with high precision). Finally, make sure you inspect ROC curves to decide on an appropriate cutoff per model, rather than basing your evaluation on the (somewhat arbitrary) default cutoff that is used within your models.
