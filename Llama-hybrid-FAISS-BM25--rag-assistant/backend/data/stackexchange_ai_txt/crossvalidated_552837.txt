Finding Correlations between 2 Multivariate data sets

I have two data sets, and both are MultiVariate datasets The first dataset has a format as below, with the first column being the country of origin (only two countries, so binary classifier) of a group of test subjects. Column 2 is an ID to a audio file, and the other variables (V1:V30) are average responses of test subjects opinions on emotions heard in the audio file (V1=angry, V2=sad,...). Because these are averages, the sum V1:V30 =1: country fileID V1 V2 V3 ... V30 0 0001.mp3 0.1 0.5 0.0 ... 0.01 0 0002.mp3 0.3 0.6 0.0 ... 0.00 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 0 2519.mp3 0.3 0.6 0.0 ... 0.00 1 0001.mp3 0.9 0.00 0.0 ... 0.01 1 0002.mp3 0.1 0.7 0.0 ... 0.00 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 2519.mp3 0.3 0.6 0.0 ... 0.00 The second data set has exactly the same first two columns as the first data set, but different variables that are on a different scale (ratings from 1-9) country fileID V31 V322 V33 ... V53 0 0001.mp3 5.6 4.7 3.3 ... 7.8 0 0002.mp3 4.3 3.5 6.2 ... 4.2 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 0 2519.mp3 3.5 5.2 4.4 ... 6.8 1 0001.mp3 4.5 7.2 6.7 ... 4.3 1 0002.mp3 5.8 4.1 3.8 ... 8.2 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 2519.mp3 6.6 4.4 3.3 ... 2.2 The analysis that I am supposed to achieve is to find if there is a way to use 2nd data set (with variables on scale 1-9) to predict the emotion from the first dataset via some kind of correlation between the variables in the first and second datasets. This is for an introductory multivariate course, and the professor has only introduced factor analysis, PCA, and Linear Discriminant Analysis as methods of analysis. No logistic regression yet I am having a lot of trouble using the methods that have been introduced. Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality do not run in R, because the data set is too large. Corrleation matrices find nothing above .02, and factor analysis only finds p-values of 0 I would really appreciate some guidance on how to approach and conduct this analysis
