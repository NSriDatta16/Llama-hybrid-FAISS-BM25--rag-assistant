I am not sure the exhaustive search would work given the # of variables you have: Even at N=3 you have ~2e8 combinations and so iterating over all the cases looks quite difficult. Besides how would you be able to tell which N to use? A more feasible way may be to go through the variable selection processes. You can find numerous discussions online. For example, start with your 1100 columns and investigate their relationships. Some of them may be quite similar and you can find this out by using PCA. Next you can check how they are related to your target variables by looking at their IV or R2 etc. There are also some automatic variable selection algorithms like step-wise although their uses are often criticized.
