How does the ρ parameter work in this customized SVM?

The article ( https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6691771 ) uses a customized support vector machine with the following loss function: I recognize the slack variable ξ together with hyperparameter C which controls the amount of slack that is allowed. I can imagine that with smaller C , you allow more slack and therefore you can sacrifice a few instances in order to find a wider margin with more support vectors. But how does the ρ work? The article mentions ρ controls the number of support vectors which in turn changes the number of positive predicted instances. But I don't understand why this works. Could someone please explain this to me?
