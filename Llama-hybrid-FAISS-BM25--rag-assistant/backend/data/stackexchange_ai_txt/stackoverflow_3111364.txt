How is 'House Blend, Mocha, Mocha' printed when there is no explicit state saved? You are creating 3 distinct objects. Let us call them a, b and c. So we can rewrite the code to look like this: Beverage a = new HouseBlend(); Beverage b = new Mocha(a); Beverage c = new Mocha(b); System.out.println(c.getDescription() + " * "+c.cost()); which will do the same thing as your code but it is clearer that you are dealing with 3 different objects. Assigning blend = new Mocha(blend); does not replace the object but actually creates a new object and simply modifies the reference blend to the new object. When you call blend.getDescription() in your code you are referring to object c, which calls getDescription of object b which calls getDescription of object a. The getDescription() of object a returns the String "House Blend". So, getDescription() of object b returns "House Blend, Mocha". And getDescription() of object c then returns "House Blend, Mocha, Mocha". A very similar thing happens to getCost().
