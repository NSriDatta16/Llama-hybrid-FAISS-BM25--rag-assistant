This answer by @KeremT is correct. I provide an example for those who still have problems with the exact implementation. weight parameter in XGBoost is per instance not per class. Therefore, we need to assign the weight of each class to its instances, which is the same thing. For example, if we have three imbalanced classes with ratios class A = 10% class B = 30% class C = 60% Their weights would be (dividing the smallest class by others) class A = 1.000 class B = 0.333 class C = 0.167 Then, if training data is index class 0 A 1 A 2 B 3 C 4 B we build the weight vector as follows: index class weight 0 A 1.000 1 A 1.000 2 B 0.333 3 C 0.167 4 B 0.333
