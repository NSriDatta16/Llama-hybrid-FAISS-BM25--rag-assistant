Preventing sqlplus truncation of column names, without individual column formatting

By default sqlplus truncates column names to the length of the underlying data type. Many of the column names in our database are prefixed by the table name, and therefore look identical when truncated. I need to specify select * queries to remote DBAs in a locked down production environment, and drag back spooled results for diagnosis. There are too many columns to specify individual column formatting. Does sqlplus offer any option to uniformly defeat column name truncation? (I am using SET MARKUP HTML ON, though I could use some other modality, csv, etc. as long as it yields unabbreviated output.)
