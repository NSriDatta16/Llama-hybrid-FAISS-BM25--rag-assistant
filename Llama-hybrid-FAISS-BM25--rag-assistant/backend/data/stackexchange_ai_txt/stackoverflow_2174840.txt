How can I prevent dragged items to be drawn during a drag and drop operation in Qt?

When draggin items from a QListView, the dragged items are drawn along with the mouse cursor and drop indicator. How can I prevent this behavior and just get the drop indicator? I am dragging from huge list items into small targets, and this makes things pretty difficult to target as the drop area is hidden by the huge dragged items.
