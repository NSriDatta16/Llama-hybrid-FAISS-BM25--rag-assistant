I would initially just focus on the response variable and consider an ensemble forecast where you weight the predictions from a few models (can just simply average them for lack of anything better). Using a few models will help prevent any single model from causing a large miss in your forecast. Some of the models worth considering might be: seasonal arima seasonal holt winters exponential smoothing triple exponential smoothing some form of naive forecast (perhaps last year's quarterly value) There's some nice discussion on ensemble approaches at the following link: Ensemble Time Series Models
