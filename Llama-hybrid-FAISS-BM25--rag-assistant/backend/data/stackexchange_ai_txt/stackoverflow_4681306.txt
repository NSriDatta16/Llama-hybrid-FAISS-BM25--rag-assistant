Saving Dragged Dropped items position on postback in asp.net

Ok I saw many posts on how to serialize the value of dragged items to get hash and they tell how to save them. Now the question is how do I persist the dragged items the next time when user log's in using the has value that I got eg: which on serialize will give "id[]=1&id[]=2&id[]=3&id[]=4" Now think that I saved it to Sql server database in a single field called SortOrder. Now how do I get the items to these order again ? the code to make these sort is below, without which people didn't know which library I had used to sort and serialize $(document).ready(function() { $(".list li").css("cursor", "move"); $(".list").sortable(); });
