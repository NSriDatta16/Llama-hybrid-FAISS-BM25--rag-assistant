How to conduct a factor analysis on questionnaire data based on 30 items in three blocks?

I have a questionnaire with 30 questions divided into 3 blocks of 10 questions each. Each question is answered with a number 1 to 10 and then an average of them all is calculated. I need to know how much each block has contributed to the final score (and if possible - how much each question has contributed). How do I do this? I have access to R.
