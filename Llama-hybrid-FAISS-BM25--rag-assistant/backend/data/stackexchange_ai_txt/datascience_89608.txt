Best strategy for extracting specific structured data from unstructured sentences

Given a list of sentences like this: 4 to 5 hours over a period of 16 weeks 1st session: 2.0-2.5 hours & 2nd session: 1.5-2.0 hours Approximately 5-6 visits over the course of 5 months. Visit 1, 3, 5: about 1.5 hours. Visit 2, 4: short 15 visits over a period of approximately 74 weeks. You will come to the organization about 12 times, over a period of a little more than three years. Each visit will take from 3-6 hours. What tools/strategy should I use if I want to let the model spit out the following data for the above sentences: Number of sessions Total duration(h) Total timespan(w) Unknown 4-5 16 2 3.5-4.5 Unknown 5-6 4.5 20 15 Unknown 74 12 36-72 156 I'm a ML beginner and wondered if this is achievable with Tensorflow or GPT? For further learning on my own: what is the specific terminology I should google for? Is this NER, text extraction or more like text classification?
