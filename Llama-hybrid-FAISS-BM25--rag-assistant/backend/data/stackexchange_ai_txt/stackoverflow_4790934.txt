How large are the files you transferred? It sounds like the majority of these are under the default 61140 byte limit for inline storage so get stored in varbinary(max) columns in the internal tables rather than the Filestream column. This RBS blog post has a detailed explanation of these values. We’ve done a lot of performance testing to make sure they’re optimized for the Filestream feature, but if you have a specific need to offload storage of these docs to Filestream it's possible to change these values for any new inserted blobs. You can see the current values of these configuration values (max_size_inline_blob, max_size_inband_write and max_size_inband_read) in the mssqlrbs.rbs_blob_stores view in your content database.
