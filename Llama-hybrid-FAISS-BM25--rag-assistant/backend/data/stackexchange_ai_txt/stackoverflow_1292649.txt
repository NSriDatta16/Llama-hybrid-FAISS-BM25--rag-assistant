Technical issue surrounding asking for credit card BEFORE address?

I'm considering asking for credit card details BEFORE an address for a physical product with average purchase price between $10-$50 What might be the technical (or non technical) issues surrounding doing this? What comes to mind is : This seems a little non-standard from the users perspective We cant do address verification if we find we're having issues with fraud (not an issue so far) Users may be more likely to complete the sale since they've committed to their most important piece of information first By asking for zipcode we can populate city/state when we do ask for the address Are there any dealbreakers i'm missing or things I'm not considering? I'm trying to make the system as flexible as possible, but would prefer to getit right first time without barking up the wrong tree.
