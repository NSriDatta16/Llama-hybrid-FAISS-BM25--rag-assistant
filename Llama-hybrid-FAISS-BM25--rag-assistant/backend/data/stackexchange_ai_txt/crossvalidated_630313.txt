meta-analysis of prognostic factor for models with different parameters

I am trying to meta-analysis the OR of a variable (troponin) for a dichotomous outcome (mortality). There are several multivariate logistic regressions out there, but none of them share the exact same set independent variables (some of the models present Individual Patient Data, most of them just Aggregate Data). Are you aware of any validated method that would allow me to do this meta-analysis, what would you do?
