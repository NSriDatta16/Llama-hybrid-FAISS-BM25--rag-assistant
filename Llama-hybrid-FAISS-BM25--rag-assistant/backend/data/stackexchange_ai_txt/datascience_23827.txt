'Clustering different ethnic groups for visualization' seems more like you are trying to do supervised dimensionality reduction since you already know the target variables in this case. Since you will be using it for classification later, I assume you already know the number of ethnic groups. This can be done using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
