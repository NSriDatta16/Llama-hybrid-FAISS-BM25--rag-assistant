How to group databases in folders in SQL Server Management Studio?

My question comes from the frustration that I have every time I launch SSMS. We have few hundred of different databases in one server instance, from different projects and customers, and having them in one long flat tree view just does not feel very ergonomic to me. Is there any smart way to keep them more organized? I thought, that for example being able to group them in custom folders would be a nice solutions, but AFAIK SSMS does not support it. Being able to group stored procedures in a similar way would be a nice added value, but I'd be more than happy with being able to group databases only.
