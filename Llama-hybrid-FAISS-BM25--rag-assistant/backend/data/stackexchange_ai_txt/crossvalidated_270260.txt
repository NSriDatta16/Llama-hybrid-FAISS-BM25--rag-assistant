I haven't read the book, but maybe the distinction here is that the batter's empirical average is a point estimate, but the beta distribution gives an entire distribution of possible probabilities for getting a hit. In your example, you chose to use the mean of the beta distribution as the point estimate, but you could have just as easily used some other estimator; the mode of the posterior beta distribution perhaps. From this perspective, the question "On what basis do we know that this approximation is good/valid?" becomes a question of decision theory. Namely, how do we choose the best point estimate given the posterior distribution of hit probabilities? The answer will depend on the loss function specified. For example, if you were playing guess the batting average using price-is-right rules, that is, if you guessed a value too high you get nothing; then intuitively you should guess a lower batting average than if you are just trying to get as close as you possibly can to the probability of getting a hit. The posterior mean is the best decision under squared error loss in the decision theoretic sense. So if your loss function is actually squared error loss, then on this basis the approximation is valid. Finally, you may have noticed that if you use an improper prior with $\alpha_0=\beta_0=0$ then the batter's empirical average exactly matches the mean of the posterior. One could argue that in some sense this reflects the fact that if you have little prior information, a good guess at the batter's probability of getting a hit is the current empirical average.
