We asked ourselves the same question several months ago (just before Drupal 6 was finalized & released) Our office has limited development resources, and we had released a couple of D5 sites, and a D5 sales app. We went with Drupal 6. The decision came after considering the core of what we were interacting with. CCK & Views are the only die-hard critical components for anything besides a default Drupal install, and the level of participation and vitality of the projects was very encouraging. The stuff that really, really matters, has been/is being ported over to D6, and the wow, this would be nice , p2 stuff is hit & miss. If you're doing any module development, D6 is a winner. If you're already very comfortable with D5, then stick with it. I hope this helps.
