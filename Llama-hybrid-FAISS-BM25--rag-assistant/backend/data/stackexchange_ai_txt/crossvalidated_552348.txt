Time steps in RNN and LSTM

I am quite new to recurrent neural networks and how to use them for sequence classification. I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on how RNNs (specifically LSTMs) capture time. That is, can LSTMs be used for classification on multivariate trajectories evolving in continuous time? For example, a Markov Chain approach is not an explicit modelling of time and thus one needs to consider some additional feature for this. So for RNNs, does time also have to be captured via features somehow?
