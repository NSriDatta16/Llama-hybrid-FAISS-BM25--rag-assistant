Caret package have incorporated xgboost. cv.ctrl Sample output eXtreme Gradient Boosting 32218 samples 41 predictor 2 classes: 'N', 'Y' No pre-processing Resampling: Cross-Validated (3 fold, repeated 1 times) Summary of sample sizes: 21479, 21479, 21478 Resampling results Accuracy Kappa Accuracy SD Kappa SD 0.9324911 0.1094426 0.0009742774 0.008972911 One drawback i see is that other parameters of xgboost like subsample etc are not supported by caret currently. Edit Gamma, colsample_bytree, min_child_weight and subsample etc can now (June 2017) be tuned directly using Caret. Just add them in the grid portion of the above code to make it work. Thanks usÎµr11852 for highliting it in the comment.
