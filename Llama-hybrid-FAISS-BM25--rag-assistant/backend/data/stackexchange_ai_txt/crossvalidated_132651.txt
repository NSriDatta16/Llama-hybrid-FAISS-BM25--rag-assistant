Selection bias and reliability

I need a bit of help with interpretation of classification results. I have unbalanced data set (80% = 0 20% = 1), fitting classifiers (SVM, GradientBoosting or kNN) on such data does not yield good results (even using weighting). I mean accuracy is very good but minority class is mostly misclassified - as should be expected. So I decided to balance train data using undersampling (number of samples is sufficient to do so). This way I introduce selection bias and I get good classification results on test data (not balanced). Can I assume that those results are reliable ?
