Your description could be clearer but it sounds like you're looking to adjust for the fact that the distribution of some relevant covariates (like age) may differ across the two groups (A/B), where you want to compare proportions. If I understand the situation correctly you'd typically use something like logistic regression to deal with that. Many posts on site discuss logistic regression*, a few discuss the Bayesian version. You might start with a site search, for example. *(as does Wikipedia and numerous other places on the internet, as well as a great many books)
