Adding not chosen alternatives as data to logistic regression model

I am interested in predicting shopping behaviour in a shopping center. I have a database with the chosen alternatives (shop) and variables describing that alternative (like type and size) and the individual which made the choice (sex, age). What I would like to get is the influcence of these variables on the behaviour. My question: Would it be possible to append for each chosen shop the not chosen alternatives and calculate the binomial logistic model? As an example: | person.id | shop.id | chosen | type | size | sex | age | | 1 | A | yes | fashion | 3 | m | 21 | | 1 | B | no | grocery | 5 | m | 21 | | 1 | C | no | fashion | 1 | m | 21 | | 2 | B | yes | grocery | 5 | f | 45 | | 2 | A | no | fashion | 3 | f | 45 | | 2 | C | no | fasion | 1 | f | 45 | I was first thinking about the multinomial logistic regression but I am actually only interested in the variable chosen which is dichotomous (yes/no).
