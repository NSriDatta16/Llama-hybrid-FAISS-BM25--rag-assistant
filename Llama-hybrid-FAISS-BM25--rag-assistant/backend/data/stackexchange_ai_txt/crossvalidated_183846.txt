How to implement a linear and a logistic regression in a single SEM model using R?

I created a SEM model in R (lavaan package), but one of my dependent variables is continuous, while the other is binary. The model is as follows: modelx z and w are covariates. x is a scale (0-12), however y is a binary variable (0;1). Thus, the question is, how can I implement a linear regression for predicting x and a logistic regression for y in a single SEM model? I assume that lavaan doesn't automatically account for the different dependent variables. If it does, I would like to see a reference for that. All ideas are welcome. Edit: Using the latent variable factor scores from the measurement model for a, b, c in a glm (binomial reg for y and linear for x) and lavaan, the results are more closely aligned for x than for y. Does it mean that lavaan ignores/doesn't do good with the dichotomous variable in this particular case, or my question from the start is moot or unnecessary?
