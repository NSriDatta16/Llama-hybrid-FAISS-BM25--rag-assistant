JQuery drag bug on chrome

Jquery drag doesn't seem to behave correctly when chrome zoom is not at 100%. On this jquery drag demo , if you set the chrome zoom (ctrl + mousewheel up) to > 100%, on the first drag the box will stay within it's containment, but if you try to drag it out the second time it will actually break out of the containment area. Anyone know a fix for this?
