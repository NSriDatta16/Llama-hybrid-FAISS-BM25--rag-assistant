By using Javascript try alert(navigator.userAgent)); However I am not sure if, it is cross browser. Better way would be to use server side languages. By using PHP, you can do this. Both, Javascript and PHP outputs something like this Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 You can detect the OS using this output as Windows NT 6.1 is Windows 7
