This first paragraph has been corrected So assuming everything is known, and that $\lambda_d\gg\lambda_P$, the threshold where you should cut off between assuming $X=1$ and $X=0$ is roughly given by the solution of $pe^{-\lambda_d T}=(1-p)\lambda_P T$. The left side is the probability that a $d_i$ that is a $D$ value lies above the threshold; and the right side is the probability that a $d_i$ that is a $P$ value lies below the threshold. When I computed the threshold for your parameter values, I got a threshold of 33. I will assume that $mp$ and $m(1-p)$ are large. Given the very large ratio between $\lambda_P$ and $\lambda_d$, it is quite wasteful to use the mean as the cutoff (it gives too many false $X=1$'s when the $P_i$ happen to be somewhat small relative to $1/\lambda_P$). Probably quite a good way to locate the cutoff in practice is to sort the $d_i$'s into order and look at the gaps. In the $\lambda_D$ part of the distribution, these should be something like $1/(mp\lambda_d)$, whereas in the $\lambda_P$ part of the distribution, they should be much bigger, around $1/(m(1-p)\lambda_P)$. I would try to find a way to guess where the gaps change; and then maybe double the threshold to be safe (you get very few false $D$'s this way and double the number of false $P$'s), but this number is something like 0.1% for your parameter range.
