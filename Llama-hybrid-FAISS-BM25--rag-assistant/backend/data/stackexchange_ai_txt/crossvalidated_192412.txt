When you say that you don't have any threshold, do you mean that you only get predicted class labels, but not classification scores? Without scores, you cannot compute a ROC curve. If you do get scores, take a look at the perfcurve function in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. The doc for the perfcurve function shows other evaluation measures.
