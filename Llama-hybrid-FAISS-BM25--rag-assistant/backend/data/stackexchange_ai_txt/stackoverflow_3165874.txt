Can we drop a file in windows explorer from WPF window?

I have a treeview that shows the current file system. I want to add functionality to enable dropping files into windows explorer. If I drag any of the node of my treeview and drop it on any of the window of Windows explorer then the file will be copied to that location. How can I accomplish this?
