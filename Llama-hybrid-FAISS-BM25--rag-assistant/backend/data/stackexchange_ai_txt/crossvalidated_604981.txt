The documentation is not very clear, but it does indicate that gamma is only used with method = "exact" and conditioned = FALSE , and then it only influences the estimated SD of the accumulation curve. I'll improve the documentation. If you want to get an estimate of extrapolated species richness, you should use specific tools for that, such as vegan::specpool (and there are other packages). However, vegan::specaccum cannot extrapolate accumulation curves â€“ only their estimated SD.
