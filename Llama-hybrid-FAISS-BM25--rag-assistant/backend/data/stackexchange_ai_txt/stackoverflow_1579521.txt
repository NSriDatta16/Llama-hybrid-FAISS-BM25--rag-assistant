Converting a C-string to a std::vector in an efficient way

I want to convert a C-style string into a byte-vector. A working solution would be converting each character manually and pushing it on the vector. However, I'm not satisfied with this solution and want to find a more elegant way. One of my attempts was the following: std::vector myVector; &myVector[0] = (byte)"MyString"; which bugs and gets me an error C2106: '=': left operand must be l-value What is the correct way to do this?
