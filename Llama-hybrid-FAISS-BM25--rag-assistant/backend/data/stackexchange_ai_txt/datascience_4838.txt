I highly recommend this tutorial: Getting Started with Topic Modeling and MALLET Here are some additional links to help you get started... Good introductory materials (including links to research papers): http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/topicmodeling.html Software: MALLET (Java): http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php topic modeling developer's guide: http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics-devel.php gensim (Python): http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ topicmodels (R): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/index.html Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox (designed for use by social scientists): http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/tmt/tmt-0.4/ Mr.LDA (scalable topic modeling using MapReduce): http://lintool.github.io/Mr.LDA/ If you're working with massive amounts of input text, you might want to consider using Mr.LDA to build your topics models -- its MapReduce-based approach might be more efficient when working with lots of data.
