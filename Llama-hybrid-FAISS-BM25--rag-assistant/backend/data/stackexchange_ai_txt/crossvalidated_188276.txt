pickSizeBest() for recursive feature elimination

I'm struggling providing my recursive feature elimination (RFE) function with valid arguments. This question is technically pretty specific so I hope I've hit the right Forum to ask it. I want to eliminate features using XGBoost model. According to caret documentation for RFE ( http://topepo.github.io/caret/rfe.html#rfe ), XGBoost is not provided by default so I need to create custom ctrl$functions (control function for rfe()), which looks something like this: rfRFE pickSizeBest() causes me problems! When I call the function like this: example it works fine (which perfectly makes sense), but what I want is to provide my train data and when try to do so (for example, train[2:127] ), I get this error, for which I haven't found a solution: Error in `[.data.frame`(x, , metric) : undefined columns selected I know that the syntax for train is fine so I have no idea what should I provide to satisfy this function's argument.
