How can I determine if there's a statistically significant difference between two averages?

I'm writing a benchmark program in C# and Java as a first assignment for a CS class. We're supposed to write some kind of report about our methods and results from the benchmark, and I'd like to add a statistical component to mine. I've got 15 run time samples from each language, and the mean and standard deviation from each. How can I determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between them?
