How big an MSMQ network is this? If you'd have 1500 queues on 150 servers this is a breeze, obviously. But let's assume the worst case: a single server, single rotating disk (i.e. not SSD) and persistent storage of messages. You'd need a few IOP per message, and your messages will arrive at a rate of about 2000 per hours. That's less than one per second, so you'd need between 1 and 10 IOPS from your disk. No big deal. You might have some latency issues if you have bursty traffic, though. Message size isn't a real concern. It's well below MSMQ limits, well below normal RAM sizes today, and even old 10Mbit Ethernet seems fast enough. And the number of IOPS doesn't really vary at this low a message size. Even a proper design isn't that important. Throwing in a SSD is available as a quick fix, and even a small 30GB would be able to hold 200 days of messages. As they're typically specced for 1000+ full reewrites, that adds up to 200.000 days in your case - plenty.
