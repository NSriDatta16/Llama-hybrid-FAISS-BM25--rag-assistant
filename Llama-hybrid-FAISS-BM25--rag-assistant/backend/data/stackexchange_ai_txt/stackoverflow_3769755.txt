Pretty bad (-: A much better idea would to cover the test cases, rather than code. The idea is this: a developer should commit a test case that fails, then commit the fix in next build, and the test case should pass ... just measure how many test cases the developer added. As a bonus collect coverage stats (branch coverage is better than line coverage here).
