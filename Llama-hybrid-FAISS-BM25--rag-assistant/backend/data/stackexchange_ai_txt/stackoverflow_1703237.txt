Don't bother. The GarbageCollector reserves the right to defragment and move objects on the heap, so there's no telling what order things are in. In addition, if you're disposing A and B and A references B it shouldn't matter if A disposes B when you dispose A, since the Dispose method should be callable more than once without an exception being thrown.
