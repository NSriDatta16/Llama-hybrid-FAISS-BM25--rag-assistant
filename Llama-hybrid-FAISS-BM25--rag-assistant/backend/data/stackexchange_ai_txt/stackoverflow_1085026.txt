[Edited - with old comments] Okay, i think i finally got you right and i might admit the problems i had understanding what you want took me a while and result of the lack of information you provided. In the future please provide the mapping of both tables clarify on the point wheather it is a mapping or a query issue. Thx. IMO you have misunderstood the idea of a parent/child-relation. The bag you mentioned like to have within the StreamFields class shouldn't be a bag but a direct association. Like this: This of course will only work if you have a property of type FiledMapping in your class. You want to map FieldMapping to the column Field_No within StreamFields class. There can only be one value within this column, so a bag makes no sense at all. If you want to have a bag of course you can keep it the way it already worked but be aware that the 'key-column' within the bag refers to the child table - in an other way it makes no sense cause a ForeignKey has to map to a PrimaryKey on its parent table. This ensures it is unique and set. I really don't want to rant but would strongly encourage you to review the hibernate reference about collection mapping to get a deeper clue however. Hopely this will solve your problem.
