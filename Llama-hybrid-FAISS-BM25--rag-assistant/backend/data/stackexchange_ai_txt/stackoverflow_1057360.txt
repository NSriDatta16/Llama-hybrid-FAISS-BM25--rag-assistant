Are you looking for something like this? ${1} '; $regex[1] = '| (www[^\s]+)|i'; $replace[1] = ' ${1} '; echo preg_replace($regex, $replace, $content); ?> Update Thanks to macbirdie for pointing out the problem! I tried to fix it. However it only works as long as there is a space before the www. Maybe someone will come up with something more clever and elegant.
