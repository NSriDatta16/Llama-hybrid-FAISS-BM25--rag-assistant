Neural networks can in principle model nonlinearities automatically (see the universal approximation theorem ), which you would need to explicitly model using transformations (splines etc.) in linear regression. The caveat: the temptation to overfit can be (even) stronger in neural networks than in regression, since adding hidden layers or neurons looks harmless. So be extra careful to look at out-of-sample prediction performance.
