When to use simulations?

So this is a very simple and basic question. However, when I was in school, I paid very little attention to the whole concept of simulations in class and that's left me a little terrified of that process. Can you explain the simulation process in laymen terms? (could be for generating data, regression coefficients, etc) What are some practical situations/problems when one would use simulations? I would prefer any examples given to be in R.
