MS Access 2007: Manually set relationship type

Is it possible, when creating a relationship in MS Access to manually set relationship type. I'm creating a relationship between two tables, where records in table A can be related to 0 or 1 record in table B. A: ID PK, Counter testID FK Details B: ID PK, Counter Details I opened relationships tab and then dragged ID from table B to testID in table A. As a result, popup appeared with relationship setup. However, Relationship type was se to One to many , with One cardinality on the B table side. Thanks
