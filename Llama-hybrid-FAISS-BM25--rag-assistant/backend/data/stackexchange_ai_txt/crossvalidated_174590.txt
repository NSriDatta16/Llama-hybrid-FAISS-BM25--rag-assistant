Determining attribute type and level of measurement

I know that we when we discuss attribute types, we distinguish between nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. I have a data set with these attributes: price: median housing price in USD crime: crimes committed per capita nox: nitrous oxide, parts per 100 mill. rooms: avg number of rooms per house dist: weighted dist. to 5 employ centers radial: accessibiliy index to radial hghwys proptax: property tax per $1000 stratio: average student-teacher ratio lowstat: percentage of people 'lower status' lprice: log(price) lnox: log(nox) lproptax: log(proptax) I have tried determining the attribute type of each of these attributes. I have found that all the attributes are ratios except of radial which is ordinal. Is this correct? I have some troubles distinguishing between ratio and interval. Besides, rooms seems to be an average of an ordinal attribute. Does this make it a ratio? The housing price is a median price. Normally, when you find the median value, you order the items and pick the element in the middle, so I wonder if this attribute is an ordinal attribute?
