ColdFusion 302 ISAPI interfering with other modules

I've got a legacy ColdFusion app that I tasked with integrating with OpenSSO using their Policy Agent. The Policy Agent is a native HTTP module that essentially acts as a filter (Not in my authentication cache? Redirect to this URL with a returnUrl specified, else, if I'm being POSTed to process the returning authentication info and let the user through). The problem is that the main index.cfm page does a 302 redirect to the app main page (app/index.cfm). When the Policy Agent generates it's 302 redirect, it has a return url of http://sameplace/index.cfm,app/index.cfm , instead of just http://sameplace . It would seem that ColdFusion's * ISAPI handler is somehow getting called, and the Policy Agent MODULE is getting confused by the already existing response headers, and tacks it on with a comma to it's own return url. Anyone have any experience with this?
