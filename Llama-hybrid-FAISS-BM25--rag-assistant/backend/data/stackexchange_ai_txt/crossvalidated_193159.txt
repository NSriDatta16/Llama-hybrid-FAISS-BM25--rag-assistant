There are many models that you can use for binary classification problems, such as logistic regressions, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest-neighbours, trees, random forest, support vector machines, etc. You can review some of these methods in the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning from James, G. et al, specially chapter 4. If you want to implement a K-nearest-neighbour in R with your data you first need to make sure you have a training set, a test set and classifications for the training set. Then you can do it with the class package . Below you can see an example. I am generating 8 random observations of temperatures and relative humidity for 1000 days and then classifying as "rain" or "sun" using a simple rule (I suppose that always rains when the mean of humidity in each day is higher than 52). Once I generate the data I split it into a train set (750 first observations) and a test set (the other 250). Then I generate predictions for the test set using the classification of the first 750 observations and check the results: library(class) ## Generate random temp and hum for 1000 days (rains when mean(hum) > 52) input 52) { output[i]
