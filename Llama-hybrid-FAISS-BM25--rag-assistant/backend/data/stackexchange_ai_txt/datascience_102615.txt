Below are some tips to get the best results: Try to build your model with each and every type of algorithm you know. You never know which one will be the best for your dataset. Just because Linear Regression worked for others does not mean it is the best algorithm for the dataset. Try to get the best features (feature selection) from your dataset. This may take some time as there are a lot of methods for feature selection, but by trial and error you can definitely get the best features. For each and every algorithm you try, always perform hyperparameter tuning. It is a necessary step for most of the coplex algorithms (decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting etc.).
