Unable To Change SeriesChartType Dynamically in MS Chart Control

I am using the MS Chart control (version 3.5.0). I have added it by using the designer (drag and drop). I removed the default "Series1" from the Properties -> Series -> Collection so that the chart contains no data. I am adding the data at runtime based on a canned query to a SQLite DB. Like so: Dim SQL As String = "SELECT * FROM ageLength ORDER BY month" Dim cmd As New SQLiteCommand(SQL) Dim SqLiteConnection1 As SQLiteConnection = New SQLiteConnection() SqLiteConnection1.ConnectionString = "Data Source=" & My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath & "\Data\UserData.db3;" cmd.Connection = SqLiteConnection1 Dim da As New SQLiteDataAdapter(cmd) Dim ds As New DataSet() da.Fill(ds, "ageLength") Dim Series1 As Series = New Series() Dim Series2 As Series = New Series() Series1.Name = "Pcnt2nd" Series1.ChartType = SeriesChartType.Spline Series2.Name = "Pcnt98th" Series2.ChartType = SeriesChartType.Spline Chart1.Series.Add("Pcnt2nd") Chart1.Series.Add("Pcnt98th") Chart1.Series("Pcnt2nd").XValueMember = "month" Chart1.Series("Pcnt2nd").YValueMembers = "Pcnt2nd" Chart1.Series("Pcnt98th").XValueMember = "month" Chart1.Series("Pcnt98th").YValueMembers = "Pcnt98th" Chart1.DataSource = ds.Tables(0) The data is displayed on the Chart, however, it is a Bar type graph. I set it to use the Spline type for both series. I am not sure what I missed. Any input is greatly appreciated.
