Grant capabilities to a running process

An already running process needs a privileged instruction, like using the SO_RCVBUFFORCE socket option. This process is running as a normal user process. How to give capability/permission to this process? File-based capability settings are still a dream? I have tried the /usr/sbin/setpcaps utility from libcap package and the cap_set_proc() api, but the CAP_SETPCAP capability is blocked on the system (a legacy system based on Fedora 4 with 2.6.20 kernel), so it can not grant/remove capabilities for a different-then-self process. Thought about setting temporary root uid to that process, but is there a way to change the effective UID of an external, already running process ? The setuid() / seteuid() /... functions can just modify the current process (who is calling the function).
