R2 as a measure to compare simulation model outputs with real world data

I want to compare a price time series generated by a simulation model to real world price data. In the literature, I found a contribution (an A journal article in economics) in which R2 is used for a similar comparison. However, I am confused whether it is possible to use R2 (among other indicators) to compare fundamental model outputs to data. Since the model is not a regression, the sum of residuals between the model and the data does not necessarily sum to zero. Therefore, a high R2 can result even if there is an apparent mismatch between the output of the simulation model and the data. Which other measures would be more appropriate for comparing a simulation model to data if R2 is not suitable?
