My two questions are: 1) Is it recommended to log-transform the data? I am uncertain at what step in the process I should do this or if it is needed. Log transforming and taking first differences is an alternative way of data preprocessing. If you want to get rid of the different scales issue and besides make your time series more stationary , you can transform by x[t] / x[t-1] . While log(x[t]) - log(x[t-1]) can be even better in terms of making your resulting timeseries stationary in terms of variance. 2) Currently, I address outliers by restricting points to no more than Â± 3 SD above the mean for each time series. Is there an improved way of determining outliers? If you follow the differentiation trail of preprocessing, you want to keep all time dates in place (if you omit some dates you can screw seasonality and AR parts), so one good way is to: take moving average over neighbor sales data points (centered) or replace your outliers with average values around them (say, taking 1 point at each side). I hope this gives you helpful hints.
