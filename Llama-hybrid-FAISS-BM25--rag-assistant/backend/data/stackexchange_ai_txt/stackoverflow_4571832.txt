Deleted my last answer - it does not work either. In standards compliant modes the only content that can not be scrolled to is content inside a parent which is hidden. And except for bugs it is not shown. What I was looking at was a IE bug. Sorry no can do in CSS as it stands today. If you need to do a calc today you would need to use jquery to get the heights of the elements then calculate the height needed for the footer; And, use CSS gradients http://robertnyman.com/2010/02/15/css-gradients-for-all-web-browsers-without-using-images/ so you can go from your shade of navy to your shade of black. I would discourage this approach as when you start to consider all of the possible resolution situations the calculation it will become rather complex and I assume they may want to redesign the heights depending on different resolutions.
