Since you are using TFS, you can make use of NUnit for Team Build which would make your NUnit test results visible in the build log and incorporated into the data warehouse for reporting. There is also NUnitForVS which can publish results within TFS. Going one of the above routes will allow you to leverage the current CI environment and is a much better approach to emailing the results as they surface.
