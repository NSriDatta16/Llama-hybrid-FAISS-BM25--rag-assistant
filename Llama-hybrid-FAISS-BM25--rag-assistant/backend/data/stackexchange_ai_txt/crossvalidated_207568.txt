Advantages of LS-SVM over SVM

My teacher asked me to do a research on LS-SVM, I know what is LS-SVM and how its mathematically different from SVM. I have found lots of papers that shows that for large-scale problems LS-SVM have some advantages over SVM. But I was wondering if there are other reasons to use LS-SVM. I have read somewhere that: One of the original dreams in the neural networks area is to make a universal class of models (such as MLPs) generally applicable to a wide range of applications. And I assume that with LS-SVM you can achieve this goal. Am I right? What Problems are LS-SVM capable of solving that regular SVM canâ€™t handle?
