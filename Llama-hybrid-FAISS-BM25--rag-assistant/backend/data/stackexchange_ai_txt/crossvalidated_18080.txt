In an OLS model, the marginal effect is the same for each observation (in particular, the marginal effect is the coefficient on the dummy variable). But in a nonlinear model -- including Probit -- the marginal effect is conditional on the X's of the particular observation. Think about the underlying predicted values. When calculating a predicted value from a Probit regression, the coefficients you see get multiplied by the respective X's (for each observation) and added. Then, the "X_i * b" gets put into the Probit function. For intuition on how the marginal effect works, do the following: Run your probit model predict yhat replace femintmig=0 (perhaps making a backup first) predict yhat0 replace femintmig=1 predict yhat1 gen margeffect = yhat1 - yhat0 browse yhat* margeffect Now, the key issue is how to turn the column of margeffect observations into a single number for you to put into a table or report. This is a matter of interpretation/application to your specific case. There is no "right way" to do it. lejohn's solution takes the average of the margeffect column. Another option is to calculate the mean of each X. Then calculate the marginal effect at "X bar" (which is what the old mfx command used to do).
