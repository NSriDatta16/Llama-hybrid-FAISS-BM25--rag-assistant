No, its not possible. Post variables are just string key value pairs. You could however implement your own higher level logic. For example a common practice is to put a suffix to the names. For example everything that ends with _i gets parsed as integer and so on. However what benefit would it bring to preserve the types? Or better asked. How do you output them? Is it only for storage? Then it should not be a problem to convert the strings to proper types if that benefits your application and cast them back to strings before delivering.
