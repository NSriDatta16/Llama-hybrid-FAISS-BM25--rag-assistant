How to change your XCode iTunes Connect login?

I am using several accounts to manage my customers iPhone/iPad applications. Therefore I need to connect to iTunes Connect with different logins. How can I change the login in XCode or Application Loader ? It is always set to one default value that I probably entered the first time XCode was started. When it comes to validating or submitting an application using the XCode Organizer I start to hate Apple for what they have done to use developers. In those situations I feel like a worm inside an Apple, pretty lost. The problem is that clicking on one of those buttons (Validate... or Submit...) is NOT giving ANY kind of feedback except in rare occations. The only way to see what is happening is using Console to see XCode log messages.
