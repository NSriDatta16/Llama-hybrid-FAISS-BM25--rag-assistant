Your case sounds pretty much exactly what the fileinput module was designed for. That way you can do: python script.py file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt and in script.py import fileinput for line in fileinput.input(): # do stuff here The added bonus for using fileinput is that you can do roughly the same thing Space_C0wb0y suggested adding a dash as the first parameter: python script.py - or cat file.txt | python script.py - fileinput is mentioned in the answers to the question linked by Space_C0wb0y, I just figured I'd spell out how it can be leveraged.
