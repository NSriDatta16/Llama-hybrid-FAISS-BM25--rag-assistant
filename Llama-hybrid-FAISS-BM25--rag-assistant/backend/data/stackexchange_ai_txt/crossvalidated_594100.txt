The name "hat matrix" is a mnemonic : a shortcut to help us remember the role it plays in regression. As @RobertLong explains in Learning hat matrix , The hat matrix is the projection matrix that maps the response vector $Y$ to the vector of fitted values $\hat{Y}$ (hence the name "hat" matrix). As to history, according to David, H. A. “First (?) Occurrence of Common Terms in Mathematical Statistics.” The American Statistician, vol. 49, no. 2, 1995, pp. 121–33. https://doi.org/10.2307/2684625 . the term "hat matrix" first appears in Hoaglin, David C., and Roy E. Welsch. “The Hat Matrix in Regression and ANOVA.” The American Statistician, vol. 32, no. 1, 1978, pp. 17–22. https://doi.org/10.2307/2683469 . But the authors themselves attribute it to J. W. Tukey.
