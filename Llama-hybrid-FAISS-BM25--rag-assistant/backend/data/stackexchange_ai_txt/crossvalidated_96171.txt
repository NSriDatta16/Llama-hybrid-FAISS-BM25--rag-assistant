No, deterministic deletion of arrivals (such as "delete every third arrival") does not leave a Poisson process, but random deletion does, e.g. for every arrival, make a decision (independent of all past and future decisions) to delete with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ and to not delete with probability $\frac 23$. Then what is left after such random deletions is a Poisson process with rate $\frac{2\lambda}{3}$. Read, for example, the last paragraph of this answer .
