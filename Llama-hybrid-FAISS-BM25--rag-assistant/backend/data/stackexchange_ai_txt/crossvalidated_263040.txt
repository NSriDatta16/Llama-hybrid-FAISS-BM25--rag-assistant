No. That isn't correct. Let us imagine you set a 95% confidence interval as your decision rule. Then if you repeated the experiment 100 times then, in expectation, at least 95 of them would have confidence intervals that contain the true parameter. Your current interval either does or does not contain the parameter. You cannot know if it does or does not. You do not have confidence in the interval, you have confidence in the procedure that creates the interval. There are an infinite number of potential confidence intervals. Any function that covers the parameter at least the specified number of times is a valid interval. Different intervals have different properties, outside their coverage properties. The edges of the interval are random because they are from a random sample. You would never expect to see the same interval again, under perfect conditions. In fact, the width of the interval tells you nothing about the quality of the research or the precision of the experiment. For example, if you split a room of 100 undergraduates in half, randomly, and took sample statistics then it would irrational to believe that the one with the narrow standard deviation was the better sample. Both were measured using the same experiment, randomization, which should remove any systematic differences leaving only random differences. If you use an interval in your inference, the most you can say is that your procedure, presuming all other forms of validity have been met, will work in at least 19 of 20 experiments assuming, of course, your number of repetitions is very, very large. You want to avoid the mental trap of saying that 95% of your data are in that range. That isn't true. You also want to avoid saying that there is a 95% chance the parameter is in the interval. That is not true either. The former error is a variant on the range. The second is an idea not measured here called the credible interval. It's a very different animal. I don't know how to answer your question on the 42% because you do not describe what you are measuring or its scale.
