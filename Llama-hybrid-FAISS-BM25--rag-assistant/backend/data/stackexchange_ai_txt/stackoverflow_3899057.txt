"Although Sencha touch appears to have a lot more documentation (at least it is certainly more organized and in a central place), I've actually found it harder to get a simple 3 or 4 page app running." Completely agree with this, Kris. They really need to focus on simplifying their demos and target the user who has created simple jQT websites (5-10 cards which slide and maybe some ajax data or a form). Screencasts which show how to take JQT sites and move them into Sencha would win them tons of new devs and fans. I know lots of people waiting in the wings for jQueryMobile just for this reason alone.
