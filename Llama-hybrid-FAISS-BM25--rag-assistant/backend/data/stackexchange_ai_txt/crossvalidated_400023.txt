So you have the following functions describing your data: And you want the maximum of GLM result * price. You have two approaches: 1. Solve analytically. You have an equation of the form $\frac{x}{1+e^{-(ax+b)}}$ where $a$ and $b$ , according to your model, are -0.2341 and 2.45, respectively. You can use calculus to find the optimum. It is a bit involved, however, as you will (I'm pretty sure, but could be wrong) need to use the Lambert W function . The other alternative is to plot the values of $\frac{x}{1+e^{-(ax+b)}}$ from some range that contains the maximum, say, 1:100, and find the maximum value, and the price that gives the maximum value that way. It won't be exact, but you probably don't need exact.
