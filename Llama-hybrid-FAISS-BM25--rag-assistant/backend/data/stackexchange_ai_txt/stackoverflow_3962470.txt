MySQL - working out the AVG for a subset of MAX values

I have a table with columns 'Date, Name, Score'. I wish to get the MAX(Score) for rows which share a common value (for e.g. the same date or even name), before averaging them to give me a figure, for example: ---- Date -----| -- Name -- | Score 2010-10-10 | John Smith | 86 2010-06-05 | Tedi Jones | 71 2010-10-10 | John Smith | 52 2010-06-05 | Tedi Jones | 68 2010-08-08 | Joe Bloggs | 79 2010-10-10 | John Smith | 46 So doing a MAX(Score) on the above would give me 86. However, what I'd like is the following: MAX(Score) to give me the values 86 (MAX for date 10-10), 79 (MAX for date 08-08) and 71 (MAX for date 06-05) which I can then average to get 78.67. I'm hoping this is possible without having to resort to temp tables? All replies are appreciated, thank you.
