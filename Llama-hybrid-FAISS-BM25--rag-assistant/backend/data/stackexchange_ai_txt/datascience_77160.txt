Terminology Question: Place Coding

While reading the paper "Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition", one of the original papers attributed to the development of convolutional neural networks, on page 3, section 3.1 the authors write (emphasis mine): The remainder of the recognition is entirely performed by a multilayer network. All of the connections in the network are adaptive, although heavily constrained, and are trained using backpropagation. This is in contrast with earlier work (Denker et al. 1989) where the first few layers of connections were hand-chosen constants implemented on a neural-network chip. The input of the network is a 16 by 16 normalized image. The output is composed of 10 units (one per class) and uses place coding . What does place coding mean? A Google search of this term yielded nothing conclusive. Any insights appreciated.
