How can one change the primary key using NHibernate

I want to change the primary key of an entity in database, so that all the relevant foreign key constraints are updated as well./We are using NHibenate as our ORM. Is it possible to do it? Thanks. P.S. I know the practice of changing the primary key is highly discouraged. My problem is that my primary key is backed by a natural Id of the entity, which may sometimes change. We could, theoretically, utilize a unique primary key, unrelated to the natural key of the entity, but this complicates things too much in other places, so this is not an option.
