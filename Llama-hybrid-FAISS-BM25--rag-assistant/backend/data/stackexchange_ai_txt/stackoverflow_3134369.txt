You need to update your PATH so that the stuff from MacPorts is in front of the standard system directories, e.g., export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/:$PATH . UPDATE: Pay special attention to the fact that /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin is in front of your old PATH value.
