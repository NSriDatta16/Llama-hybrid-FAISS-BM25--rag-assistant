PyMC3: Mixture Model with Latent Variables

I have a rather basic knowledge of Bayesian inference and I'm somewhat new to MCMC and PyMC3. Can I model data that looks like this? X1 = stats.poisson.rvs(5,size=100) X2 = stats.poisson.rvs(10,size=100) t = stats.beta.rvs(5,2,size=100) Z1 = X1*t Z2 = X2*t Z1 and Z2 are observed values, X1 and X2 are the latent variables I care about inferring, and t is unobserved. Is it possible to trace posteriors for the hyper-parameters of X1 , X2 and maybe t also?
