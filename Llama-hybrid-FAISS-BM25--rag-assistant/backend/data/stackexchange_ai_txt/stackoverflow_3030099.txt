Pragma in define macro

Is there some way to embed pragma statement in macro with other statements? I am trying to achieve something like: #define DEFINE_DELETE_OBJECT(type) \ void delete_ ## type_(int handle); \ void delete_ ## type(int handle); \ #pragma weak delete_ ## type_ = delete_ ## type I am okay with boost solutions (save for wave) if one exists.
