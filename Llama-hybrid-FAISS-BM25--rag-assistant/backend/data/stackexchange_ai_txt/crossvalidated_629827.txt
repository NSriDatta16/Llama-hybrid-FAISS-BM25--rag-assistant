Unlabeled-unlabeled learning (UU learning, by analogy to Positive-unlabeled learning, a.k.a. PU learning) is unsupervised in the sense that the data are not annotated with labels, but you know (or have an estimate of) the probabilities of each class for each set of unlabeled data. It can be applied to the case where the model learns from two sets of unlabeled data, where one set of unlabeled data has class probabilities $\pi_1$ and a second with class probabilities $\pi_2 \neq \pi_1$ . This is discussed in Chapter 8 of Machine Learning from Weak Supervision: An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach (2023) by Masashi Sugiyama, Han Bao, Takashi Ishida, Nan Lu, Tomoya Sakai. The book discusses a number of alternative weakly-supervised learning scenarios, but this is probably the scenario with the least supervision.
