Technical jargon (ORM, TDD etc.) makes one's speech more precise. Corporate buzzwords (aka management jargon), on the other hand, are designed to be able to express vague ideas when full information is not available. As such, management jargon serves its purpose pretty well, in the sense that it does allow managers to effectively communicate about thins they have very limited understanding of. That said, good manager knows when NOT use the jargon, such as when talking with developers, or with executives, both of whom hate bullshit. Based on the above, the (Anti-)Buzzword Movement, should rather increase awareness of the proper usage and application of management jargon, and encourage proper information encapsulation only with appropriate auditory.
