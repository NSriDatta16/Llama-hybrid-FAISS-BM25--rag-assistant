For my master thesis AI, I've studied the TimeGAN model in-depth, including the architecture and the used metrics. 1 : Not necessarily. Vanilla TimeGAN uses (variations of) RNNs. These nets share the weights over all different timesteps. Hence, the generation is just a learned abstraction of the time-series data. synth_data[123] does not necessarily have to be based on stock_data[123] . However, if all 123rd timesteps of your data have some specific correlation, your model might pick up on this. 2 : Apologies for inserting my own opinion, but you should not put too much focus on trying to reproduce the discriminative scores. It is possible to reproduce the discriminative scores, I did so for my master thesis. However, please note that the results of the discriminative scores are VERY unstable. For the stocks data, there is an (unspecified kind of) instability of $.02$ on a metric score of $.1$ for TimeGAN. That's a lot, no matter how you turn it. Also, note that the discriminative score is not a well-established metric in GAN research. Preferably, a metric agrees with human judgement, is consistent, and is easy to calculate. The discriminative score is non of these. You train a non-optimized neural network for 2000 epochs, with a random learning rate, with a hidden neural network size half that of the time-series features (though you have to check their non-official implementation for these details). If you train with a different learning rate, a different network size, longer (or shorter) epochs, you could get a discriminative score of $0.00$ or $0.5$ on every single dataset. You can get any model to score $0.00$ by simply putting the learning rate or number of epochs on $0$ .
