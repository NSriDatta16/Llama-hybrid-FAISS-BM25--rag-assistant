Why do I get 'Inf' value while doing quantile mapping in MATLAB?

I am doing bias correction of rainfall data simulated by Global Climate Model. Since, rainfall data generally follows gamma distribution , I am estimating parameter for gamma distribution for the time series of daily rainfall of observed period (Jan 1971, Jan 1972, Jan 1973, ...., Jan 2005) and then taking the gamma inverse of CDF of rainfall time series of projected period (Jan 2010, Jan 2011, Jan 2012, ...., Jan 2039). Since, it is the timeseries of daily rainfall for specif months it has many zero values. Though I get the reasonable values for majority of grids, few grids show Inf value which is wrong. Why is this happening? I have also tried the same thing in R using qmap package but that also gave NA values for some grid. Can I use some flag where I get Inf value and replace it with some large value from observed timeseries? I also get such warnings while running code in MATLAB, I guess this is where it places Inf values Warning: GAMINV did not converge for a = 0.0642935, b = 17.8865, p = 3.35539e-24.
