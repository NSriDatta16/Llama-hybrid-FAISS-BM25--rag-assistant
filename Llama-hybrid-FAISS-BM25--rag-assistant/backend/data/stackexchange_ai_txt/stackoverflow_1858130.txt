While it is possible to load multiple CSDL files into one (Entity)Connection, it is not possible to load multiple MSL or SSDL files, because these are completely self-contained. Back to the CSDL, there is a rarely used element in CSDL. Which might give the impression that it is similar to a Reference in .NET, but actually it is more like a Merge. I.e. one CSDL in another actually modifies both, merging them together, and potentially invalidates MSL's and SSDL's, by making them incomplete. So back to your scenario: You could in theory have 2 CSDLs: 1) To describe the Audit types 2) That uses (1) & defines the Domain Types and defines EntitySets and AssociationSets for both kinds of types. You would then have one mapping file to map (2) and a storage model file too. Which would leave you with something like this: "metadata=res://*/Models.CfarModels.csdl| res://*/Models.CfarModels.ssdl| res://*/Models.CfarModels.msl| W:\map\AuditModel.csdl; Personally though I don't think you gain enough from this separation to make it worthwhile, most of the metadata is in the extents, the mapping and the storage model anyway, so type re-use while nice is only about 20% of the work anyway. All you can really re-use is the audit type definitions, but that probably isn't worth the effort. Hope this helps Alex James Microsoft.
