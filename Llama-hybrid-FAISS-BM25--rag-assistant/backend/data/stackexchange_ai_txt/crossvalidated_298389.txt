Probability Scores threshold usually used in Deep Learning for an Object Recognition task

I am working on a Faster RCNN project. I have launched the algorithm and obtained all the bounding box proposals. Each one has a certain probability score: My question is: What is the probability score threshold usually used by the Deep Learning scientific community in the Object Detection field in order to say if an object inside a bounding box belongs to a class ? Do you think that 60% is a good threshold ? The authors are using the Multi-Task loss: Thank you very much for all your answers
