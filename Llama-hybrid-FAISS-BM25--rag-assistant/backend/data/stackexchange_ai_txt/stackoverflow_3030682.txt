EPUB doesn't really have a concept of pages-- it's meant for reflowable content that flows to fit the dimensions of the display container. So what you're suggesting is a bit of a hack. That said, users are comfortable with pages, and most readers implement some concept of a page. What you will need is to implement something like Knuth's page-breaking algorithm, which in turn depends upon his paragraph, and line breaking algorithms. See his TeX book for the full literate code (IIRC, it's in Pascal). (It's not that complex a piece of code-- I implemented one in a desktop publishing program I wrote many years back). If you went this route, it means you probably couldn't use a UIWebView. BTW, Adobe Digital Edition implements a variation of Knuth's algorithm.
