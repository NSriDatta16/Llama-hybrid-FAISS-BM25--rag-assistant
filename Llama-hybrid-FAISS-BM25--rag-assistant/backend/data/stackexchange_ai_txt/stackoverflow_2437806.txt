You need a replication strategy which of course depends on your database engine. It's usually done by configuration. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_%28computer_science%29 I've experience with Informix there you can setup data replication to have a standby system available or do full backup the data, and replay logical-logs (which contain basically all SQL-Statement) which needs more time to recover from a crash. Having a redundant storage is also a good idea on case of a disc crashes. This topic is probably better discussed on serverfault.com
