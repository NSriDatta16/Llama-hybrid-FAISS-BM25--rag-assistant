Embedding page with AdSense ads

I have developed a WPF desktop application that has quite a few users. It also includes a simple webpage that is used for news and other information. I figured I might make a few bugs if I added AdSense in this page, but I was wondering if this was allowed or not. I've read some stuff about AdSense not being allowed in desktop applications, but this is technically not the case. The page itself should be legit, right?
