Which of the 180 algorithms in R's caret package are feasible?

R's caret package works with 180 models. The author warns that some of the package may be intractably slow or less accurate than top-choice models. The author is not wrong about this. I've tried to train Boruta and evtree models and had to give up after they ran > 5 hours on a cluster. The author links to a set of machine learning benchmarks , but those only cover performance of a small number of algorithms, comparing different implementations. Is there some other resource I can turn to, for guidance on which of the 180 models are worth trying, and which will be very inaccurate or unreasonably slow?
