Number of all possible splits in each node of trees in a Random Forest

The trees in a Random Forest are grown by recursive splitting the nodes, and the best split in each node is obtained by using the Gini index, I want to know if there is a possibility to know the number of all possible split-cuts? For example by knowing the dimension of data and mtry ?
