Question 1 Given the finite sample, there is no need to mention stochastic processes at all. Indeed, there is no need to use $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_N$ to denote the $N$ random variables: we could just as well use $A,B, C, \ldots$ as the names of the random variables. But , you bring up time series which suggests that there is some meaning associated with the subscripts such as $X_i$ is the value at time $i$ and that random variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ are separated in time by $i-j$. In this sense, having the notion of stochastic process is helpful in that a lot of the notations, machinery, and procedures are already set up for your convenience Question 2 Joint distributions are messier to specify in general. In many cases, the "nicest" results are those that hold when the random variables are independent (or even independent and identically distributed) which special cases also make the joint distribution very easy to specify. Not so in general. Question 3 Your "second-order characterization" tells you very little about the distribution(s) except that all the random variables have finite means and finite variances (and covariances) as specified in your "order 1" and "order 2". You have no additional information about the process, just what you call the second-order characterization. For the case of Gaussian processes, the meaning of Gaussian is not just that the random variables comprising the process (or your set of $N$ random variables) are Gaussian random variables but, more importantly, they are jointly Gaussian random variables. Joint Gaussianity implies marginal Gaussianity but the converse is not true. Thus, knowing the mean function and the covariance function allows you to write down the joint pdf of the $N$ (jointly Gaussian) random variables. But, for non-Gaussian processes, you get very little information about the distribution from the "second-order" characterization. For more on these notions, read my answer to "Does the autocorrelation function completely describe a stochastic process?" over on dsp.SE
