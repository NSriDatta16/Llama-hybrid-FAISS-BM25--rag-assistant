An alternative approach was published by a stats.se regular in Wang, Xiaozhe, Kate Smith, and Rob Hyndman. ‘Characteristic-Based Clustering for Time Series Data’. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 13, no. 3 (2006): 335–364 . They write: This paper proposes a method for clustering of time series based on their structural characteristics. Unlike other alternatives, this method does not cluster point values using a distance metric, rather it clusters based on global features extracted from the time series. The feature measures are obtained from each individual series and can be fed into arbitrary clustering algorithms, including an unsupervised neural network algorithm, self-organizing map, or hierarchal clustering algorithm. Global measures describing the time series are obtained by applying statistical operations that best capture the underlying characteristics: trend, seasonality, periodicity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, chaos, nonlinearity, and self-similarity. Since the method clusters using extracted global measures, it reduces the dimensionality of the time series and is much less sensitive to missing or noisy data. We further provide a search mechanism to find the best selection from the feature set that should be used as the clustering inputs. R code is available on Rob's blog .
