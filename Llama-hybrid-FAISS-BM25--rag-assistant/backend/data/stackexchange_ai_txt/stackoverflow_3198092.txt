There are various tutorials available which guide you step-by-step to create a simple tablview. Google them. You can follow these steps for connecting your tableView outlets: Select your viewController where you are displaying the tableview to be your "File's Owner" in Identity Inspector. Drag your view's outlet to your File's owner. For tableView inside view, drag its outlets to File's owner again so that your datasource and delegates are up. And in the same view, drag your referencing outlet to the IBOutlet you have created in your viewController class.
