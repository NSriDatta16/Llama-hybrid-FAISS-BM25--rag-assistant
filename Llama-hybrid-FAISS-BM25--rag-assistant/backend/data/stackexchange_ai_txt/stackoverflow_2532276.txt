Best practices to develop and maintaing code for complex JQuery/JQueryUI based applications

I'm working on my first very complex JQuery based application. A single web page can contain hundreds of JQuery related code for example to JQueryUI dialogs. Now I want to organize code in separated files. For example I'm moving all initialization dialogs code $("#dialog-xxx").dialog({...}) in separated files and due to reuse I wrap them on single function call like dialogs.js function initDialog_1() { $("#dialog-1").dialog({}); } function initDialog_2() { $("#dialog-2").dialog({}); } This simplifies function code and make caller page clear $(function() { // do some init stuff initDialog_1(); initTooltip_2(); }); Is this the correct pattern? Are you using more efficient techniques? I know that splitting code in many js files introduces an ugly band-bandwidth usage so. Does exist some good practice or tool to 'join' files for production environments? I imagine some tool that does more work than simply minimize and/or compress JS code.
