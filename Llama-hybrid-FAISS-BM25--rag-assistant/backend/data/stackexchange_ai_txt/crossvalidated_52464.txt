Multilevel bayesian with AR1 correlation structure

How do I fit a bayesian multilevel model with with AR(1) correlation structure? I am trying to teach myself bayesian modelling and I am wondering how you could specify a multilevel model with an AR(1) correlation structure. e.g how do i get the equivalent from nlme using either JAGS or stan ? lme(y ~ time + x, random=~time|subject, corr=corAR1())
