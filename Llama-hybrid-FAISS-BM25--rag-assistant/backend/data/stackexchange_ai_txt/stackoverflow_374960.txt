SQL Server Agent: How to "sleep"?

In a scripting step in a scheduled task in SQL Server Agent 2005, I need to trigger a webscript that is running on a different server. I'm doing this: Dim ie Set ie = CreateObject( "InternetExplorer.Application" ) ie.navigate "...to my dreamscript" ' Wait till IE is ready Do While ie.Busy (1) Loop ie.Quit set ie = Nothing At (1) I would like to "sleep" (e.g. WScript.sleep(..)), but WScript is not available in this environment. Is there another way to "sleep" for a while?
