How to Add Text Box to RDLC 2010 Report

I am a casual user of the RDLC report control in VS 2005 Web Application, it seemed straightforward. I could set a report data source, then just drag a field into the report body as a text box. In VS 2010, dragging a field onto a report does not seem to work. I can drag a field into a cell in a table I've added to the report, but when I drag a field onto the report body, rather than show the field name in the text box, I see <> there. In the expression box, the field looks like =First(Fields!state.Value, "TestDataSet"), but there is a squiggly red line under Field!stata, and no help to say what the problem is. The fields in the table right next to it seem OK. In the text box I can pick the field from a drop down, but I still get the error. There is only one data set, containing one table connected to the report, so I don't see how there can be ambiguity or how the field could be out of scope.. It must be something simple. Thanks Mike Thomas
