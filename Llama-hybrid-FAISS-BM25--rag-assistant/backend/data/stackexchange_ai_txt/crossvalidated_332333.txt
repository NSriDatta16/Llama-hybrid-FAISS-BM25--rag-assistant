Selecting an ARIMA model for my data

I am trying to implement an ARIMA model for my dataset. I performed a Dickey-Fuller test on my dataset and it said that it was stationary. I would like to know if the autocorrelation function can state if my dataset is stationary and how do I determine the order of my autoregressive model and moving average model from these diagrams. Also I would like to know exactly what does this autoccorelation and partial autocorrelation function say about my dataset? The last graph shows my dataset which is hourly wind speeds for 15 years.
