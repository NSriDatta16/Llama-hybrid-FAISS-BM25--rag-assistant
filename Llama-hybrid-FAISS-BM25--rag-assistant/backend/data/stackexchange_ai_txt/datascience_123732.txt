It seems like you are dealing with a zero inflated lognormal (ZILN) distributed target. In this case standard error loss / metrics are not correctly capturing the error structure. I suggest to take a look at https://github.com/google/lifetime_value and the corresponding paper, which has a keras implementation of the corresponding loss functions and layers. It also shows good visualization techniques for such prediction problems. Similarly pytorch and xgboostlss offer same implementations.
