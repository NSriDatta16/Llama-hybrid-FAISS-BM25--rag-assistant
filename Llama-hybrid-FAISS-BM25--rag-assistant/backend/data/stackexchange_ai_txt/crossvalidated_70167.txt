In Bayesian terms, you have some observable property $X$ and a parameter $\Theta$ . The joint distribution for $X,\Theta$ is specified, but factored as the conditional distribution of $X\mid \Theta$ and the prior distribution of $\Theta$ . A statistic $T$ is sufficient for this model if and only if the posterior distribution of $\Theta\mid X$ is the same as that of $\Theta\mid T(X)$ , for every prior distribution of $\Theta$ . In words, your updated uncertainty about $\Theta$ after knowing the value of $X$ is the same as your updated uncertainty about $\Theta$ after knowing the value of $T(X)$ , whatever prior information you have about $\Theta$ . Keep in mind that sufficiency is a model dependent concept. Somewhat surprisingly, this Bayesian definition of sufficiency is due to Kolmogorov (see the second paragraph on page 1012 of Rikhin (1990) ).
