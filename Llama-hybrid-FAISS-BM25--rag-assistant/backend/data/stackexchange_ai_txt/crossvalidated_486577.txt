To put it in short, if there are many outliers then you may consider using Mean Absolute Error (also called the Average Absolute Deviation). RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE. But when outliers are exponentially rare (like in a bell-shaped curve), the RMSE performs very well and is generally preferred. Both the RMSE and the MAE are ways to measure the distance between two vectors: the vector of predictions and the vector of target values. MAE corresponds to the l1 norm or Manhattan norm while RMSE corresponds to the l2 norm or Euclidian Norm. The higher the norm index, the more it focuses on large values and neglects small ones
