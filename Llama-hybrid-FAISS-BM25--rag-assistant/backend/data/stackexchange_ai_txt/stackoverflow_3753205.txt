http://cnnturk.com/finans/ticker/endeks.asp is where I get the XML file but it does NOT have newlines so I am not able to use your solution while using curl :( My purpose is to come up with a shell script which gathers data from the address mentioned above and then displays information about both prices and price changes of stock exchange index, gold, usd, and euro. I need to use curl, awk, sed, and grep to accomplish this but I can't figure out how because it requires complex use of shell programming skills.
