How should I format input and output for text generation with LSTMs

I'm attempting to generate a response to an input line of text using an LSTM. I've considered various forms of input, including one-hot encoding each character in the line and passing each input line as a vector of one-hot encoded vectors. I've also considered using a dictionary and one-hot encoding each word in the sentence based on its alphabetical position. However, I'm not sure about any of this, as I am new to natural language processing in machine learning. What would be the best way to format my input (and my output) for this problem?
