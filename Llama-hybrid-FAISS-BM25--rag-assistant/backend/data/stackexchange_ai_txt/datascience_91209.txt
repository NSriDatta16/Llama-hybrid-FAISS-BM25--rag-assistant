Would a neural network trained on extracted features have the same accuracy as a full network with frozen layers?

Let's say that I train two neural networks on the exact same dataset. The first network is a VGG19 model with frozen convolutional layers so only the top dense layers are getting optimized. The second network is composed only of dense layers , with exactly the same architecture and hyper-parameters as the first networks fully connected layers. Basically, I pass all my data through the convolutional layers of VGG19, saving outputs of the last convolutional layer to disk. Then, I load the data into my second model which is only composed of FC blocks and I train it to be a classifier. Would combining the two models after training be the same as training a whole VGG19 model (with frozen conv layers) with my own FC layers? If I understand correctly, the outputs of a trained network are entirely deterministic so in theory it should work. In practice, I have no idea if optimization algorithm takes frozen layers into account when training only the last FC layers.
