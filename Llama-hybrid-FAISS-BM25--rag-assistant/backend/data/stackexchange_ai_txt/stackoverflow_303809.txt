How do I place/scale a XAML graphic in my application?

I'm working on a simple application to start learning my way around WPF. I created a vector graphic in Microsoft Expression Design at 400px by 400px, mainly because I thought it would be easier to create it on a bigger canvas. I've exported the image to a XAML file as a series of objects within a 400px square canvas. All of the child objects are positioned based on that 400px canvas. I would like to place the image in my application window, but scaled down to maybe 100px by 100px, but I don't know how to do this. As a vector image, the concept of easy scaling seems simple, but I'm missing something. Click-n-drag resizes the canvas, but not the elements inside. Internet searches have been less than useful thus far. I just want to place the image in my window... not in a button or anything special, and have easy control over its size. Do I need to copy all the XAML into my window's XAML? Can I reference the XAML file somehow instead? How can I make the elements of the image scale with the overall image? Any help would be appreciated.
