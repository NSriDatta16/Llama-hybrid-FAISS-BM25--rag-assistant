I would probably refactor the code to encourage inlining of the simple case. That said, you can use -finline-limit to make gcc consider inlining larger functions, or -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-exceptions to minimize the stack frame. (Note that the latter may break debugging and cause C++ exceptions to misbehave badly.) Probably you won't be able to get much from tweaking compiler options, though, and will have to refactor.
