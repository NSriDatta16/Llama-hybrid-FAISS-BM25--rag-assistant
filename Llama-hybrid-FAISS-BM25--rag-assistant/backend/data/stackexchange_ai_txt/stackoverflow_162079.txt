How to merge jsp pre-compiled web.xml fragment with main web.xml using Ant

We have the usual web.xml for our web application which includes some jsp and jsp tag files. I want to switch to using pre-compiled jsp's. I have the pre-compilation happening in the build ok, and it generates the web.xml fragment and now I want to merge the fragment into the main web.xml. Is there an include type directive for web.xml that will let me include the fragment. Ideally I will leave things as is for DEV- as its useful to change jsp's on the fly and see the changes immediately but then for UAT/PROD, the jsp's will be pre-compiled and thus work faster.
