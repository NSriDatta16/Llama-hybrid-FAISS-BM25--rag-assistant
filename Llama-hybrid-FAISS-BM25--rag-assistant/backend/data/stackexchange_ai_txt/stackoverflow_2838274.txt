i just followed this tut and could not get it working for hours so i made a workaround for others that might see this too. the trick lies herein onclick="this.parentNode.childNodes[0].checked=true" it goes back and than selects the first element which is in jquery style for any tab correct. with setting margin-left:-20px you get the pic behind the actual radio button. so make your background image either complete transparent or save some 25 px on the left which are transparent. then just place a image with the correct size or using the img attributes width/height this workarround does not require to mess with jquery-code, its plain simple ( Another alternative : use this "older" jquery tabs - the radio will be selected and the tab also: http://stilbuero.de/jquery/tabs/#fragment-7 )
