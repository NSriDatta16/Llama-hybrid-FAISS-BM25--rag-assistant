What is the best library to manage a wiimote?

There are many libraries that manage the wiimote but I am looking for the "best" one, or at least that has the following features: open-source portable (at least Win32 and Linux ) written and usable in c or c++ good coverage of wiimote devices I rely on people that already used such library. Google is good source of information but it doesn't know which one is best library.
