Are all of these variables 1 or 0 (true/false)? You could add them together. Are some more important than others? You could weight some higher and some lower, then add them. Another idea is to look at principal component analysis (PCA). SPSS has a function for Categorical Principal Components Analysis. This will give you the combination of your variables that gives the greatest variation. It will also take weights.
