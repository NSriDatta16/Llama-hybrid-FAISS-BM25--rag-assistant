Application:openFiles: separate files by groups

I need that my application detect how many files has been dropped to it dock icon. For this i use application:openFiles: method - (void)application:(NSApplication *)sender openFiles:(NSArray *)filenames { NSLog(@"%d",[filenames count]); } But unfortunately files sometimes separates by group. So, for example i dragged 3 files to dock icon and get this output: 2 1 How could it be?
