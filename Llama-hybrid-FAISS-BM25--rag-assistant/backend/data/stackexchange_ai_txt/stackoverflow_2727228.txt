Load a Lua script into a table named after filename

I load scripts using luaL_loadfile and then lua_pcall from my game, and was wondering if instead of loading them into the global table, I could load them into a table named after their filename? For example: I have I file called "Foo.lua", which contains this: function DoSomething() --something end After loading it I want to be able to access it like: Foo.DoSomething() Thanks!
