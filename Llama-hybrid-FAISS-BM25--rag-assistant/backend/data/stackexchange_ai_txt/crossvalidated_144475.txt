Are all models useless? Is any exact model possible -- or useful?

This question has been festering in my mind for over a month. The February 2015 issue of Amstat News contains an article by Berkeley Professor Mark van der Laan that scolds people for using inexact models. He states that by using models, statistics is then an art rather than a science. According to him, one can always use "the exact model" and that our failure to do so contributes to a "lack of rigor ... I fear that our representation in data science is becoming marginalized." I agree that we are in danger of becoming marginalized, but the threat usually comes from those who claim (sounding a lot like Professor van der Laan, it seems) that they are not using some approximate method, but whose methods are in fact far less rigorous than are carefully applied statistical models -- even wrong ones. I think it is fair to say that Prof van der Laan is rather scornful of those who repeat Box's oft-used quote, "all models are wrong, but some are useful." Basically, as I read it, he says that all models are wrong, and all are useless. Now, who am I to disagree with a Berkeley professor? On the other hand, who is he to so cavalierly dismiss the views of one of the real giants in our field? In elaborating, Dr van der Laan states that "it is complete nonsense to state that all models are wrong, ... For example, a statistical model that makes no assumptions is always true." He continues: "But often, we can do much better than that: We might know that the data are the result of $n$ independent identical experiments." I do not see how one can know that except in very narrow random-sampling or controlled experimental settings. The author points to his work in targeted maximum likelihood learning and targeted minimum loss-based learning, which "integrates the state of the art in machine learning/data-adaptive estimation, all the incredible advances in causal inference, censored data, efficiency and empirical process theory while still providing formal statistical inference." Sounds great! There are also some statements I agree with. He says that we need to take our work, our role as a statistician, and our scientific collaborators seriously. Hear hear! It is certainly bad news when people routinely use a logistic regression model, or whatever, without carefully considering whether it is adequate to answering the scientific question or if it fits the data. And I do see plenty of such abuses in questions posted in this forum. But I also see effective and valuable uses of inexact models, even parametric ones. And contrary to what he says, I have seldom been "bored to death by another logistic regression model." Such is my naivety, I guess. So here are my questions: What useful statistical inferences can be made using a model that makes no assumptions at all? Does there exist a case study, with important, real data in the use of targeted maximum likelihood? Are these methods widely used and accepted? Are all inexact models indeed useless? Is it possible to know that you have the exact model other than in trivial cases? If this is too opinion-based and hence off-topic, where can it be discussed? Because Dr van der Laan's article definitely does need some discussion.
