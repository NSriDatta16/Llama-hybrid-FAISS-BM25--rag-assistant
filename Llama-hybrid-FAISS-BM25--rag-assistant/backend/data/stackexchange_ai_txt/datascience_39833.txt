Using neural networks with jumps in stock returns

I am using an LSTM network to analyse stock return patterns. A problem is that, there is usually huge jumps in stock returns but if you are only using the trading data, the jumps would seem pretty random. (For example, the jumps from SEC ruling against or in favor of a company.) Thus, if the neural network learns too much from the jumps, the results would not generalize well. One might cap the returns or use auto encoders. What are some other methods to regularize such jumps and limit the changes the jumps cause to the network?
