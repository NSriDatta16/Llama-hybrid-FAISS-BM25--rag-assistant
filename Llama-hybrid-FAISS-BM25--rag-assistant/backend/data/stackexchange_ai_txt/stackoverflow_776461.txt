Well, I found it eventually. The parent object is drawn from a view giving three columns and no key. I can map a composite key to the HoleId and PlayerId instead of the evil guid that I found when I looked at the code. This is great as I can easily map the Score objects I need and then lazy load them using NHibernateUtil.Initialize. My mapping xml needs to look like this I got my inspiration from this post , please also pay attention to Stefan's answer as I feel I had a lucky break here, and the design could be made better with more thought about DDD. Thanks for your help.
