You cannot run the universal sentence encoder in reverse. There is no practical way to take an arbitrary embedding vector and get a sentence. My suggestion would instead be to find the sentence in your data with the embedding closest to your center. Euclidean distance works well, specially if you used K-means or another euclidean method to create your clusters.
