Yes, this is a straightforward application for neural networks. In this case yk are the outputs of the last layer ("classifier"); xk is a feature vector and yk is what it gets classified into. For simplicity prepare your data so that N is the same for all. The problem you have is perhaps that in the case of time series you won't have enough data: you need (ideally) many 1000's of examples to train a network, which in this case means time series, not points. Look at the specialized literature on neural networks for time series prediction for ideas on network architecture. Library: try Pylearn2 at http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/ It's not the only good option but it should serve you well.
