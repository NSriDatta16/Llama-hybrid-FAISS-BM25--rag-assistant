Well, your example is not very aesthetically pleasing. So I didn't bother looking at it very long. Why? Because if you are going to do demo something, do something interesting . You have to capture people's attention. So rather than some web page that fronts a db, give me a use-case I can sink my teeth into. This is why being able to whip up a demo quickly is not all that useful in and of itself (IMO). The hard part of an app isn't the execution of the idea, it's the idea itself and the refinement of it that is the long pole.
