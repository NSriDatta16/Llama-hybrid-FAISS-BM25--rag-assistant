The script loading fine on all browsers. The invalid argument only appear when you drag the slider towards zoomin in IE. If you test the plugin in in IE, you will see the error. The error does not seem to affect the functionality and only appear in IE, I install the Firebug lite, But still can't get the clear error message. What I did it. Put the following code in the master page, $(document).ready(function(arg) { $("#zoom01").gzoom({ sW: 312, sH: 312, lW: 930, lH: 930, loaderContent: "&nbsp;" }); }); And the following code in the content page where i want the image to zoom in and out.
