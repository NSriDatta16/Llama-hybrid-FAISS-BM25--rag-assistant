Test if two gamma distributed populations are different

I have data from two populations of different sizes. Both have Gamma distributions with different shapes and scales (as estimated in R): fitdistr(x/10000, "gamma") #186 members shape 0.586219900 (0.050840587); rate 0.012159695 (0.001564117); mean(x) 44.26789 fitdistr(y/10000, "gamma") #50 members shape 0.491757644 (0.080661189); rate 0.006671180 (0.001709453); mean(y) 68.15945 I want to answer the question: What is the probability that the two populations are significantly different. By different, I am referring to the mean and not to the shape and rate of the distributions. Does the average of y indicate that there is a significant change from the average of x?
