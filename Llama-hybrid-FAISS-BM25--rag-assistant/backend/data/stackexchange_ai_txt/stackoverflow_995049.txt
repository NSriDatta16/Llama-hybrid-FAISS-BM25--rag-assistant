Some things slowing down the project: Multi-site (offshore) communication (sometimes even distributed team). I tried to set up time boxed conferences (status, requirements clarification) and with strict control of things to be discussed. Of course, with meeting minutes in the end, so no further discussions on what has been decided. Continuous changes from the customer. They tend to be verbal, asked directly to the development team, fragmenting the development/testing team. I use to force a single point of communication when it comes to changes - the change control board. The handling of the changes (analysis, technical solution, planning, etc.) is done and in this control board. The conclusions are documented. The small changes are planned and handled as a bulk, for the sake of efficiency. Updating technical documentation - this looks like a slowdown from development perspective, but it usually pays back on other activities (handling changes, discussions with the customer, onboarding, etc). So it must be done :). What shouldn't be done is to put too many details adds little value. However, the right degree of details... there's no rule to find it out :). I almost forgot: "Analysis - Paralysis": thinking too much (on a technical solution). Having second thoughts, etc. This will definetly slow down the development as a whole. Adopting a pragmatic attitude might help.
