Determine if there is an influence of newspaper articles on stock quotation

Lets assume there is a company called "XY", which is listed in the NASDAQ. Lets further assume that newspapers are frequently reporting about company XY, either in a positive, neutral or a negative way. I am trying to figure out whether there is an influence of positive themed newspaper articles about company XY on the stock price of company XY or not. For this reason I gathered and classified all newspaper articles about company XY. Then I created a N-dimensional data matrix (with n = 4 columns), containing the stock price of company XY as a time series (1000 days), the associated NASDAQ index for each day, a dummy variable for a positive article (1 = positive ; 0 = neutral or negative) and a dummy variable for special events (like the release of quarterly figures). So far, I only worked with (S)ARIMA and (S)ARIMAX (including external regressors) models. I guess that the variance in stock prices is conditionally influenced by the previous variance, so I thought ARCH or GARCH would be a good model to start with. Unfortunately, I do not have the experience to judge if this is a good idea or if there are other types of models that probably can handle the described conditions better than GARCH. So my actual questions are: Is is possible to include external regressors (e.g. the dummy variables) in a GARCH model? Is there another model class which fits the described issue better?
