Comparison of bayesian multinomial logistic regression models

my independent variable has 3 categories, and I have 7 independent variables. I am trying to build several Bayesian multinomial logistic regression models but I couldn't find any package for this in R. Are there any packages to handle this? Thank you so much for your help.
