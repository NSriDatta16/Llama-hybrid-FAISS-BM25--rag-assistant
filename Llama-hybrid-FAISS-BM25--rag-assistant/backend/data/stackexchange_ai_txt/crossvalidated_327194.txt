I've generally been advised to run a main effects-only model before running a model with interaction effects. The latter can be tricky to interpret. But, to your questions. Let's assume that time is coded in months (and you had measures at baseline, then 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). 2) The average change in log-hyperreactivity (in females, age 0, with bronchitis) is 0.00819 units per month. But remember, you logged your DV. 3) The coefficient for no bronchitis (that's the variable bronchno ) means this: those without bronchitis had baseline log-hyperreactivity measures 0.0395 less than those with. 1) For bronchitis: those without bronchitis have an growth rate in log-hyperreactivity of 0.0053 units less than those with. It's a bit harder to comprehend continuous-continuous interactions, but the explanation is similar. Here, each unit of BMI was associated with a 0.0129 unit increase in log-hyperreactivity at baseline, but a lower growth rate in log-hyperreactivity.
