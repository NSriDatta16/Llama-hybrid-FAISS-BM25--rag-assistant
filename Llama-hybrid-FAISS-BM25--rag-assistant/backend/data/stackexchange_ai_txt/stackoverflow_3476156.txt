Google Appengine problem with SVN repositry

Hello there stackoverflow, I have a Google Appengine project. I've decided to SVN it. I get an error I've never seen from the Google Appengine: com.google.appengine.tools.info.LocalVersionFactory getVersion INFO: Could not find API version from E:\ws\msgServ\war\WEB-INF\lib.svn java.io.FileNotFoundException: E:\ws\msgServ\war\WEB-INF\lib.svn (Access is denied) It seems to be looking for a '.svn' file under the project's 'WEB-INF\lib' directory. Of course, being version-controlled, it has a '.svn' subdir to each directory of the project, including the above mentioned directory. Does any1 know how to circumvent this? I may point out, that this project did not begin as a version controlled one, but as a regular GAE project. I then created a proper repository, and drag-dropped all project files by hand. (I'm using Eclipse, with Subclipse and the GAE plugin) Suggestions? David
