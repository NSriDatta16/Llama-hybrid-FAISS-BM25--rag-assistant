Can a convolutional neural network take as input images of different sizes?

I'm working on a convolution network for image recognition, and I was wondering if I could input images of different sizes (not hugely different though). On this project: https://github.com/harvardnlp/im2markup They say: and group images of similar sizes to facilitate batching So even after preprocessing, the images are still of different sizes, which makes sense since they won't cut out some part of the formula. Are there any issues in using different sizes ? If there are, how should I approach this problem (since formulas won't all fit in the same image size) ? Any input will be much appreciated
