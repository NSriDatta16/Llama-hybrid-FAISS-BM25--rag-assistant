I am also new to statistics, but I think I can answer your questions in a basic way. Variance Suppose you have these two datasets: $\{10, 20, 30, 40\}$ and $\{24, 25, 26\}$. Both have the arithmetic mean $ \mu = 25 $ but their variance is very different. You want to know the average variance around the mean. To do that, you take the deviations from the mean and divide them by the number of items in the data set: $$ \frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})}{N} $$ So for the latter example, it would be $ \frac{(24-25)+(26-25)}{3}$. However the answer here would be $ = 0 $ because the positive and the negative deviations neutrilize each other. So that's why we introduce variance ($ \sigma^{2} $): $$ \sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{N} $$ By squaring the deviations, we are removing the neutrilizing effect of averaging the deviations. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance: $ \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^{2}} $ Another way of doing this would be to use the Mean Average Deviation (MAD) by converting the deviations to absolute values: $$ MAD = \frac{\sum\mid{x_{i}-\bar{x} \ \mid}}{N} $$ Empirical rule The 68 % you are referring to in regards to the standard deviation is part of what's known as the Empirical rule . Empirical studies have shown that when a distribution is normally distributed (bell-shaped curve), it is very probable that: $ 68 \%$ of all values in the distribution are likely to be found within $ \pm1 \sigma $ (1 standard deviation) from the mean $ \mu $. $ 95 \%$ of all values in the distribution are likely to be found within $ \pm2 \sigma $ (2 standard deviations) from the mean $ \mu $. $ 99.7 \%$ of all values in the distribution are likely to be found within $ \pm3 \sigma $ (3 standard deviations) from the mean $ \mu $. So if you know the standard deviation ( the average variance ) of a data set, you know that 95 % of all values can be found within the double range of the average variance's range. If the mean is $\mu = 200$ and the standard deviation is $ \sigma = 40 $, then 95 % of the values can be found in the range 120 â€“ 280: $ -2\sigma Geometric mean Has been answered elsewhere as per the comment above, but one reason (not specific to statistics) would be because there has been a compounding of values, where the arithmetic mean would give the wrong impression. See this link relating to finance for instance.
