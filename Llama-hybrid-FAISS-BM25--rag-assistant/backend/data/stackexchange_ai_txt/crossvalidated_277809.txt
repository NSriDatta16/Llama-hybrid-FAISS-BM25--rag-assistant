Have a look at this tutorial: http://machinelearningmastery.com/sequence-classification-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/ This is NLP but the goal is to classify text instead of predicting the next word. As a matter fact it is much easier to do the classification since you can just feed the output of RNN layer into softmax layer with 2 outputs (class 0 or 1)
