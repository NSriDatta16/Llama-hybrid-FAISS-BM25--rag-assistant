The fact that you're facing questions like this is a strong code smell that your data model is flawed. If you need unique constrained, then they should be enforced by an unique constraint. In other words, the 'BEF', 'ABD' full ID should be explicitly persisted in storage somewhere and uniqueness enforced on the full id column with an ordinary unique index.
