Parse Exception: At line 1, column 0: no element found

I have a weird issue. I receive the following error that causes a force-close: org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatParser$ParseException: At line 1, column 0: no element found at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatParser.parseFragment(ExpatParser.java:508) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatParser.parseDocument(ExpatParser.java:467) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatReader.parse(ExpatReader.java:329) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatReader.parse(ExpatReader.java:286) After clicking the Force Close button, the Activity is recreated and the parsing completes without a hitch. I'm using the following code snippet inside doInBackground of an AsyncTask: URL serverAddress = new URL(url[0]); HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) serverAddress.openConnection(); connection.setRequestMethod("GET"); connection.setDoOutput(true); connection.setReadTimeout(10000); connection.connect(); InputStream stream = connection.getInputStream(); SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance(); SAXParser sp = spf.newSAXParser(); XMLReader xr = sp.getXMLReader(); xr.parse(new InputSource(stream)); // The line that throws the exception Why would the Activity force-close and then run without any problems immediately after? Would a BufferedInputStream be any different? I'm baffled. :( Thanks for your time everyone. Update: It turns out HttpURLConnection.getResponseCode() returns -1 every so often, so the InputStream probably isn't being correctly set.
