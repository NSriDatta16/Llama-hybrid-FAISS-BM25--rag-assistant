How to cluster skills in job domain?

I have a problem related to clustering, where i need to cluster skill set from job domain. Let's say, in a resume a candidate can mention they familiarity with amazon s3 bucket. But each people can mention it in any way. For example, amazon s3 s3 aws s3 For a human, we can easily understand these three are exactly equivalent. I can't use kmeans type of clustering because it can fail in a lot of cases. For example, spring spring framework Spring MVC Spring Boot These may fall in the same cluster which is wrong. A candidate who knows spring framework might not know sprint boot etc., The similarity of a word based on the embeddings/bow model fails here. What are the options I have? Currently, I manually collected a lot of word variations in a dict format, key is root word value is an array of variations of that root word. Any help is really appreciated.
