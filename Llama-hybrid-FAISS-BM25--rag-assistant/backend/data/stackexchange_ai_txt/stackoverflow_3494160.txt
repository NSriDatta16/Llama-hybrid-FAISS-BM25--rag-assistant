Oddly enough when I tried this again in a new project it did not happen. In the first project where I got this error I manually created the XAML and the references to the DLLs necessary, as well as the XMLNS declarations. In the second project I let Visual Studio take care of it by dragging the control in from the Toolbox. I guess when I did things manually I must've done something to make it not work right in the designer. But I don't know what.
