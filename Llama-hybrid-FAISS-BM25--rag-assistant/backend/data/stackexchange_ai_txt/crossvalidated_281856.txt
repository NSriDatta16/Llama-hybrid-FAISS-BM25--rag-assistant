Why do ensemble models work better when we ensemble models of low correlation?

New to machine learning and have been reading about ensemble modelling. A statement that keeps reappearing is: "Ensemble models work better when we ensemble models of low correlation." I've seen examples, but I can't find an explanation for why this case? Could anyone shed some light?
