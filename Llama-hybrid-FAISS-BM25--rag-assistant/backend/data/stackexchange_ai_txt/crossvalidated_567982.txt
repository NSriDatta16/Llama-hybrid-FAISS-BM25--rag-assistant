This is not outrageous. The logistic regression aims to minimize log loss, $L(y,\hat y) = -\sum\bigg[y_i\log(\hat y_i) + (1 - y_i)\log(1 -\hat y_i) \bigg]$ . Whatever your OLS-based model does, the competing logistic regression is not trying to optimize your metric of interest, so I find it completely believable that an alternative estimation method for the coefficients gives superior performance in terms of AUC.
