Visualizing an interaction effect of a Logistic Regression Analysis (in SPSS)

What would be the best way to go about visualizing an interaction effect of a Logistic Regression Analysis (preferably using SPSS)? There is a significant interaction between one interval (HDI) and one binary (before/after Fukushima) variable as well as between that same interval variable (HDI) and another interval variable (share of non-renewable electricity consumption). The dependent variable is binary (ecological benefits of solar power mentioned in news article about topic yes/no). Failing any kind of more specific way of doing this, what would be more general steps to arrive at some visualization? Is a visualization even a good idea? (For context: Until now I have been looking at interactions using ANOVA where plotting interaction effects is straightforward. Those visualizations have been tremendously helpful and I would like something similar for this.)
