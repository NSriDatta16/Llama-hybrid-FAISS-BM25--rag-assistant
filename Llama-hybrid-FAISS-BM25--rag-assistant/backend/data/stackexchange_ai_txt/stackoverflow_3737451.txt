You will need type casting when you are down casting. upcasting is auto and is safe, that is why the compiler never issues a warning/error. But when you are downcasting you are actually placing a value which has higher precision than the type of variable you are storing it in that is why the compiler wants you to be sure and you need to explicitly down cast.
