Don't set the style object itself, set the background color property of the style object that is a property of the element. And yes, even though you said no, jquery and tablesorter with its zebra stripe plugin can do this all for you in 3 lines of code. And just setting the class attribute would be better since then you have non-hard-coded control over the styling which is more organized
