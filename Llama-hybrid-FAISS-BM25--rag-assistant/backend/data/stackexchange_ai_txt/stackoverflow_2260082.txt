If you can access self.total_sold , you can access self.tax_rate (which is the same thing as Item.tax_rate unless you stomp on it -- so you just don't stomp of it, keep the tax rate as a pristine class variable, and access it through self. !-). That would be much more solid than mucking through the stack, especially with nested decorators in the picture, which more or less guarantees fragile, specific-version-dependent code (stack introspection is meant to be used for debugging purposes, essentially, not for production purposes).
