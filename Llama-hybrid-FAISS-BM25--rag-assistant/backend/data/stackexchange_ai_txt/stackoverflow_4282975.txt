can I change the look and feel of the clickablespan

I have to embed a clickable text in a paragraph text, clickablespan can do it. But instead of using the default focus/press/unfocus style, can I change those style ? Like when focus, the background color is blue, text color is white, when unfocus, the background color is white, text color is blue.
