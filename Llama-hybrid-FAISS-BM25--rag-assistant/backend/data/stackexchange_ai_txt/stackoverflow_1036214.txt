I had previously done up #7. It was the first time I used Windbg and so I didn't know what to do with the address to find the references. Here is what I got. Address MT Size 0131c9c0 55cd21d8 84 013479e0 55cd21d8 84 044dabe0 55cd21d8 84 total 3 objects Statistics: MT Count TotalSize Class Name 55cd21d8 3 252 System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument Total 3 objects 0:011> !gcroot 0131c9c0 Note: Roots found on stacks may be false positives. Run "!help gcroot" for more info. Scan Thread 0 OSTHread 47c Scan Thread 2 OSTHread be8 Scan Thread 4 OSTHread 498 DOMAIN(001657B0):HANDLE(WeakSh):911788:Root:0131ff98(System.EventHandler)-> 0131fcd4(System.Windows.Documents.AdornerLayer)-> 012fad68(MemoryTesting.Window2)-> 0131c9c0(System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument) DOMAIN(001657B0):HANDLE(WeakSh):911cb0:Root:0131ca90(MS.Internal.PtsHost.PtsContext)-> 0131cb14(MS.Internal.PtsHost.PtsContext+HandleIndex[])-> 0133d668(MS.Internal.PtsHost.TextParagraph)-> 0131c9c0(System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument) DOMAIN(001657B0):HANDLE(WeakSh):9124a8:Root:01320a2c(MS.Internal.PtsHost.FlowDocumentPage)-> 0133d5d0(System.Windows.Documents.TextPointer)-> 0131ca14(System.Windows.Documents.TextContainer)-> 0131c9c0(System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument) (I put it in a code block for easier reading). This is after I closed the window. So it looks like it is being referenced by a few things. Now that I know this how do I go about freeing up these references so they can release the FlowDocument. Thanks for your help. I feel like I am finally gaining some ground.
