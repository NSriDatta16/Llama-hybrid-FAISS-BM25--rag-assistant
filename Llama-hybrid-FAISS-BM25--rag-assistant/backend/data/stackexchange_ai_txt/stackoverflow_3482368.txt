jQuery class selector and 'this' reference

Here is a problem: i need to select elements on page by css class, and then set their width = parentElement.width - 1. So code looks like this: $j('.innerCellElement').width(this.parentElement.clientWidth - 1); When i say this i mean current element of selector. However, is not interpreted how i want. I can do loops here but i want to know if there is an elegant way of solving this problem.
