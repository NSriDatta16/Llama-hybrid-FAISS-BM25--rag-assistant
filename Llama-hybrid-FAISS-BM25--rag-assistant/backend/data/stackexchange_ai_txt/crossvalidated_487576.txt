Unbalanced Groups and One-Way ANOVA (what is the formula)?

In typical ANOVA, we have deviation of group means from grand means (sum of squared treatment). If data is unbalanced, would it still be the deviation of group mean from grand mean (weighted by number of observations)? Or, would it instead be the deviation of group mean from the average of the group means? Is there a good resource that goes into talking about the intuition and math behind unbalanced groups? I have seen posts saying analysis is fine as long as groups are normal and have common variance.
