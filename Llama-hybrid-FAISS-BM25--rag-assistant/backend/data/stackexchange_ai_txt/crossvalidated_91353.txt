Probability Given Datapoint Does Not Appear in a Bootstrap Sample?

I received this question for a Statistics / Machine Learning assignment and I'd like to you if any of you know the proper answer. If we have n data points, what is the probability that a given data point does not appear in a bootstrap sample? Sounds simple enough right? I'm reading Introduction to Statistical Learning to try and find the solution but I would definitely appreciate some help
