Non-response in organization survey

I am a research analyst and recently conducted an employee satisfaction survey at the organization I work for. Ideally, I should have received completed questionnaires from all 380 employees (making it more like a census rather than a survey), but I got responses from 204 people, that is, just slightly above 50%. Am I right that I cannot treat the received responses as a "random sample" of all employees?
