Classify Spanish Text into different Categories

I want to recommend articles to users depending upon what type of article is user reading, Music, Movies, Politics, etc. I have 3 features: Page Title, Labels, article content. I am using an API (meaning cloud) on the Page Title feature which follows a taxonomy(IAB) for categorizing the articles into different segments. But the API is not able to label everything. 50% Uncategorized. I have tried using Basic ML models Naive Bayes for categorizing the remaining 50% by training the model on the categorized set, but the accuracy is low. *What can be done to segment these articles into different clusters or segments so that a recommendation can be given for each type of article? from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC text_clf = Pipeline([('vect', CountVectorizer()), ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()), ('clf', LinearSVC()), ]) text_clf.fit(X_train, y_train) predicted = text_clf.predict(X_test) print(metrics.classification_report(y_test, predicted)) Precision Recall F1 Score Support accuracy 0.75 422 macro avg 0.50 0.29 0.35 422 weighted avg 0.74 0.75 0.72 422
