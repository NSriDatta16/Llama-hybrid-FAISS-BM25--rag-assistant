When you declare "sayHello" (does anybody remember that Charlotte Church song? Gosh, the memories ...) inside the "ready" function, it's local to that function. You can make it global if you like by doing this: window['sayHello'] = function sayHello(what) { alert(what); }; (It's nice to give the function a "local" name — the name after the "function" keyword — because then the function won't show up as "anonymous" in Firebug.) I would encourage you to investigate making your global function into a jQuery plugin, or at least a jQuery "global" by putting it on the jQuery object instead of "window".
