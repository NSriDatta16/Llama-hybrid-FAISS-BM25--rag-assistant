help with formula to calculate Bayesian ranking of M-star reviews

I wonder, if someone could help to understand a formula from a book please. Bayesian Methods for Hackers: Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics) (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics) by Cameron Davidson-Pilon Davidson-Pilon See also this . This is the formula: I am not 100% sure what N and S is. Let us say there are 2 ratings. 1 for star 4 and 1 for star 5. Would N = 2 (2 ratings/votes/users) and S = 4 + 5 = 9? Thanks! PS: I think this is related to this , which I am sorry goes right over my head.
