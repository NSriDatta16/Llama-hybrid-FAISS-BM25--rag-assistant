Take a look at http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/#new-elements to decide whether HTML 5 has enough new features useful to you to make it harder for people using old browsers. Be aware though that most modern browsers have only implemented bits of HTML 5. The video and audio tags are relevant to games but browser implementors are still actively working on implementing those. Then there are things like canvas and local storage which are not in HTML 4 but which are widely supported already.
