Finding Clusters in Arbitrage Sites

I'm much more of a computer scientist than a statistician, so this question is a bit far from my area of expertise, but should fit in here. Suppose I have a video game where there are ten cities or so that the player can visit with a ship. Each city sells and buys goods, with the goods being the same everywhere, but their price changing by city and each city selling goods for more than they're buying them. Imagine that the player occasionally writes two lists, one with the list of cities where a good G is being sold for the lowest price and one where that good is bought for the highest price. This is essentially a record of maximally profitable arbitrage opportunities. Suppose I want to take that record and cluster the cities based on how similar their prices are to each other. Is there some special type of clustering method that is perfect for this scenario or should I just fiddle with a k-means clustering until I get good-looking results? Edit: Here's some sample data. {'low_ask' : 3.15, 'low_cities' : ['A', 'B'], 'high_bid': 3.23, 'high_cities': ['E', 'F'], 'product': 'pineapples'} {'low_ask' : 9.82, 'low_cities' : ['D'], 'high_bid': 9.97, 'high_cities': ['B', 'C'], 'product': 'cigars'} This would mean that the cheapest place to buy cigars and pineapples is for 3.15 and 9.82 from the low_cities listed and the best place to sell them would be for 3.23 and 9.97 from the high_cities listed. I have a few dozen maybe a few hundred of these datapoints.
