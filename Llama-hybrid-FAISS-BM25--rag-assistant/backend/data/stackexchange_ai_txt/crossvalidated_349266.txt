With each statistic, you're still checking whether it would exceed the critical value. For a given test statistic, knowing that it doesn't exceed the critical value because its absolute value is less than 1 doesn't alter the fact that you looked at its size and figured out whether that statistic fell in the rejection region. Which is to say, you still did a test. Consider the following scenario. We have a large collection of t-statistics (say 100 of them), all with df between 55 and 60, on each of which we need to perform a two-tailed t-test. We each take the collection of statistics and find out which ones were rejections: A) For each test statistic, I find the relevant critical value and either reject or fail to reject the null. Let's say I decided "not reject" on 30 of them and "reject" on 70 of them. This is how things normally work, and clearly I did 100 tests. B) You happen know that the critical value for $\nu=60$ is above 2, and it's higher still for $\nu When you took approach B did you really do 29 fewer tests than I did under scheme A? You still started with 100 test statistics, and you still classified them as 'reject' or 'not reject' -- you just split that decision up into two stages -- (i) don't reject any with $|t| [Or consider it this way: we know the first approach is correct. If you come up with any scheme that organizes the same work differently and it comes up with a different count of how many tests you did, you must have counted wrong.]
