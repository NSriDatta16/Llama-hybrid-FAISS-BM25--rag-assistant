Are there recommended methods for interpolating sparse time series?

I'm using sparse in a specific (but perhaps incorrect) way. Shown below is a time series of prices 2016-05-18 0.9118613142872591 2016-05-19 0.8921613140413168 2016-05-20 0.8848059412022842 2016-05-26 0.8755275321301189 2016-05-27 0.8805152228524439 2016-06-23 0.9245819516881806 2016-06-24 0.9110491341479788 2016-07-01 0.9347510668648712 2016-07-02 0.9053273268112989 2016-07-21 0.9683684001482084 2016-07-22 0.9633580372935682 2016-08-25 0.960932583607675 2016-08-26 0.944715028971071 2016-09-22 0.9778171436955735 2016-09-23 0.9627294268056957 2016-10-06 0.9594016269961939 2016-10-07 0.9371322186184987 2016-10-08 0.9165331880285734 2016-10-14 0.954074826216688 2016-10-15 0.921738772482935 2016-10-20 0.9297582568533065 2016-10-21 0.9209454873374863 I have some points in time which are quite close, and others which are nearly a month away from one another. Linear regression was one suggested method. I think this is inappropriate because the nature of the product is highly non-linear, and the nature of the noise is likely not consistent with the assumptions of linear regression. I've also tried Gaussian Process Regression, but because the data are far apart in the domain, GPR does not perform well. I've thought about doing ARIMA, but that is usually for forecasting and not interpolation, right?
