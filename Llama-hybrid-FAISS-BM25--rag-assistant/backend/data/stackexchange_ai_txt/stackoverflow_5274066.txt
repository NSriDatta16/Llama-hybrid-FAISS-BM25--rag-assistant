Create a Mvc2 Project with Razor View Engine

I've read how to use Spark View Engine instead of Webform View Engine in a Mvc2 Project so I think we can do the same with Razor View Engine but when I search on GOOGLE, I cant find anything helpful. So, to you pros I post this question. Please help! Thanks so much! Attention: Razor in Mvc2 project, not in Mvc3. Thanks again!
