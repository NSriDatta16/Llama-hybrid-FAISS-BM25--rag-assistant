Picking the nearest value from an array reflecting ranges

I have an array that reflects rebate percentages depending on the number of items ordered: $rebates = array( 1 => 0, 3 => 10, 5 => 25, 10 => 35) meaning that for one or two items, you get no rebate; for 3+ items you get 10%, for 5+ items 20%, for 10+ 35% and so on. Is there an elegant , one-line way to get the correct rebate percentage for an arbitrary number of items, say 7 ? Obviously, this can be solved using a simple loop: That's not what I'm looking for. I'm interested whether there is a core array or other function that I don't know of that can do this more elegantly. I'm going to award the accepted answer a bounty of 200, but apparently, I have to wait 24 hours until I can do that. The question is solved.
