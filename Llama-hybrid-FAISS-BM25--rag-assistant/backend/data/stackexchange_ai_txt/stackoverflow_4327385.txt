I assume it has something to do with how you generated the Android project. Typically mine creates an hdpi, mdpi, and ldpi folder. Basically, "drawable" is the default. If you have all of your resources in the hdpi folder, and try to run it on an ldpi device, I believe you will get an exception of some kind (I have not tested this, but I believe this to be the case). A detailed explanation of what happens without default resources is explained here . You should keep a default collection of resources in the main "drawable" folder (that yes, you may have to create manually) just to be on the safe side, and to ensure compatibility with older versions of Android. Android will check the specific density folders first, but will roll back to the default drawable folder if it cannot find that specific resource in that density.
