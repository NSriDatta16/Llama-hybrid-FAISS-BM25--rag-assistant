There is a method called partial least square that is something very close to what you are trying to do. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression The choice to use the PCA transformation of the data can lead to a better estimation of the output $y$ but to understand the role of the original variables will be more difficult. I suggest you to start with the lasso estimator https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_%28statistics%29#Lasso_method
