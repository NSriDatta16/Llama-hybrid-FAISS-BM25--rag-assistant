Strategies for populating a Reporting/Data Warehouse database

For our reporting application, we have a process that aggregates several databases into a single 'reporting' database on a nightly basis. The schema of the reporting database is quite different than that of the separate 'production' databases that we are aggregating so there is a good amount of business logic that goes into how the data is aggregated. Right now this process is implemented by several stored procedures that run nightly. As we add more details to the reporting database the logic in the stored procedures keeps growing more fragile and unmanageable. What are some other strategies that could be used to populate this reporting database? SSIS? This has been considered but doesn't appear to offer a much cleaner, more maintainable approach that just the stored procedures. A separate C# (or whatever language) process that aggregates the data in memory and then pushes it into the reporting database? This would allow us to write Unit Tests for the logic and organize the code in a much more maintainable manner. I'm looking for any new ideas or additional thoughts on the above. Thanks!
