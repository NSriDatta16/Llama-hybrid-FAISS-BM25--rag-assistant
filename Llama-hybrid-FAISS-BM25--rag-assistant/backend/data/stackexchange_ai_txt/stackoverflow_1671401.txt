Unable to output MySQL tables which involve dates in Sequel

I'm trying to use Sequel to access a MySQL database in Ruby. When I try accessing a table which involves a date column, I am presented with an error. When I access a table without, it functions fine. What is wrong? Example Code: require 'rubygems' require 'sequel' DB = Sequel.connect(:adapter=>'mysql', :host=>'localhost', :database=>'db', :user=>'user', :password=>'password') event = DB[:table] puts event.all Error: /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/date.rb:956:in `new_by_frags': ArgumentError: invalid date (Sequel::InvalidValue) The error is not shown when a table which does not feature a date is accessed. This is running on Debian.
