Create XML Nodes based on XPath?

Does anyone know of an existing means of creating an XML hierarchy programatically from an XPath expression? For example if I have an XML fragment such as: Given the XPath expression /feed/entry/content/@source I would have: I realize this is possible using XSLT but due to the dynamic nature of what I'm trying to accomplish a fixed transformation won't work. I am working in C# but if someone has a solution using some other language please chime in. Thanks for the help!
