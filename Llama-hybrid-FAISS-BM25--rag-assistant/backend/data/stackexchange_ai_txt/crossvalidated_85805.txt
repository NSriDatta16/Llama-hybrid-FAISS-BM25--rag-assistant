Validating statistical tests for value at risk and expected shortfall

I am trying to figure out if value-at-risk (VaR, a quantile) type tests could capture if expected shortfall (expectations above a quantile) point forecast generated from a type of model could be regarded as accurate or not. I base my curiosity from this quote from a document by the Basel Committee : Whether specialised ES backtests are good or not, one simple option is always available: during an ES calculation, the VaR at the same can be generated as a by-product with low additional effort. One can backtest this VaR with traditional methods; if the VaR is rejected, the corresponding ES calculation can hardly be correct. Since it is possible to define expected shortfall as the average of all the value-at-risk estimates exceeding a risk level, this logic could be extended as to saying: if it is likely that the expected shortfall is correct, then we could validate some value-at-risk estimates included in expected shortfall; if they are accepted, then we have increased confidence in the expected shortfall estimate. Assume I have such a test called X. My question is now, if I wanted to test the quality of my test from my knowledge, it is possible to use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the power of X, but are there any statistical tools/procedures that could tell me if X could tell me anything about expected shortfall?
