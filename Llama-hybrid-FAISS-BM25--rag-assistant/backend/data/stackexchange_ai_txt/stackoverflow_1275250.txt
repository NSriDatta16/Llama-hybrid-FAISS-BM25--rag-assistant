Is there an easy way to convert HTML with multiple tags into proper surrounding tags in Javascript?

Let's say I have a bunch of HTML like below: bla bla bla long paragraph here bla bla bla more paragraph text Is there an easy way with Javascript to convert it to properly semantic tags? E.g.: bla bla bla long paragraph here bla bla bla more paragraph text Output spacing is not important, ideally it will work with any input spacing. I'm thinking I might try to cook up a regex, but before I do that I wanted to make sure I was a) avoiding a world of hurt and b) there wasn't something else out there - I'd tried to do a google search but haven't yet come up with anything. Thanks for any advice!
