If you are using aspx, you do not need to parse the query string using JavaScript, or even use . You can POST the form to the second aspx page, extract the value in C# or VB then write it to a client-side JavaScript variable. Something like this: page1.aspx : page2.aspx : var myHiddenClientValue = ' '; The above would set the client-side JavaScript variable called myHiddenClientValue to a value of 'myHiddenServerValue' after the POST. This can be a bad idea because if myHiddenServerField contains single quotes or a newline character, then setting it on the client in page2.aspx can fail. Embedding ASP.NET Server Variables in Client JavaScript and Embedding ASP.NET Server Variables in Client JavaScript, Part 2 deals with specifically these issues, and solves them with a server-side class that ensures values being written to the client are escaped correctly.
