After reading above post , I want to give another different answer. For tree based models, such as random forest, they can't extrapolate the value beyond the training set. So, I don't think it is an over fitting problem, but an wrong modeling strategy. So, what can we do for time series prediction with tree model? The possible way is to combine it with linear regression: first, detrend the time series (or modeling trend with linear regression), then modeling the residual with trees (residuals are bounded, so tree models can handle it). Besides, there is a tree model combined with linear regression can extrapolate, called cubist, it does linear regression on the leaf.
