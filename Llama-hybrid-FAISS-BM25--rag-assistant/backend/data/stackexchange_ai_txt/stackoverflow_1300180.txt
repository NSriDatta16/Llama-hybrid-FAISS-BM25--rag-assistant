Ignore OpenMP on machine that does not have it

I have a C++ program using OpenMP, which will run on several machines that may have or not have OpenMP installed. How could I make my program know if a machine has no OpenMP and ignore those #include , OpenMP directives (like #pragma omp parallel ... ) and/or library functions (like tid = omp_get_thread_num(); ) ?
