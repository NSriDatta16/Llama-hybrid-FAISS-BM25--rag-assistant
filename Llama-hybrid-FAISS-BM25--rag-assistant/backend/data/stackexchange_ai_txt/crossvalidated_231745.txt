How do I cross-correlate timestamps?

Cross-correlation compares the correlation between two time series at different time lags. Normally, this is done when the time series are represented as time series, i.e. vectors of signal magnitude at each point in time. For example Matlab's xcorr accepts time series vectors, whose length represents the total amount of time of the time series. E.g., x = [1.1 1.2 1.9 1.6] y = [2.1 2.2 -1.2 -1.5] would be two time series. x would encode that the value of x was 1.1 at time1, 1.2 at time2, etc., whereas y would encode that the value of y was 2.1 at time1, 2.2 at time2, etc. What if you have timestamped events instead of a time series? So you have a vector of event times, whose length is the number of events observed instead of the total length of time over which it was recorded. For example, if you have the timestamps of tweets generated by two twitter feeds. E.g., x = [1.213 2.200 2.303 10.259] y = [1.1 3.39 20.38] would be two vectors, x encoding that four x events occurred at t=1.213 sec, 2.200 sec, 2.303 sec, and 10.259 sec, whereas only three y events occurred, at t = 1.1 sec, 3.39 sec, and 20.38 sec. I know that you could use the timestamps to generate very long binary time series with 0 everywhere except at the times that the timestamps correspond to. This seems incredibly inefficient in terms of memory and prematurely reduces your temporal precision because precise timestamps must be converted into imprecise time bins. Is there a built in Matlab function for doing such a cross correlation?
