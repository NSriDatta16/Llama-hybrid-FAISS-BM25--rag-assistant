Normal distribution and monotonic transformations

I've heard that a lot of quantities that occur in nature are normally distributed. This is typically justified using the central limit theorem, which says that when you average a large number of iid random variables, you get a normal distribution. So, for instance, a trait that is determined by the additive effect of a large number of genes may be approximately normally distributed since the gene values may behave roughly like iid random variables. Now, what confuses me is that the property of being normally distributed is clearly not invariant under monotonic transformations. So, if there are two ways of measuring something that are related by a monotonic transformation, they are unlikely to both be normally distributed (unless that monotonic transformation is linear). For instance, we can measure the sizes of raindrops by diameter, by surface area, or by volume. Assuming similar shapes for all raindrops, the surface area is proportional to the square of the diameter, and the volume is proportional to the cube of the diameter. So all of these ways of measuring cannot be normally distributed. So my question is whether the particular way of scaling (i.e., the particular choice of monotonic transformation) under which the distribution does become normal, must carry a physical significance. For instance, should heights be normally distributed or the square of height, or the logarithm of height, or the square root of height? Is there a way of answering that question by understanding the processes that affect height?
