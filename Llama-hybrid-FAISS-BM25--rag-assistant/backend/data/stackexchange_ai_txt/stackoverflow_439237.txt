Check the XSLT has: edit: explanation from comments By default XSLT outputs as XML(1) which means it will escape any significant characters. You can override this in specific instances with the attribute disable-output-escaping="yes" (intro here ) but much more powerful is to change the output to the explicit value of HTML which confides same benefit globally, as the following: For script and style elements, replace any escaped characters (such as & and >) with their actual values (& and >, respectively). For attributes, replace any occurrences of > with >. Write empty elements such as , , and without closing tags or slashes. Write attributes that convey information by their presence as opposed to their value, such as checked and selected, in minimized form. from a solid IBM article covering the subject, more recent coverage from stylusstudio here If HTML output is what you desire HTML output is what you should specify. (1) There is actually corner case where output defaults to HTML, but I don't think it's universal and it's kind of obtuse to depend on it.
