Individual differences in response time (RT) experiment - searching for the right test

Given a distribution of response times to different categorical variables, what's the best way to test for individual differences? or more specifically: There are 100 people pressing buttons in 10 colors, with more than 200k presses collected altogether. I want to test for individual differences in response-time (RT) to the buttons, what's the best way to do this? (remember there are differences in response time in-between the different colors). So far I thought of: ANOVA - calculate a general (weighted) mean RT and compare to individual people. The distribution level: compare the mean distribution of RT to individual distributions using: chi-squared for goodness of fit Kullback–Leibler divergence test Kolmogorov–Smirnov test Find a cool bayesian way to do it (which?) Use a mixed-effect regression model, and calculate the marginal contribution of the people (R square test). please help me decide - what's the best practice here? I'd love to learn about another way I didn't think of that would do the trick.
