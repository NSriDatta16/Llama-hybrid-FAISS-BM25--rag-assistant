Thanks for posting your data, Carlos. Please bear in mind that I am not an ecologist, so I cannot speak to whether what I propose makes sense in your field. However, given your data, I would suggest you consider a two-level (mixed effects) model, with the 5 yearly observations nested within 30 plots. I would treat sampling site as a fixed factor with three levels because, as you suspect, there are not enough levels to treat it as a random factor, unless you are comfortable going with a Bayesian approach. In lmer : m1 One element that you should carefully consider is how to treat year. Do you expect there to be any sort of systematic linear or otherwise trend in your outcome as a function of time (year). And would that effect vary across your plots? If yes, then you might consider a so-called growth curve model: m2 This allows for an average linear effect of year (the fixed predictor) and then allows for variation in this linear trend for each plot (the random slope for year). If this doesn't seem reasonable, then you can account for year as a set of fixed predictors that have the effect of estimating the associations between predictors and outcome within years: m3
