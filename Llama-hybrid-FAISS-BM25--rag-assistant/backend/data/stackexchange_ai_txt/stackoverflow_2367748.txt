I began programming about the same time I entered my pre-algebra class.. So I wouldn't say math is all that important, though it can help in certain types of programming, especially functional. I haven't taken Discrete Math yet, but I see a lot of theory stuff with programming written in a math-notation that is taught in this class. Also, make sure you know how to calculate anything in any base, especially base 2, 8, and 16. Also, one class that really brought home some concepts for me was this pre-programming class. We got taught unions, intersections, and all that happy stuff and It almost exactly parallels bitwise math. And we covered boolean logic very heavily. What I considered the most useful was when we learned how to reduce complex boolean statements. This was very handy: (x|y) & (x|z) & (x|foo) can be simplified to x | (y & z & foo) Which I previously did not quite grasp.
