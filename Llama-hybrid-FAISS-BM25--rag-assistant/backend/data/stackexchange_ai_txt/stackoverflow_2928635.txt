Style 1 is what the Linux kernel indirectly recommends. From https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst , chapter 1: Now, some people will claim that having 8-character indentations makes the code move too far to the right, and makes it hard to read on a 80-character terminal screen. The answer to that is that if you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program. Style 2 adds levels of indentation, ergo, it is discouraged. Personally, I like style 1 as well. Style 2 makes it harder to match up closing braces in functions that have several guard tests.
