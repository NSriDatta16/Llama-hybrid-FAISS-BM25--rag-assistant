Can I neglect the evidence of autocorrelation?

I am estimating a model based on time series, which comes from theoretical background (economic theory), and the specification is quite common in empirical literature. However, I find that estimated errors are correlated, and therefore Breusch-Godfrey LM test does not reject null hypothesis of no autocorrelation. I am inclined do not change specification of the model (as I mentioned it comes from ecnomic theory), but autocorrelation bothers me. Since under autocorrelation, estimated coefficients are still unbiased (but variances of coefficients are biased), so can I simply neglect the autocorrelation? If no, what can I do without changing specification? I think to use HAC (Newey West) estimator to report in my regression table robust standard errors. Thank you in advance!
