How can I test context menu functionality in a web app?

I'm playing with a grails app that has a contextmenu (on right-click). The context menu is built using Chris Domigan's jquery contextmenu plugin . While the contextmenus do actually work, I want to have automated tests, and I can't work out how to do it. I've tried Selenium 2.05a (ie. Webdriver), but there's no rightClick method. I notice that HtmlUnit has a rightclick method, but I don't seem to be able to detect any difference in the DOM between before the click and after it.
