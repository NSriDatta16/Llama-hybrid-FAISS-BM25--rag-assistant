How to improve the accuracy of Random Forest for Text Categorization

I am working on a text Categorization problem, the objective is to classify related companies into their corresponding categories. This is a single category classification problem and not multi-class classification. Below is the details of the method I used. Data Preparation - Broke the documents in the list of tokens/ words. Removed numbers, stop words, punctuations. Performed stemming. Convert corpus into DTM and, specify the word length in-between(3, 10) Transformed the documents into TF-IDF vectors convert it into a matrix and further into a data frame These will be used a feature list for the classification algorithm. Used Random forest ("ranger" by using mlr). I have 853 categorized documents with 20 categories, and I used 75:25 ration for training and test dataset. I used mlr package in R. The classification accuracy I have managed to get is 45% and I need it to be at least 80%. I also applied xgboost but got only 38% accuracy. Data Looked like the below-mentioned image: - Here is an example code I used so far: - terms 3] colnames(data) Any help on how I can improve the accuracy would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot. Please let me know if you need any more details.
