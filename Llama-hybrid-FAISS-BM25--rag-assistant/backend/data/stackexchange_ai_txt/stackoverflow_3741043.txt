Here is a good link describing what is possible and advisable now in forms: http://diveintohtml5.ep.io/forms.html , a lot of it is simple, backwards-compatible, and improves user experience (see especially placeholders, search inputs, email address input fields, url input types). There is no reason not to use these now, and they help a lot on mobile devices. I think in asp.net you would have to use custom controls for some of it (ie, a text field hack that was designed by the WHATWG specifically to trick IE is not a core part of existing control objects.) An easier work-around might look like this: This yields html: But your customer wants type="email" so you are in full Steve Jobs compliance mode. Simple work-around might be to add this javascript: document.getElementById("textbox1").type = "email" . You would do the same ...etc_etc).type = "search" if you have a text box for search input and you want the benefits of html5 for users on devices that have usability enhancements for them. See again here for more discussion. Also, apart from forms you should be able to use canvas, web storage, etc., via javascript.
