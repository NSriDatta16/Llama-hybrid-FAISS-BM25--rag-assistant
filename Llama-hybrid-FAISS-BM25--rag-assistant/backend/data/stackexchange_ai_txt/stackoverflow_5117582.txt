There must be an error in the way you are using this "philogl", preventing the function from being interpreted fully. In particular, you have a syntax error with your square brackets. The function then remains undefined. In future you can turn on the error console in Firebug (or the equivalent for your preferred browser) to see what you're doing wrong. Also, prefer document.onload = function() { ... } in a script, instead of embedding scripting in HTML tags.
