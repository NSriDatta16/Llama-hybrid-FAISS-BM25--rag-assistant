For rails & facebook integration there is this nice ruby gem called Facebooker( http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/ ). There is also a pragmatic programmers book titled Developing Facebook platform application using ruby on rails ( http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mmfacer/developing-facebook-platform-applications-with-rails ). I haven't personally used facebooker though there is a nice tutorial with facebook connect and rails here -> http://blog.moove-it.com/using-facebooker-to-make-a-rails-site-with-facebook-connect-part-1/ .
