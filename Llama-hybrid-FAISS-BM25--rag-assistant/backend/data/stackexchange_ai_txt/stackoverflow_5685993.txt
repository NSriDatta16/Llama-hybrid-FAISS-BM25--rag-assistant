Adobe AIR. Local network error

For example, in local network, when Adobe Air is reading files from local server ( \\Server\storage\ ) and network will be in down for a second, Air becomes eat a lot of memory and it is increasing up to 1GB (while normal memory use is 100 kb or less). Just reading file with File('file path on local server'); from unstable network can cause this error. Have anybody seen that in projects? private function init() : void { file = new File("\\Server\dragracing\results.txt"); fileStream = new FileStream(); fileStream.addEventListener( Event.COMPLETE, fileComplete ); fileStream.openAsync( file, FileMode.READ ); } private function fileComplete( event : Event ):void { fileContents = fileStream.readMultiByte( fileStream.bytesAvailable, ISO_CS ); ..... } ]]>
