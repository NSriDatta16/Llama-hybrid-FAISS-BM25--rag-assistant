How do I handle nonexistent or missing data?

I tried a forecasting method and want to check if my method is correct or not. My study is comparing different kinds of mutual funds. I want to use the GCC index as a benchmark for one of them but the problem is that the GCC index stopped in September 2011 and my study is from January 2003 to July 2014. Thus, I tried to use another index, the MSCI index, to make a linear regression, but the problem is that the MSCI index is missing data from September 2010. To get around this, I did the following. Are these steps valid? The MSCI index is missing data for September 2010 through July 2012. I "provided" it by applying moving averages for five observations. Is this approach valid? If so, how many observations should I use? After estimating the missing data, I performed a regression on the GCC index (as dependent variable) versus the MSCI index (as independent variable) for the mutually available period (from January 2007 to September 2011), then corrected the model from all problems. For each month, I replace the x by the data from the MSCI index for the rest period. Is this valid? Below are the data in Comma-Separated-Values format containing the years by rows and the months by columns. The data are also available through this link .
