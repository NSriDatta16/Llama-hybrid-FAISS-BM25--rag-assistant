The mathematical operation of convolution means to compute the product of two (continuous or discrete) functions over all possible shift-positions. In a 2-dimensional (gray-level) image, a convolution is performed by a sliding-window operation, where the window (the 2-d convolution kernel) is a $v \times v$ matrix. Image-processing applications of neural networks - including convolutional neural networks - have been reviewed in: [M. Egmont-Petersen, D. de Ridder, H. Handels. Image processing with neural networks - a review , Pattern Recognition , Vol. 35, No. 10, pp. 2279-2301, 2002].
