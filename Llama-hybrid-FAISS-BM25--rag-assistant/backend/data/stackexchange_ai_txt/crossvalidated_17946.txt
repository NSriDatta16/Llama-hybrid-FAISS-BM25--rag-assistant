Sampling distribution is skewed in a fully Bayesian inference of MCMC in Cox PH models

I used the MCMC method to estimate linear models with a fully Bayesian inference previously, and had no problem from estimated coefficients. Recently I use the same way in a semiparametric Cox PH model, and get many skewed posterior distributions which make the posterior means of parameters pretty close to 2.5th-quantile or 97.5th-quantile. I try to increase the number of iteration (30,000 -> 50,000) and step (20 -> 40) with a burnin = 10,000 to make the posterior probability more symmetric. Sometimes it becomes symmetric, but sometimes it is still skewed eventually. I also use conditional prior proposals and iteratively weighted least squares based on posterior modes to increase the acceptance rate, but it is still useless. The data contains over 8,000 cancer patients with very few missing data. The independent variables are either binary or scale. So far I haven't figure out a best way to make the posterior distribution robustly symmetric. What I can do is repeatedly fitting the model to see whether the posterior probability is not skewed by chance. The reason I feel sick is that the model-fitting is so time-consuming. Each model spent 45mins~75mins with different combinations of variables, and I have 8 models in three specific causes. Each failed model means 1-hour waste of my life. Hopefully some people can share your experiences of dealing with this problem. The corresponding software is BayesX. I appreciate any advice! Edit Xi'an, Because I always get symmetric posterior distribution of estimated parameters in linear mixed model by MCMC, I assume the Cox PH model should have the same scenario. Here are two results from a Cox PH model with my data: Model 1: h(t,z)=ho(t)exp{intercept + sex + white + agedx + history} Variable mean Std. Dev. 2.5% quant. median 97.5% quant. const -4.2486 0.29328 -4.70006 0.249887 0.068665 sex 0.0123228 0.0514687 -4.52946 0.0175766 0.0982832 white -0.239128 0.0644409 -4.51786 -0.195356 0.0779398 agedx 0.00786072 0.00370628 -4.53803 0.00139 0.0734418 history 0.627554 0.1464 -4.55214 0.0027441 0.800568 Model 2: h(t,z)=ho(t)exp{intercept + sex + white + agedx + test} Variable mean Std.

Only the last variable is not the same. The posterior means of sex, white and agedx are similar, but the 2.5% quantile and 97.5% quantile are different a lot. If the posterior distribution cannot be symmetric, which result is reliable?
