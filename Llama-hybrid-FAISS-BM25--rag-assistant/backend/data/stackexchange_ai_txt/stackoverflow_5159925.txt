This is not a problem with DI ; it's a problem with the tests . More specifically, you are suffering from the Fragile Test smell. This can be addressed by using a SUT Factory instead of creating the SUT directly using the new keyword. This will allow you to change the constructor signature in the future without breaking lots of tests.
