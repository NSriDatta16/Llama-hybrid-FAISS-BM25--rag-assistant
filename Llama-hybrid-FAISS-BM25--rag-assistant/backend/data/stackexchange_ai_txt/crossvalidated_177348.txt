Update: Now that the question is more specific, I've added the log likelihood and R code for left-trunction. Right-truncation. For $Y_i$ distributed as a truncated Poisson with parameters $\lambda$ and truncation parameter $k$, the log likelihood of $n$ random samples is given by $$\log(\lambda) \sum_{i=1}^n y_i -n \lambda -n \log \left({\sum_{j=0}^k {{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^j}\over{j!}}}\right) $$ This is maximized for any value of $\lambda$ when $\hat{k}=\max(y_1, y_2,\ldots, y_n)$ (which is the smallest value that $k$ can take). The maximum likelihood estimate of $\lambda$ requires an iterative procedure. Moore (1952, Biometrika) provides a good and easily calculated initial estimate of $\hat{\lambda}$: $$\hat{\lambda}_0 ={{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}\over{\sum_{i=1}^n I(y_i where $I(\cdot)$ is the indicator function taking on 1 if $y_i Some not so elegant R code follows: # MLE estimation of a truncated Poisson with unknown truncation level # Objective is to find estimates of lambda (underlying Poisson mean) and # k (unknown trunction value). # Generate some samples from a known truncated Poisson distribution lambda Left-truncation. For left-truncation the log likelihood is the following: $$\log(\lambda) \sum_{i=1}^n y_i -n \lambda -n \log \left(1-{\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} {{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^j}\over{j!}}}\right) $$ with the sum on the far right being zero when $k # MLE estimation of a left-truncated Poisson with unknown truncation level # Objective is to find estimates of lambda (underlying Poisson mean) and # k (unknown trunction value). # Generate some samples from a known truncated Poisson distribution lambda = k][1:n] # MLE for k and initial estimate for lambda khat
