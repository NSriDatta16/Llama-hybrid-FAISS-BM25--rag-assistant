How can I implement the loss function of BAD GAN in Keras?

I want to implement a GAN with complement generator (BAD GAN) for semi-supervised learning. According to this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09783 How I can implement the loss function of discriminator and generator of this GAN in Keras?
