How good is Monte Carlo Simulation when the variable distribution is unknown?

I am reading the book " how to measure everything ", there is a chapter when the author encourages the usage of Monte Carlo simulation in simulating the future events in order to get a better understanding of the risk/ uncertainty involved. The theory sounds great in paper, and I am tempted to apply Monte Carlo techniques to startup analysis , to study the performance of employees, sales campaign, markets... everything! But in practice, I doubt whether Monte Carlo simulation is useful when the distribution of the variables involved in an equation is unknown. Think of the stock price return distribution-- it doesn't fit into a Gaussian Distribution, but what distribution we can use? And when the variable distribution is unknown, how useful is Monte Carlo simulation? My guess is not very useful, but I am right? A relevant, but probably narrower question is, is there any research done along the line of sensitivity analysis? By "sensitivity analysis" I mean we assume known distributions for the variables, but we perturb them a little by slightly changing the distribution shape or slightly changing some of the constants, will the outcome of the simulation results remain roughly the same, or completely different?
