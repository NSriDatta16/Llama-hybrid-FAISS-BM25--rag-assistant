At the time you call p test_method {|i| i.upcase} The |i| used in the method definition is not visible (its scope is solely within the {} . In particular you are building a block that takes a single variable, and to build that block you must specify what that variable is. Note that p test_method {|j| j.upcase} is also valid.
