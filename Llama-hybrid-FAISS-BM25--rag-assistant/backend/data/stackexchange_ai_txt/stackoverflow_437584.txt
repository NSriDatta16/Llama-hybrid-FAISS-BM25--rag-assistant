Perhaps take a look at the example applications that are walked through in the later chapters. You will see that classes and objects are just another tool in your box. Resist the urge to program Java with Lisp syntax. Another place to look at is Successful Lisp , chapters 7 and 14 for the basics, and chapters 31 and a part of 3.10 are about packages and handling large projects. Some Lisp guru (it might have been Paul Graham, but I am not sure) once said that he has not needed CLOS at all yet. edit : I think that your confusion may come from the fact that in Lisp, you do not use the class system for organizing namespaces. This is done separately; the two do not really have anything to do with each other.
