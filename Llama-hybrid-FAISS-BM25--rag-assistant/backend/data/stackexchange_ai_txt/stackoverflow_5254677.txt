Reading a JSON formatted file in php

I'm very new at JSON, I'm trying to read one parameter of this file using php: stdClass Object ( [status] => OK [results] => Array ( [0] => stdClass Object ( [types] => Array ( [0] => route ) [formatted_address] => Foro Umberto I, 90133 Palermo, Italy [address_components] => Array ( [0] => stdClass Object ( [long_name] => Foro Umberto I [short_name] => SS113 [types] => Array ( [0] => route ) ) This is only a part, anyway, i need to echo the formatted_address using php, but i can get it, this is part of my code: $address = json_decode($curlData); echo($address -> {'formatted_address'}); Thanks for any help!
