Reinforcement Learning is not an optimization algorithm (which stochastic gradient descent is). Stochastic Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm which seeks to minimize a given target/objective function. Reinforcement learning does nothing of that sort. Reinforcement Learning is essentially learning the parameters of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Parameters are - reward we get for being in a particular state (can be any real number, with a negative reward acting as a penalty), and the probability of transition from one state to another when taking a particular action. Once we have the parameters of an MDP choosing the best policy (best action to take for a given state for the situation) is essentially a solved problem (a closed form formula exists).
