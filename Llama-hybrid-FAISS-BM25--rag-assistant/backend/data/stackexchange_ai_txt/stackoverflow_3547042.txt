Kernel.Resolve is the low level entrypoint into the resolution machinery that you seek - it doesnt go as far as instantiating the objects. I suggest downloading the trunk including tests and you'll get examples that cover your exact scenario. Dont treat this as a throwaway commment - the tests are proper clean xUnit.net tests that are exemplary in terms of being short, focused and having good coverage. You may also find Kernel.Get ().GetType() / Kernel.TryGet ().GetType() or Kernel.GetAll to be of use, depending on your exact scenario - if you can expand on same, I can make this answer more specific (however all of these instantiate the object rather than let you query the bindings at a low level.
