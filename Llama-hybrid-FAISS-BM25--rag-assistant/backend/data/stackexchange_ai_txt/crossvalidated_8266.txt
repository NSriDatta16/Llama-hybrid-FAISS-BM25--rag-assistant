Advice on classifier input correlation

I have a lot of data on previous race history and I'm trying to predict a percentage chance of winning the next race using Regression, kNN, and SVM learning algorithms. Say a race has 5 runners, and each runner has a previous best course time of, say $T_i$ (seconds). I've also introduced an additional input for RANK of previous best course time of the 5 runners with value 0 to $1 - \frac{T_i-T_{min}}{T_{max}-T_{min}}$ My question is: does introducing both the absolute best course time and rank best course time cause any problems? I understand that these inputs are likely to correlate but if someone runs a world record time they are more likely to win easily but this will get lost using the rank input only which would assign them a rank of 1.
