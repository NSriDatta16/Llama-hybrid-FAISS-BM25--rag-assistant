online retail data time series model using R

I am new to time-series modeling. I have to create a time-series from the data found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail . I have figured out how to aggregate the data, so now I have the data in following format with total revenue for each day. What would be best way to construct time series using R function ts() from this to forecast monthly or daily sales?
