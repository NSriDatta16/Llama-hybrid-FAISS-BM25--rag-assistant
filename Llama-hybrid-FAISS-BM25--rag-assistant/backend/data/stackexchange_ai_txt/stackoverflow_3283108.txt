Another rails nested form question

Trying to perform a nested object form. The page loads with no errors, but when I send it, no information gets saved to the organization model. The SQL call says this .. Parameters: {"commit" => "save", "action"=>"update","_method"=>"put", "organization"=>{"likes_snacks"=>"0"}, .. Which is right. The 1 and 0 can be changed properly by flipping on and off the checkbox. But that information is just not saved to the database I guess. Any ideas? HAML: - form_for @user do |f| = f.label :username = f.text_field :username .clear - fields_for :organization do |org| unless @user.organizations.empty? = org.label :likes_snacks, 'Like snacks?' = org.check_box :likes_snacks = f.submit 'save', {class => 'button'} CONTROLLER: def edit @user = current_user @organization = current_user.organizations.first end MODELS: ORGANIZATION.RB: has_many :users, :through => :organizations_users USER.RB: has_many :organizations, :through => :organizations_users
