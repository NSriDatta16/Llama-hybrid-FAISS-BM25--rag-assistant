I do think it is new job, basically data scientist has to apply mathematical algorithms on data with considerable constraint in terms 1) Run time of the application 2) Resource use of the application. If these constraints are not present, I would not call the job data science. Moreover, these algorithms are often need to be ran on distributed systems, which is another dimension of the problem. Of course, this has been done before, in some combination of statistics, mathematics and programming, but it was not wide spread to give rise to the new term. The real rise of data science is from the ability to gather large amounts of data, thus need to need to process it.
