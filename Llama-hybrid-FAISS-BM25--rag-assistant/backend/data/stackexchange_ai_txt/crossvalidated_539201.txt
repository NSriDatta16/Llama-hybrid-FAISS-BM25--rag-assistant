Logistic Regression - Are my observations dependent or independent depending on interpretation of the results?

I want to do logistic regression to test whether certain factors predict a loss of movement following an injury. I have measured movement from 150 muscle groups that have wounded from about 40 people. I want to see if stitching has an effect on the range of movement that remains. My independent variable is received stitching: yes/no I also have a continuous independent variable (time, in hours until surgery) My dependent variable is movement lost: (yes/no) ... Not everyone has sustained damage to all muscles, but some people have had a number of muscles "at-risk" of losing movement. When considered at a personal level, it means that these observations are, therefore, not independent. However, I intend to make no interpretations of this data at the person-level... only muscle-group level ... In which case, one person will only have one measurement taken of their left leg for example. Does that mean that I can defend a decision to do a logistic regression if I only make interpretations at the muscular-group level? If this isn't possible, does anyone have any ideas as to what I can do? I've done some reading but I can't seem to get any answers ... The answer is simply "no", but I can't think of any alternative. I would appreciate any help and opinions. Let's assume that my residuals are looking appropriately independent.
