Not an answer, but a plot following Stephan Kolassa's call to "look at these series". Kaggle tourism1 has 518 yearly time series, for which we want to predict the last 4 values: The plot shows the errors from the "naive" constant predictor, here $5^{th}$ last: $\qquad Error4( y ) \equiv {1 \over 4} \sum_ {last\ 4} |y_i - y_{-5}| $ The numbers in the corners, 81 12 ..., are $Error4(y)$ as % of range, and $length(y)$. The 3 rows are the 10 worst, 10 in the middle, and 10 best of all 518 yearly time series. Obviously, very short series -- 12 11 7 7 7 ... in the top row -- are hard to predict: no surprise. (Athanasopoulos, Hyndman, Song and Wu, The Tourism Forecasting Competition (2011, 23p) used 112 of the 518 yearly series, but I don't see which ones.) Are there other, newer collections of time series since 2010, that might be worth looking at ?
