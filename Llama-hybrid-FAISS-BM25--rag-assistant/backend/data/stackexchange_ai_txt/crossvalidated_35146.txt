Is the following a valid MCMC sampler?

I have a model with two variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. In general, I would like to create a Gibbs sampler based on the conditionals $p(X_1 | X_2)$ and $p(X_2 | X_1)$. However, computing either $p(X_2 | X_1)$ or $p(X_1 | X_2)$ is intractable. Though, they can be computed up to a normalization constant. Fortunately, there is a function $f$ such that $p(X_2 | f(X_1))$ and $p(X_1| f(X_2))$ is tractable. I wanted to know if the following is a valid sampler that has the guaranteed MCMC convergence. randomly initialize $x_1$ and $x_2$ until convergence is reached, perform the following: 2a. perform one Hastings step to get a new value for $x_1$ (i.e. one accept/reject step) for $p(X_1 | X_2)$ based on the proposal $p(X_1 | f(X_2))$. 2b. perform one Hastings step analogously for $x_2$. I am just not sure whether in order to get guaranteed convergence, 2a and 2b have to be run until convergence too (instead of taking one accept/reject step).
