The track record of machine learning in biomedicine has not been very good. Early successes in machine learning came in high signal:noise ratio pattern recognition areas such as visual pattern recognition. The S:N ratio is much lower in biology and the social sciences. Machine learning effectively fits a lot of interactions between predictors, and to do that you must either have a huge sample size or a very high S:N ratio. See Is Medicine Mesmerized by Machine Learning? . In addition, many practitioners of machine learning has misunderstood prediction tasks as classification tasks. See here for more.
