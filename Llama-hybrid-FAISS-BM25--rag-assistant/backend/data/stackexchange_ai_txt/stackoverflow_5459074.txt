Yes you can form it realtime. Taken directly from OpenCV documentation at http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/imgproc_miscellaneous_image_transformations.html?highlight=watershed#watershed Before passing the image to the function, user has to outline roughly the desired regions in the image markers with positive ( > 0 ) indices... The markers will be “seeds” of the future image regions.
