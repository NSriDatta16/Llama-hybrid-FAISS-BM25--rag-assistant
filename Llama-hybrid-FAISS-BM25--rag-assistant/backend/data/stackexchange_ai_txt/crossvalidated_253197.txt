Statistical methods not mentioned in standard literature (e.g. Wooldridge)?

In my PhD course I have often heard of statistical methods called principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), propensity score matching (PSM), latent cluster analysis (LCA) etc. However, none of these methods are mentioned in standard (edit: econometrics) literature like Wooldridge or Greene . How come? Is it because mentioned books focus on random samples and the techniques mentioned above refer to samples generated by experiments? Edit: I just started my PhD in the field of entrepreneurship/innovation after a masters in finance and am now looking into applied e-commerce and consumer behavior/choice research.
