How to prevent design mode enabled child control from being moved outside of its containing control?

I have a UserControl that contains other controls that I would like to be able to rearrange or resize at design time. So I have a custom designer for the UserControl that inherits from System.Windows.Forms.Design.ParentControlDesigner , and I call EnableDesignMode on the child controls from within the designer. That way, at design time, I can drag and drop the child controls to move them, or resize them. But I can also drag and drop the child controls somewhere else on the form that is outside of the original UserControl. Is there a way I can limit the child controls from being moved or resized outside the UserControl?
