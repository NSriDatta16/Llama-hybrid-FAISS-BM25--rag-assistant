I would suggest using Spaces or Organic Groups. Spaces was used considerably in Open Atrium... a Development Seed out-of-the-box intranet package. Intranets really require the concept of access control and feature visibility depending on which department or role you have so I'm confident that Spaces will be very good for you. Of course there is the venerable Organic Groups also. Spaces is a "higher" level concept than PURL. Spaces uses the context and PURL modules BTW. My gut instinct is for you to use Spaces or Organic groups. There are a couple of videos on the net that talk about Spaces. Check them out.
