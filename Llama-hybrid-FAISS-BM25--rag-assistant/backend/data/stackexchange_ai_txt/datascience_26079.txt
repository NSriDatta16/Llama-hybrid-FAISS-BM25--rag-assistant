Is it legal to scrape YouTube videos for training data?

Is it legal, at least as long as I am not "selling" the video under my name, to scrape YouTube videos to train a neural network? If it is not, is there a procedure to get permission for the above? I am in academia and require a massive amount of video data that YouTube would be the perfect source in. Note: I couldn't figure out where to post this questions, as it is not technically technical. I am posting it here only because I believe someone here would know a bit or two. Would appreciate any suggestions regarding community this question might have a better chance in. What about Law ?
