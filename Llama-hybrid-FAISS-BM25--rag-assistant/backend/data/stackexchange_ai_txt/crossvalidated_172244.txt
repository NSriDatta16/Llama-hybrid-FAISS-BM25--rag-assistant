Is the average of a sum equal to the average of the sum of the averages of parts of the original sum?

Can anyone explain to me whether this is true or not? $$\frac{\sum x_i,_k}{n_i,_k} = \frac{\frac{\sum x_i,_j}{n_i,_j} + \frac{\sum x_j,_k}{n_j,_k}}{2}$$ Logically, it makes sense that they should equal, but when I plug in numbers I get differing results. Am I thinking about this completely wrong? (btw not necessarily 2 in the denominator, could split up the original sum even more) Thanks
