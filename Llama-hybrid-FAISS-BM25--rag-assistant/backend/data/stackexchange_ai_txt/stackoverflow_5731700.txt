Take a look at the Rails framework. They use database migrations to manipulate (even create) the database. It integrates great with testing and across development machines too (for teams). It's Ruby (which many find preferable to PHP) so it won't work for you unless you switch, but it might give you some ideas on how to implement this for your application. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner. You could edit fragments of SQL by hand but you would then be responsible for telling other developers that they need to go and run them. Youâ€™d also have to keep track of which changes need to be run against the production machines next time you deploy. Active Record tracks which migrations have already been run so all you have to do is update your source and run rake db:migrate. Active Record will work out which migrations should be run. It will also update your db/schema.rb file to match the structure of your database.
