R working the tsDyn and Time series

Hello I am trying to work with the tsDyn packages to fit time series. Save me a lot of time if I could get this package to work correctly. I am working with data that looks like this: time change high low slope13 slope50 slope200 prediction 1 2.008082e+13 -0.00150 0.00860 -0.00420 288.46154 185.20 52.85 NA 2 2.008082e+13 0.00160 0.00570 -0.00540 90.84615 178.22 55.10 NA 3 2.008082e+13 -0.00320 0.00020 -0.00409 42.07692 181.00 55.25 NA 4 2.008082e+13 -0.00310 0.00330 -0.00010 36.92308 180.80 61.60 NA 5 2.008082e+13 -0.00156 0.00770 -0.00140 -18.46154 172.60 59.25 NA 6 2.008082e+13 0.00416 0.00176 -0.00292 -18.84615 171.56 58.27 NA The time column is the column that contains the time. It looks like 20080817210000 YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. When trying to use any of the functions on the data I get an error. only univariate time series are allowed I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong here any help would be appreciated. An example: > mt4nnetTS I'm not sure what I am doing wrong here?
