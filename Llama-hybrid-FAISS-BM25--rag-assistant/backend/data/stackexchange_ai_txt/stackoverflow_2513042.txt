Can Apache configuration check cookies?

My situation: We have a mobile version of our website, and want to start redirecting mobile users to it. The plan is to do this in Apache httpd.conf or .htaccess , using something like this: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} (iPhone|Blackberry|...) RewriteRule (.*) mobile/$1 However we want there to be a way for users to override our default action of redirecting them. One way we thought to do it was to show a link on the mobile site directing back to the regular site, and store a cookie when they use that link. Could the Apache configuration file check a cookie before redirecting? Is there a better way?
