Computation and Interpretation of Odds Ratio with continuous variables with interaction, in a binary logistic regression model

Question A binary logistic regression model has been fitted, with the following output; Coefficients Term Coef SE Coef 95% CI Z-Value P-Value Constant -9.80 3.02 ( -17.00, -4.19) -3.12 0.001 A 0.756 0.510 ( -0.150, 1.552) 1.58 0.103 B 0.0406 0.0201 ( -0.0046, 0.0798) 1.79 0.069 A*B -0.00303 0.00298 (-0.00897, 0.00341) -0.91 0.341 Odds Ratios for Continuous Predictors Odds 95% Ratio CI A * (*, *) B * (*, *) Where $A,B$ are both continuous values $> 0$ . How would one give and interpret the odds ratios for one of $A$ or $B$ here? Typically one would state that (for $A$ here) the odds ratio would be $\exp(0.756 ) = 2.13$ , but given there's interaction this is less clear. As the variables are continuous it also seems more confusing, if $B$ was been a binary value then could interpret the model as $$ \text{log} \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A + \beta_2 B + \beta_3 A \times B $$ If $B = 0$ then $$ \text{log} \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A $$ If $B = 1$ then $$ \text{log} \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right) = \beta_0 + ( \beta_1 + \beta_3 )A $$ And state that if $B$ is present then an increase of $A$ by one unit increases the odds by a factor of $\exp(\beta_1 + \beta_3) = \exp(0.756 - 0.00303)$ . And if $B$ is not present then an increase of $A$ by one unit increases the odds by a factor of $\exp(\beta_1)$ How to go about computation and interpretation of odds ratios in the case of interaction with continuous variables? Why I don't think this is a duplicate From exp (coefficients) to Odds Ratio and their interpretation in Logistic Regression with factors , talks about using categorical variables and has only one factor with three levels (red, orange, blue) Interaction Test with Odds Ratio didn't talk about a similar scenario to my question. Log odds ratio and unadjusted log odds ratio when we have a continuous variable sounds similar, but is really about putting the continuous variables into buckets rather than the interpretation of them in the context that I have given. Comparing odds ratios of continuous and discrete variables is discussing their design. Interpretation of continuous by continuous interaction in binary regression model doesn't have an answer, in the comments there are links to this post and this post, neither of which appear to answer the question, or mine. Odds ratios for continuous independent variables [duplicate] has been flagged as a duplicate, although the post that has been linked ( this post ) doesn't appear to answer the problem as it's talking about categorical variables ( I have mentioned this post already, red, orange, blue). In the last thread linked above whuber has stated the information is already there, I feel that it would be a good idea to have an explicit answer in relation to the example that I have provided as the topic seems to be confusing to other learners as well as myself.
