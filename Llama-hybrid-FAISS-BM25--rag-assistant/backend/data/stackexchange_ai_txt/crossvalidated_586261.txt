How to use MC simulation to calculate Supremum ADF test critical values

I am replicating some techniques from Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado. In Chap 17, I am doing the Supremum ADF test and Quantile ADF test. It seems that they do not follow a standard ADF t-distribution. I wonder how to use Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the right tale critical values. Text or code solutions would be much appreciated!
