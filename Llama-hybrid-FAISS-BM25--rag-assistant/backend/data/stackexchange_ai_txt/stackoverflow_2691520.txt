I usually make all vcproj files under solution have the following: SccProjectName = "SAK" SccLocalPath = "SAK" SccAuxPath = "SAK" SccProvider = "SAK" This will make it pick up the sourcesafe information from the solution file. Make sure solution file is branched, not shared in the 2 branches. Open the branched solution and then go to "Change Source Control" and bind the solution to the correct location in SourceSafe. This is all rather fragile (or perhaps I don't fully understand it) but I usually just poke at it until it works. And, as usual: if at all possible migrate to a different source control system. Perforce, Subversion, Mercurial...
