ASP.NET Ajax File Upload, Access Denied

I'm having some trouble using the ASP.NET AJAX File Uploader. I always get either: Unhandled Exception: Access is Denied or Unhandled Exception: The File Attached is Invalid To give you some background i'm working on .NET 4.0 and using the Ajax toolkit dll To get to this state all i have done is dragged a script manager onto the page, dragged the file upload onto the page and declared and linked a function to handle the upload success (save it etc..) I get the same errors with and without this function.
