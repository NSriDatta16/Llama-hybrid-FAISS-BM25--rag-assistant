Doing a Cast Within a LINQ Query

Is it possible to do a cast within a LINQ query (for the compiler's sake)? The following code isn't terrible, but it would be nice to make it into one query: Content content = dataStore.RootControl as Controls.Content; List tabList = (from t in content.ChildControls select t).OfType ().ToList(); List paragraphList = (from t in tabList from p in t.ChildControls select p).OfType ().ToList(); List parentLineList = (from p in paragraphList from pl in p.ChildControls select pl).OfType ().ToList(); The code continues on with a few more queries, but the gist is I have to create a List out of each query in order for the compiler to know that all of the objects in content.ChildControls are of type TabSection and all of the objects in t.ChildControls are of type Paragraph ...and so on and and so forth. Is there a way within the LINQ query to tell the compiler that t in from t in content.ChildControls is a TabSection ?
