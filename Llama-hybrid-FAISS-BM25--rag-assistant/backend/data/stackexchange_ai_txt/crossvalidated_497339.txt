A simple ANN would do the job, to be honest, and most of the data loaders you'll end up with let you use the MNIST dataset in an array-like fashion rather than treating it as an image. The reason being the small dimensions . But if you actually want to learn the internal working of CNNs, I would suggest going with a data set that has a larger image dimension , as this was one of the reasons why CNNs were needed in the first place. Now treating the data like an array becomes impossible from a memory point of view. To play around, just go with any simple CNN, Resnet-50 from the PyTorch model collection may be a good start. Keep in mind, the deeper the network, the more overfitting on simpler data .
