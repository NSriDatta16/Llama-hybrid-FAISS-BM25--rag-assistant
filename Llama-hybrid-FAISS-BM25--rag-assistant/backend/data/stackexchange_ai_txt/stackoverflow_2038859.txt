Your "destroy" handler is called when the window is yet in destruction, so this code fragment: def on_destroy(self): self.window.destroy() will generate an infinite recursive call. In other terms, you are destroying something that is yet being destroyed. This has nothing to do with GtkBuilder or hand-coded widgets, but I suspect I'm missing something because I don't know why you need to connect something to GtkWindow::destroy.
