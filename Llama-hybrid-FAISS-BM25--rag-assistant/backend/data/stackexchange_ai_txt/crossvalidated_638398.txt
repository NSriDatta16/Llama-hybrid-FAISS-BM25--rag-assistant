At each event time, the Cox mode uses the current values of the covariates for all those at risk of the event. That said, it's possible to devise new covariates that represent some aspect of the history of measured covariate values, like a running average perhaps weighted in some way with respect to time. Your question thus requires you to apply your understanding of the subject matter. Is it today's air pollution that contributes to today's risk of CVD or death? I would guess not, except maybe in extreme circumstances. Is it lifetime exposure to pollution? Exposure over the previous 5 years? Or 10 years? Exposure during youth? If you want to use a Cox regression, you have to convert the history of exposure to some value that is related to today's risk of the event. This might be better handled with a joint model of exposure and outcomes. I'm not an expert on that. For an introduction, look at these answers from Dimitris Rizopoulos, who has developed tools for such models, or this blog post .
