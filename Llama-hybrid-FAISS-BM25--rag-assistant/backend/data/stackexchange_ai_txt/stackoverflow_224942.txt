Raw partition access in Windows Vista

Accessing a raw disk partition in Windows Vista requires kernel mode control, as opposed to for instance WinXP where you can access it from user mode. However, I've heard that when it comes to USB flash memory, a partition can still be accessed from user mode even on Windows Vista. Is this true? Regards /Robert
