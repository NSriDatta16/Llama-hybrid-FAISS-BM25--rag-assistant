PHP sending HTTP_POST_VARS to another page?

Whats the best was of doing this? Sessions? How can I take all my variables defined on 1 page and send them over to another. I read using serialize convert the HTTP_POST_VARS to a string, and then pass that (using a hidden form/input?) and use unserialize on the other PHP page to get the variables back. Also I saw someone just use something like: $val) { ?> " value=" "> Which seems ugly and asking for trouble. Basically this is the run down of what I am trying to do: The user fills out a form and then submits the form with all the information thats required. A second page intercepts all the HTTP_POST_VARS and then defines more variables. The user is asked if the information is correct and asked if they would like to submit all information. So far I have gotten this far. Now I want a button/link where the user clicks it and then it sends all the information page 2 has to another page where it finally runs the code to process all the information. (MYSQL, EMAILS, etc) My ideal solution would be able to define something like onclick where I can just run a PHP function at whim, but that doesn't exist. One thing is I want to make sure information thats posted/pushed/whatever to page3 (processing) that its legit and actually comes from page2 (confirmation)...I don't want people just randomly making HTTP POSTs and having it validate. I was thinking of running some kind of MD5 stuff with a secret key to validate. Does anyone have an elegant solution of a form where you have PART 1 ( filling out), PART 2 (confirmation to user) and PART 3 (processing all information from PART 2).
