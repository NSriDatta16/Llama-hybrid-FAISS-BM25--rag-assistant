Some intuition may be available from the theory of best (minimum variance) unbiased estimators (Casella and Berger's Statistical Inference (2002), Theorem 7.3.20). If $\operatorname{E}_\theta W=\tau(\theta)$ then $W$ is a best unbiased estimator of $\tau(\theta)$ iff $W$ is uncorrelated with all other unbiased estimators of zero. Proof : Let $W$ be an unbiased estimator uncorrelated with all unbiased estimators of zero. Let $W'$ be another estimator such that $\operatorname{E}_\theta W'=\operatorname{E}_\theta W=\tau(\theta)$ . Write $W'=W+(W'-W)$ . By assumption, $\operatorname{Var}_\theta W'=\operatorname{Var}_\theta W+\operatorname{Var}_\theta (W'-W)$ . Hence, for any $W'$ , $\operatorname{Var}_\theta W'\geq \operatorname{Var}_\theta W$ . Now assume that $W$ is a best unbiased estimator. Let there be some other estimator $U$ with $\operatorname{E}_\theta U=0$ . $\phi_a:=W+aU$ is also unbiased for $\tau(\theta)$ . We have $$\operatorname{Var}_\theta \phi_a := \operatorname{Var}_\theta W + 2a \operatorname{Cov}_\theta(W,U) + a^2 \operatorname{Var}_\theta U.$$ If there were a $\theta_0\in\Theta$ such that $\operatorname{Cov}_{\theta_0}(W,U) , we would obtain $\operatorname{Var}_\theta \phi_a for $a\in(0,-2 \operatorname{Cov}_{\theta_0}(W,U) / \operatorname{Var}_{\theta_0} U)$ . $W$ could then not be the best unbiased estimator. QED Intuitively, the result says that if an estimator is optimal, it must not be possible to improve it by just adding some noise to it, in the sense of combining it with an estimator that is just zero on average (being an unbiased estimator of zero). Unfortunately, it is difficult to characterize all unbiased estimators of zero. The situation becomes much simpler if zero itself is the only unbiased estimator of zero, as any statistic $W$ satisfies $\operatorname{Cov}_\theta(W,0)=0$ . Completeness describes such a situation.
