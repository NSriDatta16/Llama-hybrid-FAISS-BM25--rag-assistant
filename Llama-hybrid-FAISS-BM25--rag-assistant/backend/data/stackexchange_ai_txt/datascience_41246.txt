How to extract characteristics from text using machine learning?

I would like to develop some kind of model/algorithm that allows me to extract the characteristics of a given product name . (let's say the brand, model and color). I am looking for a solution similar to the one offered by MonkeyLearn and its model Laptop Feature Extract . For example: Given the item "Apple iPhone 6s, 64GB Silver", It should compute: { brand: "iPhone", model: "6s", capacity: "64Gb", color: "Silver" } Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thank you.
