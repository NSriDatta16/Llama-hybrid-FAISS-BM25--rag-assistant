Fast graphing library

I've been using Incanter for my graphing needs, which was adequate but slow for my previous needs. Now I need to embed a graph in a JPanel. Users will need to interact with the graph (e.g. clicking on certain points which the program would need to receive and deal with) by dragging and clicking. Zooming in a out is a must as well. I've heard about JFreeChart on other SO discussions, but I see that Incanter uses that as it's graphing engine, and it seemed somewhat slow then. It it actually fast, but perhaps Incanter is doing things that slow it down? I'm graphing up to 2 million points (simple xy-plots, really), though generally will be graphing less. Using Matlab, this is plotted in a few seconds, but Incanter can hang for minutes. So is JFreeChart the way to go? Or something else, given my needs? (Also, it needs to be free, as it is for research.)
