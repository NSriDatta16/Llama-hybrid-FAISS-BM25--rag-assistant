The OpenLayers api allows you to add Markers and Features to the map. If you add Features rather than Markers you can make them draggable by adding the following code. var vectorLayer = new OpenLayers.Layer.Vector("Vector Layer"); var osMap = new OpenSpace.Map('map'); osMap.addLayer(vectorLayer); var modifyFeaturesControl = new OpenLayers.Control.ModifyFeature(vectorLayer); modifyFeaturesControl.mode = OpenLayers.Control.ModifyFeature.RESHAPE; osMap.addControl(modifyFeaturesControl); modifyFeaturesControl.activate(); This will allow you to drag features around a map. If you want to add custom behavior when feature's are dragged you can register listeners on the vectorLayer. For example to register a listener when features are modifed (i.e. dragged and released) you need to use the following code. vectorLayer.events.register('featuremodified', vectorLayer, function(feature) { //custom behavior }); For a full list of the events that can be listened to see the OpenLayers api doc OpenLayers api doc
