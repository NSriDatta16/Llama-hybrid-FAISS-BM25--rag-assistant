Karl Popper has argued for a general mindset that should be employed by a scientist. The frequentist null hypothesis testing was designed in a way that is consistent with this kind of thinking about scientific method. However this does not mean that is is the only way how you could conduct hypothesis tests! In Bayesian framework you could use Bayes factors to compare the "null" model with alternative model so to falsify your hypothesis (this is how most Bayesian equivalents to frequentist tests, like BEST , work). So you can perform hypothesis tests in Bayesian framework and Karl Popper has nothing to do with Bayesian vs. frequentist debate.
