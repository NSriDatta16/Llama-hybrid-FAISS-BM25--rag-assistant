Get timer ticks in Python

I'm just trying to time a piece of code. The pseudocode looks like: start = get_ticks() do_long_code() print "It took " + (get_ticks() - start) + " seconds." How does this look in Python? More specifically, how do I get the number of ticks since midnight (or however Python organizes that timing)?
