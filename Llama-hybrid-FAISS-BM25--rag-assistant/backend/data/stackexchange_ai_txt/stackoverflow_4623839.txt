How to downgrade arbitrary PDF file to version PDF-1.2?

I have some user generated PDF files. Typically the files are be generated with Word, but they could be just a about any kind of valid PDF file. I'd like convert the file to version PDF-1.2 if they have higher version number. The features available only in higher version (like multimedia) should be removed and the result should be still reasonably reasonable and readable. How to do this programmatically, without interactive tools such as Adobe Acrobat? Preferably with Java and iText -library, but I would be interested in other solutions also. One way would be to generate a bunch of images from original PDF and then package them as a PDF-1.2 file, but is the a more elegant way?
