Mathematical expectations are a concept from probability theory. Expressions like $E_x[...]$ denote conditional expectations and I think you will have trouble understanding Machine Learning concepts without understanding conditional expectations. (Understanding them as a mathematical concept , not on an intuitive level). My recommendation is that you look for a beginner's course in probability theory to get a grasp of the following concepts: Random variables Probability distributions Stochastic independence Mathematical expectation Conditional expectation/conditional probability Law of total probability Bayes' theorem There are probably courses designed specifically for people interested in Machine Learning. Have fun!
