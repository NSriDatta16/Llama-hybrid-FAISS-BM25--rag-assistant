According to the QuirksMode charts , the only mainstream browsers not supporting inline-block are IE6 and 7. (Well, they support it, but only for elements which have a native display type of inline .) I'd just assume it is supported and then apply a workaround for IE6/7 via conditional comments . (Note: I'm ignoring Firefox 2's lack of support for inline-block and assuming the vast majority of users have upgraded to FF3, but brief googling didn't unearth any numbers to back that up. YMMV.) If determining support from JavaScript is your only option however, you'll have to fall back to user-agent sniffing. The YAHOO.env.ua class from the YUI library is a handy chunk of code that you could copy and use. (It's BSD licensed, doesn't depend on other parts of the YUI library, and is only about 25-30 lines without comments)
