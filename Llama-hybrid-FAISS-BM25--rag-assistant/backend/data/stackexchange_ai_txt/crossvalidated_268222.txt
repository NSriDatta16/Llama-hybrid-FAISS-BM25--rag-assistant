The average paid attendance at Yankees games last year was 55,000. You randomly ask a bunch of people in NYC if they went to a Yankees game last season, and if they did, you record the paid attendance. What is the average paid attendance for the games that the people you asked who went to a game attended? I'll give you hint for my answer (hint was not provided): length-biased sampling. I scored a home run on that, but it wasn't enough to win the game, ha ha. Note: I mentioned many caveats pertaining to how the sampling was done, and the interviewer told me to disregard all of them.
