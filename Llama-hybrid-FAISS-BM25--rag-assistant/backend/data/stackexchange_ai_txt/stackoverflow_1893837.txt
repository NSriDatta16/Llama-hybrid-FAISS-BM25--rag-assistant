"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day, teach him to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime" Ok here we go. If started by installing Firefox so that I can use the Firebug extension. So you apparently have no control over the the markup which is only made of divs . So far so good. I changed a fragment of your css by removing #ConferencesContainer as Firebug obviously shows you that there is no div with the id ConferencesContainer in your markup anyway... Which explains why #ConferencesContainer .ConferencesTitleContainer { and alike select nothing. Then I removed the absolute positioning because as far as I can recall, this is something that doesn't play nice with IE. By the way, having float: left is useless if you then use position: absolute To accommodate the fact that sometimes there is no pdf download link (hence no div in the markup), I made agenda item and pdf link divs float to the left. And I made biography and webcast divs float to the right and tricked the margins to switch the divs back to their intended position. Tricking the margins was necessary as the webcast div comes first in the markup (in respect to the biography div). Of course, if you apply the stylesheet I'm giving you to a slightly different markup with "holes", that is to say missing divs because there is no corresponding link to output then it might not work. In any case, I believe you now have enough to experiment with on your own, good luck. .ConferencesTitleContainer { float:left; padding:2px 0; width:40%; background: red; } .ConferencesPdfContainer { float:left; text-align:center; width:20%; background: yellow; } .ConferencesExtLinkContainer { float:right; margin-left: -20%; margin-right: 20%; text-align:center; width:20%; background: lime; } .ConferencesHtmlContainer { float: right; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: -20%; text-align:center; width:20%; background: pink; } (source: pakosz.fr ) See it in action.
