The post is old but I would like to add another perspective to the topic. You should run correlation analysis to find out high levels of association (and hence correlation) among variables. When you perform PCA, you are trying to find an alternative model which components are orthogonal (and therefore linearly independent, with zero correlation). At this point you must keep all the original variables, because you will be able to understand how are they influencing the new principal components and their relationship within the new model. To summarize, with PCA you do not have to remove the old variables, you get a new set of vectors (variables) that have a linear relationship with the original dataset, defined using polynomials. The coordinates system and the "dimensions" of your original data change, but the underlying information is still there. But you need the original dataset to understand your original variables always, you cannot remove them. Otherwise, you will lose the images of the PCA vectors in the "real world" and the knowledge about them will be lost for good. Find out about PCA rotation and you will understand how you can match the PCA model to your original dataset.
