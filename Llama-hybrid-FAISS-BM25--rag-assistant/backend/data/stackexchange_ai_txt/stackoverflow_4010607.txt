You don't have to let MooseX::Storage manage your file IO just because it's available. You could use it to pack your objects into hashrefs and then dump them with YAML or Storable or whatever yourself. This is why MooseX::Storage distinguishes between three levels of serialization. That said, I disagree that it is inelegant to make a single top-level object that contains all the other objects you want to serialize in a given context.
