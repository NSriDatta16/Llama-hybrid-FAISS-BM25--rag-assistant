How to compute score and predict for outcome after N days

Let's say I have a medical dataset/EHR dataset that is retrospective and longitudinal in nature. Meaning one person has multiple measurements across multiple time points (in the past). I did post here but couldn't get any response. So, posting it here This dataset contains information about patients' diagnosis, mortality flag, labs, admissions, and drugs consumed, etc. Now, if I would like to find out predictors that can influence mortality, I can use logistic regression (whether the patient will die or not). But my objective is to find out what are the predictors that can help me predict whether a person will die in the next 30 days or the next 240 days , how can I do this using ML/Data Analysis techniques? In addition, I would also like to compute a score that can indicate the likelihood that this person will die in the next 30 days? How can I compute the scores? Any tutorials links on how is this score derived?, please? Can you please let me know what are the different analytic techniques that I can use to address this problem and different approaches to calculate score? I would like to read and try solving problems like this
