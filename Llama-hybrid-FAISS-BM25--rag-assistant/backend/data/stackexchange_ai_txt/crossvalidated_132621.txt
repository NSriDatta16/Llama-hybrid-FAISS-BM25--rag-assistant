Analysis of Descriptive Statistics

I'm trying to make an assessment of these figures, with the aim of using them for multivariate regression. I'm struggling and so far all I have is: "With the lowest skew, kurtosis closest to zero and a mean most close to its median, average return is the closest to a normal distribution. PTBV with a mean so far from its maximum is likely to contain outliers" Is what I've written correct? What are the questions I need to be asking myself to get the best interpretation of this data? I've searched online/on here for some analysis of descriptive statistics but have struggled to find anything 'juicy'. I'd be ever so grateful for some ideas.
