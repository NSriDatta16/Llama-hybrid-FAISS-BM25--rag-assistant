Forecasting an index with google in R

I am trying to predict an index using Google Trend Data. I try to orientate myself by this paper . In this paper the authors use the three variables: Sales, Index and SearchFrequency to forecast the Index(he also forecast the sales but in my case its not necessary). Already here a question arise for me: (1) In this paper the authors use a "seasonal autoregressive (AR) model" for multivariate data. I thought that AR models can only be used for univariate data. So I am wondering if they used an AR model for every time series separately and put the outputs into a linear regression model? I feel stupid asking that question but that's how I can explain it to myself. Back to my case: These are my two time series: Search Frequency: freq (blue-line) Index: index (red-line) Both time series are quarterly data points. As you can see in the graph of "SearchFrequency" there is a slight seasonality in the fourth quarter. Because both time series are non-stationary my first step was to transfer them into stationary time series. (2) Do both time series have to be stationary? I used autoplot(diff(freq)) and autoplot(diff(diff(index))) (3) sometimes I also read about taking the log instead of differencing. After log however my time series still weren't stationary so I decided to take the differencing, but it would be still interesting to know when to use what. after differencing the time series look like this: Search Frequency: Index: Search frequency for me seems to be stationary with high variance now and index seems also to be stationary but I had to difference twice because after the first time there was still a trend. To determine appropriate values for p,q I used the ACF and PACF plot: For Index: (4) Looking at the ACF Plot we see two significant spikes and in PACF we see three spikes. does that mean that I should use p=2 and q=3? For Frequency: (5) Looking at the ACF and PACF plots of Frequency its getting really confusing for me. The ACF shows a sinusoidal pattern with a lot of spikes and the PACF has 5 spikes if we ignore the spike at lag 7. Which information can I get out of this? (6) what is the next step? Should I do the auto.arima() with both time series and try to compare them to arima() with the p,d,q I got out of the ACF and PACF plots, compare them and choose the model which has the lowest AIC value? I am really grateful for any kind of help. I worked with "forecasting. principles and practice" by Rob Hyndman which helped me already a lot. EDIT: frequency: 3 2 5 3 3 4 6 5 8 6 5 4 4 7 7 5 9 8 9 8 9 11 11 11 15 16 19 12 26 30 29 24 32 36 38 28 39 45 48 39 52 55 58 44 65 68 69 59 70 71 75 58 77 79 77 71 90 88 94 75 98 90 index: 83.9 82.8 81.9 80.6 84.2 82.7 84.4 82 83.2 83.5 82.3 83 80 81.7 81.6 81.6 82.8 83.1 81.6 81.8 81.8 83.1 82.9 84.2 83 84.3 84.3 83.8 86 87.1 86.7 87.3 87.9 89.1 90.4 91.6 91.3 93.1 92.9 93 93.8 95.7 96.2 96.2 97.8 99.9 100.4 101.8 103.9 106.9 108.8 110.4 110.9 113.1 115 117.3 118.3 120.6 123.1 124.6 124.4 126.9
