jQUery context menu on left click

I am using jQuery context menu plugin by Chris Domigan to appy a context menu. This is how it works: $('#contacts tbody tr').contextMenu('myMenu1', { bindings: { 'copy': function(t) { alert('Trigger was '+t.id+'\nAction was Copy'); }, 'delete': function(t) { alert('Trigger was '+t.id+'\nAction was Delete'); } }, }); Now I want this context menu to appear on left click instead of right click. I can not find an option in the doc. Any ideas how to do that? Do I have to modify the source?
