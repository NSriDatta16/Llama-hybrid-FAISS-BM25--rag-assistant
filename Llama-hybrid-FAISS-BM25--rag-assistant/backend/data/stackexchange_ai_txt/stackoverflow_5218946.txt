How to set the focus to a textbox when a jquery dialog is loaded

When I am executing the below line, the dialog is opening properly. $('#divMyDialogBox').dialog('open'); But I have a textbox (i.e txtAddr) inside the div (dialog box) & want the focus to be prompted, when it's going to be loaded. I tried the below code but it's not working. Please rectify the same or suggest new solutions. $('#divEmailDialogBox').dialog ({ modal: true, draggable: true, hide: 'slide', show: 'slide', height: 100, width: 575, bgiframe: true, autoOpen: false, resizable: false, closeOnEscape: false, zIndex: 9999, open: function(){alert("Hi"); $("#txtAddr").focus();} }); $('#divEmailDialogBox').dialog('open'); Here alert is firing, indicates the code is getting called. Thanks in Advance, Biki
