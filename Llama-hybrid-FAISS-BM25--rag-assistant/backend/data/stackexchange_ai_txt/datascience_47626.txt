No you should not do this, it is causing a data leak. Data leaks happen when the data you are using to train a machine learning algorithm happens to have the information you are trying to predict. It will give your model information about your test data during training. It will cause your test scores to be overly optimistic and will make the model worse at generalizing to totally unseen data. Good resource on data leakage
