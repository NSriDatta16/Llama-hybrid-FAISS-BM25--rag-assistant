The book "Linux kernel Development" of Robert Love has a good explanation about process kernel stack. And yes, each process has its own kernel stack and if I´m not wrong its pointer is stored on thread_info structure. But I´m not really sure about it, and the struct task_struct is stored on beginning or the end of process kernel stack, depending of CPU architecture. Cheers. Carlos Maiolino
