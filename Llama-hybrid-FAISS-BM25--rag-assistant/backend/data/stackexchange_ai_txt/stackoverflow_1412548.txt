so it turns out that somehow a mouse or mouse driver was causing this. When I brought my work machine home. the problem was suddenly on my work machine. When I shut it off, hooked up a different keyboard and mouse... the problem dissapeared. A few weeks back my mouse's 5th button broke. I'm guessing it broke in such a way that the button is held down, or other parts of it also messed up. because as long as that mouse doesn't get plugged in, my dragging in visual studio on those specific controls works. It was an old Razer mouse. When I went into the device manager, there was a conflict/warning showing on that mouse.
