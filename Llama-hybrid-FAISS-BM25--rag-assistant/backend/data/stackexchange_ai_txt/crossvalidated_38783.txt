To me, this looks like a balanced, nested design with 3 levels of random effect: subject, trial, measurement point. I'm not clear to me on what happens at the measurement point level. It looks as if you get several measurements there as well. Perhaps you could clarify. What sort of error structure do you think you have? Are the errors normally distributed? If you average over the velocity measurements at the end, can you assume (or transform) to normality? To me, it looks as if your model is something like this: $$ Y_{ijk}=\mu + \alpha_i+\beta_{ij}+\gamma_{ijk} $$ where alpha, beta and gamma are error terms attributed to subject, trial and measurement point. if so, then fitting a general linear model with random effects will give you an estimate for the variance at each stage. You have no fixed effects apart from the overall mean. If you want to predict the response of a random subject, your best estimate will be that overall mean. Confidence intervals will be based on the sum of the estimated variances at each stage. $$\sqrt{\hat\sigma_{\alpha}^2+\hat\sigma_{\beta}^2+\hat\sigma_{\gamma}^2}$$
