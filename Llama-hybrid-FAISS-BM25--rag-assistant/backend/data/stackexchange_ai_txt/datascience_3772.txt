Time series prediction

I am trying to predict a time serie from another one. My approach is based on a moving windows. I predict the output value of the serie from the following features: the previous value and the 6 past values of the source serie. Is it usefull to add the previous value of the time serie ? I feel like I don't use all the information contained in the curve to predict futures values. But I don't see how it would be possible to use all previous data to predict a value (first, the number of features would be growing trough time...). What are the caveats of a 6 month time-window approach ? Is there any paper about differents method of feature selection for time-series ?
