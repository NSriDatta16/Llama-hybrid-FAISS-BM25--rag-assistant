If continuous $X$ can predict continuous $Y$ , continuous $Y$ can predict binary $X$ . So it is OK to reverse the problem and use logistic regression. The main disadvantages are (1) the power of this approach relative to the $t$ -test needs to be further explored and (2) interpretation of parameter estimates is harder. But on the plus side you can turn a multivariate response problem into a univariate problem using this reversal. This approach was described by O'Brien here . Another advantage of the approach is that it extends past comparison of mean $Y$ . If you expand (now) predictor $Y$ into a quadratic polynomial, you are able to detect differences between $Y$ groups of both the mean and the variance of $X$ . Adding a cube term would allow the skewness to vary. There is a relation to discriminant analysis. When assumptions of linear discriminant analysis hold, a reversed binary logistic regression has to fit. When using quadratic discriminant analysis, a quadratic logistic regression works.
