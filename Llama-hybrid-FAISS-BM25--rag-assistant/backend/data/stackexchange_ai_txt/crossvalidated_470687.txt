Measuring significance of algorithm

I m newbee in deep learning and I try to understand algorithms and their statistical logic. I could not understand let us we have two algorithms A and B with 75% and 78% test set accuracies respectively. Is that mean Algorithm A is significantly better than Algorithm B if the test set contains 100 instances?
