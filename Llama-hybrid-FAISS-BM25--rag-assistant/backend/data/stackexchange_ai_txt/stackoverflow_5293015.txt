Exception "Could not load file or assembly 'Messages' or one of its dependencies." NServiceBus

I am just trying to run a simple NServiceBus Pub/Sub example. Basically, I have pub/sub as console apps and when i run them I am getting an exception on sub side. Exception was unhandled by user code Message=Exception when starting endpoint, error has been logged. Reason: Error creating object with name 'NServiceBus.Unicast.UnicastBus' : Error setting property values: PropertyAccessExceptionsException (1 errors); nested PropertyAccessExceptions are: [Spring.Core.TypeMismatchException: Cannot convert property value of type [System.Collections.Hashtable] to required type [System.Collections.IDictionary] for property 'MessageOwners'., Inner Exception: System.ArgumentException: Problem loading message assembly: Messages ---> System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Messages' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. File name: 'Messages' at System.Reflection.Assembly._nLoad(AssemblyName fileName, String codeBase, Evidence assemblySecurity, Assembly locationHint, StackCrawlMark& stackMark, Boolean throwOnFileNotFound, Boolean forIntrospection) at System.Reflection.Assembly.nLoad(AssemblyName fileName, String codeBase, Evidence assemblySecurity, Assembly locationHint, StackCrawlMark& stackMark, Boolean throwOnFileNotFound, Boolean forIntrospection) at System.Reflection.Assembly.InternalLoad(AssemblyName assemblyRef, Evidence assemblySecurity, StackCrawlMark& stackMark, Boolean forIntrospection) at System.Reflection.Assembly.InternalLoad(String assemblyString, Evidence assemblySecurity, StackCrawlMark& stackMark, Boolean forIntrospection) at System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(String assemblyString) at NServiceBus.Unicast.UnicastBus.ConfigureMessageOwners(IDictionary owners) in d:\BuildAgent-02\work\20b5f701adefe8f8\src\unicast\NServiceBus.Unicast\UnicastBus.cs:line 1204 Looks like I am missing assembly called "Messages", but I am not sure where I could find it. Thanks.
