How can Safari be prevented from scrolling an overflow:hidden iframe?

With Safari you can disable most iframe scrolling by setting style="overflow: hidden;" on the iframe. However, if you click in the iframe and move the mouse the content scrolls anyhow. Example: scrollcontent.html: A B In this example, the iframe should only show a green area and it should be impossible to reveal the red area. This is mostly true: there is no scrollbar, the mouse wheel doesn't do anything and neither do the arrow keys. However click and drag still scrolls the view. This is particularly noticeable when selecting text. Does anyone know any trick to stop Safari from doing this?
