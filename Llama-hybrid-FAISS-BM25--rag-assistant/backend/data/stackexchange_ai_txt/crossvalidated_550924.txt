Using statistical tests to decide on how to do the final analysis is generally a bad idea. Tests do not have power of 1.0 for detecting non-normality, and then there is the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence problem. Transforming different subsets of Y differently is a recipe for not being able to interpret any of the results. Transformations such as Box-Cox are not flexible enough and are highly dependent on zero being a special origin for the measurements. Normality is assessed on model residuals, not on raw data. If you want to use a robust and powerful model that is invariant to transformations of Y and resistent to outliers, use a semiparametric ordinal regression model, which will also handle interaction elegantly. See examples in the Nonparametrics chapter of BBR .
