File storage in Heroku - alternatives?

I have an app in Heroku and love its simplicity, however, I need simple file storage for uploaded images (using file_column). As I see it, my options are to migrate over to Slicehost or get the Heroku app working with Amazon S3 (I'm a bit perplexed by the S3 pricing scheme). Are there other alternatives?
