cakephp saveAll not working at all

so I have a Tarif, which hasMany Price (each for different currency - doesn't really matter) the view (deleted irrelevant parts) Form->create('Tarif'); echo $this->Form->input("Price.0.price"); echo $this->Form->input("Price.0.currency"); echo $this->Form->input("Price.0.sms_format"); echo $this->Form->input("Price.0.sms_number"); echo $html->link(__('Add currency', true), '#', array('onclick'=>'return false;', 'class' => 'tarifs-add-currency')); echo $this->Form->input('Tarif.valid_since', array('timeFormat' => '24')); echo $this->Form->input('Tarif.valid_until', array('timeFormat' => '24')); echo $this->Form->input('Tarif.storage_time', array('label' => __('Storage time (days)', true))); echo $this->Form->end(__('Submit', true));?> The controller function to save it looks like this function admin_add() { if (!empty($this->data)) { $this->Tarif->create(); if ($this->Tarif->saveAll($this->data)) { $this->Session->setFlash(__('The tarif has been saved', true)); $this->redirect(array('action' => 'admin_index')); } else { $this->Session->setFlash(__('The tarif could not be saved. Please, try again.', true)); } } } The "add currency" link is there to add new inputs for new prices, but that isn't the problem, because it doesn't work even without adding currencies. When I try to save it, it says 'The tarif could not be saved. Please, try again.'. Don't you know what should I change in order to make it work? Thanks EL
