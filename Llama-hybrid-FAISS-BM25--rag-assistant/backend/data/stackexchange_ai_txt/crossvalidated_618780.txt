HMM model training issue in implementation

I am attempting to train an HMM on a series of sequences but the resulting prediction of the hidden states returns no change over the time series. My dataset is structured where the state begins in a certain state and at a certain point in each series, transitions to the other state. I have defined the state for each of the time series as but am not certain how to use this information in training the dataset. I am using the HMMLearn package in Python with a Gaussian Mixture Emission HMM (GMMHMM) and have the sequences selected and the associated lengths of each sequence but as I stated before, after training, the prediction shows no change over an example sequence. seq_final.shape = (14758, 9) len(lengths) = 311 sum(lengths) = 14758 Code: model = hl.GMMHMM(n_mix=9, n_iter=300, n_components=2, tol=1e-3) model.fit(seq_final, np.array(lengths)) The seq_final is a ~15000x9 np array broken up with the lengths array to delineate different sequences as instructed. I currently have not added the state to the dataset used to train but I think that is the aspect I am missing. Edit: I am trying to implement the training set with supervised learning instead of unsupervised as it is not correctly predicting the state change and I don't know why.
