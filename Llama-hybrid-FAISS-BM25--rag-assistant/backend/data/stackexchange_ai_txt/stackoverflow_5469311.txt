You can do it by putting html code in the cell data, there is a guide on the MATLAB site with an example, but IMHO it's not very elegant way of doing it as it makes the content a string and hides the data. It makes any subsequent data handling very awkward as you have to start separating out the html code. http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-D782JW/index.html?product=ML&solution=1-D782JW So the content of the cell ends up like this 'my text' So a worked example to clarify the comments, as I realised that the example above colours the text and not the background as requested. scores=cell(7,10); scores(3,4)={' my text '} f=figure uit = uitable(f, 'Data', scores,'Units', 'normalized','Position', [0 0 1 1]); This creates the cell array of scores with one cell html inserted. When you create the uitable you set the property 'Data' to this cell array. If you have already created your table via guide then you should have a handle to the table object, in which case you should be able to use set set(uitableHandle,'Data',scores); As I said it's a bit messy and doesn't work that well as it just colours the text background rather than the entire cell but I think that's the best you'll get with using the native MATLAB GUI widgets.
