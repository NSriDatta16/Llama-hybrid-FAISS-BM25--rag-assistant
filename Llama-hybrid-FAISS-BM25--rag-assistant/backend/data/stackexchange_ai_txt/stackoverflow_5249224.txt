Controls insist on being too large and won't resize in Qt Designer

I made a "widget" in Qt Designer with about a dozen controls organized into horizontal and vertical layouts. Oddly, every horizontal layout wants to be some large size, about 400 px wide, when the whole form is set to be 275px wide. Buttons, etc, contained within, are too wide for the form. When I resize the widget form vertically or horizontally (sometimes with the max width turned off), the various layouts won't resize. Manually setting widths (or min widths, or max widths) may affect the sizes of the controls, but not their spacing within the layout. Spacers, inserted to keep some controls at the top and some others at the bottom with a flexible space between, just don't work at all. What (probably) obvious thing am I overlooking?
