What type of information are you looking for? You could try using ruby's open-uri module. The following example is from http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/index.html require 'open-uri' open("http://www.ruby-lang.org/en") {|f| p f.base_uri # p f.content_type # "text/html" p f.charset # "iso-8859-1" p f.content_encoding # [] p f.last_modified # Thu Dec 05 02:45:02 UTC 2002 } EDIT: It seems that the op wanted to retrieve ID3 tag information from the remote files. This is more complex. From wiki: This appears to be a difficult problem. On wiki: Tag location within file Only with the ID3v2.4 standard has it been possible to place the tag data at the end of the file, in common with ID3v1. ID3v2.2 and 2.3 require that the tag data precede the file. Whilst for streaming data this is absolutely required, for static data it means that the entire audio file must be updated to insert data at the front of the file. For initial tagging this incurs a large penalty as every file must be re-written. Tag writers are encouraged to introduce padding after the tag data in order to allow for edits to the tag data without requiring the entire audio file to be re-written, but these are not standard and the tag requirements may vary greatly, especially if APIC (associated pictures) are also embedded. This means that depending on the ID3 tag version of the file, you may have to read different parts of the file. Here's an article that outlines the basics of reading ID3 tag using ruby for ID3tagv1.1 but should server as a good starting point: http://rubyquiz.com/quiz136.html You could also look into using a ID3 parsing library, such as id3.rb or id3lib-ruby ; however, I'm not sure if either supports the ability to parse a remote file (Most likely could through some modifications).
