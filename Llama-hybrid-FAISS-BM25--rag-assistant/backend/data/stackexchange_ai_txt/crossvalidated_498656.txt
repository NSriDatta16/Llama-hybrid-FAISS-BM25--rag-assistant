I am assuming a person has fixed demographic features, so for example, male/female, which would be fixed for a person. Then let's say you already have fixed effects per person, and you add an additional coefficient for male/female effects. This adds too many degrees of freedom. For example, if all males score +1 over time. Then you could fit that with a coefficient of +1 on all male persons, or with a +1 on the male coefficient. Intuitively, +1 on the male coefficient is better, but that is then not part of the model. If you apply some regularization, such as a random effects model or ridge regression, you can solve that problem. But with adding fixed effects per person and then also for demographic variables, your model has redundant coefficients and any significance results shouldn't be trusted (if at all btw, I'm a Bayesian :)). Some packages will automatically add some regularization, or are built so that they will still assign the +1 to male somehow, but that changes the question. Assuming only fixed effects, your model becomes underspecified.
