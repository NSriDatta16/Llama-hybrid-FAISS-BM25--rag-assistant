Good accuracy despite high loss value

During the training of a simple neural network binary classifier I get an high loss value, using cross-entropy. Despite this, accuracy's value on validation set holds quite good. Does it have some meaning? There is not a strict correlation between loss and accuracy? I have on training and validation these values: 0.4011 - acc: 0.8224 - val_loss: 0.4577 - val_acc: 0.7826 . This is my first attempt to implement a NN, and I just approached machine learning, so I'm not able to properly evaluate these results.
