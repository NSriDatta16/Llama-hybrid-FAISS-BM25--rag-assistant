Simplest form of security to protect a page

I'm working on a site whereby a customer needs to input a given "code" in order to access a website. I.e. when the customer hits the site they are prompted to enter a very simple code which will let them access the rest of the site. Now I'm not a great programmer as such (my skills limited to HTML, CSS and JSP). The site is only going to be accessed by your average 'Joe Bloggs' (but of course it would be naive of me to think that other, more 'tech-savvy' won't be able to access the site - there is nothing 'sensitive' that they would know even if they did access it). I'm using a crappy CMS (TeamSite) and have built the site in HTML and CSS so far. What is the simplest form of 'security' (and I use the term loosely) that I could implement to allow customer access to the rest of the site? I assume that I could just do a crappy function in JSP that would say: `if input = 'this' then take customer here` but I realise that this is very poor. Now the site is only going to be accessible by a few 100 people as it's just a pilot scheme. If this were to become 'bigger' we would of course look at something more robust (in terms of security) but I need an interim solution. I could of course just include the JS in the file and I realise this is incredibly daft but again, this site isn't intended for tech savvy users...I just want to be able to hide the "code" from your everyday user, judging by what I've said above users that View the source code would be able to access the code... I would appreciate your thoughts and thanks in advance.
