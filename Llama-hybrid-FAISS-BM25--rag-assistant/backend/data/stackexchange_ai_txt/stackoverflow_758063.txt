Sphinx, Rails, ThinkSphinx and making some words matter more than others in your query

I have a list of keywords that I need to search against, using ThinkingSphinx Some of them being more important than others, i need to find a way to weight those words. So far, the only solution i came up with is to repeat x number of times the same word in my query to increase its relevance. Eg: 3 keywords, each of them having a level of importance: Blue(1) Recent(2) Fun(3) I run this query MyModel.search "Blue Recent Recent Fun Fun Fun", :match_mode => :any Not very elegant, and quite limiting. Does anyone have a better idea?
