How to find expected cost when a random variable associated with that cost is normally distributed?

The question is as follows; Grear Tires has produced a new tire with a mean mileage of 36500 miles and std dev of 5000 (assume normal). Grear has offered to refund a $1 per 100 miles short of 30000. For each tire sold, what is the expected cost of this offer? My approach was to find the probability density for each value 100 points down starting 30000. And to find probability-weighted average; Miles Probability Refund 29900 3.338741e-05 $1 29800 3.251101e-05 $ 2 ... 100 2.474479e-16 $299 Is this the correct way to do it?
