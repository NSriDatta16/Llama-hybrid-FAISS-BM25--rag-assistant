Calculating Porbabilites in a Bayesian Network

I have got the following Network and porbabilites And I need to Calculate the probability $P(C=False)$ I triend using the formula for joint porability distributions $P(X_1,…,X_n)= \prod_{i=1}^{n}P(X_i∣ parents (X_i))$ ,and got $P(C=False)=P(C=False|A,B)$ . If I am not wrong, you can infer that $P(C=False|A,B) = 0.75$ from the table of probabilites , but I would like to know what is the general way to solving a problem like this in case not all the probabilities for each case are the same.
