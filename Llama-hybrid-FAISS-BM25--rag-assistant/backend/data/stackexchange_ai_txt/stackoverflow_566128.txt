Set up a job or create a maintenance plan for doing full backups of all your databases daily, system databases weekly. If you're using Full recovery mode, add a transaction log backup job to run at least hourly. Make sure you have a process to know if the backup jobs aren't running (oops, someone stopped the agent a month ago, now we have no backups). Test your backups by restoring them on another server. You may need optimization jobs to keep your indexes under control daily/weekly/monthly depending on usage.
