Extract the application logic to separate classes. Your application will be easier to work with if you keep the controllers as thin as possible. The Post, Redirect, Get pattern is effective for MVC. A good post about this from my bookmarks collection is: http://www.eworldui.net/blog/post/2008/05/ASPNET-MVC---Using-Post2c-Redirect2c-Get-Pattern.aspx I would also recommend looking into Action Filters. Robert Conery has a good introduction to using action filters on his blog at http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/aspnet-mvc-securing-your-controller-actions/ . The post is authentication-specific, but the concepts can be extrapolated to whatever type of functionality you want to implement.
