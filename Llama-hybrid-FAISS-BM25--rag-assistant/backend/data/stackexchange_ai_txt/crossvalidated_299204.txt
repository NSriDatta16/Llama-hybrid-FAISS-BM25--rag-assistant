What would be conclusion from statistics tests?

I'm new in data science so please sorry if this is silly question to be asked. While building a predictive model on machine learning using logistic regression I got stuck in statistics tests needed. I have some doubts in statistics tests and following are the questions: 1) In order to check independency in between predictors certain statistics tests are requires as: i) continuous vs continuous(correlation test) ii) categorical vs continuous(ANOVA test) iii) categorical vs categorical(chi-square test) But want to ask, a) what would I concluded from these tests results? b) suppose if two predictors are dependent then what to do next? c) should I need to keep the dependent predictors,if yes then why? d) In one the test chi square value is 18.35 and p-value is 0.08. now what i can concluded from these value I know that P-value is greater the 0.05 but don't get what it represents?
