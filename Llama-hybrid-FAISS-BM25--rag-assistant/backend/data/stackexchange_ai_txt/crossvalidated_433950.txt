A lot depends on how you prepare the data. It would be very valuable if you use some external data with respect to postal code as suggested by @Dan. For example you can try to build a simple regression model that tries to predict number of damage claims. For this, inputs may be population, average income, month of the year, number of insurance holders in that area and output may be number of insurance claimed. You've to be bit creative and inquisitive, and experiment with different features/models to arrive the model that suits your need. All the best.
