How to choose a importance density for Jeffreys prior?

I want to draw Bayesian inference via importance sampling and I do not come up with a good idea of an importance density for $$p(\sigma)\sim\frac{1}{\sigma}.$$ Is there a way to sample from this distribution directly? I am not sure whether $$\frac{1}{z}, z\sim\mathcal{U}[0,1]$$ will give me the desired property. Update: I implemented the proposed importance function and computed the weights $$w_t=p(\sigma_t|\mathbf{y})\Big/\left\{\frac{1}{2a}\mathbb{I}_{[0,a]}(\sigma_t)+\frac{a}{2}\mathbb{I}_{[a,\infty)}(\sigma_t)\sigma_t^{-2}\right\}$$ for a sample of $m=1.000.000$ draws. Hereby I computed the log likelihoods $\omega_{log}$, substracted the maximum $\omega_{log}$ and transformed $\omega=\exp(\omega_{log}-\omega_\max)$. What can I learn from the fact, that roughly $0.98 %$ percent of the weights are $0$? I suppose that in this case the choice of the importance sample is not sensitive, as the sample size does not really matter but only a couple of observations drive the whole result?
