Testing for the effect of an intervention when it is applied on a group of which each individual is measured

Suppose we have 500 students nested in 20 classes (different classrooms), 25 students per class student They all take a test. score The model below would tell you about the average scores and variability among students and classes library(lme4) lmer(score~(1|class)) Suppose further that a random 10 of the classrooms were painted red the other 10 were painted blue. redvblue Is this a reasonable way to test for the effect of redvblue on test scores? And if it is reasonable, is there a better way? lmer(score~redvblue+(1|class)) I'm wondering whether I should be concerned that redvblue was applied at the classroom level rather than the student level.
