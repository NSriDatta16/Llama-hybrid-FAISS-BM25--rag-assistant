MySQL: Last 10 entries per user?

I have a table storing transactional data for users. To find a users rating you take the average score of the last 10 entries for that user. Is there a way to get that with SQL? I need to be able to work it out for a single user given their ID. And to get a list of all users ordered by their score. Currently I'm working it out outside MySQL and storing it in another col for each user so I can ORDER_BY that. # returns average for all transactions. SELECT user_id, AVG(score) FROM transactions WHERE user_id = 1 # returns scores for last 10 transactions. SELECT user_id, score FROM transactions WHERE user_id = 1 ORDER_BY date DESC LIMIT 10
