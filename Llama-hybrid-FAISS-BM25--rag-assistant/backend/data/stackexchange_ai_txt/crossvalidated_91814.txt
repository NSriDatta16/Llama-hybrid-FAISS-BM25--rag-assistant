Probability enemy territory captured in X turns

I am playing Warlight online (something like Risk), and my goal is to create a bot which plays against other bots. n=100 attacking troops will on average kill 60 (p=0.6) troops each turn, n=100 defending troops will on average kill 70 (p=0.7) troops each turn. They attack exactly at the same time. Binomial distribution such that variance=n*p*(1-p) My question is the following: imagine we have 40 troops and the enemy has 25 troops. I am interested in the case that I continuously attack. What would be the chance that I have won by turn X (e.g. X=5)? For turn = 1, it is simply the cumulative sum from at least 25 kills: $$\sum_{i=25}^{40} {40 \choose i} * 0.6^i * (1-0.6)^{(40-i)} = 0.440$$ I have played around with the binomial distribution, but I find it difficult to calculate because of this "in X turns"; it seems it really explodes the amount of calculations needed (by lack of a smart trick). Can this be done analytically or am I best off just to simulate this (which I assume will be much slower)? EDIT: Perhaps it can simply be done by using the 60% and 70%?
