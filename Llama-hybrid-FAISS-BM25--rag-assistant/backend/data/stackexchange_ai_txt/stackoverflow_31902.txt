You asked for engineering reasons, so this is not strictly speaking an answer to the question. But I think it's a valid clarification. As you say, obfuscation is intended to address a social problem. And social (or business) problems, unlike technical ones, rarely have a complete solution. There are only degrees of success in addressing or minimising the problem. In this case, obfuscation will raise the barriers to someone decompiling and stealing your code. It will discourage casual attacks and, through inertia, may make your intellectual property less likely to be stolen. To make a tiresome analogy, an immobiliser doesn't prevent your car being stolen, but it will make it less likely. Of course there is a cost, in maintainability, (possibly) in performance and most importantly in making it harder for users to accurately submit bug reports. As GateKiller said, obfuscation won't prevent a determined team from decompiling, but (and it depends what your product is) how determined a team is likely to be attacking you? So, this is not a technical solution to a social problem, it's a technical decision which adds one influence to a complex social structure.
