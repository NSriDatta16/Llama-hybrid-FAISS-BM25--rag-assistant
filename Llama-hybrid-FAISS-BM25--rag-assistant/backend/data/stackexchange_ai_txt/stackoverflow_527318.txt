You have here a pretty comprehensive list of GWT plugins/editors . Those are geared towards GWT projects creation, and not so much towards GUI. However, you also have VistaFei (not very active at the moment, but worth checking out). It comes with its own eclipse distribution: alt text http://blogs.zdnet.com/images/burnette_vistafei_control_grid_398.png A visual Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building AJAX apps based on Google Web Toolkit (GWT) for all AJAX-enabled platforms. Applications are built by "drag & drop" from a Palette on the basis of What You See Is What You Get. VistaFei is a visual feature-full Java development environment geared towards apps development based on GWT. Applications are developed in Java then compiled and debugged using GWT Compiler and Debugger, and launched to a browser all from within same environment.
