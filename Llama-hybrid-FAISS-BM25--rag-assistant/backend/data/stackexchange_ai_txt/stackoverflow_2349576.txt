It depends on how is your program organized. You may return an additional boolean signifying if the function succeeded. You may return a structure containing boolean and string. You may return a special string (not necessarily empty) which should represent the failure. You may throw an exception. You may set a global flag indicating an error (though I would not recommend it). There must be lot of other methods to express function failure, too.
