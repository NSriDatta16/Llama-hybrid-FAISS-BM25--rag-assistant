Yes, Custom Post Types are a perfect fit for your needs. Here are some links to articles explaining them: http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/04/29/custom-post-types-in-wordpress http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-use-custom-post-types/ http://thinkvitamin.com/dev/create-your-first-wordpress-custom-post-type/ You can use a plugin like Custom Post Type UI or just add the register_post_type() calls to your theme's functions.php file: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/ Then you can use a plugin like "Simple Fields" to add metaboxes to your Agent post type (although there are numerous plugins offering similar functionality; I'm building one myself!): http://eskapism.se/code-playground/simple-fields/ Hope this helps...
