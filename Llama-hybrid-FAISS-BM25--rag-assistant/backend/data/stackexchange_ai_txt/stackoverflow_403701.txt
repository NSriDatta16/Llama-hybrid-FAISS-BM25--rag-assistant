I think that in principle package level protection makes a lot of sense. It allows you to create something close to a module (a package) but only expose the core classes. For example, many of my projects work with public interfaces and "hidden" classes that implement them. Users use factories, and receive a reference to the interface which corresponds to a "hidden" concrete implementation. With package protection I should be, in theory, able to only expose the interfaces and the factory. Unfortunately, because package protection does not apply to subpackages, it doesn't really fit the way that I work. I like using other packages and in particular subpackages for my "internal" stuff (in the same way that Eclipse is organized). As a result, my package cannot access package-level protected things in the subpackage. I do wish that this would be changed one day.
