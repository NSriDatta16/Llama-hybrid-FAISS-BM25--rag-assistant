Interpretation of an equation

I'm trying to describe the equation in the attached screenshot in my own words. $\lvert(\overline\chi_1-\overline\chi_2)\rvert > s_1(t_{1 @ 99 \%}) + s_2(t_{2 @ 75 \%})$ The equation tests whether 99% of population 1 lies outside of 75% of population 2. The equation is taken from Donegan, T., 2012. Geographical variation in Immaculate Antbird Myrmeciza immaculata, with a new subspecies from the Central Andes of Colombia. Bull. Brit. Orn. Club, 132, pp.1â€“40. My current interpretation is as follows: The difference between the means of the population 1 and 2 must be greater than 99% of a standard deviation in population 1 plus 75% of a standard deviation in population 2. I realise my interpretation may not be quite right. Can anybody give a better interpretation?
