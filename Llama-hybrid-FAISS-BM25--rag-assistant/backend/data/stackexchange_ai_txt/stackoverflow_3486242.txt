send cURL post to be received exactly like form post

I am trying to send simple entries in a form using PHP cURL so the remote server that the entries go to receives them in exactly the same manner as if sent from the form. So far, the remote server accepts post from the form but not when sent by this PHP code. fopen and fsockopen etc. are set to off by the host (Yahoo) that I use so cURL seems the best alternative. $URL="http://remote_server.cgi"; $useragent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Ant.com Toolbar 2.0.1 Firefox/3.6.8 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729) AutoPager/0.6.1.22'; $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $useragent); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $URL); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $_POST); curl_exec ($ch); curl_close ($ch); The remote server will not accept the entries when sent this way. What can be done to make the entries be received the same as if sent by the form? FORM action="http://remote_server.cgi" method="POST"
