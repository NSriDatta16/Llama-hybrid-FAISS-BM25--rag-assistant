I don't know if this is the answer you are looking for, but generally start by asking "what would I do differently"? So, if I am running a business (to apply some context), at how often do I not have coverage for certain positions. How can I schedule shifts (for example) to ensure that all critical positions are covered but I have as few people in the building as possible (minimising cost)? As a simple time series, you could apply any sort of forecasting to this data set - predicting who and how long they will be in the building, when they will arrive next, for example. Look for seasonality in the arrival patterns. You could also look to predict when a given person will next be in the building. And can you detect outliers? Who has been leaving early or breaking from their usual pattern of behaviour?
