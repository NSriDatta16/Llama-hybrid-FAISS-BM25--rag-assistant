Quantifying fit of a non-linear model

I have developed a non-linear model that utilizes 0-fitting parameters (all my inputs can be/are determined experimentally). As of now I have performed propagation of error and a GSA using Sobol indices, but I would like to have a better measure of how well it concurs with my experiments. Is it possible to compare the bootstrapped model averages with the experimental averages for the entire time series using a statistical test, rather than just the RMSE or MSE?
