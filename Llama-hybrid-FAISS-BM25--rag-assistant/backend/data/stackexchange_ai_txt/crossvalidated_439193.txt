From Wolfgang Viechtbauer , "the (log transformed) ratio of the coefficient of variation of the two groups (also called the coefficient of variation ratio) can be a useful measure (Nakagawa et al., 2015). If focus is solely on the variability of the measurements within the two groups, then the (log transformed) ratio of the standard deviations (also called the variability ratio) can be used (Nakagawa et al., 2015)."
