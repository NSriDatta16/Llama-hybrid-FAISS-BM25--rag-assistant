It's the lowest-level attempt at identity validation . It encourages users to re-use the same account when they return (by having a common, shared identifier you and they can use to reconnect), and it prevents impersonation, because it requires access to the claimed identity as proof. It's not perfect, but something by definition works infinitely better than nothing. If identity doesn't matter on your site (e.g. your service is throwaway after each use) then you don't need email activation. Otherwise, you probably want it.
