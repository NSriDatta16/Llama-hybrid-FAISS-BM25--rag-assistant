How to add a "Suggest Our FaceBook Page to A Friend" interface on a website?

With the many programming tools from FaceBook, like FaceBook connect, graph api, etc... Is there a way to create a form on a website that does this: I. Website visitor logs into FaceBook (from my website) II. Form changes. Website visitor is presented with button: " Invite FaceBook Friends to Like Our FaceBook Page " III. Form changes to new interface. User is able to view his friends, choose specific friends and suggest FaceBook page to them. User clicks submit button. IV. FaceBook page is suggested to friends. Data is sent to custom website application/DB to track the FaceBook info of the person who made the suggestion(s). The whole point of this is that we want to offer a people who refer their FaceBook friends to our FaceBook page some sort of incentive (free product) and we need a way to encourage & track that.
