Parallel Q-learning

I'm looking for academic papers or other credible sources focusing on the topic of parralelized reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning. I'm mostly interested in methods of sharing Q-table between processes (or joining/syncing them together if each process have it's own). I'd also appreciate a brief description of method used in linked/mentioned sources. I should mention that I use neural network (PyBrain) as approximation.
