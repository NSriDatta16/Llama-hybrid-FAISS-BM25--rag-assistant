What you can do is basically train the model for example once a day (depending on the interval), save it and append its forecasts to a copy of the array you're storing your data in so all of it could be easily accessed. You can set the border on the dashboard basing on the index in the array (i.e. 5 periods ahead forecast -> border 5 indexes before the end). You can retrain your model in time series (in some cases you even should). A lot depends on the actual model and actual data here, I cannot give you a strict yes or not answer, however if you're retraining the model you need to be careful with the parameters your model is using and with the statistical properties of the time series (the old and the new one) you're dealing with.
