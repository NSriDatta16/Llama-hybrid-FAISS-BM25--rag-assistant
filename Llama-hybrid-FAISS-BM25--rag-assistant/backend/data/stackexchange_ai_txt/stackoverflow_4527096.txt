What the authors described could be implemented with connected component analysis, using 8way connectivity. I would not call that morphological though. I do think you are missing something else: Their image does not have edges that are thicker than one pixel. Yours has. The paragraph you quoted only talks about removing isolated pixels, so there must be a step you missed or implemented differently. Good luck!
