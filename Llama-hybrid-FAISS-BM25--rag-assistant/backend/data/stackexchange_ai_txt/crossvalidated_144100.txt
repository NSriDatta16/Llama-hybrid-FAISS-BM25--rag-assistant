I quite agree with Nick Cox's response, to give an example where one has to be wary, take compliance with a particular standard by an organisation with just two cost centres where the sample size in the first case is 10 and in the second it is 100. In the first case 8 out of 10 may be compliant, while in the second only 40 out of 100 may be compliant. If one wants to know what the average among cost centres is then the answer is 60%, while if one wants to know what the average is across the organisation as a whole, then it is better to aggregate the underlying numbers, i.e. 48/110 making 44%.
