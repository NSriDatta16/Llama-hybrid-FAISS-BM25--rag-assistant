We ran into a similar situation. Although the design still smells a bit because the DomainService class has a lot of methods, we were able to organize a bit. Choose a way to divide up the responsibilities of the DomainService class. We chose to do this by Entity, but it could be along some other line. You can create a separate file for each responsibility, although each file contains a partial class implementation of your DomainService. Our naming convention for each file was DomainService.Entity.cs Another thing we did was create a separate DomainService for some cross-cutting concerns. We have one for logging messages from the Silverlight client back to the server, and one for authentication only.
