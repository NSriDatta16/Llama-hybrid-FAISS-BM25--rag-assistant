I've been using Eclipse for years, and I found that it never ran acceptably fast on my Mac until I got Ganymede (Eclipse 3.4) and ran it on my Core 2 Duo Macbook w/ 2GB of RAM. Before I had both of those things, it was only ever bearable on Linux or Windows. I'd recommend upgrading your computer. :-) Eclipse is, after all, a beast of a program no matter how you spin it.
