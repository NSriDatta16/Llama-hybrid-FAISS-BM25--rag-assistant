T-test for paired differences of two time series of spatial averages with variable data counts

Suppose I have two 30-day time series consisting of spatial averages of some meteorological variable like global wind speed, for two experiments (over the same 30 days). Each day, there might be a different number of observations, with some days potentially having very few. The two experiments will usually have very similar numbers of observations on any given day. I only have access to the data counts and the spatial means for each day for each experiment. If all the counts were equal, I can use a paired difference t-test to see if time mean global mean wind speed difference between the two experiments differs from 0. Since that is not the case, how can I discern whether the two experiments differ?
