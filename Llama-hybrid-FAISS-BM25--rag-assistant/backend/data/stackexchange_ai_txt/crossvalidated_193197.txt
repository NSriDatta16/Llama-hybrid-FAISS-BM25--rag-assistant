What mean to use in odometer calculation based on model?

Im trying to figure out what would be considered a valid calculation. Imagine I have a dataset that looks like that: +------+-------+----------+-------+ | make | model | odometer | year | +------+-------+----------+-------+ | audi | a4 | 77000 | 2012 | | audi | a4 | 94093 | 2012 | | audi | a4 | 129873 | 2012 | | audi | a4 | 125000 | 2012 | +------+-------+----------+-------+ What I want to calculate is the average number of kilometers that car with above set of parameters (make,model,year) traveled a day. I've started with the following where d is the number of days between the odometer value was taken and the day when the car was made (xxx-01-01). km_d is the odometer/d : +------+---------+----------+ | d | km_d | odometer | +------+---------+----------+ | 6523 | 38.0402 | 250000 | | 6523 | 39.5068 | 259639 | | 6523 | 31.8016 | 209000 | | 6523 | 27.3889 | 180000 | +------+---------+----------+ I've read about different mean calculations but wasn't sure which one would need to be applied in my situation.
