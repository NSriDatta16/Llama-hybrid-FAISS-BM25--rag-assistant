Procedure for Designing CNNs

Are there any standard procedure for designing a CNN? I wrote some Python code for classifying speech signals using the 1D convolutional model in the Keras environment, but I can't meet the accuracy that I expect from it. In the training process the model reaches 98% UAR, but in the test process it overfits and remains at 58%. I used regularizer and dropout and early stopping tricks to overcome overfitting, but unfortunately, I couldn't do it. For more information, I can't augment the database or change the feature vector.
