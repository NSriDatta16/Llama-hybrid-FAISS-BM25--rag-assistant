Azure Table Storage design question: Is it a good idea to use 1 table to store multiple types?

I'm just wondering if anyone who has experience on Azure Table Storage could comment on if it is a good idea to use 1 table to store multiple types? The reason I want to do this is so I can do transactions. However, I also want to get a sense in terms of development, would this approach be easy or messy to handle? So far, I'm using Azure Storage Explorer to assist development and viewing multiple types in one table has been messy. To give an example, say I'm designing a community site of blogs, if I store all blog posts, categories, comments in one table, what problems would I encounter? On ther other hand, if I don't then how do I ensure some consistency on category and post for example (assume 1 post can have one 1 category)? Or are there any other different approaches people take to get around this problem using table storage? Thank you.
