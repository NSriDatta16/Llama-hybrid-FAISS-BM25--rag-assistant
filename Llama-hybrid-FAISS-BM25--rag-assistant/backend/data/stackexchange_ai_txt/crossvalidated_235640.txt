Help with interpreting coefficients in logistic regression

I am running some logistic regressions in R. I need some help with interpreting coefficients. So, if my DV is 1 = yes and 0 = no, and I have five groups (a, b, c, d, e) and I make a the reference group (dummy coding), and the coefficient for b is significant and positive: does this mean the odds of b saying yes compared to the odds of a saying yes is greater? Or is there a greater odds of saying yes for group a compared to b?
