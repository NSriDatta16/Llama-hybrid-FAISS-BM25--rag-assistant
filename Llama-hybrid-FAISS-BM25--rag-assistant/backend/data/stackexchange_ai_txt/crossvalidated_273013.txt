If $x$ is the state vector and $S$ is its variance-covariance matrix, and subscript $i|j$ indicates the estimate at time $i$ given information to time $j$, the steps go: $(x_{0|0},S_{0|0})\stackrel{\rightarrow}{_{_{(P)}}} (x_{1|0},S_{1|0})\stackrel{\rightarrow}{_{_{(U)}}} (x_{1|1},S_{1|1})\rightarrow (x_{2|1},S_{2|1})\rightarrow (x_{2|2},S_{2|2})\rightarrow (x_{3|2},S_{3|2})\rightarrow ...$ The calculation steps (arrows) which are followed by the two halves of the subscript matching are the update steps. You still have to do the steps in the same order, but note that the arrival of an observation can happen as late as in between the two steps in the usual loop you have - you can't avoid this progression within the KF algorithm, though you can modify what it consists of in various ways, and as long as you progress in that order, you can organize your loop however you like. (The matrix operations you do in each step don't care where you put your loop breaks.) So, as you say, most times when people write the algorithm they'll progress as follows (in a sort of pseudocode): Initialize x and S (to 0|0) For i = 1 to n predict x and S (ie. go from i-1|i-1 to i|i-1) (must observe data point by here because it's needed in the next step) update x and S (ie. go from i|i-1 to i|i) i.e. progressing as $(x_{0|0},S_{0|0})\, [\rightarrow (x_{1|0},S_{1|0})\rightarrow (x_{1|1},S_{1|1})]\, [\rightarrow (x_{2|1},S_{2|1})\rightarrow (x_{2|2},S_{2|2})]\, [\rightarrow ...$ (with the square brackest $[...]$ denoting what's done within a single loop). There's nothing stopping you shifting everything along by half a loop: Initialize x and S (to 0|0) predict x and S (ie. go from 0|0 to 1|0) For i = 1 to n-1 (must observe data point by here because it's needed in the next step) update x and S (ie. go from i|i-1 to i|i) predict x and S (ie. go from i|i to i+1|i) i.e. progressing as $(x_{0|0},S_{0|0})\rightarrow (x_{1|0},S_{1|0})\,[\rightarrow (x_{1|1},S_{1|1})\rightarrow (x_{2|1},S_{2|1})]\,[\rightarrow (x_{2|2},S_{2|2})\rightarrow (x_{3|2},S_{3|2})]\,[\rightarrow$ (if the algorithm will end at any point then you may also do a final update step after the loop). I think this is just what you were asking if you can do. This works because that does the same steps in the same order -- it's still the Kalman Filter. The two steps before the loop might be able to be combined into a single step (i.e. in many cases you may be able to just start with the 1|0 values immediately).
