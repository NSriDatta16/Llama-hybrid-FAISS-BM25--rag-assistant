Exchange Web Services and Property Sets

I need to retrieve calendar information by invoking the Exchange Web Service in BPOS. I'm using a CalendarView with a PropertySet to retrieve as little data as possible. However, property sets seems to be limited. I need the EmailAddress of the one who made the calendar appointment so I thought I could use the AppointmentSchema.Organizer in the PropertySet . When fetching a whole appointment I can get the e-mail through appt.Organizer.EmailAddress . But with the code below the Organizer.EmailAddress is always null. I've enabled the trace and checked it and only the Organizer.Name property is sent, nothing else. Does anyone have a solution on how to get the EmailAddress when using a PropertySet ? CalendarView view = new CalendarView(dtFrom, dtTo); view.PropertySet = new PropertySet(ItemSchema.Subject); view.PropertySet.Add(ItemSchema.Id); view.PropertySet.Add(AppointmentSchema.Start); view.PropertySet.Add(AppointmentSchema.End); view.PropertySet.Add(AppointmentSchema.Organizer); // This should contain EmailAddress but it doesn't Mailbox mailbox = new Mailbox("myemail@test.ab"); FolderId id = new FolderId(WellKnownFolderName.Calendar, mailbox); CalendarFolder folder = CalendarFolder.Bind(service, id); FindItemsResults findResults = folder.FindAppointments(view);
