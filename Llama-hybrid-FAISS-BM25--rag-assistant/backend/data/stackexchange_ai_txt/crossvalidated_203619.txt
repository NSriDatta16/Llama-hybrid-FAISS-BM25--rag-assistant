VEC model is a special case of VAR model. It exploits the time-series property of cointegration, i.e. that some linear combinations of unit-root time-series can be stationary. Because of this property VAR model has a special structure, which can be estimated via VECM. To apply VEC model at least two time series must be unit-root time series, because to define cointegration you need at least two unit-root time series. So the answers to your questions are No you cannot difference the non-stationary time series and then estimate VECM. Because estimating VECM on stationary time series does not make sense. Johansen's test can be applied only when all the series are non-stationary, because Johansen's test is for testing cointegration, and cointegration is defined only for unit root time series.
