Checkbox column in Infragistics win ultragrid

Am a newbie to Infragistics. On my winforms app, am using Ultrawingrid to display data from database. How do I show a checkbox column as the first column in the grid? Also, I need to capture check/uncheck event and then read the corresponding grid row/cells in the application. Could you please help me on this? Thanks for reading.
