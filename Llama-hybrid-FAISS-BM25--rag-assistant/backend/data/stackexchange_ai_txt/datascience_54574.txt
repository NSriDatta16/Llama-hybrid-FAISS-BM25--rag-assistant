Supervised learning approach - creating my own labels

Scenario - I have data that does not have labels but I can create a function to label the data based on behavior and deploy the model so I don't have to keep labeling the data. Is this considered machine learning ? Objective : Classify accounts with Volume spikes based on high , medium or low labels to deploy on big data (trillions of lines of data) . Data : The data I have includes the following attributes: Account, Time, Date, Volume amount. Method : Create a new feature column called spike and create a pandas function to ID a spike greater than 5 . Is this feature engineering ? Next I create my label column and classify it as low medium or high spike. Next I train a machine learning classifier and deploy it to label future accounts with similar patterns in big data. Thoughts on this process ? Is this approach correct for machine learning ?
