If you don't insist on having login, t&c and description inside GWT module, and can use jsps for these three things I'd suggest to: * Create security constraint in web.xml and protect whole GWT module via standard web container features. Each access to unprotected resource will be redirected to login form. * Use servlet filter to check whether user has agreed to t&c and read description and store information about it in http session. By the way it'd be quite elegant to use ActivityMapper for second thing, but for login I'd definitely use server-side, proven mechanisms. Hope it helps.
