ARIMA(p,d,q) + GARCH(p,d,q) model

I found an article where they fit an ARIMA(p,d,q) model to a time series and then fit a GARCH(p,d,q) to the residual of the ARIMA (the parameters (p,d,q) are passed as the volatility model lags to the GARCH model and not as the mean model lags). I know that the inconsistencies of doing them serially have been discussed here , here and in other posts. However, my question is if it is valid to reuse the lags of the ARIMA to fit the GARCH model. The traditional ARMA(p,q)-GARCH(r,s) does not do so and I could not find any reference supporting this.
