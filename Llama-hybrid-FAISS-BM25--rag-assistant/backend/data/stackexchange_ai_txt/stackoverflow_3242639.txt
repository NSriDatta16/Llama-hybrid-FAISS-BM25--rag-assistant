Clustered primary keys are only going to take you so far - they just determine the semi-physical organization of rows in pages according to the clustered index. All the data is stored in the tree as opposed to the index, so it's not nearly as efficient for read - you're still effectively reading the entire row. For higher performance, you really want covering non-clustered indexes (these are usually narrower and so fit more data per page), and you want to see index seeks or index scans when you look at the execution plans. These only read the information in the index (plus any included columns) and will fit a lot more per page and be able to go a lot faster (not as much unnecessary data being read and discarded or skipped over).
