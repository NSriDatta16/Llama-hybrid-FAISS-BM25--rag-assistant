Using ' #pragma once ' might not have any effect (it is not supported everywhere - though it is increasingly widely supported), so you need to use the conditional compilation code anyway, in which case, why bother with ' #pragma once '? The compiler probably optimizes it anyway. It does depend on your target platforms, though. If all your targets support it, then go ahead and use it - but it should be a conscious decision because all hell will break loose if you only use the pragma and then port to a compiler that does not support it.
