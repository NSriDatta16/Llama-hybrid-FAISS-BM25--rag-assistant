It’s import to get used to thinking that data can be used as code, and vice versa . Usually you construct a program (data) using several primitive operations (folding, nesting, threading, distributing, ..., and some are generalized inner product, outer product, etc.), and use this program (data) to manipulate other data. After a while, I found that functional programming […] encourages a "top down" design. I agree.
