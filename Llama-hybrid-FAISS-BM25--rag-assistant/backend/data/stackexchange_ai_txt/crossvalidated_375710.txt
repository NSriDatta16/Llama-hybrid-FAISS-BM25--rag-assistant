estimate probability that sensitivity/specificity greater than threshold value

Is there a Bayesian method to estimate the probability that the sensitivity of a diagnostic test is greater than some value, say 0.70? Rather than estimate sensitivity and a confidence interval (e.g., 0.80 [0.7-0.9]), I want to say that there's a 82% probability that the test's sensitivity is greater than 0.70.
