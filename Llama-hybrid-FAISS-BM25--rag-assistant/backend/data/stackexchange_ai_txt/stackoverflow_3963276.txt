Word 2010 VSTO development

I'm trying to create a Word 2010/2007 VSTO add-in and have run into a couple of questions: If I use the Backstage View and other 2010 features in the Ribbon, how will Word 2007 handle them? (i.e. do I need to do some kind of conditional checking for version? If so, how?) The whole Primary Interop thing. Does setting a reference to Word 14.0 and embedding the primary interops allow me to deploy to Word 2007 without new primary interops? Thanks in advance!
