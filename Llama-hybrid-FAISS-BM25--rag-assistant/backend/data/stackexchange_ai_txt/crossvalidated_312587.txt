Your density is missing a constraint on the support, namely $0 This however does not change the constant $a$ that turns $a\bar{Y}$ into an unbiased estimator: $$\dfrac{6}{\theta^3}\int_0^\theta y^2(\theta-y)\text{d}y = \dfrac{6}{\theta^3}\dfrac{\theta^4}{3}- \dfrac{\theta^4}{4} = \dfrac{6}{\theta^3}\dfrac{\theta^4}{12}=\dfrac{\theta}{2}$$ Which implies that$$\mathbb{E}_\theta[2\bar{Y}_n] = \theta$$is unbiased. For consistency, you do not need to prove that bias and variance to be zero (bias is indeed zero since the estimator is unbiased) but that $2\bar{Y}_n$ converges almost surely to $theta$. Given that $\bar{Y}_n$ is an average, you should look at the Law of Large Numbers for an argument. Note that computing the variance of $Y$ is not particularly complicated: $$\dfrac{6}{\theta^3}\int_0^\theta y^3(\theta-y)\text{d}y = \dfrac{6}{\theta^3}\dfrac{\theta^5}{4}- \dfrac{\theta^5}{5} = \dfrac{6}{\theta^3}\dfrac{\theta^5}{20}=\dfrac{3\theta^2}{10}$$You should be able to deduce the variance of $\bar{Y}_n$ on your own from there. A final comment is that, given that the support of the distribution depends on $\theta$, an estimator based on $Y_{(n)}=\max_{1\le i\le n} Y_i$ should be more efficient that $\bar{Y}_n$.
