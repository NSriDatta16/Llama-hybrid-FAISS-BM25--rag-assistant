Outside of using a transactional engine (InnoDB if you're using MySQL , or just use PostgreSQL , etc.) and wrapping the relevant atomic activities there's not a great deal you can do. As @Seb says, you can create a transactional log and you could even use a master/slave database setup, but this won't really add much in terms of coverage.
