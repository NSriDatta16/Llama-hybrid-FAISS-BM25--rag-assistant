With the SSH key pair using ssh-agent, but is there any other way? The problem is that you need to get the public key out to the remote host, which can be done in a simple string but still requires a login. So the initial setup of the key pairs with passphrase and the adding of the key to the remote host requires many passwords to be entered. After the initial setup it all works well. ideas?
