I just went through the same process, and didn't have many problems using eclipse. Once you get past the initial learning curve of setting things up, it's really not that bad :) Here's some of the sources I used to learn how to build JAX-WS services: http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/?wp405739&JAXWS.html#wp72279 JAX-WS/Java EE tutorial from Oracle, updated June 2010 https://metro.dev.java.net/getting-started/basic.html#Building_Server This gives some useful code snippets whether you are starting from Java or from a WSDL file. http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jstl0211.html Information on JSP tags and the JSTL standard libraries. (these are super useful when writing the JSP pages your user will end up seeing) http://www.stardeveloper.com/articles/display.html?article=2001081601&page=1 Information on JSP scripting tags and custom tags in general. http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javaserverpages/code_convention/ JSP code conventions/best practices
