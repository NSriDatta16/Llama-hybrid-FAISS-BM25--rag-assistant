NSXMLDocument, nodesForXPath with namespaces

I want to get a set of elements from a xml-file, but as soon the the elements involve namespaces, it fails. This is a fragment of the xml file: My Finds Pocket Query Geocache file generated by Groundspeak Groundspeak contact@groundspeak.com 2010-09-15T16:18:55.9846906Z cache, geocache, groundspeak 2010-01-11T08:00:00Z GC22W1T Kadonneet ja karanneet by ooti, Traditional Cache (1.5/2) http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=4af28fe9-401b-44df-b058-5fd5399fc083 Kadonneet ja karanneet Geocache Found Geocache|Traditional Cache Kadonneet ja karanneet ooti ooti Traditional Cache Small 1.5 2 Finland I want to get all the grounspeak:cache elements, but neither //groundspeak:cache nor //cache seems to return anything. NSArray *caches = [self.xml nodesForXPath:@"//cache" error:&error]; Any clue? Edit: Are there any cocoa-based software out there, where I can load my xml and test different xpaths? I'm quite new to objective-c and cocoa, so it would be nice to check that it is really my xpath that is wrong..
