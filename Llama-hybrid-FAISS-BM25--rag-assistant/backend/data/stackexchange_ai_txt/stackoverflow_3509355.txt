Parallelize the content retrieval from database, search and store as HTML

I have a database table having HTML content stored as binary serialized blob. I need to retrieve content one by one, look for certain keywords in the content (and report the matches found) and also save the content to the disk as HTML files. Can I parallize this using Parallel.ForEach? Is this a good Idea or there is a better one. Thanks in advance for help, Ashish
