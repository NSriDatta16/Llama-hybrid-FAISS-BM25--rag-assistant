The distinction is that you fitted a model that pools the SDs together into one common value. To show more precisely, first let's get some stats: > ( n ( s Note that the sample SDs are quite different from one another, which is part of the reason for your confusion. Now, the standard errors you calculated are based on the individual SDs: > s / sqrt(n) a b c 2.384709 17.878830 12.632462 But the ones that lsmeans outputs are based on one SD (the pooled SD, which is obtained from a weighted average of the variances): > ( s.p s.p / sqrt(n) a b c 34.77988 15.55403 34.77988 The latter results match those from the lsmeans output. Note that the largest s corresponds to the largest n , giving it the most weight in calculating s.p . This makes the pooled SD quite a bit larger than the sample SDs for conditions "a" and "c".
