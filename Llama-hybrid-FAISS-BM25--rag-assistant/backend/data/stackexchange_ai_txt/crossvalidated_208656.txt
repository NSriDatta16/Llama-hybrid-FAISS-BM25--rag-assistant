Intuition behind the characteristic equation of an AR or MA process

Ok, so I've just started learning Time Series Analysis. We can write an $MA(q)$ process as $Y_t = \theta(L) \varepsilon_t$ and an $AR(p)$ process as $\varepsilon_t = \phi(L) Y_t$ in terms of the lag operator. Then, with no explanation (from my textbook), we suddenly replace $L$ with $z$ to get $\theta(z)$ or $\phi(z)$ , which can "be thought of as a generating function for the coefficients" - which I don't really understand. We then set the characteristic polynomial equal to zero, and solve for the roots. And by some magic, the complex roots of this "characteristic equation" tell us whether or not the process is stationary? I've searched around, but I can't find an explanation or a derivation for this result. Do I need to brush up on differential equations in order to understand this on an intuitive level? Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks!
