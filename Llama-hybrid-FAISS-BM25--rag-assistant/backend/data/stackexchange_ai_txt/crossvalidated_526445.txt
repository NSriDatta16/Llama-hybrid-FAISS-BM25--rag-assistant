I would say some people would have preferred group A products if they were as cheap as group B is a perfectly legit effect of discount on sales. You may also say "some people would have preferred products from your competitor if they were as cheap as group $B$ ". There may be bias in your estimated effect on sales because, by coincidence, you might have chosen products in group $A$ that are more susceptible to discounts than products in group $B$ or vice versa. You should check the effect on sales on every single product, then compute the variance $\sigma_{A, B}^2$ of the effect for both groups. The posterior standard deviation on your estimate on the effect of discount on sales is roughly $\Delta_{A, B} = \frac{\sigma_{A, B}}{\sqrt{N_{A, B}}}$ , where $N_{A, B}$ is the number of products in group $A$ or $B$ . You may consider doing a t-Test if you see some overlap, e.g., if $(\mu_A + 2\cdot\Delta_A) > (\mu_B - 2\cdot\Delta_B)$ , where $\mu_{A, B}$ is the effect on sales (however you measure it). You should not assume a linear relation between the discount and the effect on sales, as your equation suggests. Assume you offer 100% discount: probably almost everybody who sees your offer would buy it for no cost. If you can measure the amount of people who see a product in your e-commerce store and the amount of people who buy/don't buy, I would do a [logistic regression][2] for the conversion rate, i.e., $\frac{number~of~sales}{number~of~product~views}$ to measure the effect of discount. Calling the conversion rate $q$ , the model would look like $$q(d) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_0 + w_1\cdot d)}}$$ where $d$ is the amount of discount. The likelihood function you need to maximize w.r.t. the model parameters $w_0, w_1$ is $$\mathcal L = \prod_{n = 1}^N q^{y_n}(d_n; w_0, w_1) \cdot (1 - q(d_n; w_0, w_1))^{1 - y_n}$$ , where $n$ runs over all product views, $d_n$ is the amount of discount for the product of impression $n$ , and $y_n = 1$ if impression $n$ ended with a sale and 0 else. In the end you'd get a function for the conversion rate depending on the discount. These are my first ideas on this problem. You may as well estimate the uncertainty on the model parameters $w_0, w_1$ if you have only few data, e.g., with a Laplace approximation.
