Ok, tracked this one down after quite a lot of pain. It was working fine on one environment, but not another, so I fired up Process Monitor ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx ) and ran a package through the SQL Agent job, comparing which system entities were hit on each enviroment. On the failing environment, at the point of the bulk transfer operation, the package attempted to get the Oracle 11 client DLL, and then hung. I knew that this was installed, and, moreoever, the DLL path was a system environment setting. After further investigation it was revealed that the server had not been rebooted since the Oracle Client install and the SQL Server Agent process had not bee recycled. Yes, can you believe it, the old helpdesk fix "Can you reboot your computer?" worked. Sigh!
