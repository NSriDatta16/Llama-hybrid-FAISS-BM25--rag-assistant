Removing &NBSP; in Rails

I am trying to remove all &nbsp; 's in my model with the following method : def about_us_sans_spaces self.about_us = replace(self.about_us, "&nbsp;", " ") end Except! it turns out 'replace' isn't a method in rails. How would you remove the &nbsp; 's? Mind you, I have already tried sanitized, simple_format. My view looks like this right now: = truncate(sanitize(simple_format(organization.about_us_sans_spaces), :tags => ''), 125).titleize
