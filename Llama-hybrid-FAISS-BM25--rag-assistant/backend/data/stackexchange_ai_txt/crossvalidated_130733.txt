It could be an issue. Thinking of the design matrix, $X$ the last column could be expressed as $1 - $ sum of other columns. That means $X^TX$ would not be invertible. Two options that might help, the first of which is probably going to be easier: Drop a column. As its value is perfectly defined by the remaining data, you lose no information. Use (Bayesian equivalent of) lasso regression, which will effectively choose one to drop for you. Low entries in the correlogram are unlikely to signify we can relax. The proportions must be negatively related in some sense as for one to get larger, another must get smaller.
