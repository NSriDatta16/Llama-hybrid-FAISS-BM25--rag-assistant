Multinomial Logistic Regression - Interaction Effect

In my study, participants saw a picture of a man or woman either with or without a cigarette. So I have a 2(Male, Female) x 2(Smoker, Non-smoker) experimental design. Coding: Male=1, Female=2, Smoker=1 and Non-Smoker=2 The question is whether participants would choose to (1) Date, (2) Not Date or (3) Become Friends (with the person on the picture). I have put Gender and Smoking Status into the Co-Variate Box in SPSS and put the DV into the DV-Box with (2) Not Date as a reference category. I used a cutomized model, that is, I put Gender, Smoking Status and Gender*Smoking Status into the model by using the forced-entry method. After analyzing the data I found an interaction effect for "Date vs. No Date": b= -1.56, Exp(B)= .340, p= .034. Questions: Based on these coefficients, would I be able to interpret the interaction effect? (I don't know how to do this). Or would I need to do follow-ups to see if there are simple main effects?
