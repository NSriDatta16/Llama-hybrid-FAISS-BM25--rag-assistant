What is a healthy acceptance rate for Metropolis-Hastings algorithm?

I'm using Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to evaluate the posterior distribution of the parameters of a hierarchial Bayesian model. What is considered a healthy acceptance rate for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm? Should the hyperparameters and parameters have the same acceptance rate? Or should they be different? I particularly want to know whether there should be a difference in the acceptance rates of parameters and hyperparameters.
