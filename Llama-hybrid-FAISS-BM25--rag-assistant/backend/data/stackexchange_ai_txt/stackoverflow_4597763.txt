Persisting Cookies In An iOS Application?

I am going to use NSHTTPCookieStorage in an iOS App to manage cookies that are retrieved from a url, and I understand that it will manage cookies during your application's runtime. However, I was wondering if it's possible to persist cookies after the application has closed. And then read those cookies again when the app is opened again. Does NSHTTPCookieStorage persist cookies between app uses? Or just during the applications runtime? Do I need to use CoreData to persist these cookies?`
