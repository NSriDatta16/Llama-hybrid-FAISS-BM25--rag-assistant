After many hours troubleshooting this stuff... Here are some quick highlights that helped us from the X-UA-Compatible docs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325(VS.85).aspx#ctl00_contentContainer_ctl16 Using The Standard User Agent modes (the non-emulate ones) ignore directives in your page and render based on the standards supported by that version of IE (e.g., IE=8 will better obey table border spacing and some pseudo selectors than IE=7 ). Whereas, the Emulate modes tell IE to follow any directives in your page, rendering standards mode based the version you choose and quirks mode based on IE=5 Possible values for the content attribute are: content="IE=5" content="IE=7" content="IE=EmulateIE7" content="IE=8" content="IE=EmulateIE8" content="IE=9" content="IE=EmulateIE9" content="IE=edge"
