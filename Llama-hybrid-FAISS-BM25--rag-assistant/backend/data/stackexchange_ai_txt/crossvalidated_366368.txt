I do not think your approach is a waste of time, with the following caveats: You have the distribution of $X$ and the joint distribution of $Y | X$. If you just have the marginal distribution of $X$ and $Y$ then you don't know how they relate to one another. e.g. they both could be normal distributions but unless you state their correlation, you don't have any kind of useful information. You make multiple independent Monte Carlo samples and construct many regression lines to get a predictive distribution. If you met these two conditions then what you're doing is essentially like a bootstrapping or Bayesian approach. You can construct a confidence interval around a mean regression line and then make appropriate probabilistic statements about predictions. If you're making decisions and have a decision cost function, you can feed these multiple regression lines into your cost function.
