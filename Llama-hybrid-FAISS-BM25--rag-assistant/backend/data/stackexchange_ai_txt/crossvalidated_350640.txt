Can you show us your particular dataset? If you are interested in inferring things about $\mu$, the parameter that describes the average change, then you might need to assume more than stationarity, maybe some assumptions about how autocorrelated the series is. In general, you don't want the autocorrelation to not die out. If it's a financial time series, it probably won't be a problem. Also, estimates of $\mu$ are less noisy than z-scores. Here are a couple technical results: If a time series is stationary with mean and covariance functions $\mu(\cdot)$ and $\gamma(\cdot)$, then $\text{Var}(\bar{X}_n) \to 0$ if $\gamma(h) \to 0$ as $h \to \infty$. If a time series is stationary with mean and covariance functions $\mu(\cdot)$ and $\gamma(\cdot)$ then $n E[(\bar{X}_n - \mu)^2] \to \sum_{h=-\infty}^{\infty} \gamma(h)$ if $\sum_{h=-\infty}^{\infty}|\gamma(h)| You probably want the second result. You can see that $$ \text{Var}\left[\sqrt{n}(\bar{X} - \mu)\sigma^{-1}\right] = n\sigma^{-2}E[(\bar{X}_n - \mu)^2] \to \sigma^{-2}\sum_{h=-\infty}^{\infty} \gamma(h) If you want to assume further that, in addition to being stationary, your time series is Gaussian, then $$ \sqrt{n}(\bar{X} - \mu)\sigma^{-1} \sim \text{Normal}\left(0,\sum_{|h|
