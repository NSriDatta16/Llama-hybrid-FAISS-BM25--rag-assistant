Unknown iphone code

I am looking at a project which was provided me by my organization, for study. The problem is that in this project I found some code which I never saw before. Please tell me why the following code is written. -(void)notifications { [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver: self selector: @selector(hideViews) name: @"Hide" object:nil]; } This problem arose because this project has only some code for designing. Sorry if this is a silly question...
