The standard time series "pitfall" is the dreaded unit root or, more generally, non-stationary processes. For example, suppose price and volume are given by: $ln(price) = a + b*t +\epsilon_1 $ $ln(volume) = c + d*t +\epsilon_2 $ Running a regression will give you an exceptionally good fit (in terms of $R^2$ and t-values), but is fundamentally a worthless equation to have estimated. These are referred to as "spurious regressions." Econometrically, the standard approach is to first-difference your data until both are stationary prior to running any regressions. In addition to insuring that both processes are stationary, you may also have to worry that the two variables are cointegrated , which has its own associated procedures. Read Johansen (1988) for everything you ever wanted to know about dealing with cointegration, and more.
