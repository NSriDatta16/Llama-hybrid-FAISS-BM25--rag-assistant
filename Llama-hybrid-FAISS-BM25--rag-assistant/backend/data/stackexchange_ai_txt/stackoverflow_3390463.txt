Not sure how you're embedding the Ruby code, but you could easily have a background timer thread that evaluates raise YourTimeLimitExceededException, 'no more time' after a period of time. You'd also want to disable Thread.new and Thread.start (as well as java.lang.Thread.new) for the user code, or they could easily circumvent your timer.
