hey guys i am having trouble understanding this, i dont get when themap is referenced to the cities dict really. or the last line, what is the(cities, state) part? thanks. cities = { 'CA': 'San Francisco', 'MI': 'Detroit', 'FL': 'Jacksonville'} cities['NY'] = 'New York' cities['OR'] = 'Portland' def find_city(themap, state): if state in themap: return themap[state] else: return 'not found' #ok pay attention! cities['_find'] = find_city while True: print 'State? (ENTER to quit)' state = raw_input('> ') if not state: break #this line is the most important ever! study! city_found = cities['_find'] (cities, state) print city_found
