Forecast horizon should normally depend on the application. If the model is considered in a context where agents are looking 20 days ahead and making decisions based on a 20-day outlook, 20-day ahead forecasts is what is needed. If the model is analyzed without a particular application in mind, one could look at multiple forecast horizons and analyze all of them. Of course, that would be more work. What is sensible in your case also depends on the application. There is likely nothing wrong with using a 20-day horizon, but this horizon may or may not be relevant and interesting.
