Relationships between physical quantities (like pressure and temperature) often may be described using functions or equations, and sometimes the measurement error is small – this might be the case here as well. If so you could derive the type of relationship and the specific function from physics knowledge you could use statistical (including Bayesian) techniques to determine the values and uncertainties of the parameters. If the error is large the relationship between the variables will be less apparent and (compared to the physical equation behind the phenomenon) a more simple function could be fitted on the data. Linear regression is a widely used, simple method. You tagged your question “machine-learning”, so the relationship between your variables may be more complex, but you may not be able to derive it from physics. In this case you can choose from a wide spectrum of non-linear machine learning and statistical techniques. In any case I suggest you to plot your data using a scatterplot, think about the possible mechanisms between the variables. Although machine learning can be Bayesian, too, the best Bayesian approach may be fitting plausible models on the data.
