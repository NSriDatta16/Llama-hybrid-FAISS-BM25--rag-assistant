The simplest way would be to estimate the multinomial probability of an individual choosing each color and estimate confidence intervals. An easy way to do this in R would be with the MultinomialCI package. library(MultinomialCI) dat If the confidence intervals do not overlap, you have a significant difference at the given $\alpha$. If you have individual-level covariates that may influence the selected group, you could use a more complicated method, like a multinomial logistic regression.
