How about xml = lxml.etree.tostring(e, with_tail=False) ? from lxml.html import fragment_fromstring from lxml.etree import tostring frag = fragment_fromstring(' This stuff is really great!') em = frag.cssselect('em').pop(0) print tostring(em, with_tail=False) Looks like with_tail was added in v2.0; do you have an older version?
