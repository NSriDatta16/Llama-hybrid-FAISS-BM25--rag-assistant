I think heeen is on a good path with Win32::API, and I suspect that you'll need to roll your own user agent to manage the NTLM handshake with the IIS server. That's not all that bad, the interaction is well understood. This smells a little like something that Samba could help you with, too. Searching around, there's a lot of buzz about using Samba + !IIS to support integrated authentication, you just need the other direction.
