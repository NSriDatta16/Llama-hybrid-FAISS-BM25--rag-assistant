Using trigram language model to estimate probablilites

P(A | B) : probability of event A given event B occurred A second order Markov model is given as : Assume x0 = x-1=* in this definition where * is a special start symbol in the sentence. An example is then provided which I'm attempting to implement : (the dog barks STOP) = q(the|*, *)×q(dog|*, the)×q(barks|the, dog)×q(STOP|dog, barks) This is based on a nlp course , notes : http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/lm.pdf Is q(the|*, *) the probability of the given * , * ? I'm assuming that * , * can be any value, and so q(the|*, *) = 1/4 ? Same assumption based on q(dog|*, the) ? How to determine value for q(dog|*, the) ?
