Concise Lisp code to apply a list of functions all to the same argument(s) and get a list of the return values?

Suppose I have a single element, and I have a list of predicates (functions). I want to apply each of these predicates to the single element and get a corresponding list of return values. I know that map and friends can apply a single function to each a list of arguments, but is there any concise syntax to apply many functions to a single argument? Of course I can do (mapcar (lambda (pred) (funcall pred SINGLE-ELEMENT)) LIST-OF-PREDICATES) but it would be nice if there was a function that worked like: (test-predicates-against-element LIST-OF-PREDICATES SINGLE-ELEMENT) Obviously I can just defun it, but I wanted to know if there is an accepted method for doing this.
