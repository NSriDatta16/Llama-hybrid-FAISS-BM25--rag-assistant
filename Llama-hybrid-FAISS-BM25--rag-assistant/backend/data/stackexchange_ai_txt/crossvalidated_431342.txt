Distribution for simulating machine learning algorithm errors

I want to simulate machine learning algorithm, that solves binary classification problem. This algorithm should output not just $\{0, 1\}$ labels, but probability of class $1$ (that of course is in $[0; 1]$ range). The question is what distribution should I choose for simulating errors produced by this algorithm. As I understand it should be some one-sided bounded distribution, but I don't know which one.
