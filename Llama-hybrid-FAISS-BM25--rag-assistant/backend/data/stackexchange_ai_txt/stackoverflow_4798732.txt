Flex 3 : Easy Deep Linking Question

I'm having a problem with deeplinking on my Flex 3 site. I want people to be able to link to different parts of the site. I also want to be able to type a url into the browser bar and be taken to a particular part of my site. Also, I need the default to open to #view=2. I'm having problems setting the default #view=2. So, it's supposed to check the browser fragment to see whether its a valid section of the site. If it is then it should call parseUrl() and open that section of the site. So far, so good. The problem is how do I set the default to view=#2, if the loop doesn't find a valid view number? Here's my code: private function initBrowserManager(): void { browserManager = BrowserManager.getInstance(); browserManager.addEventListener(BrowserChangeEvent.BROWSER_URL_CHANGE, parseUrl); browserManager.init("","My Website"); if(browserManager.fragment != null){ for (var j:uint = 0; j I've tried to add this line: else{browserManager.setFragment("view="+ 2); parseUrl();} everywhere I could think of, but no luck so far. I know that the answer will be really simple. Any suggestions? Thank you. -Laxmidi
