The most elegant way to solve this type of issues is to use the Model View Presenter design pattern. Here the background code doesn't fiddle with the state of the controls directly, but alters the model, which then triggers the update of the UI. I the case of WinForms its really hard to implement a proper MVP pattern, but you could use data bindings to separate the state of your application from the actual controls. When you implement binding correctly, after your background code updates the data, it should be automagically displayed in the controls.
