Algorithms/problems to solve while learning a new language

At some point in our lives we're put in the situation to learn a new language (either by job requirements or just passion). Personally, I'm trying to learn Objective-C coming from a background of several years coding php. My problem is that I'm bored with your average starting programs (most of them coming from maths; eg: Fibonacci). What are your first algorithms and programs you write when learning a new language? I'm thinking we could make a list of interesting problems to be solved and that would make the learning curve at least more entertaining. Later edit : My question is about fun things (and also useful), but not like Code Kata or other very boring math stuff (I've done many of those already) Later edit [ 2 ] : I found this today and the problems there seem fun to do.
