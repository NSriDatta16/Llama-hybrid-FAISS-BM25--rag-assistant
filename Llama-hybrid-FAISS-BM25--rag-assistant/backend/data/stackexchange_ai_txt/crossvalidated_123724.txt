Number of principal components when preprocessing using PCA in caret package in R

I am using the caret package in R for training of binary SVM classifiers. For reduction of features I am preprocessing with PCA using the built in feature preProc=c("pca") when calling train() . Here are my questions: How does caret select principal components? Is there a fixed number of principal components that is selected? Are principal components selected by some amount of explained variance (e.g. 80%)? How can I set the number of principal components used for classification? (I understand that PCA should be part of the outer cross-validation to allow reliable prediction estimates.) Should PCA also be implemented in the inner cross-validation cycle (parameter estimation)? How does caret implement PCA in the cross-validation?
