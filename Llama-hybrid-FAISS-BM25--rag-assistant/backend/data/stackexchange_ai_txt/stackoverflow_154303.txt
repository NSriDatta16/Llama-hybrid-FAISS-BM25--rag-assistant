The "Gang of Four" book ( Design Patterns ) has a GUI-based text editor as it's main source of examples and is a worthwhile book to own. The general "pure text" editor probably uses ropes, which SGI's STL has an implementation of. Basically, they are a linked list of character buffers. That way, inserting/deleting characters involves changing smaller buffers and a few pointers, instead of storing the entire document in a single buffer and having to shift everything.
