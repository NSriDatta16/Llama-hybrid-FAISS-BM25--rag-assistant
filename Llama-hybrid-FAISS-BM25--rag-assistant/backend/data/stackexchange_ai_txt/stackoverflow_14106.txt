How would you go about evaluating a programmer?

A few weeks ago, I was assigned to evaluate all our programmers. I'm very uncomfortable with this since I was the one who taught everyone the shop's programming language (they all got out of college not knowing the language and as luck would have it, I'm very proficient with it.). On the evaluation, I was very biased on their performance (perfect scores). I'm glad that our programming shop doesn't require an average performance level but I heard horror stories of shops which do require an average level. My question are as follows: As a programmer, what evaluation questions would you like to see? As a manager, what evaluation questions would you like to see? As the evaluator, how can you prevent bias in your evaluation? I would love to remove the evaluation test. Is there any advantages to having an evaluation test? Any disadvantage?
