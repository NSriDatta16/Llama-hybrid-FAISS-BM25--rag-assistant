The flagged answer is wrong. There's no 'access' going on is this code at all. The real answer should be no difference in this case unless the vector implementation is exceedingly incompetent, except using an iterator will be slightly slower. Iterator for something that is stored in an array is quite a silly concept. It's just done that way because some other cases can't be accesed directly as an array, so to be more general they encourage iterator use for everything. Even though iterators are ridiculously cumbersome, and only make sense to use in a few special cases.
