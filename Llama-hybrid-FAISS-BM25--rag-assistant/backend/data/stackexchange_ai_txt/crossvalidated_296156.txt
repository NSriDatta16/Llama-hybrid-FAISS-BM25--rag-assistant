Removing seasonality from multiple time series

I'm building a model involving a few times series, let's call them A and B. I removed seasonality from A using a function with a linear trend, days of the week and statistically significant months. However, for the series B days of the week don't have any effect and different months are statistically significant. Is there any reason why using different seasonality functions would for different time series in the same model would be a bad idea? Intuitively it shouldn't be a problem, the end product are deseasonalised time series and we don't need to care how we got them - but I'm not sure.
