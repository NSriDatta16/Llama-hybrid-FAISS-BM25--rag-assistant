What Java REST framework to use with App Engine and Android for students?

I'm teaching a college course on mobile application development and would like to introduce my students to a REST framework for use with App Engine, to help them with data storage for the Android apps they're building. Could anyone recommend a Java REST framework for App Engine that meets the following criteria: Must have: Easy learning curve Well-documented, with clear tutorials and sample programs Clean abstractions Free as in beer Works well with Eclipse Nice to have: Android client Free as in speech Not important: Able to support large query volumes Highly customizable From my web searching, Restlet looks best. Is there any other framework I should consider?
