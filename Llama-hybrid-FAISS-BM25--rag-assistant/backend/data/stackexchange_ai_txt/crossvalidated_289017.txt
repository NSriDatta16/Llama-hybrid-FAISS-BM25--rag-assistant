Overlapping data and QQ plot

Problem Have a time series of data and want to look at changes over long periods so want to use overlapping changes, then want to compare these overlapping changes to overlapping changes from a normal distribution in a QQ plot. Question so far I have had to resort to creating overlapping data via Monte Carlo from a normal distribution to use as the comparison. Is there a more deterministic/better way to do this? Example of overlapping changes - green cel is change made up of difference from two yellow cells. It is overlapping as there is one calculated for each day.
