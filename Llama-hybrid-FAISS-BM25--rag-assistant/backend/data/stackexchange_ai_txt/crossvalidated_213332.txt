If I understand your question correctly, notice that while the vibration has bounded error, it still fluctuates, something like $\cos(N\omega)$, in a similar fashion to a random walk. In particular, $\cos(\phi+\omega n)$ will tend to stick near $\pm 1$, due to the weird properties of $\cos(U)$ where $U$ is uniformly random and hence be similar to a standard random walk. These fluctuations will cause the increase of error from $1/N$ to $1/\sqrt{N}$. Let $X_n=\cos(\phi+\omega n)$. Then you're looking at $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N{X_n}$. Now I'm just computing in an adhoc way the variance which for each term would be $E[X_n^2]-E[X_n]^2=E[X_n^2]=\cos^2(\phi+n\omega)\approx 1$. You can make these arguments rigorous by treating $X_i$ as a random variable $X_i=\cos(U_i)$ where $U_i$ is uniform random on $[0,\pi]$. Thus the average variance of the error contribution would be something like: $\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{k=1}^N \mbox{Var}(X_k)=\frac{1}{N},$ which will look like an error of $N^{-1/2}$.
