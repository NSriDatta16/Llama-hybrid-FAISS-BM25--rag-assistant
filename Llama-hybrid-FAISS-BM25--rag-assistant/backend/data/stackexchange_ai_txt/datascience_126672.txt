Is there a way to check if a time-series is seasonal without manual inspection of its decomposition?

While using various models to generate a forecast of a time-series it is needed to know if a time-series is seasonal or not. I have searched about this topic but could only find people mentioning visual inspection of the seasonal decomposition of a time series to determine if the series is seasonal or not, but that becomes non viable when trying to generate forecasts for a large amount of items. Is there a way to find out if a time series is seasonal? Examples of when its needed to know if a time series is seasonal or not: # Auto Regression model = statsmodels.tsa.ar_model.AutoReg(demands, lags=3, seasonal=???) fittedModel = model.fit() # Holt-Winters model = sm.tsa.ExponentialSmoothing(demands, trend='mul', seasonal='mul', seasonal_periods=???) fittedModel = model.fit() ```
