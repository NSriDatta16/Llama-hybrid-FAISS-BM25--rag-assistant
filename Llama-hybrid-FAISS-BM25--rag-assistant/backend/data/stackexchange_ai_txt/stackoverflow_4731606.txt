At the highest level a URI reference (hereinafter simply "URI") in string form has the syntax [scheme:]scheme-specific-part[#fragment] If you are interested to know the complete set of rules, read RFC-2396 I doubt whether you need to know all the syntaxes. I have never read the entire RFC and still I am using URI in development and day to day use. So, you better post the URI you are having problem with. Then, people here can point out the specific problem.
