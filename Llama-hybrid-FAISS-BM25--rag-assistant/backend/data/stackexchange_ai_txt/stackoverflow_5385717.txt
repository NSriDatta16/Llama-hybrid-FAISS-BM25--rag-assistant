I'm not sure that this would be possible using different activities, perhaps if you're looking to use fragments (which are similar to activites) you could combine several into a single app using some sort of tab interface. However, my question would be why you would want to combine several activities into a single interface? As for making a single activity using a tabbed view, I'd start with checking out the TabHost class for the layout, and use a TabWidget object for the content portion inside each tab. If you're looking for some example code to get you started, Google's tutorial is a great place to start.
