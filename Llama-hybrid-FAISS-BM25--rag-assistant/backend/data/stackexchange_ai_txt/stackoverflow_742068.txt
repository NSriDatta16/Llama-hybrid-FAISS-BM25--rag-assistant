When Apple talks about "Memory", what do they mean?

For my understanding there are always two types of memory: the working storage the "disk space" So when you have a 16 GB iPhone, does it have 16 GB of working storage? or 16 GB of "disk space"? Which "Memory" is Apple talking about in his Docs, when it comes to performance and memory management? It looks like the working storage, but I am not sure. Actually I thought the iPhone is a huge brick of working storage, since all that stuff is just a solid block of chip memory (no hard drive).
