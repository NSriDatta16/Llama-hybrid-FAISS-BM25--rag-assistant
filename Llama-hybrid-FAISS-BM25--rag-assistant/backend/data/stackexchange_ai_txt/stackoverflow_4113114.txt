How do I read a big SQL query string from a file?

I'm writing a database project on the iPhone and I'd like to store some big SQL queries in a separate, project-included file. Then, I'd like to read this query into an NSString * (or, well, const char * is also ok) reference, and then perform it with an sqlite3. I'm a newbie to iPhone developing, and I have never worked with files, neither I know any details of their storage. Could you please give me a hint on: The appropriate file format to store the strings. How do I store it into the iPhone; How do I read from it. Thanks a lot!
