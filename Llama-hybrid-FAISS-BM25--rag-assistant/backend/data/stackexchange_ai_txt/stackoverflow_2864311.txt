I had this problem as well. The first thing I tried was to re-activate the main window after creating and showing the splash screen. This returned the activation to the main window and worked but it didn't seem very elegant. A better solution is to not set WindowState on the splash screen to maximize, instead manually maximize the splash screen to cover the entire screen using interop and Windows Forms as described here: http://www.inveigledsoftware.com/2009/07/maximizing-a-wpf-window-with-windowstatenone/
