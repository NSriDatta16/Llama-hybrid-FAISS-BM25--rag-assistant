I've used Gubed with Quanta+ as a stepping debugger with PHP, don't know if you can get that to work with Netbeans but I thought it was more hassle that it was worth. I found that I could for(i=0;i Xdebug is a very useful PHP extension which features a remote debugger with support for some editors, though Neatbeans isn't listed. I've not used the remote debugging element of Xdebug (see above) but the profiling, code coverage and - in particular - improved browser error messages I find helpful. Generally with Symfony I find I can get most of what I need from stack traces or by dropping items into the logger and picking them up with either the debug toolbar or firesymfony .
