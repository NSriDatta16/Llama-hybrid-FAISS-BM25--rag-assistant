How to force a TD to be a certain height with CSS?

Although some questions similar to this one have been asked before, this one is a little different. I have a table that looks a little something like this: This will overlay the second image on the first one. However, the td insists on being 200px tall even though there is only 100px of content . Setting the td 's height does nothing, which seems consistent with the answers to the other questions. However, I do not have the option of embedding the contents in a DIV and setting the height to 100px because the td will still insist on being 200px tall. How can I tell the td to just be 100px tall? Edit: Oh, and using absolute positioning is out of the question too because a lot of DOM manipulation goes on in the page and stuff gets moved around - whereas the absolutely positioned stuff does not. Edit: jsFiddle example can be found here .
