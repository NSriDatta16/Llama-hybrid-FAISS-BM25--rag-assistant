One important use of PCA is in analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data. To measure an EEG, dozens of electrodes are attached to your scalp and measure electric currents in your brain, either at rest or while you perform some experimental task. Of course, the measurements at neighboring electrodes are heavily correlated, because they are generated by activity at a specific region in the brain, which then creates electric currents that will be picked up by all electrodes in the vicinity. It's not easy to learn about what happens deep in your brain if all you have is measurements from your scalp, but for some reason, few people are fine with having deep electrodes driven into their brain. One thus reduces the dimensionality of the problem using PCA, which in this particular application also has a temporal component. You are completely right that it is hard to actually interpret the principal components. However, over the decades a body of research has developed that lets us expect particular principal components loading on particular electrodes, with peaks at particular points in time, e.g., after being presented with a specific stimulus. For instance, a long time ago I looked at the P300 , an event-related potential that loads over the parietal lobe (there's your PCA) about 300 ms after presentation of a stimulus that requires some kind of decision. In this particular analysis, the experiment was about whether spider phobics and non-phobics reacted differently to drawings that could be interpreted as spiders. The (unconscious) decision whether a particular drawing "was" a spider elicited a P300, and that indeed differed between phobics and nonphobics. Using a PCA and analyzing the parietal principal component - instead of, e.g., a single specific electrode = allows reducing the noise in such a setting, by essentially averaging the signal from multiple electrodes.
