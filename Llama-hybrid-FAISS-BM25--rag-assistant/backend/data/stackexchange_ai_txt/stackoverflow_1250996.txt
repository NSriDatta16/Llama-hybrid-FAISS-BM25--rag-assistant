Generally if you're creating and destroying thousands of objects a second you should at least use an object pool. You could use a custom allocator which purely allocates objects of a specific size. Override new and pre allocate a heap specifically for your objects. Using a bit field and an array its relatively simple. Basically a custom heap is more memory efficient if the objects are small (the heap overhead is quite high relative to small objects size); Its faster; It prevents heap fragmentation; And its easier to debug.
