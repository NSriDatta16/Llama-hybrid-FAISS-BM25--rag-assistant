Confidence in cross validation

A paper I'm reading reports classification accuracy, calculated using 5-fold cross validation. Each accuracy number is reported together with 95% confidence given inside the parenthesis. For instance: 69.92 (0.545). I understand accuracy is averaged over 5 tests data sets, but what is 95% confidence and how it is calculated?
