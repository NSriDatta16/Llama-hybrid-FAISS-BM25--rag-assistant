Real life examples of AR and MA PROCESSES

As someone who has just started learning ABC of timeseries can some explain me with real - life examples of what AR (autoregressive) and MA (moving-average) MODELS helps in real life. where AR with order of p follows : $$X_t=\mu + \alpha_1\left(X_{t-1}-\mu\right) + \alpha_2\left(X_{t-2}-\mu\right)+ \dots + \alpha_p\left(X_{t-p}-\mu\right) + e_t$$ where MA with order of q follows : $$X_t=\mu + e_t + \beta_1e_{t-1} + \dots + \beta_qe_{t-q}$$
