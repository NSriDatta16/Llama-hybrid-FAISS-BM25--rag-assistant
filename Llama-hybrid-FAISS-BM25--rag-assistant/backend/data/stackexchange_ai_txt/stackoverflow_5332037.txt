I wrote a quick script to test this. import random def hash(key): hashKey = 0 hashKey += 2047 * key[0] hashKey += 8191 * key[1] hashKey += 32767 * key[2] hashKey += 131071 * key[3] return hashKey seen = set() collisions = 0 for i in range(0,10000000): x = hash([random.randint(0,1000000), random.randint(0,10000), random.randint(0,1000), random.randint(0,1000)]) if x in seen: collisions += 1 else: seen.add(x) print collisions When I ran it, it told me I got 23735 collisions. I also tried it on one million elements, and I got 247 collisions. Both numbers are averages over 4 runs.
