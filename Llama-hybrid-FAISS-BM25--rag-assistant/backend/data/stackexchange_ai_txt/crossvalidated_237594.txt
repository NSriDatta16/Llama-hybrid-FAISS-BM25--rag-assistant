Maybe is the range of the explanatory variables: If you have temperatures (according to other users' example) vs probability of having the disease, the probability at the maximum measured temperature is 60%. Logistic regression model doesn't know you are talking about temperature (is just another continuous variable). So the model could be saying that "The probability of having the disease is 95% when the temperature is 95Â°C (really high)". The model doesn't know that this temperature would have killed a human way before has been reached. So, in conclusion: Having (0.0,0.6) is not an incorrect output, it reflects the reality (but with flaws)
