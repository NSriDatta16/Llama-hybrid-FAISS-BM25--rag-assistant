As far as additional plugins are concerned, we install TocMacro, XmlRpcPlugin, WysiwygPlugin and TracRedirect. In particular, the WYSIWYG plugin is really good for encouraging less technical staff to maintain their own documents in the wiki - you can even C&P from MS Word whilst retaining formatting, which helps. Take a look at the custom ticket workflow stuff that Trac gives you, if your own workflow isn't well represented by Trac's defaults. This has allowed us to add code review and integration testing steps to the workflow. I'd recommend making your Trac server authenticate against some central authentication framework. We run an LDAP tree with auth credentials in it, and this is used by all our internal systems - including trac, svn, samba, openvpn etc.
