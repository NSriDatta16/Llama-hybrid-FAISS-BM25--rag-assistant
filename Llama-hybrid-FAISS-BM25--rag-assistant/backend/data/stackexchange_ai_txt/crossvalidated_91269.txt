Deriving the optimal value for the intercept term in SVM

I was reading andrew ng's machine learning lecture notes on SVM. I came across the following equation (finding the optimal value for the intercept term $b$ in the SVM problem): However, I have no idea how the intercept term $b$ is derived by solving the primal problem ? I believe the primal's Lagrangian is: $$\min_{w,b} \max_{\alpha} \mathcal{L}(w,b,\alpha) = \min_{w,b} \max_{\alpha} \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 - \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i [y_i (w^T x_i + b) - 1]$$ But how do I solve for $b$ ? Any help will be great. Thank you very much.
