This is not a direct answer to your question ('Which type of averaging to choose'), but rather a recommendation to avoid calculating averages at all: Your scenario seems to look like a case for hierarchical/ multilevel models (MLM), as data are perfectly nested. You have three levels of random effects: pixels (Level 1) nested in cells (L2), nested in fields (L3), nested in wells (L4). Treatments should be treated as fixed effects. You are only interested in the effect of treatment; the MLM method takes care of the different variances of each level and gives you also an estimate of how much variance is explained by which level. So you do not 'lose' any variance by treating an averaged value as 'the measurement', but you estimate the model on the level of raw data. This method, however, calls for a sufficient number of groups for each random effect (i.e., enough pixels, enough cells, enough fields, enough wells). As you are not interested in cross level interactions, general recommendations say something like 10 to 30 units minimum (of course, depending on the specific scenario, etc.; see, e.g., here ).
