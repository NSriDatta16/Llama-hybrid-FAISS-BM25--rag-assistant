I would think that the only information that is attainable from null on YearGarageBuilt is what is the effect of having a garage or not on estate value. But it seems, you're asking for what information you should extract from it, but i have a feeling that what you're really looking for is a way to reformat your dataset ( feature engineer something more genuine and less likely to get 'nan' values ), i guess you could come up with a feature that could combine some of the features you presented if that's your real motive for this post. Note : you could encode that feature in a way that nan would be 0, the oldest possible year would take 1, next 2 etc.. in this case 0 would mean no garage, 1 would mean very very old garage etc.. which should give you a positive slope in terms of YearGarageBuilt/Estate value (the newer the garage the higher the price)if my estate logic is correct.
