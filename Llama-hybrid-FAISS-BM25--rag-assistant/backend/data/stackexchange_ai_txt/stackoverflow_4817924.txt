How to clone a full fledged MSCRM 4.0 OnPremise installation?

Is there a clean way to duplicate/clone/copy a full fledged MSCRM 4.0 machine and bring back the copy with new host name? Lets assume my crm installation runs on a host called crm01. Lets assume furthermore that this machine is a virtual machine. The goal is now to bring back a renamed clone of that machine to live, for instance renamed to crm02. After cloning that virtual machine, what else do I need to do? I know that I have to pay attention to SQLServer, Reporting Services, IIS and MSCRM itself, right?
