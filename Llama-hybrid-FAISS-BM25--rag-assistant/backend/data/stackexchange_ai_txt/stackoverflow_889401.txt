IIRC, the xtragrid requires that the datasource implement a databinding interface (ie IBindingList(T)) for it to auto-generate columns and the items should implement INotifyPropertyChanged. With that in mind: if you do create columns via the wizard at design time or in code at runtime, as long as you set the FieldName property of the columns, they will show the data from the datasource with a property of that name. Notes: I think it must be a property, auto or not, as I've found that it sometimes won't bind to public variables. The property must be assigned something (default or otherwise). There must be a parameterless constructor for the item.
