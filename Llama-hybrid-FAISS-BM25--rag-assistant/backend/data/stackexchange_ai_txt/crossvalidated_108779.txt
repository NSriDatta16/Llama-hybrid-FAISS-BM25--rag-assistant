Multivariate model in lme() with independent random effect, similar to MCMCglmm

I would like to specify a multivariate model with lme with a random effect for group which is independent across variables. I found this post , which explains that the model specified as: fit.multilevel is equivalent to (using MCMCglmm ): fit.w.null However the model I would really like has independent random effects for school across the variables: fit.w.null (the random effect is specified with idh() ). I cannot find a way to specify this in lme . Here is some code to generate example data and run the analysis: gr=rep(c("A","B","C"),each=100) grp.mean=rep(rnorm(3,5,1),each=100) var1=rnorm(300,rep(rnorm(3,5,1),each=100),1) var2=0.8*var1+3*rnorm(300,rep(rnorm(3,5,1),each=100),2) dat.mcmc=data.frame(var1=var1,var2=var2,group=gr) dat.lme=data.frame(y=c(var1,var2),var=rep(c("1","2"),each=length(gr)), group=rep(gr,2),id=rep(1:length(gr),2)) dat.lme$v=as.integer(dat.lme$var) Currently this is the best I can do: fit.multilevel This is (I believe) equivalent to: fit.w.null However, I would like an lme command equivalent to: fit.w.null Any help you can give me will be much appreciated.
