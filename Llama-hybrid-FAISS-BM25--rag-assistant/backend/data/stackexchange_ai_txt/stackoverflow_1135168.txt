Organizing Clojure Code

I have a program that draws shapes on an image. I have a separate namespace for each shape, and they are in separate files. com/name/box.clj --> has com.name.box namespace. com/name/triangle.clj --> has com.name.triangle namespace. They all share a common function called generate that draws them on screen, so if I use use , function names clash. For now, I load them with load-file . Is there a better way of doing this? Looking through the Clojure API, it seems there are multiple ways of including files. Which one is a better option for a project with lots of files?
