This is precisely what an ANOVA-type analysis tells you: whether within-group (for one employee, in this case) variation is greater than variation across groups/among employees. A one-way ANOVA is a possibility if the equal variance assumption among groups is satisfied; it's non-parametric equivalent eg Kruskal-Wallis is an option otherwise. As you describe the problem, there is no particular advantage to using monthly averages vs. raw scores, since those scores are presumably independent surveys, and using all scores increases your power. But you also seem to be interested in potential confounding factors: yet, based on your description, there does not appear to be data to attribute any of that (except month ), unless you had data on the same customers evaluating several employees, a covariate of a customer's state of mind, or data on the type of product, etc . So your main assumption is that all other factors are random and unlikely to affect employee scores in any directional manner, and, with the limited information you provide, it seems somewhat justified (eg it is unlikely the same employee gets most of the customers who were having a bad day). Validity in this case is very much a construct of your question: when the test was designed, it was presumably justified that all these factors did not matter. Thus validity cannot be conclusively confirmed by observing or not observing a significant difference, e.g. no way of going back and checking if an employee's family stopped by every day to fill in their survey.
