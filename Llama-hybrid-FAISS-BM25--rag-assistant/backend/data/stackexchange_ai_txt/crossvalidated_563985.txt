Is redundancy/correlation between fixed and random effects a problem in mixed-effect models?

This might seem a stupid question but I can't find an clear answer. Say I am studying Species richness (outcome variable) in lakes. I have data from 20 lakes, over 4 years, and 3 values per year(early, mid, and late summer) . It is clear to me that LakeID should be a random factor , whatever the model I consider, to account for pseudoreplication as samples from the same lake are likely correlated. Now, I would like to see, amongst others, if the area of the lake (its size, termed Lake_area ) influences Species richness. I wanted to put it as a fixed effect . The model would be: lme(Richness ~ Lake_area + 1|LakeID) Is this correct to do so? On the one hand, I feel this is redundant, as one lake has only one size (one area, it does not change over the study period). And by including LakeID as a random effect, I somehow take into account variation on richness due to variation between lakes. On the other hand, (i)doing a model comprising only Lake_area as a fixed effect, no random factor would be surely wrong, as it would fail to consider that some samples are not independent. (ii) while Lake_area is somehow "nested" in Lake, Lake_area does not explain all the variation which is due to LakeID. Depth, morphometry, catchment, light exposition, etc are all potentially playing a role, that I do not necessarily capture with Lake_area. (iii) if I want to do a more complex model (which I do, I will have time in julian_days as a fixed effect and likely other variables), I have to include LakeID as a random factor in my final model. One solution I see to test the effect of lake_area is to take the average richness per lake as the outcome variable, and fit this model lm(Mean(Richness_per_lake)~Lake_area) But I lose power and I can't do that if I want to include other variables. Any help would be much appreciated.
