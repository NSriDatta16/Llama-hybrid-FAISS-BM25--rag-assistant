Learning algorithm vs Model in Machine Learning

In ML, I learned that we have a model and a learning algorithm. The learning algorithm is used to train the model with training data, does that sound correct? If the model is trained using linear regression, then is it called a "linear model"? In the same way, what are the models called which are trained using KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM?
