Gender Analysis is a pretty common trend in data science, especially when it comes to mental health. But breaking it down into categories can be difficult. I would break it down in to two columns, minimum. One that is designated as either 'Assigned Male at Birth (AMAB)' or 'Assigned Female at Birth (AFAM)'. This is necessary from a medical standpoint as some drugs and side-effects of drugs have different effects depending on the hormones already present in the body. There's also the male study bias, where people who go into scientific studies for drugs are only tested on non-pregnant men. Note that the column above may change later into a broader category, depending on how culture adapts to handle intersex individuals. The second column would have more ambiguous categories, as with the current culture shift people are exploring gender more. It would need to be open to new updates as our culture shifts. Some options for this would be M for man, W for woman, U for unknown, Q for queer, A for agender, F for fluid, ect. One-hot encoding later will help make this easier to 'study'. It would be handy for a person to know the pronouns of the person they're going to interact with, as well as to study the trends within our culture. So having a field for pronouns would be helpful for data analysis later on, as well.
