How to add vm option to jetty?

How it is available to specify vm option like -javaagent to start jetty or it is available only thru MAVEN_OPTS variable? I need it to enable load-time-weaving of aspects. This plugin seems like doesn't work. org.codehaus.mojo exec-maven-plugin 1.1 exec maven -javaagent:path\to\org\aspectj\aspectjweaver\1.6.10\aspectjweaver-1.6.10.jar May be it can be done by jetty-plugin, but its tag systemProperties said that will NOT override System properties that have been set on the command line or by the JVM What does it mean?
