My approach would be this: Determine if there is actually a problem with performance (isn't it alreade acceptable to my users?) Measure the performance at each teir (how long does it take the database to come up with data? how long does it take the service to respond with data? how much time does it take from the service to the client?) Based on the measurements I would then determine where to do my caching. Remember that, the closer to your data storage you do caching, the easier it is, but the closer to the client you do caching, the better the performance gain (usually). Also remember that caching should not be the first thing to do to improve performance. You should also look into other performance gains as well. Are the stored procedures slow? Is there a lot of overhead in the WCF messages? Is there some inefficient processing in the service? Do I realy need all that data in one message? HTH, Jonathan
