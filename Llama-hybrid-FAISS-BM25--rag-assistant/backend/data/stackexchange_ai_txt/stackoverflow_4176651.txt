This is a fairly common issue which all of us face while loading images from the sdcard. The solution as I found was to use inJustDecodeBounds first while loading the image using decodeFileDescriptor . That would not actually decode the image, but give the image size. Now I can scale it appropriately(using the options) so as to resize the image for the display area. Its needed because low memory on the phone can be easily taken over by your 5MP image. This I believe is the most elegant solution.
