Update : flex 4 solution So when I moved to the flex 4 and started compiling my mxml with adobe's open source mxmlc compiler, the solution below no longer worked because the alert doesn't lose focus when you're in the settings anymore. As far as I could tell I had to move to a less elegant solution where the user must click "OK" on the alert box every time they are done with the settings. Here is the new code: private function setup_smart_hide():void { // Call this function whenever you make the flex app visible (or add it // to a show_flex() function if you have such a thing set up) alert = Alert.show('Click "OK" to continue.', 'Thanks!', Alert.OK, null, function(e:CloseEvent):void { // calls the external javascript to hide the flex app hide_self(); }); } OLD: (flex 3) Got this working... private function setup_smart_hide():void { alert = Alert.show('Thanks'); alert.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_IN, function(event:FocusEvent):void { // javascript to hide the flex app ExternalInterface.call("SB.flex.hide"); }); alert.addEventListener(FocusEvent.FOCUS_OUT, function(event:FocusEvent):void { // javascript to show the flex app ExternalInterface.call("SB.flex.show"); }); alert.setFocus(); } Which is run first thing in the init() function... the only problem is (like Wesley said), the focusOut event occurs when the flex app itself loses focus as well.
