How can GCN model be applied to find next link based on similarity of values between its edges?

I want to apply GCN model to predict next link based on similarity of values between its neighbors nodes. For example I have total of 13 nodes and edges = [ (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 10), (9, 13), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 13) ].If each node has two features = torch.tensor([ [22, 45], [11, 34], [25, 35], [22, 34], [13, 40], [24, 45], [10, 36], [16, 42], [13, 39], [25, 44], [22, 50], [15, 49], [18, 37], ], dtype=torch.float32) I want to calculate the average of each node and compare it with its neighboring nodes i.e 1 should compare its average value only with node 1 and 2 as a result the next link should be created with node 2.In the next iteration node 2 should be considered as source node and compare its average value with its edges and predict the next link and so on. Can anyone please explain how I can achieve this.
