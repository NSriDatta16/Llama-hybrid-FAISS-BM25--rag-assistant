VGAM - "propodds" in R

I am trying to use "propodds" in the VGAM function in R, but am not sure if I am doing it right and don't really understand how to analyze the output I got so far to check to see if I am using it right. Any help on how to correctly use "propodds" or analyze the output would be appreciated. This is what I have so far: > fittest fittest Call: vglm(formula = rp ~ is.native + is.male + age2 + is.debt + oh + ms + cjs, family = propodds, data = dummydata2) Coefficients: (Intercept):1 (Intercept):2 (Intercept):3 (Intercept):4 (Intercept):5 is.native 2.827674173 -0.463602645 -0.474290665 -0.614877500 -2.514394420 -0.063546621 is.male age2 is.debt oh ms cjs 0.114052675 0.067835161 -0.058563607 -0.089420626 0.109135966 0.003937505 Degrees of Freedom: 52000 Total; 51988 Residual Residual deviance: 24702.04 Log-likelihood: -12351.02 > summary(fittest) Call: vglm(formula = rp ~ is.native + is.male + age2 + is.debt + oh + ms + cjs, family = propodds, data = dummydata2) Pearson residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max logit(P[Y>=2]) -5.1080 0.1300 0.2803 0.3016 0.3335 logit(P[Y>=3]) -0.6976 -0.5876 -0.5490 0.5937 14.7717 logit(P[Y>=4]) -13.1157 -0.5173 -0.4831 0.6080 3.0626 logit(P[Y>=5]) -4.0174 -0.4072 -0.3746 1.0167 1.2176 logit(P[Y>=6]) -0.6164 -0.5749 -0.1610 -0.1541 3.6060 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

I have a few factors that I want to control for since they may affect risk preferences [age2, is.debt, oh(owns home), ms (marital status), and cjs (current job status)]. Based on similar research the best way to analyze this is the cumulative logistic regression and they seemed to look at the proportional odds. The data came from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study which is representative of the US population over age 50. There are about 20,000 participants. I'm not sure if my model is formatted correctly. "rp" has 6 categories - a control group, low risk tolerance (rt), some rt, high rt, substantial rt and "ignore" which is answers of "don't know" or "NA". All other variables are dummy variables with only options for "0" or "1" besides "age2" which has 6 categories (under 50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90+). Are these dummy variables appropriate to use or should I just use the actual answers provided by the participants? I know the significant codes in the "summary" section tell me gender, age, and marital status are significant at the 1% significance level, but I don't understand any of the other results. Such as, what does it mean that all the intercepts are significant? Is the model as a whole significant? What is the dispersion parameter? What are the exponentiated coefficients?
