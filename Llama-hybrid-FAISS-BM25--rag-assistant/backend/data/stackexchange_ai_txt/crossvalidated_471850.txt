"Homogeneous treatment effect" refers to an assumption that the treatment effect is the same for all units, i.e., it does not depend on other factors. "Non-homogeneous treatment effect" allows that the treatment effect might differ across units. Certain methods of estimating the treatment effect are only compatible with a homogeneous treatment effect. If that assumption is incorrect, then the estimate will be biased. Other methods are compatible with either a homogeneous or non-homogeneous treatment effect and can be used in either scenario. If the treatment effect is indeed homogeneous, then your estimate will be more precise if you use a method for homogeneous treatment effects. In general, though, this is a bad assumption to make, so you should generally use a method that is compatible with both homogenous or non-homogeneous treatment effects, such as the random forest or linear-RE methods. (That is, it's worse to assume a homogeneous treatment effect and be wrong than it is to assume a non-homogeneous treatment effect and be wrong.) Even if the treatment effect is estimated as non-homogeneous, the att function estimates the average treatment effect , which is the average of the individual treatment effects (which are allowed to vary with the models compatible with non-homogeneous treatment effects). This is why the output looks the same regardless of which assumption you make: you are estimating the same single quantity but under one assumption or another.
