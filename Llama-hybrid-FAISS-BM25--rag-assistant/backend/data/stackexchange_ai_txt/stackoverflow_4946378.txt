From what I remember, dictionaries in Python have O(1) average access time, but lists will definitely be faster. If your indices are not very sparse, you can try something like this: reader = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')] # Replace it with your CSV reader. # First, fill a dictionary: text_dict = {} for index, text in reader: text_dict[index] = text # Then create a sufficiently large list: max_index = max(text_dict.iterkeys()) texts = [None] * (max_index + 1) # And fill it: for index, text in text_dict.iteritems(): texts[index] = text print texts # prints: [None, 'a', 'b'] print texts[1] # prints: a
