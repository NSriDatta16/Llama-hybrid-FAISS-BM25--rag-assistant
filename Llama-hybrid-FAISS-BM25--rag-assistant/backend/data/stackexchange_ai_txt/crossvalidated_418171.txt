What is the name for the average of the largest and the smallest values in a given data set?

What do you call a statistical mean that is calculated from upper and lower extremes in any given dataset? For example, if you have a set: { -2, 0 , 8, 9, 1, 50, -2, 6} The upper extreme of this set is 50 and lower extreme is -2 . So, average of the extremes would be (-2 + 50 / 2) = 48/2 = 24 Is there a term for this kind of statistical mean?
