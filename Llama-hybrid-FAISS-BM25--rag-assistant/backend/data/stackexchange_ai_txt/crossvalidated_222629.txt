You can assume $P(\theta) \propto C$, but then you are using a uniform prior over the domain for $\theta$. So, although your goal was to avoid dealing with a prior, you have actually used a uniform prior. Here are some issues with this approach: It is not invariant to the parameterization you chose for the model. Thus the development of the Jeffreys prior. The normalizing integral, $\int C * L(\theta|data) d\theta$, might not be finite. If using MCMC, this could be worse because it might not be obvious. Uniform priors are often extremely unrealistic and extremely informative. Thus, you went from an idea of avoiding the prior to using a prior that is extremely informative toward implausible values.
