Calculate the depth of a binary search tree?

I am having difficulty calculating the summation of depths [the sum of the individual depths for all children of the root] for a given BST. I have the total number of nodes for the tree, and I am trying to calculate the average depth for the tree, requiring I have this depth sum. Recursion and I don't get along very well.. I am finding this problem very difficult. I would like to see a recursive solution though, if possible. NOTE: I have created accessors Node.getLeft() and Node.getRight()
