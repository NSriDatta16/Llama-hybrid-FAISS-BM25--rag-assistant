How to use Lucene for getting tags for tagcloud?

I'm a Lucene newbie and I have it working where I can create an index from a column of a database table storing tags, and search this index for a particular tag and display the results and their scores. I'm looking at this as an alternative to a MySQL fulltext index which I've heard mixed comments about. But, what I want is to get from the most popular tags in the index along with their counts and then use this data to create a tagcloud. Does anyone know if and how Lucene can be queried to get the most popular tags in an index and their counts at all? Thanks Mr Morgan.
