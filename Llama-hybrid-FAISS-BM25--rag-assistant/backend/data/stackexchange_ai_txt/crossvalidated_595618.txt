Alright, I found an answer to my question. So in case anybody stumbles upon this with the same question: The Cousineau-Morey method can be used to calculate confidence intervals for repeated measures. A good introduction can be found here . In brief, we remove the subject average from each observation and add the overall average (all subjects) to disentangle the condition-specific variability from the subject-specific variability of our data. A very useful R-package for this is Rmisc . A tutorial on creating visualizations for within-subject data (using Rmisc) is presented here .
