Add an HTTP Header Manager to the Thread Group in your Test Plan . Add the name-value pair: Name: Accept-Encoding Value: gzip,deflate,sdch This will ensure that all JMeter requests use HTTP compression. To verify: Add this Listener to the Thread Group: View the Results Tree Run your test plan View the Sampler result tab for one of the webpages. Do you see these name-value pairs? Content-Encoding: gzip Vary: Accept-Encoding Transfer-Encoding: chunked If yes, then you've successfully setup gzip requests in JMeter. Congrats. Another way to verify is in the Summary Report stats: You'll see that the Avg Bytes values are the uncompressed sizes. That's OK. For whatever reason, that's how JMeter works. Pay attention to the KB/sec column. That will show an improvement of 6-10x with gzip enabled.
