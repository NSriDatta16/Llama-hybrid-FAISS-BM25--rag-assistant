If all you have is one variable (as you imply) I think some of the respondents above are being over critical of your approach. Certainly other methods that look at things like leverage are more statistically sound; however that implies you are doing modeling of some sort. If you just have for example scores on a test or age of senior citizens (plausible cases of your example) I think it is practical and reasonable to be suspicious of the outlier you bring up. You could look at the overall mean and the trimmed mean and see how much it changes, but that will be a function of your sample size and the deviation from the mean for your outliers. With egregious outliers like that, you would certainly want to look into te data generating process to figure out why that's the case. Is it a data entry or administrative fluke? If so and it is likely unrelated to actual true value (that is unobserved) it seems to me perfectly fine to trim. If it is a true value as far as you can tell you may not be able to remove unless you are explicit in your analysis about it.
