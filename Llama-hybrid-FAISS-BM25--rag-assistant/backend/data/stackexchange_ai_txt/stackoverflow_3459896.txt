Nested optgroup solution from drop down list

I have a drop down list of pages in a site, however the structure is quite complicated to go in the list e.g.; Home Projects Category 1 Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Category 2 Item 4 Item 5 Item 6 Category 3 Item 4 Item 5 Contact Accessibility Sitemap What I want to do is say "select a page to link to" and then present the user with a list of the above options. The problem is, isn't nestable, so I was wondering if anyone had a more elegant solution (maybe using Jquery or something) to present the list? At the moment I am just using multiple &nbsp;'s and &bull;'s (â€¢) to achieve an indented list like the old un-ordered list that we know and love... but it's not ideal. Also, I don't want to use a tree - it really needs to be a drop down type list for space saving reasons. Cheers!
