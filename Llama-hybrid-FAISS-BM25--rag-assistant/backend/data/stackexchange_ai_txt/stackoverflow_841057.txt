How to list all tables or only those of a given database

You can get a list of databases using PRAGMA database_list or a list of tables in the "main" database using select name from sqlite_master where type='table' but as I just wrote, it only returns the tables from the "main" DB only, and I don't see a way to know which tables are in the other DBs. So how does one list the tables in the other DBs (which were attached later on)? Thanks, --DD PS: I can think of a work around of creating a separate sqlite* for each DB listed via the pragma database_list, and them doing the "select name from sqlite_master where type='table'" N times on those (since each one is the "main" one now), but this sounds like something that should be possible without resorting to the work-around, no???
