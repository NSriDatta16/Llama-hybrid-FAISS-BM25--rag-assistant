Mixture design experiment and regression

I have an experiment with four groups with multiple trials. In two groups individuals have the exact same trials during all the experiment, no variation In the stimuli were added. But in the other two groups the trials have a little difference (level of the stimuli varied). Now Iâ€™m doing a logistic regression to analyze this data. This mixture design (between/within subjects) have implications to the way I design my LR model? How can I make the model take this difference into consideration? Please, If you have some textual reference on this I would really appreciate.
