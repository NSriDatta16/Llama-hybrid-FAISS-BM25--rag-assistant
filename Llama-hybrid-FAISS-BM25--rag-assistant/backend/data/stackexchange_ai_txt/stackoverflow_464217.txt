How to decipher Firebug results in efforts to make site faster

I am trying to fix my website and found this great tool called Firebug. I was trying to pinpoint why my website is really slow at loading (wordpress based website). I was hoping to see if anybody could give me some hints. The results that I get under Net->All is. GET www.XXXXX.com http://www.XXXXX.com/ 302 Moved Temporarily ? 10.08s GET XXXXX.com http://XXXXX.com/ 200 OK XXXXX.com 9 KB 7.36s GET submenucontents.htm?1232464334833 http://XXXXX.com/wp-content/themes/bl_custom/submenucontents.htm?1232464334833 200 OK XXXXX.com 878 B 442ms 3 requests I first try to access the site with a www (and it redirects it to an address without the www prefix). Under the response header for GET XXXXX.com I get: Response Headers Date Tue, 20 Jan 2009 15:12:03 GMT Server Apache Cache-Control no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre- check=0 Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Pragma no-cache X-Pingback http://XXXXX.com/xmlrpc.php Set-Cookie xLanguage_7b770aac8932bb67100357a3682248c9=en; expires=Sat, 02-Jan-2010 20:32:09 GMT; path=/ Keep-Alive timeout=15, max=100 Connection Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding chunked Content-Type text/html; charset=UTF-8 Request Headers Host XXXXX.com User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 300 Connection keep-alive Cookie xLanguage_7b770aac8932bb67100357a3682248c9=en; PHPSESSID=c8fde81fo6f76uitqemqk7k5b3 If anyone could help, it would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you.
