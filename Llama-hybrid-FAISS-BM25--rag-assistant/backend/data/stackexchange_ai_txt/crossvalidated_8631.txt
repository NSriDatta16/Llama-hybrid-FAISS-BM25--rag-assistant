How would life expectancy impact the calculation of disease prevalence?

I want to understand how to make calculations on the prevalence of a disease in a country population and the impact that the element of average life expectancy (of those suffering with the disease at time of diagnosis) has on this calculation. Are there any 'best practice' papers on making epidemiology calculations?
