How to create a library

I have some code which I want to organize into a class or library for other developers to use more easily on their website. The way I use the class now is to instantiate an instance of it and start calling the functions I need as I need them. $class_object = new MyClass(); $class_object->myFunction(); Is this basically all I need to make a library, or do I need to make further changes to turn this into a library?
