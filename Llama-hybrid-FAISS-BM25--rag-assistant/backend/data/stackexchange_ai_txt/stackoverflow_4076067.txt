You could add a column to order on select *, 1 as ORD from discussion where title like '%india%' UNION select *, 2 as ORD from discussion where title like '%Australia%' order by ORD EDIT - 29/11/2010 Due to the duplicate with ORD problem i was thinking about a, maybe, more elegant way to achive this Select * from discussion where title like '%india%' or title like '%Australia%' order by (case when title like '%india%'then 1 else 2 end)
