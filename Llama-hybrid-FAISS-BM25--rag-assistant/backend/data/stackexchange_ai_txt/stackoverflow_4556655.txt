Mobile Redirect via ModReWrite Simple code

is it possible to just use this simple code for the redirection of ALL mobile phones? RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} .*(iPad|iPhone|Mobile).* RewriteRule .* http://website.com/ [R] since Android and Symbian and BB have "Mobile" in their strings. or should the UserAgents be explicitly listed out like here: http://www.projectronin.com/blog/?p=10 thanks
