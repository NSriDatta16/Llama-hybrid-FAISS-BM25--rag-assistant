How do remove 'credit card (save)' Payment method from Magento?

I’m using paypal payment product. If you see the attached file i get 3 options. The first 2 work fine and are actually all i require. The last option Credit Card (save) doesn’t seem to work. Can someone explain what this option is, also how can i remove it.
