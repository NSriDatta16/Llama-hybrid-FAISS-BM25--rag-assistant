Comparison Between Features for Random Forest or Decision Tree

In the random forest of sklearn package, will there be some relationships among features? For example: if value(feature_1) > value(feature_2); it is category A, else B. I read some materials online, it seems there will only be the absolute value comparison. For example: if value(feature_1) > 1 and value(feature_2) > 3; then it is category A, else B.
