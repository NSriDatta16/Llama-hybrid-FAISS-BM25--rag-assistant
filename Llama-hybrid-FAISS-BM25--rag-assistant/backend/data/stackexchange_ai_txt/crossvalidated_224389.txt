auto.arima() has fitted an ARIMA(0,1,1) model to your data. That is, it believes that your first differences follow an MA(1) model, $$ y_t-y_{t-1} = \phi\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_t,$$ or $$ y_t=y_{t-1} + \phi\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_t,$$ with $$\hat{\phi} = -0.0735$$ and $$\epsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2) \quad\text{with}\quad\hat{\sigma}^2 = 50.92.$$ That is, the MA coefficient is very small compared to the variance of the innovations. Therefore, the forecasts converge to a flat line so quickly that convergence happens only in the fifth or later digit of your forecasts. Now, looking at your time series, we immediately see that your data has two (or even three, for the small step in between the high and low values) regimes. If you want good forecasts, the very first thing to do will be to identify and forecast when these regimes happen. If these happen every day at the same time, you may be able to include this as a frequency for your time series, and auto.arima() may pick this up and fit a seasonal ARIMA model. Alternatively, you could include a dummy regressor that is set to 1 in one regime and 0 otherwise, then feed this into the xreg parameter of auto.arima() , which would fit a regression with ARIMA errors . I very much recommend this free online forecasting textbook , in your case especially the chapter on ARIMA models .
