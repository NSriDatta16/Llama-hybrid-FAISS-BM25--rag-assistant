Even if the distributed application is entirely the same, for example the same executable, since both realeases are different, each release ought to have a different version number. So if you released 2.0 ad hoc, and then released official version, that version ought to be different, for example 2.0.1, for organizational and clarity purposes. You will know if the customer refers to version 2.0 that that is an ad hoc version, and if the version is 2.0.1 that is the official version without requiring further information. In summary, each individual release should have an individual and unique revision number.
