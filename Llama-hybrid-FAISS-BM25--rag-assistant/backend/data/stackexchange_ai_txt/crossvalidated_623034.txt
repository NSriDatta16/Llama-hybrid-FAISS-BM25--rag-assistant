Backtransform variables in ggeffects (logistic regression)

I am running a logistic regression. Two variables are transformed for linearity with the logit of the outcome. var1 If plot probabilities in ggeffects, the variables are on the transformed scale. library(ggeffects) library(car) p To solve this, I transformed var1 back: p $x x)^2 The question is now how to transform var2 back. I have back-transformed the three fixed values of var2 manually: 0.01^0.5 = 0.1 0.09^0.5 = 0.3 0.25^0.25 = 0.5 p $group group, "0.01='0.1';0.09 ='0.3';0.25 ='0.5'") The final plot: p $x x)^2 p $group group, "0.01='0.1';0.09 ='0.3';0.25 ='0.5'") plot(p, ci = TRUE, colors = c("system")) + geom_line(size=2) + labs(colour = "") However, is this way of transforming variables back to their original scale correct?
