changing screen brightness programmatically in android

I want to change the screen brightness programmatically in android. At the moment I use this code: WindowManager.LayoutParams lp = getWindow().getAttributes(); float brightness=1.0f; lp.screenBrightness = brightness; getWindow().setAttributes(lp); But this sample code works on cupcake, not on latest versions. I am using the latest version of SDK.. What is the preferred solution for newer Android Versions?
