I've done some additional research on the topic and found the Wikipedia entry for the Okapi BM25 algorithm . It also has a successor BM25F that takes document structure into account, but this appears to be more relevant to HTML/XML. BM25 Incorporates: average document length in the collection, length of the particular document term frequency Finally, the Wikipedia entry links to a Lucene implementation . Compared to @Doug's answers above this appears to be a more complex algorithm to implement.
