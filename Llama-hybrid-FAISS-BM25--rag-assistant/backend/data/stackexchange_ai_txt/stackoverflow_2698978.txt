There are several options. Two I would suggest: Set up SQL Agent Job, with a T-SQL step in it. In the step details you will select target database and type in SQL statement to delete rows. Create SSIS package; use Execute SQL Task and define SQL statement there. Then create SQl Agent Job to call the SSIS package. (1) has a limitation - it will only be able to run the script against a database locate in the same instance of the SQl Server as SQl Agent, unless you use Linked servers.
