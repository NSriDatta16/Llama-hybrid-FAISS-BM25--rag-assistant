Brad Smith beat me to the punch, with a slightly more elegant solution :D Let me know if this isn't what you're looking for, but have you tried: // when adding to a subview, try this, where myView is the view you need centered, // and myMainView is the view you'll be adding it to as a subview myView.center = myMainView.center; [myMainView addSubview:myView];
