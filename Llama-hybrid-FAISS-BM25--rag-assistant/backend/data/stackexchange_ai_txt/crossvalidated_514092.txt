Why the CV in smaller test set perform better than a bigger test set?

I have a question about cross-validation. I use random forests (RF) for regression forecast. I use a daily data from day 1 to day 365. In this case, I have the dataset from the year 2011 to the year 2014. I divide the dataset into 2 types: one-year and four-year dataset. Then, I build the RF algorithm with these dataset and validate by 10-fold CV. The results show that the CV-R2 of one-year dataset is higher than four-year dataset. Also, the CV-RMSE of one-year dataset is smaller than the four-year dataset. It would be great if you could suggest me about the reason why the CV in one-year dataset outperform the CV in four-year dataset. Thank you so much in advance.
