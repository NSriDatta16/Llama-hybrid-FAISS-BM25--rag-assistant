Red-R is a visual programming interface for R designed to bring the power of the R statistical environment to the general researcher or user. The goal of this project is to provide access to the massive library of packages in R without any programming expertise. The Red-R framework uses concepts of dataflow programming to make data the center of attention while hiding all the programming complexity. In visual programming, functional tools (called Widgets in Red-R) are linked together on a canvas to control the flow of data through the program. This framework allows novice users to quickly and easily build complex analysis pipelines. There are a couple of videos demonstrating the applcation at Red-R Documentation Some of the current functionality includes: Read/View Data Merge/Intersect/Filter Math/Apply Plotting Stats - Parametric Stats - Non-Parametric Some advanced functionality: Bioconductor microarray analysis Survival analysis Spatial Stats SQLite ROCR â€“ ROC Curves Neural Nets LME4 This is definitely a work in progress, but you can check out the application at Red-R.org. We are looking for any feedback in improving the usability and expanding the functionality. We'd be happy to work with anyone for specific needs. Anup
