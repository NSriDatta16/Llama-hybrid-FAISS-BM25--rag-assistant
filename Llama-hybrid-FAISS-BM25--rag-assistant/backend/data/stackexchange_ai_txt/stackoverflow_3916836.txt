In Java, I am currently discouraged to use boolean functions as a predicate in a test: if( list.isEmpty() )... must be rewritten if( list.isEmpty() == true )... and if( !list.isEmpty() )... must be rewritten if( list.isEmpty() == false )... because "it is clearer like that". To me, "list.isEmpty() == true" has 2 verbs, "is" and "equals", in one phrase without a connective. I can't make it feel right.
