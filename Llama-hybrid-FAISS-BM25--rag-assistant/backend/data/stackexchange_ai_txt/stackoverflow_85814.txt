I agree with all the "reset" suggestions and the "grid" framework suggestions, but I did want to add a bit of advice: The goal of identical in every browser is, in practical terms, unachievable because you cannot control the client. Case in point: fonts. You declare your font styles in CSS but some Linux machines, some Macs, some mobile browsers -- will not have the font you specified. This variation leads to differing text lengths and wrapping. Then there's the variance of browser versions and operating systems running each; how different browsers implement zoom features; and the text size can be adjusted by the end user. Identical rendering is simply an unachievable goal. But take heart! This is the "art" part of CSS: Being able to be flexible in your design such that variances between browsers, operating systems, and end-user adjustments are handled elegantly. Don't strive for identical rendering -- you should strive for brand consistency + appropriate experience + flexibility.
