Numerically PCA implements SVD or SVD implements PCA

How do we numerically implement SVD? I confused the numerically implementations between PCA and SVD (who implements who). Since we know that PCA can be numerically implemented by NIPALS (Non-linear iterative partial least-squares). And theoretically, we needn't to decompose the covariance matrix $X^TX$ in PCA instead we compute the SVD of $X.$ Then do we implement SVD by implementing corresponding PCA by NIPALS? Or implement SVD by other numerical method, then implement PCA by implementing corresponding SVD?
