Jurafsky and Martin's NLP textbook has a chapter about information extraction that should be a good starting point. For example, if you want to extract company names it will tell you how to do that. A paralegal would go through the entire document and highlight important points from the document. What you need to do depends heavily on what your definition of "important" is here. It would help if you can give some specific examples.
