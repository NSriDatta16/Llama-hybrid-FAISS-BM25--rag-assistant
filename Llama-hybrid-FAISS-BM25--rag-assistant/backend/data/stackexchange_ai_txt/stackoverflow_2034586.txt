Something like that for a plane polygon (compiled with notepad): static double GetDeterminant(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) { return x1 * y2 - x2 * y1; } static double GetArea(IList vertices) { if(vertices.Count Although your approach doesn't pay attention to Z-axis. Therefore I'd advice to apply some transformation to get rid of it: you won't be able to get area if the polygon is not plane, whereas if it is plane you are able to get rid of the third dimension.
