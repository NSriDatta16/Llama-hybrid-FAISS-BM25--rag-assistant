Little late, but are you familiar with machine learning methods? For non linear relationships you could try gradient boosting, or if you have enough data a neural net. Id also try to include additional features to regress the demand curve. Cyclical features like month of the year or day of the week (just make sure to properly encode ). Additional features could also include price of competitors, macroeconomic indicators, users info, among others. You can find a good overall exposition of the ML framework for pricing here For an introductory idea behind ML regressors yu can always check statquest . Hope you find it useful. Regards!
