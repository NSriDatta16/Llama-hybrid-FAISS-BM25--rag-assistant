Principal components analysis on nested data

I'm working on a piece of analysis that requires identifying a small set of variables that summarize the variation found in a larger set of principal observations on teacher practice. Given the nature of the question, it seems natural to use PCA in my analysis. My data set however, has a hierarchical structure (observation occasions at the first level, and teachers at the second). So, I have the following questions: What do I risk by doing PCA without considering this temporal effect? What methods are there for accounting for the nested structure of data in PCA? Are there any useful tools in R?
