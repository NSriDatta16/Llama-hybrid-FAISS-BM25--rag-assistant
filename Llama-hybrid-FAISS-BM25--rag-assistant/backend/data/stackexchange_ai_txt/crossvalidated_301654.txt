There are two separate ways of specifying 'the smallest number of records' to negate the effect. The first is to remove a specific subset of records, and the second is to remove a random subset of size n. You describe the way to find the first method in your question. This will give you a specific subset of n records where removing them will negate the variable effect and there is no subset of n-1 records that will negate the effect. To find this you need to do an exhaustive search of looking at every record, every pair, every triplet, etc. If instead you want to know on average, what is the minimum number of randomly chosen records that you can remove to negate the effect, then you can randomly remove subsets of different sizes until you find the smallest generic subset without the effect. Start by randomly removing 1/2 of your records and look for the effect (do this 10 times). If the effect is not there then remove 1/4 of the records from your full dataset and look for the effect. If the effect was there then remove 3/4 of the records from the full dataset and try again. Each iteration should cut the distance between unknown points in half. EX: Remove 1/2 - effect is there Remove 3/4 - effect is not there Remove 5/8 - effect is there Remove 11/16 etc.
