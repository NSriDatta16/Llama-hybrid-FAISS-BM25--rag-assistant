I don't think it can be done in a simple query, but it's relatively easy to do with a simple php script. just have a simple loop in php to go over every single row with content and do a preg_replace on the content field, then update that single row. It's not nearly as elegant as doing it in sql, but its sure to get the job done today as oposed to sometime this year. P.S. this is assuming there is more content than just the URL, in which case normal mysql string functions would suffice.
