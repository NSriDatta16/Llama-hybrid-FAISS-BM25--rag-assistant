Using a newer OS ipad for adhoc deployment

I'm getting confused about version compatibility and hoping someone can clear this up for me. I have xcode 3.2.4 which supports iOS 3.2 but not 4.2.1. Now, I have two iPads--and older 3.2 OS and a newer 4.2.1. I am able to create an adhoc provision and install my app into my older iPad, but I cannot do it for my newer 4.2.1 iPad. Shouldn't the newer ones be backward compatible at least in terms of running ad hoc distributions? I get the yellow dot warning/error in Organizer when I hook up my new iPad and it says I need to install the latest iOS sdk to use my new iPad for development, but I'm wondering if there is something else I'm doing wrong. It doesn't seem like I should have to keep upgrading my xcode to run ad hocs built for older OS's, much like old applications in the app store should just work for them. Am I thinking about this incorrectly, or do I have to upgrade my iOS sdk just to build out ad hoc to it?
