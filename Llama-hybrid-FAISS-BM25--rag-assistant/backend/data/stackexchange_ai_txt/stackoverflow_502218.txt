Sandbox against malicious code in a Java application

In a simulation server environment where users are allowed to submit their own code to be run by the server, it would clearly be advantageous for any user-submitted code to be run in side a sandbox, not unlike Applets are within a browser. I wanted to be able to leverage the JVM itself, rather than adding another VM layer to isolate these submitted components. This kind of limitation appears to be possible using the existing Java sandbox model, but is there a dynamic way to enable that for just the user-submitted parts of a running application?
