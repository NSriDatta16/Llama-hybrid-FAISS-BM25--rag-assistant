Identifying those samples which changed over time - but at random timepoints

I have a dataset of observations taken at random time points across a wide range of time. These are X-rays taken in a fashion that, sadly, is a bit random (clinic can get a bit manic). I have 70 patients. Each patient has between 2 and 8 images. This means about 300 images. The image capture time is random, but always between 1 and 80 months from the first image. We have a series of morphological measurements we have extracted from each image. SC_1 is the first metric, we have about 18 to look at. I want to determine if the measurements we are obtaining are changing significantly over time. I expect that around half of them will show a substantial change in morphology after 6 months. But I need to see if this is true, and then identify those patients who did change significantly. [ I have tried plotting the data - it is a bit of a mess unfortunately because there are more patients than colours to choose, and the varying time-frame. But some are definitely are showing change over time, while others are not. I am at a loss to figure out the best way to quantify the change for each patient. I was thinking perhaps take the percentage change for each patient, between the first and last image - and assigning this number to each patient? Or take the standard deviation for each patient's measurements over time? Or is there a more sophisticated method? If I can get a pointer in the right direction, I'd happily learn a new method (e.g. some form of time series). It is just getting to the point of knowing which methods to look at.... I will have about double to dataset in a few months though....
