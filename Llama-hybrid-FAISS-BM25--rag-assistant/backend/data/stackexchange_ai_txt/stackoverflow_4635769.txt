I'm working with the bitConverter class and found myself stuck trying to append the results. The reason I'm doing this is so I can save runtime values into a IO Stream. The target storage is Azure Page blobs in case that matters. I don't care about what endian this is stored in, as long as it input matches the output. static byte[] ConvertFloatToByteArray(float[] floats) { byte[] ret = new byte[floats.Length * 4];// a single float is 4 bytes/32 bits for (int i = 0; i
