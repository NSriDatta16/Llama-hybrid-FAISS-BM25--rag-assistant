welcome to CV! A common and relatively simple way to analyze pre-post data with small samples is a paired samples t-test. That you can do in almost any software, including Excel. That will test whether there was change from pre to post in your items. However, you have quite many items and not a large sample. Would it be possible to combine the 10 items or some of them? Do all 10 items measure different things? If some of them measure more or less the same thing, you could consider averaging these items into a composite score and only run 1 or 2 t-tests.
