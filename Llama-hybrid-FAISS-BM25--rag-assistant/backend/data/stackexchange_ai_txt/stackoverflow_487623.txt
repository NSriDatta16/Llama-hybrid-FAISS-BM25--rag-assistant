If your embedding sql in code then your should always use the long form for clarity, not performance. For ad-hoc queries the select * syntax is ESSENTIALLY no less efficient than specifying column names unless you have a massive number of columns which you shouldn't unless you're denormalizing. I should get 1 point for using 2 unlesses in a sentence and still habving it make sense!! :)
