You should not sprinkle your code with this check everywhere if (application.Status == Status.New) { //do something } else if (application.Status == Status.Closed) { //do other things } Instead, use the state pattern. Change the state whenever the mode of the application changes and forward all your calls to the state's methods. You'll have a much cleaner and easier to maintain code. As for changing the status, that has got nothing do with the state pattern. So you can use whichever approach is elegant.
