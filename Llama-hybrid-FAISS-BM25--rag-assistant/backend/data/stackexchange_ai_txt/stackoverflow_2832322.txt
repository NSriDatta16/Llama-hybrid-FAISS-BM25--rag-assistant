Firebug error causing code to fail in Sitecore when using IE8 to view the Content Editor

I have a Sitecore 6 CMS with a custom data provider to create child items on the fly based on items added to a field in the parent item. This was working okay (about a week ago was the last time I was working on this project), but now I am getting errors in the web client which are originating in the FirebugLite html and JS files. Basically, I click on a content item, the FirebugLite js fails, and then my code in my custom data provider fails to run. I would have thought any FirebugLite scripts would be disabled or ignored when running under IE8 (isn't FirebugLite a Firefox addin?) When I remove the FirebugLite folder from ..\sitecore\shell\Controls\Lib\ my code runs fine and I don't get the clientside errors. I'm not really sure what my question is. I guess it is should FirebugLite affect IE8? What am I missing out on if I remove FirebugLite from the Sitecore directory tree? I'm running WindowsXP SP3, VS2008. The errors I get are the following: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Timestamp: Fri, 14 May 2010 06:42:04 UTC Message: Invalid argument.
