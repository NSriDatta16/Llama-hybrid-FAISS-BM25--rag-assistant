Having the default action for each controller have the same name just simplifies the routing (check global.asax). Also, it all things (Products, Books, Contacts, ...) use actions/views with the same name for the same function, then the code becomes much easier to navigate and understand. This use of convention is especially important when working as part of a team as it will encourage consistent code across developers. While looking at another question, I ran across SimplyRestfulRouting in the MVCContrib project on codeplex. This might give you some ideas.
