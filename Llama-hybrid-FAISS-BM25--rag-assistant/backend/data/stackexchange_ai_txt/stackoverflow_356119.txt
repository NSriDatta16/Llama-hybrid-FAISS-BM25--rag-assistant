The whole iPhone UI development (UITableView etc) is based around the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, so a good understanding of that is vital. Memory management is also vital and can be a little cumbersome to start off with. I have not long started so can not give you a good description here without making a fool of myself :). Apple Memory Management Finally the development environment can be a little wierd to start off with. Especially hooking up the view controller and interface elements. So check that out. Then its basically looking through the tutorials on the iPhone developer website and the internet to learn the intracacies of the different UI elements and controllers (tables, textboxes etc). You will need to pay for the iPhone Developer program to legally use your iPhone to debug your applications (although the Xcode dev environment comes with a simulator). Submitting the application to the app store allows access by everyone. Full details for doing this are available after paying your money. There are other ways you can get apps on the iPhone but I will not provide details for doing that - search the internet. I would say that looking through the documentation and following tutorials will get you far enough to start building applications. This should not take to long. A good book may also help you out here, try the iPhone Developers Cookbook , which gives good well discussed and broken down examples about specific issues and broader coverage of things like tables etc.
