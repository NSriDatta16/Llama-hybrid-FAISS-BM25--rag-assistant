My question is, why would someone take this approach over using a static variable? it makes sense if you have something to hide -- an int is not worth usually hiding, but a large library is. an author may also prefer to hide implementation details from clients in some cases. regarding static functions -- i'll typically hide them if they are just free helpers, and really don't belong in, or are required to be a part of the class interface. generally, i'll put it in the class interface simply for organizational purposes.
