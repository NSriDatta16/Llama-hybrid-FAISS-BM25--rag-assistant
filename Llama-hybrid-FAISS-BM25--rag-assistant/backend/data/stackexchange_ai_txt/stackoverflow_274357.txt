class UsefulStuff { object _TheLock = new object { }; public void UsefulThingNumberOne() { lock(_TheLock) { //CodeBlockA } } public void UsefulThingNumberTwo() { lock(_TheLock) { //CodeBlockB } } } CodeBlockA and CodeBlockB are prevented from executing at the same time in different threads, because they are both locked on the same object instance _TheLock . The methods on _TheLock itself are completely unaffected.
