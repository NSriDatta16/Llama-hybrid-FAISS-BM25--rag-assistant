PCA on Wine data with only one binary data(white/red wine) and other quantitative data

I am working on wine data with the following format: head(wine,2) ID color fixed.acidity volatile.acidity citric.acid residual.sugar chlorides free.sulfur.dioxide 1 2419 white 6.6 0.56 0.22 8.9 0.034 27 2 285 red 9.9 0.59 0.07 3.4 0.102 32 total.sulfur.dioxide density pH sulphates alcohol quality 1 133 0.99675 3.20 0.51 9.1 5 2 71 1.00015 3.31 0.71 9.8 5 I want to do a PCA on the data but I am wondering how to deal with the binary categorical data here. I know this issue has been talked a lot of times but I'm trying to understand what is the simple way to deal with this particular data. My ultimate plan is to predict wine quality by combining local kernel method and PCA
