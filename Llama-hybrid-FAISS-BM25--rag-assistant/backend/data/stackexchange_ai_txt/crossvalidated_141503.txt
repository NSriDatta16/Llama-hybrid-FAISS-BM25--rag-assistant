Neural network for time series forecasting- Single input Single output Theoretical proof needed

I am doing time series forecasting using neural networks. I have 2 approaches: Forecasting in a auto regressive manner i.e based on time series lags as shown below: y(t) = f(y(t-1), y(t-2), ..., y(t-d)) Forecasting in linear regression manner i.e one independent variable and one dependent variable as shown below: y(t) = f(x(t)) In the first case, the neural network is multiple input single output , while in second case, the neural network is single input single output . The data which I am trying to forecast is wind energy production. So, in the first case, the values used are just power output. In the second case, the independent variable 'x' is wind and dependent variable 'y' is power output. In both cases, I am forecasting using sliding window method with short term horizon. In both models, there is a hidden layer in the neural network model. I am getting low forecasting errors with the second method. I did not find any proof that neural networks can be used in this manner. So, I was hoping for some clarification from the experts here, is forecasting using neural networks correct?
