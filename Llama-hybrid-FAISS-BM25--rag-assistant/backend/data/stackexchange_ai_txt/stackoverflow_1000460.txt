There were not many answers! I managed to do it using templates (to allow any CWnd-derived control to use the functionality) and CImageList (to display the dragged image). I can't post source code here because it's a commercial application but if somebody it's trying to do something similar and needs my help. I'll try to help him/her out. Thanks.
