I have had problems with EF4 and composite keys. It doesn't support columns being used as components in more than one key in a join table. See my previous question Mapping composite foreign keys in a many-many relationship in Entity Framework for more details. The nuts of it is that when you have a join table (describing a many-many relationship) where both of the relationships use a common key, you'll get an error like Error 3021: Problem in mapping fragments...: Each of the following columns in table PageView is mapped to multiple conceptual side properties: PageView.Version is mapped to (PageView_Association.View.Version, PageView_Association.Page.Version) The only way around it was to duplicate the column which defeats the purpose of having it there at all. Good luck!
