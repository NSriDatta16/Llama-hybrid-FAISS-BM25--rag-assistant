Custom dataannotation enum for property

I want to create a data annotation and I need it to be an enum something like public enum DataUsage { Count, Average, Median, Percentage } And then slap it onto a property like this (I know the syntax is wrong, I just want to show usage) [MyDataAnnotation = DataUsage.Average] public decimal CasesPerYear { get; set; } Can someone help?
