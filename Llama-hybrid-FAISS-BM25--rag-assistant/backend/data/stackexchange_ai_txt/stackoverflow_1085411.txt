It depends on what "memory" you are leaking. Are you using device storage space to cache something? In theory then it's possible that you've used up enough space the other app cannot start because it needs a certain amount of free space. If we're talking physical memory, then no. When your app is dead it is dead. You could ask them to restart the device and see if they have the same issue.
