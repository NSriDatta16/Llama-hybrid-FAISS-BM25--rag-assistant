Existing code to simulate the Secure Attention Sequence (SAS), which most people refer to as control alt delete or ctrl-alt-del, no longer works in Windows Vista. It seems that Microsoft offers a library that exports a function called SimulateSAS(). It is not public and one is supposed to request it by sending a mail to saslib@microsoft.com. There is a similar library available with the following features: Works both with and without User Account Control (UAC) Supports current, console and any Terminal Server session Does not need a driver The calling application does not need to be signed or have a special manifest Supports multiple programming languages Please note that this library is not free. Meanwhile you can contact info@simulatesas.com if you are interested in it.
