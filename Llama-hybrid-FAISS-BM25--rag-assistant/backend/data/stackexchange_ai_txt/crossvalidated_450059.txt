Binary representation: -1 vs 0

I commonly see {0,1} used in representing pass/fail data, but I recently found a case where I was given a data set with {-1,1} to perform some pre-processing. So, I'm wondering whether I should keep {-1,1} for some downstream purposes. Question: When dealing with binary data, what are some advantages/disadvantages of using {0,1} vs {-1,1}? Will this affect my result when performing correlation or applying machine learning algorithms e.g. scipy/scikit/tensorflow?
