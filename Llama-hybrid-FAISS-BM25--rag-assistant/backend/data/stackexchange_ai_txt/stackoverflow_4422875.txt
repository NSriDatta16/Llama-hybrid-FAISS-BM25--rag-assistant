It depends on your exact context (OS, Eclipse version, CDT version). It can be: an index issue , Just recently upgraded to Eclipse Ganymede RC4 with CDT 5 (release from June 17th). I am having some difficulties with "Unresolved Inclusion" warnings (from the Indexer I assume?). I had the same problem the first time I built my project after changing from Callisto to Ganymede. I changed from the Fast Indexer to the Full Indexer and did a full index, which resolved the problem (I also checked Index All Files, but I don't know if that was essential). I could then change back to the Fast Indexer and everything worked. a preference issue : I guess this could be solved in the preferences for the project. Under the point c/c++ general -> Paths and symbols . In the tab " includes " under GNU C++ , you can add the location of the include files. or, as this thread illustrates , a context issue: This happens if you use Eclipse/CDT on a windows system with Cygwin or mingw. When CDT follows the include paths there in no path " asm " in the include directory - just an " asm.lnk " which causes the problem.
