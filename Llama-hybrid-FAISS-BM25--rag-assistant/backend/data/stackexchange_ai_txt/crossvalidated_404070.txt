Here's my few cents.. Co-movement of independent and dependent variable is the key here. Let's say we want to find out how height changes with age and we have data for 100 people. Let's say we know that our independent variable (height) varies a lot across the 100 observations, but we want to find out how much of it comes from the co-movement of height and age. Hence, we fit a model and to estimate of how much of the variance in height can be explained from co-movement w.r.t. age. If in our data, everyone has the same age, the model won't be able to explain ANY of the height's variance, we'll need to find something that explains the movement (variance) of the independent variable. Explaining the movement (variance) of independent variable is a good starting point for all predictive models. In PCA, the objective is rotate the data to get the best axis for cleanest perspective. Using variance to change the basis is just a way to get this perspective on how data is scattered on a hyperplane.
