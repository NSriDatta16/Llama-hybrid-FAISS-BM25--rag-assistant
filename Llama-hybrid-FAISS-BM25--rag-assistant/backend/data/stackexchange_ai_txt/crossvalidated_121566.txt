AR(2) & constant & trend - very poor constant estimates?

Here is a problem that was puzzling me. Suppose I simulate the AR(2) process with constant and trend using the code below (I apologize for inefficiency and inelegance - the aim was to get job done at this point; also - it may seem strangely constructed, but it has some other purpose too for which is irrelevant here). My question is - why the constant estimates are so poor? The true value is 70 but if we average 1000 regressions each over 1000 observations I get an average of 381.9234 . Is it because I interpret something wrong or the did I make a mistake somwhere? set.key(123) #parameter values V=7 P=10 S=4 r1 = 50/(50+P) r2 = V/(30+V) mu = 10*P l2 = 10*(S+V) a0 = 10*V d0 = 10*P a1 = 0 d1 = P+V s2 = 2*(P+V+S) #simulate and estimate the parameters data
