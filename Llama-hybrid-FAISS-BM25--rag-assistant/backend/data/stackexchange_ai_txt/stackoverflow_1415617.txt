In my book, a framework provides a structure and encourages or requires that it be used in a certain way. This can be good if the developer wants to do things the framework's way, since it's easier for many thing to be automatic, but it can be bad if the developer wants to deviate from the framework's intent. A toolkit, on the other hand, provides various tools that can be used together or separately. It's more flexible but requires more effort on the programmer's behalf.
