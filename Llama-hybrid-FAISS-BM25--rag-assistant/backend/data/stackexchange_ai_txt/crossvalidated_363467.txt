Bootstrapping is useful when there is no closed-form analytic estimator for a statistic. For example, the variance of a conditional survivor probability estimated by bootstrapping may produce estimates with nominal type I probability coverage). For another example, when a particular distribution is unknown (and therefore closed-form analytic estimators of its moments or other statistics are unknown), as when measuring phenomena that do not have precise mathematical theory undergirding their distribution (e.g., distributional measures of BMI or of smoking intensity in a population). Bootstrapping can also be a useful tool in simulations for evaluating the performance of approximate estimators.
