jQuery is a JavaScript library the way stdlib is a C library, so yes you'll need to know minimal JavaScript as well as basic understanding of CSS/HTML. However, learning jQuery is probably the best way to learn JavaScript these days, as it takes care of the big hurdles that trip up those new to JavaScript (the DOM and the event model) and makes AJAX a breeze. It also encourages best practices such as unobtrusive JavaScript, as opposed to putting "onclick" everywhere, and forces you to learn about closures. If you're already a programmer, you'll have no problem picking it up.
