Can pinball loss be used to construct a prediction interval?

I'm modeling some time series data ($\{y_t\}_t$) and would like to construct a model that is able to return not just a single-value prediction $\hat{y_t}$, but an interval $C_t=(\hat{y}_{t, lower}, \hat{y}_{t, upper})$ such that $y_t \in C_t$ with some probability. Now, I've learned about the pinball loss: $$L(q, z)=\cases{qz, & z >= 0 \\ (q-1)z,& z Is this interpretation correct? Then, can I simply train two models, say one for $q=0.05$ and the other for $q=0.95$ in order to get the estimates of the intervals that contain the actual values with the probability $0.95-0.05=0.9$?
