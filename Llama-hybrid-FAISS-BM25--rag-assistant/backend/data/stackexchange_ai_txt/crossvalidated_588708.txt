Given that you have to use stepwise, why not bootstrap it? See for instance How to evaluate collinearity or correlation of predictors in logistic regression? Then, as @Dave said in a comment, calculate effect sizes the way you would do it with a prespecified model, but repeat it in every bootstrap resample. The same you can do with other fit statistics. The variability between resamples will give some indication of the reliability of the effect size estimates.
