Since Gmail doesn't provide any API to get this information, it sounds like you want to do some web scraping . Web scraping (also called Web harvesting or Web data extraction) is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites There are numerous ways of doing this, as mentioned in the wikipedia article linked before: Human copy-and-paste: Sometimes even the best Web-scraping technology can not replace humanâ€™s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly setup barriers to prevent machine automation. Text grepping and regular expression matching: A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from Web pages can be based on the UNIX grep command or regular expression matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python). HTTP programming: Static and dynamic Web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote Web server using socket programming. DOM parsing: By embedding a full-fledged Web browser, such as the Internet Explorer or the Mozilla Web browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic contents generated by client side scripts. These Web browser controls also parse Web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the Web pages. HTML parsers: Some semi-structured data query languages, such as the XML query language (XQL) and the hyper-text query language (HTQL), can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform Web content. Web-scraping software: There are many Web-scraping software available that can be used to customize Web-scraping solutions. These software may provide a Web recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write Web-scraping codes, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform Web content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Semantic annotation recognizing: The Web pages may embrace metadata or semantic markups/annotations which can be made use of to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer 2 , are stored and managed separated to the Web pages, so the Web scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages. And before I continue, please keep in mind the legal implications of all this. I don't know if it's compliant with gmail's terms and I would recommend checking them before moving forward. You might also end up being blacklisted or encounter other issues like this. All that being said, I'd say that in your case you need some kind of spider and DOM parser to log into gmail and find the data you want. The choice of this tool will depend on your technology stack. As a ruby dev, I like using Mechanize and nokogiri . Using PHP you could take a look at solutions like Sphider .
