Error in creating HTML form using Python-CGI

I have to create a HTML form and get the data using python-cgi. HTML form requires user to submit firstname and lastname and then the python script is supposed to get the data generated in the form. I have read up tutorials and tried playing with it to make it work, but it does not seem to happen. HTML code: First Name: Last Name: Click here to submit the form: python script to extract data #!c:/Python26/python.exe -u import cgi, cgitb cgitb.enable() def main() print "Content-type: text/html\n" print form = cgi.FieldStorage() if form.has_key("firstname") amd form["firstname"].value !="": print " Hello", form["firstname"].value, " " else: print " Error!Wrong! main() when i direct html form to above script it does NOT work but when i direct it to the following script it works. #!c:/Python26/python.exe -u import cgi, cgitb cgitb.enable() print "Content-type: text/html" print print "The First Python Script On Server Side" print "The sum of two numbers evaluation" print "3+5 = ",3+5 I dont know what is going wrong. Any help will be highly appreciated!
