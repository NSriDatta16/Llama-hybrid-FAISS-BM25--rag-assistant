Linear regression and arithmetic mean

I do experiments with a certain parameter x. The result is y. I assume y is linearly related to x. Suppose I can do 1000 experiments, which method will give me a better estimation of the linear relation? Select 1000 different values of x, get a single y for each x, and do linear regression? Select 100 different values of x, run 10 experiments for each x, average the y values for each x, and then do linear regression on the 100 averages? Select 100 different values of x, run 10 experiments for each x, and do linear regression without averaging first? What if I am not sure that the relation is linear?
