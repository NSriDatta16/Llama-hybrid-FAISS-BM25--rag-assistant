Unbalanced training data for different classes

What precautions do I need to take while trying to develop a CNN for classification of images if there is much more training data for one label. For example: label1 : 1000 images label2 : 100 images label3 : 100 images label4 : 100 images Numbers will become larger later but proportion is likely to stay the same. Thanks for your insight.
