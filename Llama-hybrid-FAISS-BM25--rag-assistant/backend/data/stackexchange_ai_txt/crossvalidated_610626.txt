logistic regression model with mixed effects?

I have a dataset where the primary result is the test results (a binary variable 0 or 1) from doctors. I want to see if a continuous variable X is going to affect the test result. I think in this dataset, one row represents one test. But in this dataset, there are multiple rows from the same doctor, which means some doctors conducted the tests more than once. So I wanted to build a model to include doctor as a random effect, like this: glmer (test_result ~ X + (1| doctor_ID),family= binomial) How is this different from a regular logistic regression where you put doctor ID as a covariate? glm(test_result ~ X + doctor_ID, family= binomial) What if I have another random effect variable patient_ID (tests results from the same patient as a cluster). How do I add this to the model?
