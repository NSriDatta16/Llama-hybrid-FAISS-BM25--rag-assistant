Jquery UI Slider - Input value truncates 3.40 -> 3.4

I am trying to resolve an issue. When I put in stepping, lets say .01 everything works great. However, if it lands on 1 it prints 1 instead of 1.00, as well as 3.40 prints as 3.4. I have added toFixed(2) in various places of ui.slider.js, but have not found the correct location to make this fix. Can anyone shed light to this question.
