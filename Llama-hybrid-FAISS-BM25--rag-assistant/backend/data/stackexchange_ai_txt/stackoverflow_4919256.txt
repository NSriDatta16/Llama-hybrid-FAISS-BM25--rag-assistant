Add compiled java class to a maven project

I received some compiled classes that I need to add to a project. One solution I can think of is creating a jar with these files and manually uploading it to the repository. Obviously this will work. But I wonder if there is a more elegant solution. May be I can put them somehow under the project structure? So the files will be checked-in to the source control and it will easier to maintain their versions, etc.
