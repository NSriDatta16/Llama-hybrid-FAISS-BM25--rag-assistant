How to compare logistic regression curves?

I have a binary dependent variable whose probability depends on a continuous independent variable, i.e., age. I have fit these into a logistic regression model and have the coefficients for the same. The problem is that I have 3 such curves (for 3 different groups - categorical) and I need to show that these three are statistically different from each other. How could I show that one logistic regression curve is not the same as the other? Note: Sample sizes for the three groups are different
