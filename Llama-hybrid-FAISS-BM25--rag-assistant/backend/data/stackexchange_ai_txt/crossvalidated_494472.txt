Why might the functional form of a distribution be "inappropriate" for a particular application?

Working through Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning(a great read so far!) and on page 67 he says: "One limitation of the parametric approach is that it assumes a specific functional form for the distribution which may turn out to be inappropriate for a particular application" Why might it be that the functional form of a distribution is inappropriate for a particular application? An illustrative example would also be much appreciated.
