I guess a wildcard import could slow down compilation a bit if the package imported were unusually huge, but in practice, it's negligible. Import statements have no effect at runtime. The compiled class is identical, whether wildcard or explicit imports are used. However, wildcard imports are generally discouraged, because they make the code hard to read; it's not clear to a human reader what package a type comes from when multiple packages have been imported this way.
