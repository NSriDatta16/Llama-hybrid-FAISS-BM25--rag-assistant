Basically, creating a new SPSite object is "expensive" in terms of memory it requires. This is why you have to Dispose() them whenever you can - to free up resources you have taken. So, whenever such method is available, you should call methods which use "singletons" built into SharePoint. For instance, in your 3rd example, you call SPContext.Current.Web . Internally (you can see it, if you load the code in Reflector) it stores a reference to the SPWeb object and returns you the same object, every time you call it. It means that different web controls in the same page use one single SPSite object and one SPWeb object. Your second example, however, creates a new SPSite object and that costs you 2Mb of memory (information taken from Robert Lamb's article ). In my opinion, the 1st and the 3rd method are equivalent. One of the methods calls the other one internally (I don't have access to microsoft.sharepoint.dll at the moment, so I cannot verify). The 2nd example is different.
