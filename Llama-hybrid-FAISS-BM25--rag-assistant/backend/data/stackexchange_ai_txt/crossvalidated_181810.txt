For a coefficient in a regression model, yes, if the $1-\alpha$ interval doesn't contain the value of the parameter under the null hypothesis, that same null value would be rejected by a test at significance level $\alpha$. Indeed, both procedures are based on the same pivotal quantity In the case of the hypothesis test, the statistic is $T=\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta_0}{s_\hat{\beta}}$, which is rejected when $|T|\geq t_{1-\alpha/2}$ (at the relevant degrees of freedom; n-2 for simple linear regression). The $1-\alpha$ confidence interval has bounds of $\hat\beta\pm s_\hat{\beta}\cdot t_{1-\alpha/2}$. If $\beta_0$ is outside the interval $\hat\beta\pm s_\hat{\beta}\cdot t_{1-\alpha/2}$, that's equivalent to saying $|\hat{\beta}-\beta_0|\geq {s_\hat{\beta}}\cdot t_{1-\alpha/2}$. Now let's show that rejecting in the hypothesis test is the same: $|T|\geq t_{1-\alpha/2}\implies |\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta_0}{s_\hat{\beta}}|\geq t_{1-\alpha/2}$ $\hspace{2.55cm}\implies|\hat{\beta}-\beta_0|\geq s_\hat{\beta}\cdot t_{1-\alpha/2}$ (Not all tests have this property, but many do. There's an explicit example of one that doesn't in comments here ) Note that both inferential procedures rely on the same set of assumptions; if the assumptions don't hold (or reasonably nearly so), the actual type I error rate and the actual coverage probability might not be very close to their nominal values.
