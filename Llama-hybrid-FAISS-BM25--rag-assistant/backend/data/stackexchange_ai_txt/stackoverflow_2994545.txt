Another solution but this is very slow compare the below query. select DISTINCT u.Id from Users u inner join Certification c on u.ID = c.AId inner join ApplicantDetails ad on u.ID=ad.AId inner join EducationalBackground eb on u.ID=eb.AId inner join EmploymentDetails ed on u.Id=ed.AId inner join Expertise e on u.Id=e.AId inner join GeographicalExperience ge on u.Id=ge.AId inner join [Language] l on u.Id=l.AId inner join ProjectDetails pd on u.Id=pd.AId inner join [References] r on u.Id=r.AId inner join Training t on u.Id=t.AId left join FreeTexttable (Users, (AlternativeEmail,Email,Firstname,Lastname,Middlename), 'xandrick' ) as uf on uf.[KEY] = u.id left join FreeTexttable (ApplicantDetails, (Address1,Address2,City,Province,StateorRegion), 'xandrick' ) as adf on adf.[KEY] = ad.id left join FreeTexttable (Certification, (Certification,School), 'xandrick' ) as cf on cf.[KEY] = c.id left join FreeTexttable (EducationalBackground, (fieldofStudy,other,School), 'xandrick' ) as ebf on ebf.[KEY] = eb.id left join FreeTexttable (EmploymentDetails, (Address1,Address2,City,CompanyName,DescriptionofDuties,Position,Province,TypeofBusiness), 'xandrick' ) as edf on edf.[KEY] = ed.id left join FreeTexttable (Expertise, (Expertise), 'xandrick' ) as ef on ef.[KEY] = e.id left join FreeTexttable (GeographicalExperience, ([Description]), 'xandrick' ) as gef on gef.[KEY] = ge.id left join FreeTexttable ([Language], ([Language]), 'xandrick' ) as lf on lf.[KEY] = l.id left join FreeTexttable (ProjectDetails, (Address1,Address2,City,ProjectDescription,Projectname,Projectrole,Province,ServiceRendered,StateorRegion), 'xandrick' ) as pdf on pdf.[KEY] = pd.id left join FreeTexttable ([References], (ContactDetails,CurrentPosition,Name,Organization), 'xandrick' ) as rf on rf.[KEY] = r.id left join FreeTexttable (Training, (School,Training), 'xandrick' ) as tf on tf.[KEY] = t.id where uf.[KEY] is not null OR adf.[KEY] is not null OR cf.[KEY] is not null OR ebf.[KEY] is not null OR edf.[KEY] is not null OR ef.[KEY] is not null OR gef.[KEY] is not null OR lf.[KEY] is not null OR pdf.[KEY] is not null OR rf.[KEY] is not null OR tf.[KEY] is not null
