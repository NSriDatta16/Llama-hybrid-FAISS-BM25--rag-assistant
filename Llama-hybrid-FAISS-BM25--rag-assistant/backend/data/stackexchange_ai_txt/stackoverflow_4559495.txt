A for in loop will iterate through every property in an object. In your example, the x variable will cycle through every property in the mycars object. If you add mycars.expensive = "Porsche"; , it will find that too. Note that, as stated by MDC , for in loops should not be used to loop through ordinary arrays: Although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over an Array , this is a bad idea. The for...in statement iterates over user-defined properties in addition to the array elements, so if you modify the array's non-integer or non-positive properties (e.g. by adding a "foo" property to it or even by adding a method or property to Array.prototype ), the for...in statement will return the name of your user-defined properties in addition to the numeric indexes. Also, because order of iteration is arbitrary, iterating over an array may not visit elements in numeric order. Thus it is better to use a traditional for loop with a numeric index when iterating over arrays. Similar arguments might be used against even using for...in at all (at least without propertyIsEnumerable () or hasOwnProperty() checks), since it will also iterate over Object.prototype (which, though usually discouraged, can, as in the case of Array.prototype, be usefully extended by the user where are no namespacing concerns caused by inclusion of other libraries which might not perform the above checks on such iterations and where they are aware of the effect such extension will have on their own use of iterators such as for...in).
