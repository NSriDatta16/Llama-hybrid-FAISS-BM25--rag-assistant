what are the differences between receptive field (RF) and field-of-views (FOV) in DeepLab papers?

I am learning the deeplab models. However, some concepts in the papers made me confused. Receptive field (RF) and field-of-views (FOV) are two concepts mentioned in the Deeplabv1 paper. I know that receptive field is defined as the region in the input space that a particular CNNâ€™s feature is looking at. What about the field-of-views (FOV)? Are they the same?
