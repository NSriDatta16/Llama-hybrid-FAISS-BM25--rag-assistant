Data that are forced to be positive and are also cut off at the top of the distribution cannot be normal. The flatness of your qq plot at the left represents your positivity constraint, and at the right represents the cutoff at 100 units. These are highly non-normal data. You can do Pearson correlations if you wish, but statistical tests would be meaningless. If you need to work with data scaled that way you need to do a non-parametric test. Even that may pose problems as there seem to be many ties in the data. Also, the values will be highly dependent on the particular maximum value that happened to show up in your data sample. You might reconsider your scaling approach and just use the actual values. A correlation coefficient automatically takes different scales of data into account so there's no need for this type of pre-scaling. A further caution: you seem to be analyzing time series of data. Correlation studies that make sense in other contexts can give misleading results when applied to time series. Taking the time to learn about proper time-series approaches now will save you pain in the future.
