Please state your operating system and version of IIS. You need to grant access to the account that is running the app-pool in IIS. It is usually NT Authority\Network Service, so try granting full control to that account. However, if you are using windows integrated security (and have impersonation=true) on your website, the user that must be granted access, is the user requesting the page. Finally, I really want to discourage you from making a blog system that creates aspx files on the fly. It's simply not the way to do it.
