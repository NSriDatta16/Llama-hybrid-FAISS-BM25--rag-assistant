How to replace new lines by regular expressions

How can I set any quantity of new lines with a regular expression? $var = " some text another text more text "; $search = array(" \s "); $replace = array(" "); $var = str_replace($search, $replace, $var); I need to remove every new line ( \n ), not , between two paragraphs.
