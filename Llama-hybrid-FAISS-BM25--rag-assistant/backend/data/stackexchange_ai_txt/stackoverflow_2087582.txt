Converting std::list to C friendly type

What's the most elegant way to return a std::list object from a shared lib function (implemented by C++ code) to a C consumer? I know for std::vector , we can return the address of the 1st element of the vector and have the consumer treat it as an array, but std::list is implemented as a linked lis.
