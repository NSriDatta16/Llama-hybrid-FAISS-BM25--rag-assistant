It the problem really is memory fragmentation, there is not much you can do about it. But before you give up in despair, try running your app with a execution profiler to see if it is spending a lot of time executing in an unexpected place. It is possible that the slow down is actually due to a problem in your algorithms, and nothing to do with memory fragmentation. As people have already said, J2ME garbage collectors should not suffer from fragmentation issues.
