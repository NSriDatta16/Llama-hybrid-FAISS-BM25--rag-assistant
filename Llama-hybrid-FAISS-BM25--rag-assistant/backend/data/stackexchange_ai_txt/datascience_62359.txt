From a general point of view, CNN does not break the component into subcomponents but rather use shared weights on all the overlapping subcomponents (recpetive fields) to find the same pattern. It is not a divide and conquer algorithm. In general case, CNNs tend to extract local and position-invariant (independently of their position) features, and RNNs tend to find diffenret patterns across the time even if they are far. For example in the case of applying both to natural language, CNNs are good at extracting local and position-invariant features but it does not capture long range semantic dependencies. It just consider local key-phrases. So when the result is determined by the entire sentence or a long-range semantic dependency CNN is not effective as shown in this paper where the authors compared both architechrures on NLP taks.
