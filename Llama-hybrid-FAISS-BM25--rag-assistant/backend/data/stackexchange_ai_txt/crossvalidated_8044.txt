Resources for an R user who must learn SAS

I use R. Every day. I think in terms of data.frames, the apply() family of functions, object-oriented programming, vectorization, and ggplot2 geoms/aesthetics. I just started working for an organization that primarily uses SAS. I know there's a book about learning R for SAS users , but what are some good resources for R users who've never used SAS?
