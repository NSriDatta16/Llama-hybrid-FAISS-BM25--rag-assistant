I would say PrestaShop man, I never heard of Spree, but i take a look at it now, looks interesting. I build eCommerce shops all the time and built all successful ones and I am using PrestaShop. I tried Magento, but it was the biggest pain in the ass ever. It would continuously crash on me and i hated it, But if you were going with a huge project, like a huge site, get a developer and use Magento PrestaShop you can do it on your own or visit my site and i can help you build a nice small eCommerce site that pulls in a yearly salary
