By far the easiest way to add a preloader in as3 is to just have a 'wrapper' swf that loads in your main swf. There's loads of tutorials about this on the net and about using the Loader class in general. There is a much more convoluted method of doing it related to not loading your assets until frame 2 at which point they all have to be on the stage or some such shenanigans that I've never bothered to get working and I would recommend you ignore.
