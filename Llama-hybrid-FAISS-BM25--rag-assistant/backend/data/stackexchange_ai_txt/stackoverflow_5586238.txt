Namespaces are mainly for the benifit of large projects. Since you are working on a "simple project", I suggest that you use a single namespace for the entire application. Since everything in C# must be a type or a member of a type (i.e., there are no global variables or methods), the types that you create (objects, classes, interfaces, enums, etc.) are usually a good-enough organizing feature for a small project. For slightly larger projects, I suggest putting each tier into its own namespace. For even larger projects, namespaces should be a logical grouping of related types or subsystems, according to preference.
