The average variance extracted (AVE) calculated as follows: total of the squared multiple correlations plus the total sum of each variable, then divides it by the number of factors in that variable. In order to get square multiple correlation of each item, you need to find square of each item Standardized Regression Weight / Estimate. AVE- average variance extracted (AVE) should not be less than .05, this is to show that more than half of the variances is observed (Janssens, et. Al). AVE can be calculated by using auto design by James Gaskin by visiting this website , and click on Excel StatTools on the left hand menu, it is an excel file with calculator for calculating AVE, reliability and validity test. You can also view the video on YouTube through this link .
