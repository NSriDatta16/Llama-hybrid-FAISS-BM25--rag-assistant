Options : In your case I'd put BUT this does the same thing as returntype="string" returnformat="plain" + and that's a problem form jQuery point of view because you get ugly JSON even if you use serializeJSON srerialization by columns. You can make JSON string manually through cfloop and concatenation :/ Use cfjson.cfc which overrides serializeJSON Go to Ben Nadel's site and take his toJSON method and modify it somehow to fit your needs Other thing is serializeJSON, returns uppercased keys, so pay attention, use lcase() or write .LIKETHIS in js. PS: Try this for dynamic creaiton of html in jQuery: var someLiElement = $(' ').addClass('custom_class') .text('Foo bar') .attr('id', 'custom_id' + someInteger) then append method to parent element
