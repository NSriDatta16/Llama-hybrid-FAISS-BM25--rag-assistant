It's possible to host the Window. Change A's parent HWND by calling the SetParent function against it. To change the window styles, you need to use the GetWindowLong/SetWindowLong pair to change the attributes that you want to muck with. If this is a third-party application (ie, not yours), then you're probably in for a rough ride, particularly if the window does any theming or anything custom with its window (for example, changes to the drag area, etc).
