Why don't elements pay attention to their absolutely positioned children?

I'm having trouble with some css. Here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/bkVDH/ I'm trying to make #window 's height stem from what's in .content . .content is absolutely positioned, but in a way that you can figure out the height of .wrap if you know the height of the content div. The same is true between .wrap and #window , so I was hoping that since .content has a height due to what's inside of it, #window would to, but it's not working. Is this solvable?
