It depends on the inference you want to make. If you want to predict or describe, the independent logistic regressions are fine. If you want to explain or make a causal inference, the independent regressions are majorly problematic. Decreasing odds ratios with each additional predictor means your predictors are correlated with each other and have the same relationship with the outcome. The c-statistic increases because your model becomes "better" with each additional predictor you include.
