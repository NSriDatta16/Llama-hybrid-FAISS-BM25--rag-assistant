You should try Visual Studio Extension . You are able to use the VS.NET IDE for free , create diagrams, export into xml/webservice/custom format etc. For example, you can create a tool to describe concepts that are specific to how your organization models business processes. If you are building a state chart tool, you can describe what a state is, what properties a state has, what kinds of states exist, how transitions between states are defined, and so on. A state chart that describes the status of contracts in an insurance company is superficially similar to a state chart that describes user interaction among pages on a Web site. However, the underlying concepts between the two state charts will differ significantly. By creating your own domain-specific language and custom-generated designer, you can specify exactly what state chart concepts you need in your tool. Start here .
