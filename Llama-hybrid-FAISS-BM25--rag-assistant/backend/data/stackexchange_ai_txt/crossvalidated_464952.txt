The general recommendation for random forest it to use as many trees as possible. In most cases, with hundreds of trees, you wouldn't be able to understand why did they collectively made the decision that they made. In such case, you would need to use the general interpretability tools such as described in the Interpretable Machine Learning book by Christoph Molnar . Among other things, you can also calculate the feature importance for random forests, but beware since the naive implementations for this are biased .
