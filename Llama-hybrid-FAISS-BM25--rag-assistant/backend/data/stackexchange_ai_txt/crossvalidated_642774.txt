Linear Logistic Regression model

I am working on an exercise question, and I am a bit stuck unsure on how to proceed. I was given the data below and asked to graphically display the relationship between dose and kill rate. Using R, I created a data frame to represent the values from the table with the following commands, dose % mutate(kills = kills, beetles=total_beetles, killrate=kills/beetles) I then displayed the relationship between dose and kill rate graphically using a facet wrap to view the insecticides as well. ggplot(data=beetles.df, mapping=aes(x=dose, y = killrate, color=insecticides)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(vars(insecticides)) Now for this exercise question, I was asked to, plot the linear logistic fitted curve for each of the insecticides plus the combination, but I am not sure I can plot a logistic curve in this case since wouldn't my response variable have to be binary to apply a logistic curve. I am just a bit confused maybe on the wording of this question.
