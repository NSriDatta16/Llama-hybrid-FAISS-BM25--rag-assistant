The average (mean) $\mu_1$ is the first moment of the distribution $f(x)$: $$\mu_1=\int xf(x)dx$$ There's an infinite number of moments $\mu_k$: $$\mu_k=\int x^kf(x)dx$$ Knowing the distribution includes knowing the average. Since the argument is that it's better to know more than less, we're told to better know the whole distribution than just its mean (average)
