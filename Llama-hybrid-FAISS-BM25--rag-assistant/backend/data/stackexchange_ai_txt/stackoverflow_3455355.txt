Is it possible to customise the ugly little Flash "Local Settings" dialog?

I've got a simple question that I just KNOW won't be possible, but here goes: Is it possible in ActionScript to customise the look of the very un-user friendly Flash settings dialog that pops up allowing the user to give permissions for network/camera/storage access? It makes me crazy that I can make a beautifully crafted Flash app which needs to access to some local resources, with the user's permission, and that God-awful little box appears. To be clear, I have no problem with WHAT it's doing, just how it LOOKS. I want to skin it myself. This is an example of what I mean: I've run some focus testing, and users feel intimidated by this thing; they think the site is trying to do something spamful. My only "solution" has been to try to educate the users with a help button which has a snapshot of the dialog telling them what to do with it. Not ideal. Anyway, it's a rant + question, so any help would be appreciated. Cheers, Shane
