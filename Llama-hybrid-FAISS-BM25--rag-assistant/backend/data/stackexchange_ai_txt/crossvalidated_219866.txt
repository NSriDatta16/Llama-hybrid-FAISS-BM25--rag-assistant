I think I got the answer by myself but wish some experts can confirm. The confusion is that, in CVX book we are converting one optimization problem with constraints to another optimization problem without constraints and solve the dual problem . But in PCA optimization we cannot. For example, page 227, we convert $$ \underset{x}{\text{minimize}}~~ x^\top x \\ \text{s.t.}~~~~~~ Ax=b $$ into maximize the dual function $g(v)=-(1/4)v^\top A A^\top v -b^\top v$, which is $$ \underset{x}{\text{maximize}}~~\left(-(1/4)v^\top A A^\top v -b^\top v \right)\\ $$ In PCA optimization problem, problem has Lagrangian (for equality constraint we can use $-\lambda$) $$ \mathcal{L}(\mathbf w,\lambda)=\mathbf w^\top \mathbf{Cw}-\lambda(\mathbf w^\top \mathbf w-1) $$ For fixed $\lambda$, we get partial derivative and set to $\mathbf 0$. $$ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf w}=\mathbf 0=2\mathbf {Cw}-2\lambda\mathbf w $$ which is the eigenvector equation $$ \mathbf {Cw}=\lambda\mathbf w $$ As pointed out by Matthew Gunn in the comment, PCA problem the objective is not convex see this discussion . Therefore we should not try to minimize dual function to solve the original problem.
