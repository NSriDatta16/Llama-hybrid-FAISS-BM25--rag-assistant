Dividing the cable in sections is not the only possibility. A natural approach for this problem is through a stochastic point process indexed by the abscissa $x$ along the cable's path which can be used as a 'time'. The Poisson Process is a good candidate: the breakage rate is given by the the intensity (or rate ) $\lambda(x)$ of the process, which here is the probability of break by unit of cable length around $x$. This intensity can be constant or piecewise constant and can be related then to some area predictors as cited by Robert Jones. It can also be related if needed to continuous predictors such as the cable depth. For a fixed period of time, say a year, a PP can describe the locations of the breaks. The intensity function $\lambda(x)$ is not unlike a probability density, and will have to be integrated with respect to $x$ for most computations. A more sophisticated version would use a spatio-temporal point process with intensity $\lambda(x,\,t)$ related to the time $t$ and to the abscissa $x$.
