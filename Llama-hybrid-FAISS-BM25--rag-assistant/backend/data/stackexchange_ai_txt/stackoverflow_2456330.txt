How to organize infinite while loop in SQL Server?

I want to use infinite WHILE loop in SQL Server 2005 and use BREAK keyword to exit from it on certain condition. while true does not work, so I have to use while 1=1 . Is there a better way to organize infinite loop ? I know that I can use goto , but while 1=1 begin ... end looks better structurally.
