There is a minor typo in one of the equations: $$\nabla_{\theta} \log p(x ; \theta) = \frac{\nabla_{\theta} p(x ; \theta)}{p(x ; \theta)} $$ Nevertheless, I think the confusion is because you are ignoring the effect of the term $p(x;\theta)$ . Consider a simple example, the gradient of the function $x^2 + y^2$ averaged over all the points on the unit circle is zero i.e $2x \hat{i} + 2y\hat{j} $ average over the unit circle is zero vector. However, the same gradient when weighted by a term, say, $\frac{1}{x}$ is non-zero i.e $2 \hat{i} + 2\frac{y}{x}\hat{j} $ averaged over unit circle has positive component along x-axis. Notice that in both the cases, the gradients are parallel
