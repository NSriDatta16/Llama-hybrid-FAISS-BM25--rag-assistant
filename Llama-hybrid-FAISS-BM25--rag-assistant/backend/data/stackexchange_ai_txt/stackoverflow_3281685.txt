Tree structures in a nosql database

I'm developing an application for Google App Engine which uses BigTable for its datastore. It's an application about writing a story collaboratively. It's a very simple hobby project that I'm working on just for fun. It's open source and you can see it here: http://story.multifarce.com/ The idea is that anyone can write a paragraph, which then needs to be validated by two other people. A story can also be branched at any paragraph, so that another version of the story can continue in another direction. Imagine the following tree structure: Every number would be a paragraph. I want to be able to select all the paragraphs in every unique story line. Basically, those unique story lines are (2, 7, 2); (2, 7, 6, 5); (2, 7, 6, 11) and (2, 5, 9, 4). Ignore that the node "2" appears twice, I just took a tree structure diagram from Wikipedia. I also made a diagram of a proposed solution: https://docs.google.com/drawings/edit?id=1fdUISIjGVBvIKMSCjtE4xFNZxiE08AoqvJSLQbxN6pc&hl=en How can I set up a structure is performance efficient both for writing, but most importantly for reading?
