How to handle the CEO expectations from a company that's new to data science?

I'm new here. I'm about to have a final interview for a data scientist position for a company (it's in the e-commerce field) that is new for data science. It's a pretty new position for the company, and from the interviews I had so far, I noticed that they don't fully understand what they want from a data scientist. They barely know what data science is. I explained them the "standard" data science workflow (Ask A Question, Get the Data, Explore the Data, Model the data and Communicate the data). But I don't think they got it. I want to set the proper expectations, so the company and I can agree on my job description, and what they can expect from me in one month, tree months, six and twelve months. So, how do you handle the expectations(specially the CEO) from a company that's new to data science?
