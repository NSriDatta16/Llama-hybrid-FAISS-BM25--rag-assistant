Scientific Fortran Compile Error

I'm working on scientific modelling program and have yet to get my program to even compile. I haven't touched the code which my professor insists previously worked, only the makefile. After many attempts, the furthest I've gotten was this error: Error on line 1112: Declaration error for xxmf: adjustable dimension on non-argument upcase: intrpl: splin: mtrnpr: My Professor insists that it's merely a compiling problem and that there should be some option involving global variables that I can use that'll fix this. The closest I've found is using the option -Mipa=safeall in the makefile, but I'm not sure if I'm putting it in the right place or if it made a difference since I still get the same error.
