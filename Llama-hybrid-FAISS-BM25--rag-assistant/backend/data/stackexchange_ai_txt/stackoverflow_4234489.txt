Smooth grabbing

I've made a simple grabbing demo page . It doesn't have any easing/acceleration. I would like to do the same easing/acceleration as on kulesh.info (Flash website) using JavaScript. How can I do that? Any examples of smooth grabbing (scrolling, dragging) in JavaScript would be helpful as well as a language agnostic algorithm.
