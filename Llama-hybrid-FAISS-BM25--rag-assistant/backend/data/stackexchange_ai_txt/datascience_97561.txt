About the Feature selection in timestamped from industrial process

We are working with timestamp data from an industrial process, so I want to make a linear model for target value based on some measured values. There is a high probability that the lagged values of features contribute to the model. There are some redundant and some irrelevant features in the dataset. I want to do feature selection. So, These are my question : I want to remove the redundant features using correlation matrix values. What is a good threshold for kipping/removing features? For example, 0.95 or 0.995? Is there any good reference? What is the best method for detecting relevant/irrelevant features in timestamped data? The data is not a classical time series. However, there are exogenous inputs.
