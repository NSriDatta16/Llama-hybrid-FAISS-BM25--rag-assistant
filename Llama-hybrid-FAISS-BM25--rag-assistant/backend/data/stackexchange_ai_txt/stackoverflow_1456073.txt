I'm not sure about the leak, but your resetTable() function is very inefficient. Try fixing those problems first and see where you end up. Don't append to the DOM in a loop. If you must do DOM manipulation, then append to a document fragment, and then move that fragment to the DOM. But innerHTML is faster than DOM manipulation anyway, so use that if you can. Store jQuery sets into local variables - no need to re-run the selector every time. Also store repeated references in a local variable. When iterating over a collection of any sort, store the length in a local variable, too. New code: Test Page $(function() { var $tbody = $("#content tbody"); function kickoff() { $.getJSON("test.php", resetTable); } function resetTable(rows) { var html = '' , i = 0 , l = rows.length , row; for ( ; i " + " " + row.mpe_name + " " + " " + row.bin + " " + " " + row.request_time + " " + " " + row.filtered_delta + " " + " " + row.failed_delta + " " + " "; } $tbody.html( html ); setTimeout(kickoff, 2000); } kickoff(); }); MPE Bin When Filtered Failed References: jQuery Peformance Rules Speed Up Your Javascript
