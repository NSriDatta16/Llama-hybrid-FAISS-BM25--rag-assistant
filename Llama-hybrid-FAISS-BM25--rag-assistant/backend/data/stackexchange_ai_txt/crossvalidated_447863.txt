Log-Transforming target var for training a Random Forest Regressor

I have a variable that I want to model, which has a skewed distribution. Log transforming the var gives is a normal-like distribution. When training a Random Forest regressor on the non-transformed var, I get worse performance than when I log-tranform the var. I am bit puzzled about whether I should do this knowning that the random forest regressor is predicting the mean of the leafs. If trained on a log tranformed var, that means that the prediction is the mean of the logs of the values in the leafs. Which (when tranformed back) is not equal to the mean of the real values. Any opinion?
