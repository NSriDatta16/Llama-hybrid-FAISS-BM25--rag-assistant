Named Entity Recognition using NLTK. Relevance of extracted keywords

I was checking out the Named Entity Recognition feature of NLTK. Is it possible to find out which of the extracted keywords is most relevant to the original text? Also, is it possible to know the type (Person / Organization) of the extracted keywords?
