I understand you must have researched before opting the regression model.But I want to highlight one thing here that since that data is time series one,we have to be more careful here and use the models which takes the account of moving average and other time series factors. Also,cross validation is different for timeseries analysis. Having said that please use other models like ARIMA or SARIMA for your time series if your objective is to have higher accuracy.
