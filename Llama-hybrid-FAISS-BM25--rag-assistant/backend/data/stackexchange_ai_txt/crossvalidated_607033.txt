Multifractional polynomial with mixed-effects logistic model

Dataset I am working on a dataset collected from more than 20 hospitals. I used the glmer command to estimate a mixed-effects logistic regression model with the following as patient-level predictors: age (patient's age; a continuous variable), cci (Charlson Comorbidity Index; a continuous variable), sex (patient's sex; man vs. woman), race (patient's race; Asian vs. Black vs. South Asian vs. White), and htn (has hypertension vs. no hypertension). I used the hospital variable (the hospital that recruited patients) to estimate the random intercept. Problem My code for mixed-model (worked very smoothly): mixed_died30in Then I used the mfp command: mfp_died30in The following error appeared: Error in fixed.only && random.only : invalid 'x' type in 'x && y' In addition: Warning message: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt$par, ctrl = control$checkConv, : Model is nearly unidentifiable: large eigenvalue ratio - Rescale variables? Questions Does the mfp command from the mfp package in R support mixed-effect models? Is (are) there any problem(s) in my code?
