Magento Forms Not Posting in Custom Module

I created a new module and a new top level menu item in the Admin section. I also created a few views in the templates/[mymodule] folder, with forms I want to use in my app. The purpose of the module is to contain all the custom functionality for my client's store, firstly a small form to edit product recurring-delivery subscriptions on-the-fly. I successfully created a non-EAV data model from a multi-table join, and populated the default view (called in index/index and loaded through the menu item) with the records. Next step, to install the "search by email address" form. My form consists of getUrl('editsubs/index/post') ?>"> Search by Email: var searchForm = new varienForm('search_form'); and I have verified the URL is properly formed and it is trying to post; however the URL editsubs/index/post is not found and Magento redirects to the dashboard. Could missing items in config.xml cause this behavior or is there some other reason this might be occuring? Something I'm overlooking? Magento version CE 1.4.1.1. I'm purposely keeping this very bare-bones and NOT building it on top of SaRP or using their forms. Routers section of config is: admin Kindbars_Editsubscr2 editsubs Thanks in advance!! Kris
