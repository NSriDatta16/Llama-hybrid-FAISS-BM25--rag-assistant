Interestingly I just finished reading PeopleWare , and the authors strongly discourage individual metrics being made visible to superiors (even direct managers), but that aggregate metrics should be very visible. As far as code specific metrics I think it's good for a team to know the state of the code at the current time, and to know the trends affecting the code as it matures and grows. The question is obviously not focussed on .NET, but I think the .NET product NDepend has done a lot of work to define and document common metrics that are useful. The documentation section on metrics is educational reading, even if you're not doing .NET.
