How to make an email notifier like google calendar?

I am using asp.net mvc 2.0 C# .NET 4.0 ms sql server 2005 iis 7.0 I want to make an email notifier system just like many sites have such as google. I want user to be able to set a reminder date and when that date is hit a email is sent to them. I am not sure how to do this. I heard of a couple ways but have not found any tutorials on how to do them. Windows scheduler through ms sql server (think sql server agent?) With the windows scheduler I don't think it would work on a shared hosting environment. I would prefer if it did but if there is a big difference then I can live with out that ability. I also want in the very near future to support SMS messages so the solution should be able to expand to work with that as well if possible.
