How can I merge many data frames from csv files when the ID column is implied?

I'd like to merge a bunch of data frames together (because it seems many operations are easier if you're only dealing w/ one, but correct me if I'm wrong). Currently I have one data frame like this: ID, var1, var2 A, 2, 2 B, 4, 5 . . Z, 3, 2 Each ID is on a single row w/ several single measurements I also have a csv file w/ repeated measurement for each ID, like: filename = ID_B.csv time, var4, var5 0, 1, 2 1, 4, 5 2, 1, 6 ... What I'd like is: ID, time, va1, var2, var4, var5 ... B, 0, 4, 5, 1, 2, B, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, B, 2, 4, 5, 1, 6, ... I don't really care about the column order. The only solution I can think of is to add the ID column to each csv file then loop through them calling merge() several times. Is there a more elegant approach?
