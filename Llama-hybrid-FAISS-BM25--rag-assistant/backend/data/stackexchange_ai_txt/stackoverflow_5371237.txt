postgresql: how list indexed columns?

There is a lot of information, that can be retrieved from information_schema and pg_catalog in postgresql . I would like to retrieve information about columns indexed by a certain index, similar to what I would achieve with pragma index_info( ) in sqlite3. How can this be achieved without parsing create index statement?
