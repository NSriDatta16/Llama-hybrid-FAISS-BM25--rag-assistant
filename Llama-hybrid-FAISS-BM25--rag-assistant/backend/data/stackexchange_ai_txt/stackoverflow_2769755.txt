It might be worth it if your database is I/O bound. If it's CPU-bound, a RAM drive will make no difference. But first things first, you should make sure that your database is properly tuned, you can get huge performance gains that way without losing any guarantees. Even a RAM-based database will perform badly if it's not properly tuned. See PostgreSQL wiki on this , mainly shared_buffers, effective_cache_size, checkpoint_*, default_statistics_target Second, if you want to avoid synchronizing disk buffers on every commit (like codeka explained in his comment), disable the synchronous_commit configuration option. When your machine loses power, this will lose some latest transactions, but your database will still be 100% consistent. In this mode, RAM will be used to buffer all writes, including writes to the transaction log. So with very rare checkpoints, large shared_buffers and wal_buffers, it can actually approach speeds close to those of a RAM-drive. Also hardware can make a huge difference. 15000 RPM disks can, in practice, be 3x as fast as cheap drives for database workloads. RAID controllers with battery-backed cache also make a significant difference. If that's still not enough, then it may make sense to consider turning to volatile storage.
