Good detailed coverage of cointegration and cointegration testing is available in Chapter 12 of Zivot & Wang's "Modeling Financial Time Series with S-PLUS" (2006). I will base my answer on it, but I will skip most of the details that are not directly relevant with regards to the original question. Engle & Granger's cointegration testing procedure consists of two stages: Obtaining the cointegration residual $\varepsilon_t=y_t-\beta x_t$ Testing $\varepsilon_t$ for a unit root. The stage relevant for your question is the second one. It is common to use the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test in this stage. The word "augmented" indicates that the test regression may include lags of the dependent variable (with $\delta$ coefficients in front): $$ \Delta \varepsilon_t = \alpha + \beta t + \gamma \varepsilon_{t-1} + \delta_1 \Delta \varepsilon_{t-1} + \dotsc + \delta_{p-1} \Delta \varepsilon_{t-p+1} + u_t $$ ($\alpha$ and $\beta t$ may or may not be included depending on the first stage of the Engle & Granger procedure; see the reference above for details.) The motivation for including the lags of the dependent variable can be found in Chapter 4 of the same textbook. Essentially, they are there to make the test regression better represent the underlying process being tested for a unit root. In my understanding, the phrase a lag is used in the ADF test, say of length $n$ means that there are $n$ lags of the dependent variable in the ADF test equation, i.e. $p-1=n$ or $p=n+1$. That is, you have an equation of the form $$ \Delta \varepsilon_t = \alpha + \beta t + \gamma \varepsilon_{t-1} + \delta_1 \Delta \varepsilon_{t-1} + \dotsc + \delta_{n} \Delta \varepsilon_{n} + u_t $$ (with or without $\alpha$ and $\beta t$.) Meanwhile, the first stage of the Engle & Granger procedure is not affected by the quoted statement and remains as indicated above.
