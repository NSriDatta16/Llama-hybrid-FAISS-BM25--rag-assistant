Can you find the posterior mode of an unknown distribution without MCMC?

I was wondering if you wanted to compute the MAP estimate of an unknown posterior distribution, is there a non-sampling based method that would suffice? As in, if you donâ€™t need to know anything more than the posterior mode, what would be the method to approximate this? Two related questions Why is MCMC needed when estimating a parameter using MAP and Are MCMC based methods appropriate when Maximum a-posteriori estimation is available? but they don't quite answer my question.
