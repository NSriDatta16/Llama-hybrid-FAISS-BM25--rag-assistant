Getting Arabic text from .txt file?

Hey, I have Arabic text in a txt file that I would like to show in a simple EditText, Though when I do that here is what I get: http://i55.tinypic.com/66g09z.png Here is the code I use to get the text from the .txt file: txt1 =(EditText) findViewById(R.id.EditText01); try{ File f = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"/1.txt"); FileInputStream fileIS = new FileInputStream(f); BufferedReader buf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fileIS)); String readString = new String(); //just reading each line while((readString = buf.readLine())!= null){ txt1.setText(txt1.getText().toString()+readString); } } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e){ e.printStackTrace(); } } How can I get proper Arabic letters into the EditText? Thanks
