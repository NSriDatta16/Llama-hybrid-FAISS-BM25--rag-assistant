Comparing Factorie and Figaro languages for Statistical Relational Learning

I am looking to implement statistical relational learning, preferably in a modern programming language, and came across Factorie and Figaro for Scala. But most resources online that compare these are a little outdated, since these are under active development. How does Factorie compare against Figaro now? (and how do these compare against the C++ based Alchemy ?) Some features that I would like to seem compared on are: Directed (Bayesian Logic) and Undirected (Markov Logic) graphical models Inductive and deductive inference algorithms for first order logic Learning algorithms Support for Dynamic, time-series algorithms (for first order logical inference) Support for higher order (probabilistic) logic
