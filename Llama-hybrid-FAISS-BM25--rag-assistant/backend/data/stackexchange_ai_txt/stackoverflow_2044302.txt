If my assumptions on what you want are correct, then I see two ways of doing it. The direct way: SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(ms, T1.my_time, T2.my_time)) FROM My_Table T1 INNER JOIN My_Table T2 ON T2.my_time > T1.my_time WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM My_Table T3 WHERE (T3.my_time > T1.my_time AND T3.my_time The tricky way: SELECT DATEDIFF(ms, MIN(my_time), MAX(my_time))/(COUNT(DISTINCT my_time) - 1) FROM My_Table After all, the average differences is just the total difference divided by the number of divisions into which you're breaking it down. You'll need to add WHERE clauses for the date range if you want to limit by that and you will need to account for the possibility of divide by zero in the second query.
