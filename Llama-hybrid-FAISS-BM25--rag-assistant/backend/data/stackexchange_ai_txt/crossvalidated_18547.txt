In some cases one knows a theoretical model which can used to test your hypothesis. In my world tis "knowledge" is often absent and one must resort to statistical techniques that can be classified as exploratory data analysis which summarizes what follows.When analyzing time series data that are non-stationary i.e. has autocorrelative properties simple cross-correlation tests are often misleading insofar as false positives can be easily found. One of the earliest analysis of this is found in Yule, G.U, 1926, "Why do we sometimes get nonsense correlations between time series? A study in sampling and the nature of time series", Journal of the Royal Statistical Society 89, 1â€“64 . Alternatively when one or more of the series themselves have been effected by exceptional activity ( see whuber "the sudden setback in Cohort B at 2001 ) which can effectively hide significant relationships. Now detecting a relationship between time series extends to examining not only contemporaneous relationships but possible lagged relationships. Continuing, if either series has been effected by anomalies ( one-time events ) then we must robustify our analysis by adjusting for these one-time distortions. The literature of time series points out how to identify the relationship via pre-whitening in order to more clearly identify structure. Pre-whitening adjusts for intra-correlative structure prior to identifying inter-correlative structure. Notice the key word was identifying structure. This approach easily leads to the following "useful model" : Y(T) = -194.45 +[X1(T)][(+ 1.2396+ 1.6523B** 1)] COHORTA +[X2(T)][(- 3.3924)] :PULSE 3 +[X3(T)][(- 2.4760)] :LEVEL SHIFT 30 reflecting persistant unusal activity +[X4(T)][(+ 1.1453)] :PULSE 29 +[X5(T)][(- 2.7249)] :PULSE 11 +[X6(T)][(+ 1.5248)] :PULSE 27 +[X7(T)][(+ 2.1361)] :PULSE 4 +[X8(T)][(+ 1.6395)] :PULSE 13 +[X9(T)][(- 1.6936)] :PULSE 12 +[X10(T)[(- 1.6996)] :PULSE 19 +[X11(T)[(- 1.2749)] :PULSE 10 +[X12(T)[(- 1.2790)] :PULSE 17 + [A(T)] which suggests a contemporary relationship of 1.2936 and a lagged effect of 1.6523. Note that there were a number of years where unusual activity was identified viz. (1975,2001,1983,1999,1976,1985,1984,1991 and 1989). The adjustments for the years allows us to more clearly assess the relationship between these two series. In terms of making a forecast MODEL EXPRESSED AS AN XARMAX Y[t] = a[1]Y[t-1] + ... + a[p]Y[t-p] + w[0]X[t-0] + ... + w[r]X[t-r] + b[1]a[t-1] + ... + b[q]a[t-q] + constant THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE CONSTANT IS: -194.45 COHORTA 0 1.239589 X( 39 ) * 78.228616 = 96.971340 COHORTA 1 1.652332 X( 38 ) * 77.983000 = 128.853835 I~L00030 0 -2.475963 X( 39 ) * 1.000000 = -2.475963 NET PREDICTION FOR Y( 39 )= 28.894826 Four coefficients is all that is required to make a forecast and of course a prediction for CohortA at time period 39 (78.228616) obtained from the ARIMA model for Cohorta.
