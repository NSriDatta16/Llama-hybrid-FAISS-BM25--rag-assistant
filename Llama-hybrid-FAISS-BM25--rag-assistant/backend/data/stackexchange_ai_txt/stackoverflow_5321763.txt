I would have thought that retrieval of the wsdls and schemas should be doable using a simple HTTP GET process either manually or via a simple code call (ant task etc) rather than that rather convoluted process you described. Having said that I usually deal with web services that have a release cycle and therefore I get usually get given the wsdls and schemas manually. If you have to re-get the wsdls and schemas on every build I would be inclined to put the get process into the build as a preliminary step (in maven it would be the initialize phase and I would look at using the GET ant task ) followed by the wsdl2java step (in maven I usually hook the wsdl2java ant task to the generate-sources phase).
