To read lines of text from a file, you can wrap a FileReader in a BufferedReader . You can use String.split() to split a line of text into tokens around spaces, and you can use Integer.parseInt() to turn a String representing a valid integer into an int . You can find the maximum and minimum of a list of int s in linear time (examining each int once) using two int s worth of storage. That should be enough to get you started. Edit : just realized those were supposed to be on separate lines (you should use the formatting tools when posting). String.split() will be unnecessary, then.
