For Windows... technically, maybe being able to run your own app when a drag is going outside the area of the app. But super complex and challenging. You would need a few things: Elevated SL4 OOB app A COM component on the system, or a native code app embedded in the app that you can execute with parameters about a drag operation, look into isolated storage, etc. You monitor when a drag starts, and then would need to execute your native code app somehow to realize the drag. Even then, I don't think the new app could pick up on the true drag operation.
