Rookie question about non parametric and parametric tests

I am a very rookie statistical test user and I want to better understand how to choose between a non parametric and parametric test based on my data. I read several statistical tests tutorials but I couldn't make any correlation between the examples given and my data, so it was hard to understand the tutorials I read so far. My data is composed by five vectors which represent ten f-measures values of a classification of a set of binary data. Each dimension of the vector represents the f-measure result of each 5x2 cross validation machine learning experiment. My question is: how to choose between a parametric and non parametric test based on my data? also, how to know which test to use? is there any wrong option or it depends on the assumption I give to my data and I am free to decide?
