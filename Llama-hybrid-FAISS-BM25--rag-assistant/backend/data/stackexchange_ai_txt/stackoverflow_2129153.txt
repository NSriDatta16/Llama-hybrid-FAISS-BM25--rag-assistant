The following code does what the OP wants: #include #include using namespace std; int main ( int argc, char ** argv ) { cout It allows drag and drop, but doesn't use the dropped file name in the file open. When you drop a file in it, you get the message "wrote file" Unfortunately, at the moment I have no idea where it wrote the file - not in the current directory, definitely. Just going to do a search... Edit: It creates it in your Documents and Settings directory. So to put it in the current directory, you probably need to explicitly prefix it with "./", but I havent't tested this - I leave it as an exercise for the reader :-)
