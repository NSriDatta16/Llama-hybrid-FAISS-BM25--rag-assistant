Is there a problem having too many of the same entries in your response variable?

I'm building a predictive logistic regression model on whether someone books an Airbnb and the independent variables are things like how close the Airbnb is to the center of the city, it's ratings and price. I've still very new at statistics and maybe I've just missed the answer to this, but I'm wondering if there's an issue when 90% of my entries for if they booked is 0 (failure) and 10% are 1 (success). Cause after splitting my data set into a training set (80% of data) and testing set (20% of data), it just seems like after I build my model and use predict function on my testing set with my training set model it just predicts everything to be 0 because there are just so many entries of that. So even though my classification rate is high I feel my model isn't really predicting anything with the independent variables and I'm only really learning anything about the independent variables from doing summary() of the model. Any resources or suggestion to help my understanding would be appreciated.
