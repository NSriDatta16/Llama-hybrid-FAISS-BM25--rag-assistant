I would look elsewhere for signs you need to switch. For all the hype--and I'm a big supporter of OOP--code reuse is often only marginally better with OOP languages. OOP is simple another tool to help organize your code, like functions in the past. It's a great and useful tool. But the main benefits are making it easier to write and maintain your code. If it were me and moving to OOP required almost a complete rewrite, I'd hold off until some more material benefits of the switch became apparent. If your code works, I don't know why you'd rewrite it.
