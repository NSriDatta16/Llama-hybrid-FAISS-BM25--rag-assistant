Web Start Application built on NetBeans Platform doesn't create desktop shortcut & start menu item

I've created a NetBeans Platform application that is launched using Java Web Start. I built the WAR file using the 'Build JNLP Application'-command in Netbeans 6.8. I've added a desktop shortcut and menu item to the JNLP file, but for some reason, these are not created when the application is launched. However, when I go to: Control Panel -> Java -> Temporary Internet Files -> View -> Select my application > Click 'Install shortcuts to the selected application' the desktop and menu shortcuts are created correctly. Also, in the Java Console, the Shortcut Creation option is set to the following (the default, I presume): Prompt user if hinted Below is a snippet of my JNLP file: ${app.title} SomeVendor (Pty) Ltd Some description ... I'm stumped. Does anybody have an explanation for this? Thanks PS This is on both Windows XP and Windows 7. NetBeans version: 6.8
