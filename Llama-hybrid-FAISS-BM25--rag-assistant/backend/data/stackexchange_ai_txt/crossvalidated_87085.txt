The following answer is based on: (1) my interpretation of Willett and Singer (1988) Another Cautionary Note about R-squared: It's use in weighted least squates regression analysis. The American Statistician. 42(3). pp236-238, and (2) the premise that robust linear regression is essentially weighted least squares regression with the weights estimated by an iterative process. The formula I gave in the question for r2w needs a small correction to correspond to equation 4 in Willet and Singer (1988) for r2wls: the SSt calculation should also use a weighted mean: the correction is SSt What is the meaning of this (corrected) weighted r-squared? Willett and Singer interpret it as: "the coefficient of determination in the transformed [weighted] dataset. It is a measure of the proportion of the variation in weighted Y that can be accounted for by weighted X, and is the quantity that is output as R2 by the major statistical computer packages when a WLS regression is performed". Is it meaningful as a measure of goodness of fit? This depends on how it is presented and interpreted. Willett and Singer caution that it is typically quite a bit higher than the r-squared obtained in ordinary least squares regression, and the high value encourages prominent display... but this display may be deceptive IF it is interpreted in the conventional sense of r-squared (as the proportion of unweighted variation explained by a model). Willett and Singer propose that a less 'deceptive' alternative is pseudoR2wls (their equation 7), which is equivalent to my function r2 in the original question. In general, Willett and Singer also caution that it is not good to rely on any r2 (even their pseudor2wls) as a sole measure of goodness of fit. Despite these cautions, the whole premise of robust regression is that some cases are judged 'not as good' and don't count as much in the model fitting, and it may be good to reflect this in part of the model assessment process. The weighted r-squared described, can be one good measure of goodness of fit - as long as the correct interpretation is clearly given in the presentation and it is not relied on as the sole assessment of goodness of fit.
