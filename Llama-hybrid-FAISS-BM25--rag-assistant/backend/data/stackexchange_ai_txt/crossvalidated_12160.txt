Multiple dependant variables in logistic regression

I have a binary dependent variable, say food security status, where 0 = food insecure and 1 = food secure , and this response variable is recorded for two categories of households, small farmers and land less rural house holds . Both these household categories may have food secure or food insecure. These dependant variables are a function of some common independant variables. I want to check which independant variable has more impact on farmers or landless households' food security. Is it possible to include it in one logistic regression model? Or do I need to run separate models for farmers and landless households?
