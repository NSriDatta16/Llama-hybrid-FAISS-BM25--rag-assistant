The short answer is that, for a transaction to be durable, the log file has to be written to stable storage before changes to the database are written to disk. Stable storage is more complicated than you might think. Disks, for example, are not usually considered to be stable storage. (Not by people who write code for transactional database engines, anyway.) It see how a particular open source dbms writes to stable storage, you'll need to read the source code. PostgreSQL source code is online . (File is xlog.c) Don't know about MySQL source.
