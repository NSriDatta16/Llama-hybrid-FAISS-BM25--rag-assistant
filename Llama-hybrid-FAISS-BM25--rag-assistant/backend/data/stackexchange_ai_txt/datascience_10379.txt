I don't think you need prior knowledge like SVM and MLP. In fact, reinforcement is another type of machine learning beside supervised learning, which including SVM, and unsupervised learning, which includes MLP. Reinforcement learning is actually very different from the latter two, as it is learning for interaction (agent-environment interaction). The trade-off between exploration and exploit is the key point. Markov decision process is the basic framework for reinforcement learning, which is very different from the other two types of learning. I highly recommend the textbook " Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction " by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto". That's the book I am reading now. The language is very easy to follow and the content is comprehensive.
