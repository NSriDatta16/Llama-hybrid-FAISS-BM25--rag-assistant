Run SQL Server Agent and Database Engine as Network Service or System

It's been a long time since I've had to install SQL Server. I'm doing it for a source control system called Plastic SCM on my system. I'm about to finish the wizard asking me a plethora of questions, and I'm at the Service Accounts tab under Server Configuration , it's asking me if I want to use NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM to run either SQL Server Agent or SQL Server Database Engine . My question is, what is the different between these accounts? Thanks
