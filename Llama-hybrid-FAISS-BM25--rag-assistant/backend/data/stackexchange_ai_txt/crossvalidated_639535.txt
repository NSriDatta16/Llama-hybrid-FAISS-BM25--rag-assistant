Answer I'm not sure which text you are referring to, but I think the answer is fairly straightforward. Our $x_1$ here clearly has a consistent positive linear effect on $y$ and has a very narrow credible interval band around the regression line, so it's not surprising that this is a statistically significant effect. We can't say that about the other two. For $x_3$ , the effect is nearly nonexistent, as it only influences $y$ at $x_3$ 's minimum and maximum values. For $x_4$ , the line is literally flat, and that should pretty clearly indicate that it doesn't have any influence on $y$ . Usually if a GAM smooth has a statistically significant effect on the outcome, the spline fit will either be linear and strong enough in magnitude to become statistically significant, or it will be so curvilinear that it becomes pretty clear that the predictors have some influence on $y$ , just not in as straightforward a sense as linear fits.
