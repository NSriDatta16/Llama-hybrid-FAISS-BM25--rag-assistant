I don't think this answer will suffice, but I will try and draw your attention to some potential issues. To begin, I don't see any issues with your code other than efficiency concerns, but I could be wrong. I recommended some R code below to help with this explanation. For example, I do not recommend adjusting the time configuration on the minimum wage ratio (i.e., minwage ) before loading it into R. Different software packages have different default behavior, so try executing all your code in R, if possible. Speaking of default behavior, typically when we lag a variable we lose a time period. Unless your example data hasn't been preprocessed in Excel, the data frame should show "NA" values in 2006 within each country (e.g., Belgium, Czechia, etc.). Again, the lag operator should respect the panel structure. Since the dplyr and plm packages tend to mask each other, I used plm::lag(minwage, k = 1) to remove any ambiguity. Note also how I dropped country and year as the model will 'sweep out' the country- and year-specific effects. The plm() function recognizes the redundancies and will drop them for you. Moreover, I don't see any issues with manually extracting the standard errors and storing them into a list-like structure. To save some extra keystrokes, try the coeftest() function. The result is a neat coefficient matrix with columns containing the estimates, standard errors, test statistics, and $p$ -values. The results should be equivalent. Suggested Code # library(plm) # library(lmtest) model Other Considerations The model only considers the effect of lagged wages on unemployment, ignoring all other variables . Omitting other relevant covariates (e.g., eligible working age population) will bias your estimate. Further, the large standard error suggests the estimate is likely to be on either side of zero. Even in the face of elevated uncertainty, you're making statements about the direction and magnitude of the relationship. Don't do this. The low $R^{2}$ also suggests a poor fit. Lastly, I wouldn't recommend selecting a model to support your a prior assumptions about the effects of raising the minimum wage. The model, as specified, should have been considered before starting the analysis. Given your comments, it appears you've embarked on a scientific journey with the results already predetermined. Either live with the results, or rerun your experiment using new data. I worry you might try running endless strings of models until your confidence interval is completely to the left of zero.
