as a suggestion, you may want to consider lua for scripting, its pretty fast, and can be used in production systems and very easy to bind to c. do you need a relational database? quite often on embedded systems you use a simple storage system, like a file based system. in general the more flexibility you want, the more overhead you will need. simplest, treat entire memory as a large sequential file. slightly more complicated, an allocation table to keep track of multiple files and so on... Perhaps a key / value store would give you the best compromise for query and storage.
