How to transform test set to the PCA space of the training set, if the features in train and test are different?

I'm working on a text classification project, and I want to reduce the tf-idf matrix dimension with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then train my model with this, which is pretty straightforward. But once I do that with my training set; how do I transform my test set to the same space to where the training set was mapped? This would be simple if I were working with data where the features are fixed (by just multiplying the component matrix times the test data matrix), but in text analysis, the features change every time a document is added. So my question is: how to do this with text classification? Or should I try another approach?
