Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test and Lag Length

In R, using the package tseries , one uses the command adf.test for the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. However, this assumes a certain number of lags, unless specified. I have a two-part question: How are the number of lags calculated? (Is this using the Akaike Information Criterion, for instance?) Is it ever possible for the (Augmented) Dickey-Fuller to support different hypotheses based on different lag lengths? e.g.: A time series modeled as an AR(1) may show up as non-stationary, but the same series modeled as an AR(12) is stationary.
