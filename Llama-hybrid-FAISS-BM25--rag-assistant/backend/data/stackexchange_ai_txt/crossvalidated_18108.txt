The easiest answer would seem to be to use web conferencing software such as WebEx. You set up a meeting, everyone signs in from their computer, and whoever the organizer of the meeting is can designate a person as "presenter". That person clicks on a button and everyone can see their desktop. Wikipedia has a comparison page for web conferencing software: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_conferencing_software . I don't know if free/open source is important; there do not seem to be many offerings in that category, but OpenMeetings sounds promising. (I don't have experience with them.)
