FastPass allows you to wait in multiple lines at the same time. It allows you to avoid waiting, but increases the average wait time because the lines effectively get longer. But most people don't spent their entire time going on rides. Some events, like the parades, don't really have a waiting time. By using a fast pass you can go to more of these no-line or short-line events without sacrificing as many long-line rides.
