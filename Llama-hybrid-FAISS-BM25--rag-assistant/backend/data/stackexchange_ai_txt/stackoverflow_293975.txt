How to detect drag operation at windows global scope?

When I drag a folder at the edge of the screen in Windows XP, it becomes a toolbar containing the files in the folder. How can windows detect there is a drag operation? If I want to write an application to detect drag operation in system scope, how can I do this? And another problem: how can I disable this Windows XP function, it is really annoying.
