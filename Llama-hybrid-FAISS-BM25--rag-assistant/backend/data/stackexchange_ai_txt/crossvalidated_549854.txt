There are a few problems with your first paragraph which may make your question difficult to answer. We know that a polynomial can approximate any function. Can it? If you're referring to a Taylor polynomial, then the function must be smooth. Not every function is a smooth function. In binary logistic regression we're trying to fit a decision boundary to our data. This isn't true. Logistic regression seeks to estimate the coefficients for a model $$ p(x) = \dfrac{1}{1 + \exp(-x^T\beta)} $$ There is no decision boundary here, and any cut off is imposed post facto .
