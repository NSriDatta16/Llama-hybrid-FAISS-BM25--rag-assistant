The direct route to getting Excel data into Java is, of course, POI . Very stable, excellent library, and lets you in and the low-level innards of working with Excel. Of note is the Busy Developer's Guide to POI , which should help ease some of the initial pain. If you're more interested in learning POI and doing a simple Java exercise, then this sounds fair enough. The more interesting questions will be how to display the millions of combinations that haven't already occurred, and how to approach this from a data structure point of view (hint: use a mix of hashtable lookups and generation to keep the memory overhead to a minimum). If you want to take this really seriously, ask yourself if an Excel file is a good storage mechanism for this kind of data. That's really what you're doing: using Excel as a data store. There are better alternatives.
