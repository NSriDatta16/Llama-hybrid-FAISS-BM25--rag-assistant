In Visual Studio, go to Tools -> External Tools... Click the add button, and enter Start SQL Server for the title and for the command put: C:\WINDOWS\system32\net.exe For the arguments, put: start mssqlserver Untick "Close on exit" and tick "Use output window".

You can also add a shortcut button in any toolbar by right-cliking on the toolbar area, selecting customise, and then dragging the relevant external tool link (unfortunately VS refers to them as this, so you will have to figure out which one to choose) to a toolbar.
