It seems to me that your question of interest is trying to predict youth, based on other risk factors, that are considered to be high risk for STDs based on test information as well as demographic information. The relevance of using lifestyle survey information depends upon how you intend to identify eligible children for this intervention. In other words, if you incorporate that information, you will have to administer the lifestyle survey to all eligible children before deciding who may receive the information. This can be problematic in large populations. On the other hand, it may be good to assess as a secondary hypothesis. We may be interested in incorporating this information if, say, a lifestyle question can predict with 95% accuracy the risk of encountering any STD. Predicting STD risk is a matter of building a regression model. The event of acquiring an STD is the outcome. All regressors are considered possible risk factors. A logistic regression model would be suitable if STD incidence is measured in terms of yes/no for each individual. A log linear model would achieve similar results for a table of incidence. A complementary log-log model would be appropriate if you have measured the number of encounters a person has had. With any of these models for risk, you can compare the relative risk of outcome, and identify who is at the highest risk so that they may receive the intervention.
