What I do is basically the same as Jim Schubert's. I do make one small change though, in the MasterPage's PageLoad, i would do a conditional check, something like the following: if(Page is CustomPage) { var cp = (CustomPage)Page; this.Title = (String.IsNullOrEmpty(cp.PageTitle)) ? "Master's Default Title" : cp.PageTitle; } This then addresses point 2 of you question, so that your custom pages need not specify a title, but can just return String.Empty. (Forgive if the syntax isn't exactly right, VB is my native language.)
