A simple logistic regression using keras and R

I am new in ML. I try to run a simple logistic regression using Keras in R. I have 0 or 1 in a train$y data set. It corresponds to train$x > head(train $y) [1] 1 1 0 0 1 1 > head(train$ x) [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 53 13.0 22 [2,] 76 17.0 14 [3,] 73 17.0 12 [4,] 67 16.0 13 [5,] 65 13.0 10 [6,] 58 16.5 17 Here is my code: model % layer_flatten(input_shape = c(3)) %>% layer_dense(units =1, activation = "sigmoid") model %>% compile( loss = "binary_crossentropy", optimizer = "rmsprop", metrics = "accuracy" ) model %>% fit( x = mnist $train$ x, y = mnist $train$ y, epochs = 5, validation_split = 0.1, verbose = 2 ) When I run prediction I receive a very different result compared to logistic regression using glm. Actually the results are almost meaningless. Am I doing something wrong?
