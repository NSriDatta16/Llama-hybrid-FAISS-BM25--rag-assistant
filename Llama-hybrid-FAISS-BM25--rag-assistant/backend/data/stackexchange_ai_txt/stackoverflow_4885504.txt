After dragging a file on exe, ifstream fails to open file

I have have the following problem: When I drag and drop a file to my tool (exe) when ifstream fails to open the file. If I give it manually though the console it works! I don't get where the diffenence is, because I am cutting the path and passing just the filename. Have a look at the code: int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { if (argc files; for (int g = 1; g It fails already on the constructor: Converter::Converter(const char* file) { filename = file; myfile.open(filename.c_str(), ios_base::in); cout You have any idea why? UPDATE: The file as parameter works now. The solution was to leave the full path. Anyway I have the same error on a hard coded file. I thought it may be the same that's why I added .\ at the beginning of the file name... without success. The code: void GenericCommandConverter::getATCommandsFromCSV() { cout lines; vector commandList; vector > linesSeparated; ifstream csvFile; csvFile.open(filename_csv.c_str(), ios_base::in); cout UPDATE2: The solution was: on dropping a file to the exe, the "root" folder changes to the one where the dropped file comes from. Giving the hardcoded file the path from the *.exe solved it!
