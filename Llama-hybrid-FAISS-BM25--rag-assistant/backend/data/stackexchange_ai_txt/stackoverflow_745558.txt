RSA hashes are not unique. There's an extremely tiny (something to the order of 1:36^40) chance that you will create a false positive when hashing two different bits of clear text. For most applications, the chance is considered sufficiently small that you can ignore it, since it would take, on average, millions of years to see an accidental collision.
