When opening Form2, pass the object containing Form1 as a reference. In Form2, access the combo box using this object either directly (note that this might require changing the access modifier of the combo box from protected to public ) or (more elegantly) by calling a public method of Form1 written by you that returns the selected item of the combo box.
