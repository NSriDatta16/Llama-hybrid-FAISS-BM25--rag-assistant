Running under a Microsoft debugger (windbg, kd, cdb, Visual Studio Debugger) by default forces Windows to use the debug heap instead of the default heap. On Windows 2000 and above, the default heap is the Low Fragmentation Heap , which is insanely good compared to the debug heap. You can query the kind of heap you are using with HeapQueryInformation . To solve your particular problem, you can use one of the many options recommended in this KB article: Why the low fragmentation heap (LFH) mechanism may be disabled on some computers that are running Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, or Windows 2000 For Visual Studio, I prefer adding _NO_DEBUG_HEAP=1 to Project Properties->Configuration Properties->Debugging->Environment . That always does the trick for me.
