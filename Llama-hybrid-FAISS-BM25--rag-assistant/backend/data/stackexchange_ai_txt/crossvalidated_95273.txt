Does failing a test for heteroscedasticity mean I need to reject the model?

I have a model produced by a logistic regression which tragically failed Breusch-Pagan test. > bptest(lm.fit) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: lm.fit BP = 22837.5, df = 2, p-value I am hardly looking for alternatives (the response is zero-inflated). Does the fact that the model is clearly heteroscedastic imply that the model is useless or can I still adopt it with some caution?
