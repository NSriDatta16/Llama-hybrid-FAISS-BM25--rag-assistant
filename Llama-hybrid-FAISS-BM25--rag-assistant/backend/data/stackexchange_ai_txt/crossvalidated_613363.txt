What you're looking for is almost exactly what "Metropolis-Hastings for Ratio-of-Uniforms" tries to do. There are unfortunately no known papers on this topic, but what is available are some slides by Luke Tierney: http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/talks/bormio05.pdf Ratio-of-Uniforms is a way to generate random samples from a given distribution $F$ with density $f$ (need not be defined on any bounded set). However, in order to implement Ratio-of-Uniforms, one needs to obtain uniform draws from a bounded set $\mathscr{A}$ where this is: $$ \mathscr{A} = \left\{ (u,v): 0 \leq u \leq \sqrt{f(v/u)} \right\}\,. $$ If $(U,V) \sim \text{Unif}(\mathscr{A})$ , the $V/U \sim F$ . This is typically done by enclosing the set $\mathscr{A}$ within a rectangle and then implementing iid Accept-Reject sampling. However, this can be fairly inefficient if $\mathscr{A}$ is weird and high-dimensional. Tierney presents a few different ideas on how Markov chains can be constructed to sample uniformly on this set $\mathscr{A}$ instead of rejection sampling. There is also this Masters Thesis project that explore this for a specific problem: https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/1226
