Appropriate test for two test groups, one control group and binary outcome

I have the following problem: We send our Clients an email and offer them some new product. Let's say we want to test 2 email designs. Additionally, we need a control group, since some of the clients would buy a new product even without an email. As a result, we have a binary variable, either the clients bought the product or not. I would like to test, if any of the 2 emails worked better than the other (i.e. convinced more clients to buy the offered product) and at the same time, if sending the emails is significantly better then not sending them. So basically, I need three comparisons: Test 1 vs. Test 2 Test 1 vs. Control Test 2 vs. Control What would be the prefered method to do it? I thought about logistic regression with contrasts , but how to include the test between the two test groups?
