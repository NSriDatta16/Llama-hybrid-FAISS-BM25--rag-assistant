If you are only ever going to display in Imperial, then there may well be no good reason to store in metric. You will save yourself hassle by simply use an int to store the number of inches. If you need more resolution than that, either: uses an int to store (for example) tenths of an inch use numeric to store fractional values As you are storing only "hundreds/thousands of peoples' heights", storage issues are very unlikely to be a worry.
