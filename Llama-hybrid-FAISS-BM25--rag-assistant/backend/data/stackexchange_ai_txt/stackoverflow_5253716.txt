increasing mysql storage

Sorry in advance in if this is a dumb question but I was wondering if anyone could explain to me how to scale mysql? Here's my situation..I work for a startup and we're creating software that will rely on very large datasets. I'm trying to setup the mysql server and the data structure, etc.. I am realistic enough to realize I won't make a perfect solution that'll last forever and will eventually need to make changes to the structure and since I can't really predict how much data I'll need, I suspect I'll eventually have to make changes. Does anyone have any tips or sources I could read to understand how to deal with increasing storage? How does the process work and is there any considerations I need to make before setting up the database? I want to physically have different storage but logically I want this to be transparent to the users(i.e. table is actually stored on multiple servers but users only query one table). I read that mysql has a 4 gig limit on tables, how does facebook scale so well on mysql then? Thanks in advance and sorry if this question either doesn't make sense or is too basic.
