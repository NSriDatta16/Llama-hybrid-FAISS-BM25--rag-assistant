Prediction Interval Construction

At my organization, we use a deterministic formula mid-month to predict an end-of-month value. We have some data on the historical performance of this prediction. We know the value of the average prediction percent error ((Predicted - Actual)/Actual) and correspondingly we know the standard deviation of the prediction percent error. Can this historical information be used to produce a prediction interval (let's use 95%) when the predictions are made?
