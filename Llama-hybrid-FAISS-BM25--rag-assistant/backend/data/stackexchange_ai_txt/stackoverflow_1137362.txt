XmlDocument Don’t use XmlDocument unless you absolutely need to. It is optimized for constructing xml not reading it. http://www.mattberther.com/2004/06/16/xmldocument-vs-xpathnavigator/ Use either an XmlReader or an XPathNavigator. If you are reading into classes consider doing a direct serialize with XMLSerializer. Xml versus flat file Only use XML if you are creating a hierarchy of objects. From your description a simple line by line read of a text file would suffice. You can then split on the first occurrence of “=” and read it into a Dictionary, a List, or some custom structure. It will be faster than XML and easier to maintain. Spelling I don’t think XML helps you with spelling errors. Localization Should be done with resource files Have a look here http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/Localization.aspx or on SO https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/localization+.net
