In my experience, when mentoring someone, it is very important for the mentee to really WANT to learn more. Never ever spoon feed them. Instead point them towards things of value and have them utilize the new information they are learning in projects that they are using. Knowledge is useless if not put into practice. So encourage your mentee to code, code, code.
