One of the cutest uses of random numbers for mid-sized crowds is finding cycles. I will describe the physical method, and then some explorations. The Python code is fairly trivial. Start with your group of about 100 people with their names on pieces of paper in a bowl. Everyone descends on the bowl and takes a random piece of paper. Each person goes to the person with that name. This leads to groups clumping together in various sizes. Not always what people expect. For example, if Alice picks Bob, Bob picks Charlie, and Charlie picks Alice, then these three people will end up in their own clump. For some groups, have people join hands with their matches to see everyone being pulled this way and that. Also to see how the matches create chains or clumps. Now write software to watch the number of clumps. Do the match on clumps, asking, for example, "how often is the biggest clump less than half the people"? For example, for N students, an average of 1/N will draw their own names. Do you need code?
