Difference between C and lambda in SVM

I've been taking the coursera machine learning course and The instructor said that if ( C = 1/lambda ) then the learning algorithm would reach the same optimal value of theta does this mean that using C instead of lambda is just a convention when using SVM or is there an actual difference ? P.S Please dumb down the answer for me I'm kind of new to this :) Thanks
