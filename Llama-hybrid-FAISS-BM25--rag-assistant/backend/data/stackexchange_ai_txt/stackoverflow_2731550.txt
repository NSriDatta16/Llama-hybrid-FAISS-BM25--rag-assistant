This has less to do with PHP, and more to do with math. The simplest way to calculate something like this is to take the average traffic for a given day over the past X weeks. You don't want to pull all the data, because fads and page content changes. So, for example, get the average traffic for each day over the last month. You'll be able to tell how accurate your estimates are by comparing them to actual traffic. If they aren't accurate at all, then try playing with the calculation (ex., change the time period you're sampling from). Or maybe it's a good thing that your estimate is off: your site was just featured on the front page of the New York Times! Cheers.
