Brace for impact The use of the same varibale for different perpose at different places in code is NOT ideal. Here's the solution though: Use braces to separate the different use-cases of the same variable. for(int i=0;i NOTE: As Robert rightly pointed out, unless the instruction is executed, i will not be initialised to the new value. GoodLUCK!!
