Yes you can, for a feature with positive and negative values, logistic regression will find a coefficient that works best with all values. You should not set all negatives to zero, as you will be losing information. If you want to add some negative boosting, then it may be worthwhile to create a new categorical variable with two values: 'Positive' or 'Negative'. In this way, the regression can assess the impact of the feature being positive or negative, and can also use the numerical values for prediction as well. I think it's important to understand the contextual significance of a positive vs negative value. Is the feature continuous from -inf to +inf (or whatever your limits are)? If two candidates have a score of 1 and -1, is the difference between them similar to two candidates that have a score of 88 and 90? In both cases the score difference is 2. I don't know the context of your model, but I think this is an important consideration.
