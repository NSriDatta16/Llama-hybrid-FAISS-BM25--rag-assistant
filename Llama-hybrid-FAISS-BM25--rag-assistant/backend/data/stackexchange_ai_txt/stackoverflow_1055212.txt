In terms of being modern and standards compliant for video embedding, Video for Everyone is probably the best way. cc-by --> No video playback capabilities detected. Why not try to download the file instead? MPEG4 / H.264 “.mp4” (Windows / Mac) | Ogg Theora &amp; Vorbis “.ogv” (Linux) A fully commented version is available at the link above. This uses the video tag if it's supported, but as Firefox and Safari both support different formats (Ogg and Mp4) you need to have a couple of different versions of the video files. This works on every browser, from IE6 to the iPhone, and from Chrome to Opera including everything in between. For audio, the audio tag is the most modern, though I'm not sure about browser support at the moment.
