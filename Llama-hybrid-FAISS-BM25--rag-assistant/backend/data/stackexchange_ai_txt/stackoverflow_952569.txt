Iconic, It's difficult to answer the questions without knowing exactly what you're trying to achieve. I'll have a go though: If you're familiar with web forms, think of your partial view as a webforms usercontrol for the moment and think of the part of your model that is relevant to your partial views as a 'fragment of information' that want to pass across to the partial view. Natural choices for using a partial view would be for elements used in many views across your site. So ... in answer: 1.Although what you are doing is valid, it doesn't seem quite correct. An example of a partial view I have used might be a row in a grid of data where you'd call the partial view passing in the row object as its model: foreach (MyObject o in Model.objects) { Html.RenderPartial("Shared/gridRowForObject.ascx", o, ViewData); } You can strongly type your views also to expect a specific type to be passed through as the Model object. Again another use might be a login box or a 'contact me form' etc. 2._Ultimately this is a personal design decision but I'd go for the option that requires the least application/presentation logic and the cleanest code in your view. I'd tend to avoid writing to many conditional calls in your view for example and by inferring a base type to pass across to all of your partial views as in your example, may well tie you down. When learning the MVC framework I found the Oxite code to be useful. I hope that helps.
