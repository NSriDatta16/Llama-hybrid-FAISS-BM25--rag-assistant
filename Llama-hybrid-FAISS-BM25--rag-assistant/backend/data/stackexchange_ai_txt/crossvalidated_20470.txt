I also like @john 's answer, but I'd add that, rather than significance, you should be more concerned with effect size, especially if you are not doing a fishing expedition. You should also be concerned about other things. Robert Abelson, in his marvelous book: Statistics as Principled Argument says that we should evaluate statistical findings based on the "MAGIC" criteria: Magnitude - how big is the effect? Articulation - Does it need a lot of qualifications and exceptions? Generality - Does it apply to a large area (e.g. lots of types of people, or whatever) Interestingness - interesting effects are better! and Credibility - Can people believe it? I review the book
