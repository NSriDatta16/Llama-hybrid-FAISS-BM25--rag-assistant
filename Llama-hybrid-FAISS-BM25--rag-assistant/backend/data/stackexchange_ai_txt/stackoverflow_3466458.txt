This looks to be a permissions issue, and I have to wonder if the differential between those who can and those who can't have something to do with which OS they are running. I'm running Mac OS 10.6 as an administrator and I was unable to perform the action in the DMG. But I was able to perform the action if I dragged both files out of the DMG and onto my Desktop. If you need to install files in specific locations to the hard drive to support your project, then I would recommend making an installer (and a matching uninstaller as well) as opposed to the setup you have presented.
