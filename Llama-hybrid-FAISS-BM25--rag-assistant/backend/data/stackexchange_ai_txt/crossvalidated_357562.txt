In this case the simulator is your function. It is a complicated, noisy, black-box function that you want to optimize. Yes, you can use genetic algorithms, Bayesian optimization, or a number of other derivative-free optimization algorithms to seek for it's optimum. The only problem is how efficient (in terms of speed and precision) would be the algorithm you choose for this particular problem, but I am afraid that the choice of algorithm may be problem-specific. Some algorithms may work better for some cases and worse for others, so you should either look for a literature on problems similar to yours for suggestions, or just check it by trial and error.
