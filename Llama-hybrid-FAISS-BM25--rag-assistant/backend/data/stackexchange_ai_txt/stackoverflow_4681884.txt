WPF: MouseEnter doesn't work on several buttons when mouse is pressed

I have a list of toggle-buttons in wpf and I want the user to be able to toggle several buttons by dragging over them. To do this, I used the MouseEnter-Event for each button. This does work, when I press the mousebutton outside the buttons and start dragging. But when I press the mousebutton on a button and start dragging, the MouseEnter-Event is only fired for the first button, where I pressed the mousebutton (also none of the other events like mouseover or mousemove are fired). Here's the code: public void AddButton() { ToggleButton btn = new ToggleButton(); btn.MouseEnter += VisibilityButton_Enter; this.gridButtons.Children.Add(btn); } private void VisibilityButton_Enter(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed || e.RightButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed) { ToggleButton btn = sender as ToggleButton; btn.IsChecked = !btn.IsChecked; } } I found a solution to use "drag and drop" and the dragover-event, but I think there must be an easier solution?
