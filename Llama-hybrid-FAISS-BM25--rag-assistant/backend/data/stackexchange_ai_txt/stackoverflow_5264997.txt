I have a java a application written for the desktop. But with a few lines of code, I can deploy my application to the web as an Applet? With a few lines of JNLP, you can launch your (J)Frame based project directly from a web site using Java Web Start . ..Can anyone inform me why simply converting my application to an applet is a bad deployment idea? 'Browsers'. As you probably realize, an applet is a guest in a web page that is rendered by a browser. Browser/JRE/applet interaction bugs are the bane of an applet developer. There is a new one every other week. Avoid the browser, and most of the problems are solved in a stroke. I deploy applets on my site, though I generally only make an applet when the web page can bring something to the applet. E.G. there is a properties applet that is configured using JavaScript. But my general advice is, avoid applets if at all possible.
