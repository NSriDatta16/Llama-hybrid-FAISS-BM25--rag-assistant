Well, with a simple adjacency graph (supervisor_id pointing back at the employees table), you could certainly do what you want, but it won't be very efficient, and will not scale to large numbers of people. What you probably want is to implement a nested set model . This allows you to very easily grab everyone who reports to some arbitrary person in the organization. If you're early enough in development, you might consider looking at the Doctrine ORM system, which provides a nestedset behavior for models, so you don't need to implement your own. Edit: Richard Knop has a post about nested sets with php example code which you might find more helpful than Celko's 100%-sql examples..
