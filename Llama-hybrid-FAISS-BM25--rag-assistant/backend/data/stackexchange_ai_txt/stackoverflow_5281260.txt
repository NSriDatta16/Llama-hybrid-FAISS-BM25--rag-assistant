Why is the Problems view in Eclipse not showing all of my errors?

I am using Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede, and in my project there are several Java files that have compile errors. There's a red line at the error point when I open one of these files, but Eclipse doesn't show that there's a problem with the file at the project level. Is there a property that needs to be set for that to happen? Why wouldn't all of my errors be shown in the Problems view?
