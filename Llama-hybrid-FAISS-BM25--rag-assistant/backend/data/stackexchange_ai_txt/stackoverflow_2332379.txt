Hey, thanks to all for the answers so far! I have never worked in a team/collaborative environment before, so this is a tad bit new to me. We are in the midst of acquiring a " Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition with MSDN Premium subscription ". I know that this package gets updated to "Visual Studio 2010 Premium with MSDN" on March 22 2010. Will I still be able to leverage collaborative efforts using this package? Is it worth the $2970 additional cost? EDIT : We are applying for the Empower for ISVs subscription. We work mainly on SaaS/RIA solutions. Am I understanding the term "Work Item" correctly - that is if I wish to task Developer 1 with say XHTML/CSS, Developer 2 with a certain functional module, and Developer 3 with another functional module - each of these is considered a work item that can be easily tracked with VSTS?
