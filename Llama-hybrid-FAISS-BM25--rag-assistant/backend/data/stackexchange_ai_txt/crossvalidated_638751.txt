Use the (negative) likelihood of the distribution as your loss function. You can also turn it into a pseudo r2 for easier interpretability ( and negative likelihood is a 1:1 relation to pseudo r2). I highly recommend xgboostlss / lightgbmlss for that regression task. https://github.com/StatMixedML/XGBoostLSS https://github.com/StatMixedML/LightGBMLSS Somewhat related: Working in the field of insurance, I have my doubts that policies are gamma distributed without zero-inflation ( does every policy have a 100% chance to pay out >$0). If you actually do have 0 payout I recommend using zero inflated lognormal distributions (and loss). This is a popular choice in customer lifetime value modeling , and transfers very nicely to policy pricing. See here fir details and implementation ( including loss) https://github.com/google/lifetime_value In xgboostlss world this is the ZALN distribution.
