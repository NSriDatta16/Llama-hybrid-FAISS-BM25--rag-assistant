So, a few of your rows will have too many columns by one or more as a result. That's easy to detect, but harder to infer where the error was -- which two columns are actually one? which delimiter is not a delimiter? In some cases, you can use the metadata, because it helps you know when an interpretation of the columns can't be right. For example, if just the one column can have a text value, and all the others must be numeric, it's unambiguous where the error is. Any additional columns created by this error occur right after the text column. If they're all text, this doesn't work of course. You might be able to leverage more than the metadata's column type. For example you may know that some fields are from an enumerated set of values, and use that to determine when a column assignment is wrong.
