Estimation of treatment effect when there is an unknown and variable coverage of the population

I am not sure if I am using the correct terminology, something must be written about the following problem, but I cannot find it by searching. I am presently analyzing data about the effect of introduction of a new vaccination program. The data is supposedly "ecological data", that is , population data, we do not have data on individual level, so no subject level covariates. So, basically, I have a count time series, of total number of deaths, and number of deaths for reason A. But we do not know how good the surveillance system is, that is, which percentage of cases is actually reported. That percentage is surely changing with time, hopefully it is becoming better. But we do assume, realistically, that the probability of a death being reported do not depend on its cause. So, I model $$ Y_{1t} \sim \text{Po}(\lambda_t) \\ Y_{2t} \sim \text{Po}(\mu_t) $$ where $Y_{1t}$ is number of deaths for reason A at $t$, while $Y_{2t}$ is number for all other reasons. In reality, those variables are overdispersed, but here I will just assume Poisson (because overdispersion issues are unimportant for my question). So, I use glms (actually, vglms from R package VGAM) for representing Poisson regressions, with some common terms in the linear predictors $\eta_1, \eta_2$. I introduce a 0/1 dummy for the introduction of the vaccine at time $t_0$, a polynomial of low degree for representing the observed relative decrease of deaths of certain reason relative for other reasons, a common natural spline term for representing the effect of the varying coverage (assumed the same for both processes) and some other terms unimportant for the question. The model is then more explicit: $$ Y_{1t} \sim \text{Po}(\lambda_t=\exp(\beta_{10}+\beta_{11}t+\beta_{12}t^2+\beta_{13}t^3+s(t)+\beta_{14}I(t-t_0\ge 0)) ) \\ Y_{2t} \sim \text{Po}(\mu_t=exp(\beta_{20}+s(t))) $$ where $s(t)$ is a common spline term. Since the two regressions have some common parameters, we use VGAM for the estimation. My problem is that by introducing too much flexibility (too many df for the natural spline term), that term will eventually absorb the effect of the dummy term! So, how to choose how much flexibility? As we do not really have prior info about the correct nuber of df, it must in some way be from the fit. Some observations: Since the smooth term is common for both linear predictors, if too little flexibility, will cause underfitting, which can be seen as autocorrelated residuals, and even correlation between the two residuals. So that will give some information. But, I am only concerned about good estimation (unbiased, small bias, consistency) of the treatment effect. How can I be sure about that, in the presence of many other badly identified parameters, with little prior information? That is, should I underfit or overfit (my intuition says that I should avoid overfitting, so erring in the direction of some underfit) but there must be some papers studying this or some related questions? Any thoughts, or references? EDIT I found one paper which seems relevant, http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0304414913000811/1-s2.0-S0304414913000811-main.pdf?_tid=5ddf25ce-ac17-11e6-a0a4-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1479312884_12ea86a56c9581553b7607211e21941d but there must be something more specific? Also, very low views in this question, is there something I can do to make the question clearer?
