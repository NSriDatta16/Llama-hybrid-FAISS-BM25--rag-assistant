Cupcake(API3) friendly way to pause/stop sound loops in SoundPool? Any ideas?

Quick note: I'm using the SoundPool class http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/SoundPool.html What I have here is a simple button that plays a looped sound while it's pressed. It works great. However, sounds.autoPause(); wasn't introduced until API 8 and I really need something that is cupcake compatible (API 3) So i was going through the dev reference site filtered by API 3 stuff and i saw pause so i figured i'd try sounds.pause(sound); but it doesn't stop the sound when i release it.(Maybe i'm just using it wrong?) Does anyone know of a cupcake friendly way to stop this sound? thanks! edit: also tried sounds.stop(sound); that didn't work either. The Code: My onCreate: sounds = new SoundPool(5, AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 0); sound = sounds.load(this.getApplicationContext(), R.raw.red_long_one, 1); Then here's my touch event @Override public boolean onTouch(View arg0, MotionEvent event) { switch (event.getAction() ) { case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: System.out.println("touch"); sounds.play(sound, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1); break; case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP: System.out.println("up"); //autoPause does not work on anything lower than sdk8 sounds.autoPause(); break; } return false; } I don't understand why sounds.stop(sound); doesn't seem to work, that seems to but what any article i read recommends to do I think it's worth noting that if i use sounds.stop(sound); it works ONE time then after that it won't stop after i let go. but the first press and release it works as intended. Now, I know on the andoird site it says streamID and not soundID but i have no idea how to get the streamID
