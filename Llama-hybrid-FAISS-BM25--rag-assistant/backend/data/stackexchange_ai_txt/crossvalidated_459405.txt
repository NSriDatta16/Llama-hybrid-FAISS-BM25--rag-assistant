forecasting trafic for many regions with time series using one model

I am working on forecasting Trafic for many regions, each region has its own time series. I have 40 regions, i don't want to have 40 models for each Region. The question, have you an idea about one algorithm that i can forecast the trafic of all the regions at the same time? my data is like: 01-01-2016: 20 placeA ; 01-01-2016: 10 placeB. Thank you in advance
