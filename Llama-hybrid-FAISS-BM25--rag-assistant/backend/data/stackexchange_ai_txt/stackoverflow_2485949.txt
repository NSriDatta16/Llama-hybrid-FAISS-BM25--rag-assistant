Maybe you can try RPN Expression Parser Class for now or bcParser ? These are very small expression parsing libraries. I like strong, statically typed languages for my own work, but I don't think they're suited for beginners who have no interest in becoming professionals. So I'd have to say unfortunately your choice of C# might not of been the best for that audience. Boo seems to be statically typed to. Have you thought about embedding a Javascript engine, Python, or some other dynamically typed engine? These usually are not that hard to plug into an existing application and you have the benefit of lots of existing documentation.
