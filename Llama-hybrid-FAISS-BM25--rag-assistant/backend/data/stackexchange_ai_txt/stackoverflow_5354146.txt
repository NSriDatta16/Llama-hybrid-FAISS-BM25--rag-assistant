I have a level 9 app on android, and I want to know if I can use new features from level 11 (Android 3.0) in the same project? Yes, via reflection or conditional class loading, as suggested by Mr. Willis. Here is a sample application that demonstrates this for the action bar, also new to API Level 11. For 3.0 tablet version, my layouts will contain fragments. How do I use these fragments and allow the level 9 version to build and run successfully? Use the Android compatibility library . Can I define different layouts for different API levels (in the res/layout)? Yes, via the -vNN resource set suffix (e.g., res/layout-v11 ). However, you should try to minimize this. If I keep 2 versions, one for tablet other for phones, can I add that to the android-marketplace with the same package name? No.
