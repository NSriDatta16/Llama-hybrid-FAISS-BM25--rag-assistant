A Google Docs document picker?

Working on a method to allow users to "attach" a doc from their Google account to an object in my application. Really, all I need to do is create a link in my app to their asset in Google Docs. Some sort of document chooser that allows users to browse their docs would be very helpful. Is there a standard method/interface to accomplish this? Something similar to embedding a doc in a Google Site?
