Properly Using Chi-squared Test

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this question. I'm an undergraduate with fairly limited statistical education up to this point. I have a research project examining the contents of fox scat. Within each unit of scat we gather whatever animal parts we can find record the following data: 1) the taxa those parts belong to 2) the likely mass and life stage of that organism. For example: One scat contains a teeth attributed to a juvenile cottontail weighing 50-150 g. Therefore 1 occurrence of cottontail is counted for the 50-150g column within the cottontail category. This study was fairly opportunistic, so control for variables is limited, but as far as I can tell we can still use a chi-squared statistic to measure the significance of: 1) which taxa was dominant by overall frequency of occurrence 2) which taxa was dominant by amount of biomass 3) which biomass category was overall dominant. Am I correct in applying chi-squared here and that our degrees of freedom would be determined with n = # of categories for each test?
