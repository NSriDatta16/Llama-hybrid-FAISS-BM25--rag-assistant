What would be a good resource to learn about memory management in Android OS?

I am looking for any kind of website, blogpost, wiki, discussion, book, magazine, scientific paper, which on good authority could explain the internals of memory management in Android. I know very well that a big part is Linux and this is where I should go first, but Android has dalvik, which is, as far as I understand, deeply integrated with the Kernel, also, Android is unloading apps if it runs out of memory, which is probably what Linux does not do. So, I am looking for an authoritative answer about memory management in Android. Topics include, but are not limited to: How to interpret values from adb shell dumpsys meminfo , i.e. what is the meaning of each value: size, alloc, free, Pss, priv dirty, shared dirty, what kind of data is it stored there? What would be the best metric to evaluate memory consumption on the device? Where is each *.so loaded to? Or does Android have execution in place implemented? Are there any limits on how much memory an application can consume? Does OS assign a contiguous chunk of memory, which can grow as long as it is contiguous, or some kind of fragmentation is permitted? Etc. There is a great answer in this thread How do I discover memory usage of my application in Android? , but I want some more in-depth explanation, thus asking for an external resource.
