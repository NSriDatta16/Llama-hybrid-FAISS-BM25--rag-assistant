Statistical method to compare multiple ratio of averages

What is the best statistical method to use to evaluate the difference between multiple ratio-of-averages (NOT average-of-ratios)? I have two parameters (P1 and P2) that are changing over time (5 time points). I want to know if the change in the ratio of P1/P2 over time is significant. I want to compare the ratio-of-averages (average P1 and P2 first, then find ratio) over the course of the 5 time points, NOT the average-of-ratios (take ratio of each individual P1/P2 first, and then average). I understand that one can use ANOVA for the latter case... But what statistical test can I use to compare the ratio-of-averages over time? Thanks for your response. I'll try to be more specific: I have 50 individuals for whom I am measuring P1 and P2 across 5 time points (t0 through t4). Over time, the mean P1 of the 50 individuals decreases, as does the mean P2. I can calculate delta-P1 and delta-P2 for the interval between each of the time points to quantify the average change. However, the ratio of dP1/dP2 also decreases over time, meaning that P1 is actually changing faster earlier on relative to P2, and then slows down over time. What I want to show is that the decrease observed in the ratio-of-averages, dP1/dP2, is statistically significant over the 4 intervals between each of the 5 time points (t0-t1, t1-t2, t2-t3, t3-t4). My understanding is that if I were using the average-of-ratios to calculate these numbers, I could just use ANOVA. However, I am not, I am using the ratio-of-averages (as explained), and need to know how I show statistical significance. I hope that helps.
