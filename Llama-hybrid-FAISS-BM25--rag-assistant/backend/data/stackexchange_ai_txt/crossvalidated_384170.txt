Is there any tool to test the tendency toward/away from stationarity?

I have time series data, like the following: Time Value 1 20 3 40 8 -10 9 30 ... I'm wondering if there is any test if this time series is toward 0 (like "decrescendo" pattern in the traceplot), or away from 0 (like "crescendo" pattern in the traceplot). Any recommendation for the tool to visualize/summarize this pattern will be appreciated.
