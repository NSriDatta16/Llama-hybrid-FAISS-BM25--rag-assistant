In a certain sense (unbiased minimum variance) you can't really do better than the estimator you gave above, you are efficiently using the information available in the data you are analyzing. How you can do better is e.g. if you have prior information by using a Bayesian approach or via shrinkage approaches (either sort of Bayesian shrinking towards a sensible guess, or via a hierarchical model across related quantities e.g. estimating variances for the same variable in different populations or something like that).
