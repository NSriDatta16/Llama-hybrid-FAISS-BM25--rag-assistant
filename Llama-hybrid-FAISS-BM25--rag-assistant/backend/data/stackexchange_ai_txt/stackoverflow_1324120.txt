First Day of Next Year for SQL Server?

This should not be this hard. I simply need the following: SET @DueDate = CONVERT (DATETIME, '01/01/2010') However, I need it pragmatically so that if it were March of 2010, the date given would be '01/01/2011'. I know it's simple, but my brain isn't coming up with it. I'm sure it's with a DateAdd and getdate() .
