VB Syntax for LINQ query that creates a new{} set?

I am trying to AVERAGE 6 different fields on a DataTable, but without grouping. Just the AVERAGE. I have found a couple of examples in C#, but can't find any examples for how to do this in VB. Can someone please help me convert the syntax? Here is what I have so far: Dim query = From dtRow In dtIn.AsEnumerable _ Where dtRow.Field(Of String)("FOLLOWUP") = "Alert" _ Select New With { _ .Brand_Functional_Avg = XXX.Average(Function(f) f("Brand_Functional")), _ .Brand_Personal_Avg = XXX.Average(Function(f) f("Brand_Personal")) _ } What should I use for XXX? I tried all of the options that I could think of and nothing is compiling. Trust me, if I could write this in C#, I would, but the project requires VB.
