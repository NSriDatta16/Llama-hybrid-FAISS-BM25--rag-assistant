What should come first -- the design pattern or the code?

I'm starting on a fresh new project--should I look at my spec and decide which design patterns to apply, or just come up with a general idea of organization and allow the patterns to emerge organically through refactoring? In your experience, which technique will be most productive and have a greater chance of leading to clean elegant code? I'm also wondering if there are design patterns out there that aren't defined by the GoF, but could be just as valuable? If so, what are some useful resources for informing myself about these?
