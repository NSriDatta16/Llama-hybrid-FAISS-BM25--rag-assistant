If my data looks like this, is linear regression just never gonna be useful?

Clearly you can see that there is no linear relationship. If there was one it would be a vertical line which is not that useful. I need some type of regression rather than classification as the output is continuous. The only options I can think of are neural networks and SVR (support vector regressors). Is linear regression a waste of time here? What would you use? The use case is - I am trying to predict the rgb color of a polygon based on its area, length, index, complexity, #of lines, # of curves, and intensity (black and white). In this first step I am merely trying to predict the amount of red from 0 to 1. (scaled down from 255). Edit: here are the labels - rgb values: http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/2HZX here is the data with the 7 features: http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/2HZY
