Custom Django Storage

I have a web page where people can upload their own images and I want to store them in a salable storage. I was willing to use Amazon S3, but later I decided to use my own file servers with web servers for serving static content (images) But I'm not sure how to do this. What is the correct way to do it and what custom Django storage should I use? How will I upload images to these file servers?
