Algorithms that don't learn the state-transition probability function are called model-free . One of the main problems with model-based algorithms is that there are often many states, and a na√Øve model is quadratic in the number of states. That imposes a huge data requirement. Q-learning is model-free. It does not learn a state-transition probability function.
