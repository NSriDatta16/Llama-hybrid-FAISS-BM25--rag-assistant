VAR - VARX model selection

Suppose I have three stationary economic time series $y_i$ that are not cointegrated and I want to investigate the relationship between them. I happen to be unsure about the "endogenousness" of $y_3$ so I first fit a VAR model with all three variables, but I also fit a VARX model with $y_1$ and $y_2$ endogenous but $y_3$ exogenous. Can I use an information criterion like the AIC to help me select the better model? Or if not, what are my other options?
