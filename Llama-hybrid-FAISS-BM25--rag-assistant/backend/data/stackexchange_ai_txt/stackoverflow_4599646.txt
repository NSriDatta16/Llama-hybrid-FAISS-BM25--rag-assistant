It bears mentioning that the Flash file should be served from the same domain as your CI site or one won't be able to read the other's cookies. Also make sure that the login cookie path is set to the root path. If SWFUpload can not read the login cookie, it can not send it either. Flash has limited access to session cookies, as documented here in the SWFUpload forum . Is it possible that you've set the auto login to avoid setting an expiration (in config/tank_auth.php), thereby making it a session cookie? If that is the case, then the SWFUpload SWF may not be able to access or send the autologin cookie value, depending on the version of Flash player on the computer. Double-check your cookie expiration values using a debug tool like Firebug to see if this is the case. If the upload works when you check a "remember" me box but not otherwise, that would indicate a session cookie problem. To force the SWF to pass the TankAuth cookie value on file uploads, you could first overload the cookie helper get_cookie function to look in either the $_COOKIE array or the $_POST array for values. Then, it appears that with SWFUpload v2 you can send additional POST values along with the upload , and this would be the way to send the autologin key, which would then allow your controller to get the user_id. But before hacking the Cookie helper, make sure your moving parts are working first, as described in the first paragraph.
