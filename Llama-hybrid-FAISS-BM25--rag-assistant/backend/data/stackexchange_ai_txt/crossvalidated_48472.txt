You haven't specified 'what' your output or target variable is. A neural network is a supervised learner and requires input and output data to train. So, in order of questions: 1) The output will be the response or target based upon the output it is trained on. 2) It would probably make sense to undue any transformations after the NN returns results, in order to make them more understandable. 3) It depends on what the outputs are. The error will be a result corresponding to the method you use to pre-process and transform data and the loss function you use (which is usually something like rmse between prediction and actual).
