Does Breiman's random forest use information gain or Gini index?

I would like to know if Breiman's random forest (random forest in R randomForest package) uses as a splitting criterion (criterion for attribute selection) information gain or Gini index? I tried to find it out on http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm and in documentation for randomForest package in R. But the only thing I found is that Gini index can be used for variable importance computing.
