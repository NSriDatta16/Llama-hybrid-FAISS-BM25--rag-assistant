It depends on how you are hiding it, are you using a DOM ready or a window ready? Window ready waits for all images to download, which is generally far too long. For accessibility, reasons, I'd hide it on DOM loaded. But to ensure it won't show up, you could put it in a noscript element As for your last paragraph, nothing like that can happen in the absence of JavaScript.
