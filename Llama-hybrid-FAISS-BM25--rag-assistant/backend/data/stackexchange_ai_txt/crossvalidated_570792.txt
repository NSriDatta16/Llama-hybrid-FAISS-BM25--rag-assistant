Repeated measures with nested data in R

Previously, I conducted a model like the following. I have repeated measures ( Time factor: pre-post) of depressive mood in two different groups ( Group factor: neutral and experimental). Each participant in only one group. I checked the Coping as a moderator. lmer(DepressiveMood ~ Coping*Time*Group + (1|ID), data = data) Currently, I created 3 Level s among the participants based on their pre-depressive mood scores as a low, average, and high depressive mood. So, the difference can be more sizeable. However, I could not create the model. Is this following model correct? My question is individuals in three different levels of depressive mood (Level factor) are different? lmer(DepressiveMood ~ Coping*Time*Group + (1|Level|ID), data = data)
