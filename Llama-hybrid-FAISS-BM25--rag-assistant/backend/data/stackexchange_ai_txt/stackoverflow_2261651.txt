Telerik RadEditor image manager issues

We are using Telerik RadEditor control in our project and having some problems with its integration with our user documents storage engine. We've implemented custom content provider for Telerik image manager and it shows correct documents in dialog. But in doesn't switch between images while selection. You can see this on this picture . We've tested this behaviour on the blank ASP.NET page without any additional CSS or JS. Rad editor tag could be found below. Please help! Why do this could happen?
