Can I use machine learning to find similar and longer continuous time-series?

I have data which contains access duration of some items. Example: t0~t5 is the access time duration, 1 means the items was accessed in the time duration, 0 means it wasn't. ID,t0,t1,t2,t3,t4 0,0,0,1,1,1 1,0,1,1,1,1 2,0,1,1,0,0 3,1,1,0,0,1 4,1,1,0,0,1 Objective: Find sets which are all 1 for a continuous duration as longer as possible. I can set the minimum continuous length len=2 . If len==2 , what I want is groups ID=0,1 ID=3,4 aren't because their len is 2 but ID=0,1` are more continuous than them. For clustering: I tried KMeans and DBSCAN , they all cluster ID=3,4 as one group and it makes sense. But it doesn't do what I want. For regression: Although I can predict which ID will be access, I still find the longer continuous time-series. For classification: I don't have label it to identify which ID will be what I want. I try above algorithm but didn't figure out, I thought possible way is pre-processing before clustering and find out after clustering. Is there any possible pre-processing of data to reach what I want ? Or any ways to help me?
