Logistic regression model; too many independent variables? (listening duration of music genres)

I'm building a logistical regression model to predict the gender of users based on listening duration of music genres. My main worry is that I have over 40 different genre's and I'm concerned that having that many independent variables is going to hurt my GLM, or make it uninterpretable. Is there a better way to approach the problem?
