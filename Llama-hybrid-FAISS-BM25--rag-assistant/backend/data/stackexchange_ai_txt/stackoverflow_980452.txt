The guidelines say that a property should represent a state of the object, it should not be expensive performance wise, and it should not have side effects apart from computing/setting that state. My guess is GetType() does not respect these rules so they made it a method. GetType() is a slightly expensive operation. If it were a property it would encourage uses like DoStuff(obj.Type); .... DoStuff(obj.Type); etc. instead of Type type = obj.GetType(); DoStuff(type); .... DoStuff(type); and that would be not so optimal. So they made it a method to suggest that it should be called sparingly.
