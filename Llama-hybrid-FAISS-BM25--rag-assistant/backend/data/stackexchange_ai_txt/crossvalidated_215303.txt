I always think you can do most task by two approaches: knowledge driven and data driven include binning your continuous features. By knowledge driven, you can think about what binning will make sense from what the actual feature represents. For example, if you are binning a household income, you definitely can find some references on basic statistics of the US household income and use those statistical metrics to bin it (e.g., what is the typical value for middle class, rich etc.). By data driven, you are essential want to use this binning to improve your model performance. You can think about you are essentially doing feature engineering or basis expansion. Suppose you want to sacrifice your interpretability, you can even use Neural Network to "train the basis expansion", where you expand one continuous features to many "engineered features", those engineered features can be continuous or discrete. I am thinking you are using RPART to bin, is similar to this approach. Best research always come with combining both knowledge driven and data driven, where you use knowledge to specify a "rough shape of the model" and use data to fit it to get more details. In your case of binning continuous variables, you may also do this. I am not sure if my answer is too high level, but feel free to ask me to explain any part in details.
