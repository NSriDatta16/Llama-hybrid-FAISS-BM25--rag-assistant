@Gary The Controls filter of the DATA view (my 2nd answer) actually does keep the folder hierarchy. You can have it go into sub-folders if needed, but in your case you're only interested in showing one specific folder correct? What you're doing is useing SP-designer to do it, I couldn't find a way to do it via the regular webparts. drag and drop your shared document library in the 'design' view for the page Click the common task arrow ( > ) and customize the columns you want to show Still in the common task, apply a filter of choice. What you want to do here is apply a filter on your Month column, so that the Month column is equal to the current month/year, correct? The filter will only give you a choice to type something in, type the current month, say May 09. then switch to 'code' view Find the shared document library, and more specifically look for something like: &lt ;Where&gt ;.... That is the CAML query I had mentioned before. You can do an HTML decode on the whole thing, so that it's a bit more readable. But in essence, the filter is a simple CAML query. You want to modify that query, so that your month/year combo is that of the current month/year. CAML has one feature called which returns the month in the following format: mm/yyyy (you may need to change the format on your column or create a new one to make it easy on yourself) - Your CAML query should be something a bit like this: or html encoded: &lt ;Where&gt ;&lt ;Eq&gt ;&lt ;FieldRef Name='Month'/&gt ;&lt ;Value Type='Number'&gt ;&lt ;Month/&gt ;&lt ;/Value&gt ;&lt ;/Eq&gt ;&lt ;/Where&gt ; The key to this, is that you're only creating a filter at the root level, on the data view. Once they click on the folder, they're just thrown into the document library and can view everything within the folder. Hope this help! ps: on the html encoded I had to add spaces before the ';' so you could see the code.
