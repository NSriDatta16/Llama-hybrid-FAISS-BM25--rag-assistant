Edited after clarification Your logistic regression looks just fine. Maybe easier to sell, but similar, would be to use a chi squared test of independence between age and item 2 for people with positive item 1. An alternative to this test would be a trend test (e.g. test for non-zero Spearman rank correlation) that would consider the ordinal nature of age categories (also only for persons with positive answer to item 1).
