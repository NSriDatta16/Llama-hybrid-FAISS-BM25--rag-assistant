Validate 10% sample from population

I have two databases which include amount of passengers between two routes. One is the full dataset, while the other is supposedly a 10% sample. So for example, the full database will display a route (AB)= 4.000 passengers while the 10% sample should display route (AB) = 400, obviously. However that doesn't always happen, but I still want to be able to validate with a certain confidence interval how much can my 10% sample variate. I've been looking at different methods but so far bootstrapping for example doesn't seem to fit here as I can't figure out how to resample my route info. Meaning that I can resample the routes but then I'll have an absurd number for a certain route. Edit: About the last paragraph. From what I understand from bootstrapping, I would resample the amount of passengers traveling on those routes. However, this is a fixed number meaning that there's no shuffling. The only resampling I could do would involve attributing a new value for the amount of passengers on route AB. For example resampling those numbers would either be based on the other routes, meaning that I could end with a number of 1 or 5 million. Or I would just resample that value based on a percentage which then I'm not sure how it would allow me to validate the 10% sample. Saying so, I'm not sure how to validate if a 10% sample is indeed a 10% sample as there are no characteristics on the routes being analysed. It's just a sum of passengers, without any other characteristics.
