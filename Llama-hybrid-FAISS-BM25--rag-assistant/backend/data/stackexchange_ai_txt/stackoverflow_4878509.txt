AndyPC, unfortunately, you're out of luck. If you're dealing with an object whose type is an IXmlSerializable, the WCF JSON serializer delegates to IXmlSerializable methods first, gets the serialized XML out of them, wraps the XML in a JSON string, and just passes that on. This is one of the major weaknesses of the WCF JSON model in .NET 3.5. I think the entity framework (WCF Data Services) technologies try to handle this more elegantly, but not sure. I'd recommend manually using the JSON serializer and crafting up a string or a manual serialization mechanism that does what you want...
