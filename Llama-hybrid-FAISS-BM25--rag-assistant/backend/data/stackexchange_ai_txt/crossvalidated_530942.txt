It depends on how deep you want to go. Abraham Wald was studying sequential testing and stopping criteria in 1945 . It was further studied in the 1960 and 1970s (cf Ferguson, 1989 ). In 1989 Pocock and Hughes described using early stopping for clinical trials (I'm not sure if this is the earliest paper like this). As about first citations of using it in machine learning, the paper by Morgan and Bourlard (1990) is sometimes quoted, for example by Prechelt (1997) or Finoff et al (1993) .
