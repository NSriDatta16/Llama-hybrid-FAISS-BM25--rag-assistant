They probably doubt that you will make any worth while use of it, and they have summed up that the avarage gain from a level 1 programmer is very little. This is obviously a generalisation, so you should prove them wrong. Make a list of some of the features that you use in resharper demonstrating that you know Resharpers features, and for each estimate how much time you save pr. use. Add reference and add import statement (xx seconds) Move class to namespace (xx seconds) Generate property, method, field etc. (xx seconds) ... ... etc. And then make a wild guess how many times you do that a day, and add it conservatively up to minutes a day. Then figure out how much this saved time equals in cash a month, and counter that with the cost of Resharper. I bet it will be painfully obvious, that it would be a bad idea not to give you a Resharper license. You can spice it up with code qualitiy increases from the statical code analysis. If they still doubt you, give them a demo of some of the time saving features.
