Use source_location : class A def foo end end file, line = A.instance_method(:foo).source_location # or file, line = A.new.method(:foo).source_location puts "Method foo is defined in #{file}, line #{line}" # => "Method foo is defined in temp.rb, line 2" Note that for builtin methods, source_location returns nil . If want to check out the C source code (have fun!), you'll have to look for the right C file (they're more or less organized by class) and find the rb_define_method for the method (towards the end of the file). In Ruby 1.8 this method does not exist, but you can use this gem .
