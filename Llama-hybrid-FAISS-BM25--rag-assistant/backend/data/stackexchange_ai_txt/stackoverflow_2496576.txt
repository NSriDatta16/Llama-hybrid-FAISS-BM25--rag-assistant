There are additional resource identifiers you can use to target the particular Android version running on a device. For example, you could use drawable-v3 for Android 1.5 and 1.6, and drawable-v5 for Android 2.0 and above (or rather drawable-ldpi-v5 , drawable-mdpi-v5 and drawable-hdpi-v5 in practice). You need to have the three icons for the three different screen densities anyway (otherwise, it doesn't look so good after scaling), so adding an extra directory/icon for Android 1.5 isn't so bad. Or you could just ditch the Android 1.5 folder and let it have a "flat" icon â€” I'm sure users wouldn't be particularly bothered.
