The sysjobs , sysjobsschedule and sysschedules tables in SQL Server does a pretty good job of this. I wouldn't reinvent the wheel, I'd just copy their design. Here are some of the important fields from sysschedules freq_type How frequently a job runs for this schedule. 1 = One time only 4 = Daily 8 = Weekly 16 = Monthly 32 = Monthly, relative to freq_interval 64 = Runs when the SQL Server Agent service starts 128 = Runs when the computer is idle freq_interval Days that the job is executed. Depends on the value of freq_type. The default value is 0, which indicates that freq_interval is unused. Value of freq_type Effect on freq_interval 1 (once) freq_interval is unused (0) 4 (daily) Every freq_interval days 8 (weekly) freq_interval is one or more of the following: 1 = Sunday 2 = Monday 4 = Tuesday 8 = Wednesday 16 = Thursday 32 = Friday 64 = Saturday 16 (monthly) On the freq_interval day of the month 32 (monthly, relative) freq_interval is one of the following: 1 = Sunday 2 = Monday 3 = Tuesday 4 = Wednesday 5 = Thursday 6 = Friday 7 = Saturday 8 = Day 9 = Weekday 10 = Weekend day 64 (starts when SQL Server Agent service starts) freq_interval is unused (0) 128 (runs when computer is idle) freq_interval is unused (0) freq_subday_type Units for the freq_subday_interval. Can be one of the following values: Value Description (unit) 1 At the specified time 2 Seconds 4 Minutes 8 Hours freq_subday_interval Number of freq_subday_type periods to occur between each execution of the job. freq_relative_interval When freq_interval occurs in each month, if freq_interval is 32 (monthly relative). Can be one of the following values: 0 = freq_relative_interval is unused 1 = First 2 = Second 4 = Third 8 = Fourth 16 = Last freq_recurrence_factor Number of weeks or months between the scheduled execution of a job. freq_recurrence_factor is used only if freq_type is 8, 16, or 32. If this column contains 0, freq_recurrence_factor is unused.
