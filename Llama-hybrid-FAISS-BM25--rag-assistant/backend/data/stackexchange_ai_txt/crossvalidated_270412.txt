Are there any implementations/examples of hierarchical classifiers?

Currently, I'm using Scikit-learn in Python 3.6 to classify data with a 7-8 classes (e.g. [C, A.1, A.2, B.3, B.1.1, B.1.2, B.2.1, B.2.2] represented by dark borders below) but I started realizing that there is an inherent hierarchy in these groups that could be used during classification. I was going to write my own algorithm but I don't want to reinvent the wheel if one exists. Does an algorithm that can predict class-labels in hierarchical manner like this exist (preferably in Python )? If not, are there any examples of an approach like this being used? It reminds me of layers in a neural network but I do not have nearly enough samples for a neural net. For example, A.1 and A.2 in Level-1 are subgroups of Level-0_A . Level-0_C has no subgroups.
