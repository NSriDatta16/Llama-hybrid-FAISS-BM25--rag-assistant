Any simple solution that works is maintainable, reliable and performs well enough is a good solution. It sounds to me like you have already found a good solution ... An path-finding solution is likely to be more complicated than your current solution, and hence more likely to require debugging. It will probably also be slower. IMO, if it ain't broken, don't fix it. EDIT IMO, if the maze is fixed then your current solution is good / elegant code. Don't make the mistake of equating "good" or "elegant" with "clever". Simple code can also be "good" and "elegant". If you have configurable maze levels, then maybe you should just do the pathfinding when you initially configure the mazes. Simplest would be to get the maze designer to do it by hand. I'd only bother automating this if you have a bazillion mazes ... or users can design them. (Aside: if the routes are configured by hand, the maze designer could make a level more interesting by using suboptimal routes ... )
