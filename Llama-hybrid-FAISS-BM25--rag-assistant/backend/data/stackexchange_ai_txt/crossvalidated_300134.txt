Hypothesis test for the difference in Logistic regression probabilities (R glm)

dummy_data I get a standard error of the probability output for one observation: X So, I am able to get probability p1, and standard error SE1 respective to a feature vector X1 of observation A (a specific person doing something at a specific moment in time). Other observations (Xi) used to fit the logistic model are randomly sampled and independent. Then, suppose I have a new feature vector X2 with respect to observation A, which has a physical meaning of how the person behaved at another moment of time, which does not overlap with the first time period. I assume here that X1 and X2 are not necessarily dependent, so they can be arbitrarily different. I run the new vector of features through my trained model and get probability p2 and standard error of prediction SE2. I wanto to test if p1 is significatly different from p2. Z = (p1 - p2) / pooled_se. Question: A confusion arises when 1) I decide how to get a pooled standard deviation, and 1.a) what are the degrees of freedom? Are these the number of observations used in model fitting, or are these equal to 1, since I run a hypothesis test for just one observation?
