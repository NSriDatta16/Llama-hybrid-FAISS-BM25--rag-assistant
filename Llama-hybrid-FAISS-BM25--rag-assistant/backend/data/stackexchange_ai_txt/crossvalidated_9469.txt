Wilcoxon Ranksum Test aka Mann-Whitney is the way to go in the case of ordinal data. The bootstrapping solution is also elegant albeit not the "classic" way to go. The Bootstrapping method might also be valuable in case you aim for other things like factor analysis. In case of regression analysis you might chose ordered probit or ordered logit as a model specification. BTW: If your scale has a larger range (>10 values per variable) you might use the results as a metric variable, wich makes a t-test a safe choice. Be adviced that this is a little dirty and may be considered devil's work by some. stephan
