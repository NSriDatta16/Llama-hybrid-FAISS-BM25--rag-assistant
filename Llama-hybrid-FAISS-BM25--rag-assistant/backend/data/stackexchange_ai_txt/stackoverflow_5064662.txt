PostSharp and Visual Studio Code Coverage

I've recently started using PostSharp in some of my projects and have noticed an unfortunate side effect - the code coverage in all the projects its used with drops significantly. I'm guessing the reason this happens is that the analyzer sees the PostSharp code and a lot of it isn't tested (i.e. boiler plate code for generic exception handling and logging). I could obviously write unit tests for every method that use the aspects, but if I'm honest it feels like a waste of time. Has anybody got any experience with this kind of thing?
