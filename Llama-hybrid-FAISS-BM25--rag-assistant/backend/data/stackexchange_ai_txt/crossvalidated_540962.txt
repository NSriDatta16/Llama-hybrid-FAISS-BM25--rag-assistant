Statistical test to use for multiple categorical independent variables, multiple correlated continuous dependent variables?

I'm pretty much a beginner in Stats so please excuse me if my question doesn't seem too hard to answer. I have a dataset consisting of variables Treatment (categorical variable with levels Control, A, B, A+B), Year (categorical variable consisting of 3 consecutive years), Coverage of an invasive species (in %) (which we wish to eventually reduce), Coverage of native species A , Coverage of native species B (we want to see an increase in both of these variables), Coverage of dangerous species C , Coverage of dangerous species D (we want to see a decrease in these), and a few other technical measurements of the land which are of little interest. All the coverages of a single record add up to 100%, and the dataset is quite small with just 30 records in total. I wish to determine statistically which group in the Treatment column would help to achieve most of the desired effects as mentioned above, and not too sure which direction I should head to do this. After doing some self-research, I have 2 available options that I'm considering: Using MANCOVA with Treatment and Year as explanatory variables, and Coverage of an invasive species (in %) , Coverage of native species A , Coverage of native species B as multiple dependent variables. Someone also advised me I could try experimenting with PCA for this problem, but I am not sure how I could go about using PCA for this. Since PCA is mostly used for dimensionality reduction, would I need to wide-pivot the Treatment column into separate columns for each treatment, then one-hot encode them, then use PCA with target being Coverage of an invasive species (in %) , Coverage of native species A , Coverage of native species B to find the best treatments (principal components)? Any advice on how I should approach this problem is greatly appreciated!
