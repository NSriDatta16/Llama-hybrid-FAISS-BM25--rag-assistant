Avoiding spurious correlation in time series

I am investigating the relationship between monthly macro-economic variables, and monthly indicators of a company's performance and workload. I am doing this for predictive purposes, and I am particularly interested in finding models that predict changes in the underlying trend. Both X and Y data are seasonal with an annual cycle (12 data points). I have ~4 years of data (50 data points) If I am concerned about spurious correlation, should I de-trend the data, for example by using first differences, although I am interested in predicting the trend too? Are there specific techniques to fit a model to changes in trend? This post is a continuation of Finding all relationships from 500 independent variables to 400 dependent variables (time series) and What techniques can be used to predict a time series with another time series?
