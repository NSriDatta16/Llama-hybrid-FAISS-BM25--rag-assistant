What does your mediaLoader.php script do? Does it just check the database whether there are any media entries for the given story and if so format them properly and output them? Because currently I don't think you can slide down after the video is completely loaded, since you are embedding a vimeo video container, which handles the loading of the video itself and you have no access to it...
