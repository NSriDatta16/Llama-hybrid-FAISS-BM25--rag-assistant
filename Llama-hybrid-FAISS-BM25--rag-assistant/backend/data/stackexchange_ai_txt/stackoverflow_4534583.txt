What's causing "Unable to retrieve native address from ByteBuffer object"?

As a very novice Java programmer, I probably should not mess with that kind of things. Unfortunately, I'm using a library which have a method that accepts a ByteBuffer object and throws when I try to use it: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Unable to retrieve native address from ByteBuffer object Is it because I'm using a non-direct buffer? edit: There's not a lot of my code there. The library I'm using is jNetPcap, and I'm trying to dump a packet to file. My code takes an existing packet, and extract a ByteBuffer out of it: byte[] bytes = m_packet.getByteArray(0, m_packet.size()); ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes); Then it calls on of the dump methods of jNetPcap that takes a ByteBuffer.
