Derivation of the linear regression in sample error equation

I'm reading Elements of Statistical learning Chapter 7. I am slightly confused about one term in the derviation of the in sample error equation (equation 7.12) Can some explain/show mathematically how the variance term changes to become $\frac{p}{N}\sigma_{\epsilon}^2$ in equation 7.12? I know the $1/N$ is due to the fact that the second equation relates to the traning error, and so is an average loss over the training sample. However, I'm unsure where the $p$ comes from.
