If you have $N>1000$ samples and only $p=19$ predictors it would be pretty reasonable to just use all predictors in a model. In that case a PCA step may well be unnecessary. If you are confident that only a subset of the variables are really explanatory, using a sparse regression model, e.g. Elastic Net, could help you to establish this. Also, interpretation of PCA results using mixed type inputs (binary vs real, different scales etc, see CV question here ) is not so straightforward and you may wish to avoid it unless there is a clear reason to do so.
