I wrote a long and exhaustive blog article answering this question . To summarize, the general answer is "no; there is no benefit". However, there are a few special cases: Static fields should be set to null when they are no longer needed - unless the process is shutting down, in which case setting static fields to null is unnecessary. Local variables hardly ever need to be set to null. There is only one exception: It may be beneficial to set local variables to null if running on a non-Microsoft CLR. Instance fields hardly ever need to be set to null. There is only one exception: An instance field may be set to null if the referencing object is expected to outlive the referenced object. [Note that the semi-common practice of setting instance fields to null in IDisposable.Dispose does not meet this test, and should not be encouraged]. In conclusion: generally speaking, setting variables to null to help the garbage collector is not recommended. If it is deemed necessary, then an unusual condition exists and it should be carefully documented in the code.
