Smoothing will tend to "smooth over" the elbow in the data. If your view, based on domain knowledge, is that the true model has a major breakpoint or elbow, then you should consider fitting a model that is not smooth. I suggest considering regression trees or hinge functions. There are many methods for fitting these, e.g. gradient boosting and MARS. These are sometimes thought of as black box machine learning methods. That said, interpreting a model with only one independent variable is usually pretty simple.
