If I understand correctly, you're really trying to measure event counts among groups of different sizes. You could use a Poisson regression and add an offset for the size of each group. See When to use an offset in a Poisson regression? and poisson vs logistic regression for more explanation. Not sure if this will be better from a predictive standpoint. I have had good predictive success using linear models or GBMs with ratios as the dependent variable. It would be a problem if you have many ratios close to 0 or 1 as a linear reg will start predicting ratios outside of that range. After seeing your update, I would disaggregate the data and use the group as a factor variable in a logistic reg. What's wrong with a large dataset?
