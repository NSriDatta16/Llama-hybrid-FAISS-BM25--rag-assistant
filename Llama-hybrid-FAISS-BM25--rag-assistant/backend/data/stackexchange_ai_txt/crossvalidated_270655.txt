How to take Linear Model results with interactive variables & transformations

first post here! I have a project to estimate commercial real estate properties given categorical and continuous variables. I have ran a step-wise linear regression model to pick out a good formula in RStudio. (Adj. Rsq = .90 also, I know I need to do PCA and some type of categorical ANOVA test still, but I just want to get a beta estimator out before going deeper.) I'd like to figure out how to correctly deal with the interactive variables that have a transformed factor in it. Ex: log(Sqft):floors:building_materialWood from R . Normally it would be a simple natural log to cancel out the transformation but I feel like that is an inappropriate solution for interaction variables. Thank you so much! If anything is not specific enough I will do my best to further explain.
