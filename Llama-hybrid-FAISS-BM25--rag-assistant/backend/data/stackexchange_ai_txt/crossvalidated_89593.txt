How to initiate bias node in a restricted Boltzman machine

I am new to Neural Networks and trying to implement RBM. I am stuck on initializing the visible layer's bias value. Is it supposed to initialize to some random number or there is some probabilistic distribution by which it should be initialized. In python I am seeing: > "vbias = theano.shared(value =numpy.zeros(n_visible, > dtype = theano.config.floatX), name='vbias') " but don't know what is happening here in this line.
