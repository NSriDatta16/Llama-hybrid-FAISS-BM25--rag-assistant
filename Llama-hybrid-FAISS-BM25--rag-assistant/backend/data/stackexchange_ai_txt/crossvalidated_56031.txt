Very interesting topic. Here are my 2ct: as we already know that various groups influence the boiling point, I think it would make sense to put this knowledge into features the algorithm can use (like feature generation for image analysis). It may be much easier to improve the estimates that are available from such predefined features than learning without any guidance how to generate meaningful input. Coding features like alkyl chain length, various functional groups etc. may give you an idea what kind of algorithm would be suitable, because you need a method that can cover this kind of complexity. The choice of method will depend on your aim: prediction only or also description (i.e. do you also want to learn/interprete what the model uses to calculate boiling point)? The easy rules for estimating boiling point are similar to decision trees. So maybe decision trees (random forest) with regression in the leaves would be a starting point. In other respects, the rules would formulate differences compared to another substance, which would maybe more similar to e.g. artificial neural networks (e.g. a node "cis double bond" would lower the bp, and this lowering would be added up together with the output of other "functional group" nodes). The decision tree would build a completely different regression for saturated and unsaturated substances.
