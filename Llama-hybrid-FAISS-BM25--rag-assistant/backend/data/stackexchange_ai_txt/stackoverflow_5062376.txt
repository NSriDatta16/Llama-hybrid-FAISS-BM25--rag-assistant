bullet idea: on mouse_down start a toggle quit the toggle on mouse_up if the toggle is on, make mouse_move pay attention to the drag boundaries if mouse is above, to the right, to the left, or below the boundaries while the toggle is true - don't allow the mouse to move anymore, but make the scroll area move either up/down or left/right. hopefully this helps / makes sense.
