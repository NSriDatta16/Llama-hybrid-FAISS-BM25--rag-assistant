How to download xcode4 from windows pc (with IDP acc)

I was not able to download xcode4 from windows pc, even with valid iphone developer program account. No success even after spoofing the useragent string as mac safari with firefox.

Our mac machines download limits are throttled. Update - Solution : It is a stupid error msg from Apple. I was able to proceed to download once I agreed the updated license terms.
