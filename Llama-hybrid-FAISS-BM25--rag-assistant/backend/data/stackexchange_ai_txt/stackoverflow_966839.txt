It's easy to get a couple of hundred lines of code per day. But try to get a couple of hundred quality lines of code per day and it's not so easy. Top that with debugging and going through days with little or no new lines per day and the average will come down rather quickly. I've spent weeks debugging difficult issues and the answer being 1 or 2 lines of code.
