Visualising developmental binary data: plot model fit or data means?

In my disciple (developmental psychology) it is becoming common to visualise data as the fitted model with CIs, rather the actual data (means with CIs). The typical example is where we are interested in the development with age of the tendency to choose 1 rather than 0 in a simple binary choice task. Data is visualised as the fit of the logistic model (e.g. http://www.pnas.org/content/110/36/14586.figures-only ). With my own data I am comparing these methods. I am initially attracted to plotting the fitted model, because (a) I think it looks cool, (b) everyone is doing it, and (b) more seriously, because the method seems like it focusses on signal rather than noise. The problem is, with my data set, it just doesn’t seem to do the data justice. Have a look. One of these graphs is model fits (separate for two conditions), the other is mean at each age (each +-95% CI). The most salient problem is that the model implies that the two conditions are quite likely to have different starting points at 4 years, which is clearly not the case from the data. The models are the most simple logistic regressions possible (R glm default settings for family=”binomial”). I have also tried included a quadratic age term. The fit then looks a bit more like the actual data, but the conditions still don’t converge at 4 years, and above all the quadratic term is not significant and the model has worse AIC, so the quadratic term does not feel justified. Any advice?
