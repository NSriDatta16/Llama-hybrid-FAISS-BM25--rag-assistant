Online WYSIWYG PDF editor

Actually i'm looking for a simple online WYSIWYG PDF editor where i can build simple formular (image,text,inputs) with drag&drop, but i could'nt find any. Alternatively i would also accept a HTML WYSIWYG editor like ckeditor, but with an Grid option for placing absolute elements. With only absolute elements it should'nt be hard to write a PDF output out of the HTML source. I know the html2pdf stuff but last time i used it (about 1 year), those scripts where horrible slow and not quite exactly.
