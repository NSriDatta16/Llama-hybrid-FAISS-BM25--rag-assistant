how to solve the problem that the positive instances are much less than negative instances in dataset?

For example, I have a data set contains 100,000 instances. There are only about 5,000 positive instances and negative instances are 95,000. I wish to fit the data using logistic regression or svm. How can I do it? Is this a cold boot problem?
