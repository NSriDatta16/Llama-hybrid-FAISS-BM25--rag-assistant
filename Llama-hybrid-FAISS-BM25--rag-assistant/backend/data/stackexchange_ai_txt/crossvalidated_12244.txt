How to calculate the number of trials for a 'meaningful' result

Apologies for newbie question but have failed to understand what I've read about in this area so pointers to the correct methods would focus my attention. I have a piece of software which when tested repeatedly in the same way fails occasionally - say once in 20 runs. If I make a change to fix the problem, how many times should I test it to be confident (say 95%) that the changed software is actually better than the original. More generally: if a test fails a out of b times. After the fix , how many times (c) must it run without any failures to be confident to d%.
