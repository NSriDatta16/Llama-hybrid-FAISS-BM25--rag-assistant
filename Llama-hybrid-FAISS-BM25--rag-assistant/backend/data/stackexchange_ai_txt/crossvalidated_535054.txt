Is adding a dummy value to the entire dataset correct way to deal with zero inflated Bray-Curtis Index in R (vegan/ Biodiversity) package?

I'm trying to calculate the "cproj" i.e. the projection values of each species using add.spec.score package in BiodiveristyR. My datapoints however are zero inflated. I calculate the BrayCurtis index but it will not let me use the cmdscale since the BC scores generate NANs in the data set. However, if I add a dummy variable "1" to my entire dataset, the problem dissapears. However, I'm sure if this is the correct way to deal with this. Is there something else in the package which will allow me to deal with this type of error? library(vegan) library(BiodiversityR) library(ggplot2) set.seed(111) sp1
