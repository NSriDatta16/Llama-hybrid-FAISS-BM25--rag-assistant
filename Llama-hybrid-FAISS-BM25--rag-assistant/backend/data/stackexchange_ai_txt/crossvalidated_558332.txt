As pointed out in the comments, Bayesian inference would be a way to "pile up" evidence in favour of a hypothesis. This, however, would always fall short of a proof. I think an important point to bear in mind is that a single counterexample can establish that a claim is false, while no amount of evidence can establish that a claim is right; hence, using evidence alone we can reject hypothesis, not establish their validity. Edit: On re-reading your question I have a minor comment: you say "...if we can reject the null hypothesis, we accept the alternative." This is not necessarily the case. The evidence can be in strong disagreement with the null, and in still stronger disagreement with the alternative. This would force you to re-think your problem, and enlarge either the null or the alternative, as seemingly neither one provides an adequate model for your observations.
