If both the agents were designed by you, then the answer can be different. Consider the HTTP and FTP cases, we can use host names to distinguise multiple sites on the same port, then why can't we do it for SNMP? We can create a dispatcher who monitors port 161 for incoming traffic. Then use multiple real agents to handle those traffic behind. We can feel free to design how to distinguise them. Personally I prefer the FTP virtual host name manner and use | to distinguise agents. Maybe I can create a demo for #SNMP Suite in the future. But if you need to work with existing agents on the same server, then such flexibility is lost.
