Forecasting a time series based on a collection of other time series

I am new to Time Series analysis, but I read a lot of questions here which deal with how you can forecast values of a time series based on its history alone. Now, the data I have is of this kind : TimeSeries1: timestamp value .. .. .. .. Now, I have a huge number of other timeseries, which follow the same schema. Also the data is not seasonal. If plotted, the time series will look like a rectangular wave. What I want to do is forecast values of TimeSeries1, based on the aggregate behavior of all the remaining timeseries data that I have. I had a look at this question , but my problem involves incorporating a large number of other time-series rather than just one like in the above question. What are the possible approaches to this problem?
