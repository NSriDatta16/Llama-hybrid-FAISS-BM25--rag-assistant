Since both $X$ and $Y$ are normal distributed, they are as well $i.i.d.$ and you can use the t-test to test the difference in mean. If they would be dependent on each other, you could not use the formula provided because the standard error $SE(\bar{X}-\bar{Y})$ would depend on the covariance of $\bar{Y}$ and $\bar{X}$. For $X$ and $Y$ you are using data to estimate the random variables $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$. This means you are losing one degree of freedom as stated in your formula. In some textbooks, only the large sample formula is provided without adjusting for $dof$. The small and large sample formulas should come close to one another when $n,m$ are each larger than $90$. Then, the Central limit theorem should ensure that your sample averages follow a normal distribution. As for the critical value from the t-distribution, you should use $t_{n+m-2,1-\alpha/2}$ for two-sided tests and $t_{n+m-2,1-\alpha}$ for one-sided tests, where $\alpha$ is your significance level.
