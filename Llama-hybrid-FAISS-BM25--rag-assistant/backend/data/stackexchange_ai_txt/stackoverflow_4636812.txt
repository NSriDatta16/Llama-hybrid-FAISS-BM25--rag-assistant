(Note: assuming Rails3, since Rails2 doesn't have default caching.) This should work as you want it to out of the box: Queries caches are destroyed after each action ( http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html paragraph 1.5) In addition, it seems (http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2007/2/7/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-activerecord-explicit-caching) that caches are also destroyed on attribute/record updates Do you have a specific use case not covered by the default configuration?
