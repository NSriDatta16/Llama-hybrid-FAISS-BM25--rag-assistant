This is called the "parameter tuning" issue for SVMs. One of the easiest approaches is to take the median of each for the greatest levels of class prediction accuracy obtained as you go through the CV folds. Also, as a rule of thumb, use a simpler classifier to determine if your data are linearly separable. If k-nearest neighbor (kNN) or linear regression works better, then you shouldn't use a more expensive (computationally) approach like SVM. SVM can be easily overused, so make sure you evaluate linear regression, kNN, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, etc.
