I think when people talk about leveraging existing infrastructure with RESTful web services they mean they can use existing things designed for the web rather than having to use software specifically built for web services. For instance if I have a web service using REST I can take advantage of things like HTTP caching proxies, where to get the equivalent functionality with SOAP I would need something specialized.
