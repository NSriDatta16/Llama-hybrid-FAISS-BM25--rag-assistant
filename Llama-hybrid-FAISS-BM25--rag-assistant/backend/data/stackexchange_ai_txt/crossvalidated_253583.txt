The "M" stands for "Multi-class" (Hi Ã‰be! I'm a little late to the party.), in contrast to binary, i.e., two-class. For example, Freund and Schapire have "First Multi-class Extension" as the title of Section 5.1 in their original AdaBoost paper (Happy Boosting! K. Frank) where they present the AdaBoost.M1 algorithm. That paper is: Yoav Freund and Robert E. Schapire, "A Decision-Theoretic Generalization of On-Line Learning and an Application to Boosting, "Journal of Computer and System sciences, 55, 119139 (1997).
