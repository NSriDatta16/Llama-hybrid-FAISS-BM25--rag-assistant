You'll need to provide more information to get this question answered. Are you running in a Java EE container? Have you set a non-standard flush mode? Can you post your persistence.xml file? Be aware that 'persistence context' and transaction lifecycle may not be the same. Transactions Per EJB 3.0 the default transaction attribute for all EJB 3.0 applications is REQUIRED . The doc's for transaction type are here: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ejb/TransactionAttributeType.html Are you perhaps using the REQUIRES_NEW transaction type which will operate in a separate transaction? In particular, try using a local rather than remote interface for the 2nd and 3rd EJBs . Flushing With default settings a flush is forced before a query (if needed) to ensure results are correct: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/persistence/FlushModeType.html Try calling entityManager.setFlushMode(FlushModeType.AUTO); to make sure a flush happens before your query. Enable SQL logging in your JPA provider to be sure that the updates / inserts are really being sent to the DB prior to the select.
