C++: Code from the beginning of my project of significantly lesser quality

I've started a rather large 2D game engine project a few months ago, and I began noticing: The code from the first one or two months is quite different to the more recent one: The naming of variables feels a bit different Some code style aspects are different I'm sometimes wondering why I named some function that way, and can easily think of a better name The code feels rather messy There are parts where almost instantly a better way of doing it comes to my mind The code seems as if its quality was significantly lower However, at the time I wrote it, I was watching out to do everything right the same way as I do now. Now, for my questions: Is this a common situation, even in large commercial-style projects? Should I consider investing (a lot of) time in refactoring and maybe even rewriting the affected code? Is it normal that as a project grows and changes, large parts of code have to be refactored or rewritten from ground up? Is this bad?
