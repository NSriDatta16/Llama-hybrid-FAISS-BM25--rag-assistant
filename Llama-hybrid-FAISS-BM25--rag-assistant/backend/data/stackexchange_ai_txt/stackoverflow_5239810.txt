Disclaimer and warning: I work for Micro Focus, owner of the DevPartner Studio and BoundsChecker products. BoundsChecker 10.5, part of DevPartner Studio 10.5 (though you can buy it by itself), supports Visual Studio 2005, 2008 and 2010 unmanaged code for 32 and 64 bit applications in essentially the same way it supported 32 bit applications on Visual Studio 6.0. While enhancing it to support X64 applications, we found and fixed quite a few very old problems, and made a start at working in spite of the .NET 4.0 code present in some VS 2010 applications. I say "in spite of" because .NET 4.0 turns out to do a lot of very nasty things in the process space, doing some things that Microsoft warns everybody else not to do, and has a certain amount of built-in resistance to tools like BoundsChecker, which are essentially gigantic viruses. Anyway, since that release (February 4th), we have updated it to work on Windows 7 SP1 (which isn't quite public yet), and as far as BoundsChecker is concerned, we work with Visual Studio 2010 SP1 as well. We also discovered a nasty .NET 4.0 trap, and figured out to prevent it from taking us down. These enhancements and fixes will be available in our next public update, hopefully within the next month or so.
