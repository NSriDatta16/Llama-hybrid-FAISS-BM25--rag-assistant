So, I solved the problem, but don't understand why it worked. That leaves me slightly frustrated, but I'm grateful that the problem's gone. Before I took derobert's suggestion and traced the process, I decided to move the library load to the mod_perl startup file and voila, problem solved. Interesting that it took me a day of work to get to the point where I understood the problem enough to ask the question on SO and then once I got to that point, a simple thing solved it.
