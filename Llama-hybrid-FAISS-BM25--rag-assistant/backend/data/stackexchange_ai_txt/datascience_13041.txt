Which variables matter most for prediction of another variable?

I have a dataset and need to predict, out of 9 variables, which ones matter most to predict number 10. I first tried using the selectKBest method from sklearn.feature_selection and it looks like 4,5,6 and 8 are best. Then I tried to look at linear correlation using pearsonr between each of the variables from 1 to 9 and number 10, and I get 2,4,5,8 are most correlated. However, when I used PCA from sklearn.decomposition and calculate the pca.explained_variance_ I get these values [ 2.13128046e+01 3.44315766e-01 3.26052258e-01 2.67148345e-01 1.85871921e-01 1.55241540e-01 1.31994073e-01 9.34982387e-02 1.03297667e-02] Isn't it a problem that the first variable is so much higher than all the other ones? What does it mean?
