You should be consciously committing changes, not just whatever the state of your directory is. If you only commit what you intend to commit, the problem is moot. I almost always use git add -p and actually pay attention to everything that's going into a change. I change a lot of code throughout the day, and sometimes I'll go longer than I'd like without committing. It's easy to split up all that work into a few commits before finishing it up. That said, I do maintain a .gitignore and I quite often use git clean to wipe the directory.
