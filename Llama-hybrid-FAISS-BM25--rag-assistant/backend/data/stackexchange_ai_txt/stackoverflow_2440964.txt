If I understand what you are after... passing each line through a regex like this should work... You can use the perl debugger to play around with this. Hop into the perl debugger with just a perl -de 42 on the command line in linux/mac. (The "42" is just a valid expression - it could be anything, but why not choose the meaning of life?) anyways open FILE, " ) { @fixed_text = $line =~ m{(?:(" .+? ")) | (?:\A .* [^"] .* \z)}xmsg; for my $new_line (@fixed_text) { print qq($new_line ); } print qq(\n); } NOTE: Sorry I had to edit it - didn't see you wanted lines without any quotes at all... Yes, Regex and Perl is amazing. It should be 100% accurate and get all of your instances, acept in the case where a quote extends across paragraphs
