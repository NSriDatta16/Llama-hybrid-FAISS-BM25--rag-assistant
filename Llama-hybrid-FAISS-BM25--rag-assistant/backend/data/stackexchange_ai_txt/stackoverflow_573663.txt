Keeping your main form class short best practice

I have a main form at present it has a tab control and 3 data grids (DevExpress xtragrid's). Along with the normal buttons combo boxes... I would say 2/3 rds of the methods in the main form are related to customizing the grids or their relevant event handlers to handle data input. This is making the main forms code become larger and larger. What is an ok sort of code length for a main form? How should I move around the code if necesary? I am currently thinking about creating a user control for each grid and dumping it's methods in there.
