"I was interested to know its probability distribution and see if it fits other distributions" ... there is no reason to model the observed series which can be reduced to simpler structure. Failing modelling attempts one simple uses monte-carlo procedures using the cdf of the observed series to generate values for the composite BUT not time series traces. There is no need to transform your data see the following for clues on power transforms When (and why) should you take the log of a distribution (of numbers)? What I propose here is a 2 step procedure 1) characterize the series ..separating observed to signal and noise AND then 2) simulating white noise and using it to render a data realization of the model . It is important to characterize the series i.e identify the nature of the "curves" . In this way you can separate the data into signal and noise and focus on simulating trial/candidate noise processes leading to "similar time series" i.e. time series with nearly identical acf. In this way after a useful model has been identified one can then use simulated error processes and then "reverse" the model by injecting/inputting the simulated error processes to generate a trial realization of the data. This is essentially how one generates a forecast and the probability distribution to assess prediction limits for a given interval of time BUT we will not be forecasting here. Please post your actual 250 data points and I and others might be able to help you further. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF YOUR 250 OBSERVATIONS : One of the reasons I asked you to post your data is that I have long been a fan of simulation (dating back to the mid-sixties) as an objective way of evaluating strategies and suggested procedures. As I developed and improved model identification strategies , I conducted simulation of data in order to evaluate signal detection. I always have maintained a currency in simulation as a possible lithmus test. I took your 250 values and used AUTOBOX , a piece of software that not only has model identification BUT data simulation capabilities. I used it to take your data and identify the following model in order to separate signal and noise and then to use the model as the basis for simulations. Here is the ACF of the orig inal series . AUTOBOX rendered a model here with residuals here and acf here The Actual & Fitted values are plotted here Now the Histogram of the original 250 values is here and is shown for completeness sake while the histogram of the error series from our model is here and much more important in our exercise. We now proceed to use the simulation option in AUTOBOX which requires a model , presented here in a structured manner We ask the software to generate 0,1 random numbers and use them as the basis (input) into the model form to create a 250 period realization . This can then be repeated for as many replications of the 250 simulated values. I show here the acf of the original 250 values and the acf of the first replication of the 250 simulated values . The simulated series "resembles" the original series which is what I think you want to do. Your question could have/should have been worded more correctly. I guess you now how to modify your question given my answer. I suggest you do so. I suggest that you get hold of a good simulation piece of software ( and there are a few !) to allow you to specify the required equation for the generated simulation OR write your own code to do this . presents the relationship between an error process (perhaps the result of simulation) and the realization in terms of Y
