Nhibernate: Make Many-To-Many Relationship to Map as One-To-One

I have two items A and B, which have a uni directional one-to-one relationship. (A has one B) In the database these are represented by ATable and BTable, and they are linked together by ABTable. (From the database setup it appears there is a many-to-many relationship but there is not, it was done this way for normalization reasons). The problem is due to this setup, I have only been able to get NHibernate to map this as a many-to-many relationship between the entities. Is there anyway of making the entities have a one-to-one relationship? The best I could think of is to leave its has a many to many relationship, and then have two properties on the A entity one that returns a List of B, which would satisfy the mapping and a second non-mapped property that would get the first B from the list, to satisfy my application. - but this seems un-eligant.
