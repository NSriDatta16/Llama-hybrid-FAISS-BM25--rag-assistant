Time Series Components wrt Multiplication and Addition

I was wondering whether a time series can be a combination of addition(+) and multiplication(*) of it's components. For example $$ TS = Trend(T) + Seasonality(S) + Local Pred(L) + Noise(N)$$ or $$ TS = T* S* L*N.$$ But, is it possible that the TS may be a combination of + and * ? For example something like $$ TS = T*(S+L+N)$$ or $$ T*S+L+N$$ or something like this?
