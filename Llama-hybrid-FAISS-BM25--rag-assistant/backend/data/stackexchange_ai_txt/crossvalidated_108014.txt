$corr(X,Y)$ is just a scaled covariance so it evaluates, by construction, the linear co-dependence between the variables X and Y. To understand a little bit better how it works take a look at the covariance matrix formula . You'll realize it is a generalization of the variance formula, as it evaluates if two variables value vary in concordance or not. If they do, and their values increase together, the covariance will be positive, if when one decreases the onther decreases in the same way. If the way they vary is unrelated, then the average value calculated in the formula will be zero and we say the variables are not correlated. You can say this analysis is simplistic, as it does not provide an evaluation of the correlation when different $Y(X)$ or $X(Y)$ are not assumed. Well, the problem is exactly that: to strictly evaluate another dependence you have to assume it, and if you prefer not to do so the analysis of correlation through the covariance is the most natural. This said, you can evaluate the correlation using different indicators. Take a look at Spearman's Rank , in which you calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the ranked variables, and and a consequence you do not assume a linear dependence but merely a monotonic one. Or even the more recent (and arguably more powerful) distance correlation . The wiki plots similar to the ones showed before will show you the different capabilities of these indicators.
