If you need this functionality maybe your architecture is not well designed. Each activity must be in some way "standalone" so when it's stopped release any data associate with it. If you need to store some persistant data between activities use sql or some other data storage and if you need some shared resources between activities put them in service. Try to isolate any coupling between activities.
