My understanding of constrained ordination is that, rather than performing a singular value decomposition as is the case in PCA and using a sparse representation of the Sigma matrix, "constrained ordination" displays the residuals from a regression analysis adjusting for the other $p-2$ variables in the covariance matrix. These factors appear as a point cloud if they are in fact conditionally independent. If there are other unmeasured variables that you have not accounted for (mediators or moderators), you will see a trend in the point cloud like what you have shown above.
