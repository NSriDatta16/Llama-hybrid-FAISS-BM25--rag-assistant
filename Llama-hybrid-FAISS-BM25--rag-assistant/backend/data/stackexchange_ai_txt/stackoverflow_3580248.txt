rails sortable list not updating

I have followed the instructions on http://railscasts.com/episodes/147-sortable-lists for creating a sortable list. The list drags and drops as it is supposed to, but the sort action is not being fired when the link is released. I have tested this by putting a render :text command into the sort. No error's appear, it just doesn't fire off the action. I have tried other actions to test it and it doesn't go to them either. Index: [drag] sort_tasks_path) %> Controller: def sort #render :text => 'sorted' params[:tasks].each_with_index do |id, index| Task.update_all(['position=?', index+1], ['id=?', id]) end #render :text => 'sorted' render :nothing => true end route: map.resources :tasks, :collection => {:sort => :post} map.resources :tasks
