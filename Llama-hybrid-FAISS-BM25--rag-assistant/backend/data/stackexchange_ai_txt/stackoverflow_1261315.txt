reflow text in PDF documents (iPhone, CGPDFDocumentRef)

I'm using CGPDFDocumentRef to render PDF content for an ebook app. This works great, but it seems to preclude allowing the user to read text in "landscape mode" by tilting the phone- I have no way to reflow the text to make use of the wider space. (Yes, I can scale the whole page to fit the new space, but that's not really helpful to the reader.) Is it possible to reflow paragraph text in PDF documents based on a given page width? I realize that HTML does this nicely, but the "export to HTML" from tools such as Keynote just draws a JPG. If what I'm asking for is impossible, that would be an acceptable answer; I'd just like to know for sure.
