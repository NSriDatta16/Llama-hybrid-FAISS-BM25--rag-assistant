You could use Kim's Character-Aware Neural Language Models https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06615 as an alternative to word2vec. It uses a CNN over character inputs to produce a fixed size vector for each word. It can scale to previously unseen words. This feature of scaling to previously unseen words is why I prefer it over "simple" word2vec. FastText by Facebook is also interesting (and quicker) than Kim's model.
