Regex for random text replacement on input stream

I have a paragraph of text below that I want to use an input source. And I want the doSpin() function to take the stream of text and pick one value at random, from each [%group of replacement candidates%]. This [%should|ought|would|could%] make it much [%more convenient|faster|easier%] and help reduce duplicate content. So this sentence, when filtered, could potentially result in any of the following when input... 1) This should make it much more convenient and help reduce duplicate content. 2) This ought make it much faster and help reduce duplicate content. 3) This would make it much easier and help reduce duplicate content. // So the code stub would be... $content = file_get_contents('path to my input file'); function doSpin($content) { // REGEX MAGIC HERE return $content; } $myNewContent = doSpin($content); *I know zilch of Regex. But I know what I'm trying to do requires it. Any ideas?
