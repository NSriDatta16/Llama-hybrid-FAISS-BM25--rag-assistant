These guidelines are for those who are asking and those who would answer homework-related questions. They are rooted in two principles: It is okay to ask about homework . This site exists to help people learn and provide a standard repository for questions in statistics and machine learning, both simple and complex, and this includes helping students. Providing an answer that doesn't help a student learn is not in the student's own best interest. Therefore you might choose to treat homework questions differently than other questions. Asking about homework Make a good faith attempt to solve the problem yourself first. If we can't see enough work on your part your question will likely be booed off the stage; it will be voted down and closed. Ask about specific problems you have encountered in your initial efforts. If you can't do that yet, try some more of your own work first or searching for more general help. Admit that the question is homework. Trying to hide it will just get the question closed faster. Do this by mentioning that it is homework in the question text and by using the homework tag. Be aware of school policy (if relevant). If your school has a policy regarding outside help on homework, make sure you are aware of it before you ask for/receive help here. If there are specific restrictions (for example, you can receive help, but not full solutions), include them in the question so that those providing assistance can keep you out of trouble. Never use a solution you don't understand . It definitely won't help you later (after school, in later assignments, on tests, etc.) and it could be, at best, very embarrassing if you are asked to explain what you turned in. Answering homework questions Try to provide explanations that will lead the asker in the correct direction. Genuine understanding is the real goal for students, but trying to provide that is seldom unappreciated for any question. It's usually better not to provide a complete solution (or code sample) if you believe it would not help the student, using your best judgment. You can use pseudo-code and general descriptions first. In the spirit of creating a resource, you may come back after a suitable amount of time and edit your response to include more details, if the question seems like such information will have lasting value. Don't downvote others who answer homework questions in good faith, even if they break these guidelines. It's not always obvious at first glance that a question is homework, especially when you're not expecting to see it here. It is a good idea to suggest editing the response in a comment. Don't ridicule a student because they haven't yet learned something obvious or developed the good habits you'd expect from an expert. Do add a respectful comment or answer that points them towards best practices and better style. Don't downvote a homework question that follows the guidelines and was asked in Don't edit a question to add the homework tag . If there's any room for doubt at all, it's best to leave it as is. Instead, add a comment first requesting that the asker clarify the situation. (Adapted from an SO post by Joe Coehoorn as suggested in a meta discussion .)
