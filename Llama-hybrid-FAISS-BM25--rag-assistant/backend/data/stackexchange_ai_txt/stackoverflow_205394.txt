Having been on both sides of this process professionally, I can say that the following should be mandatory : the documentation of the code (javadoc, doxygen, etc) details on build process where to get current source how to file bugs (they will happen) route to provide patches either to the source or to customers how it works (simple, but often overlooked) user-customizable portions (eg there is a scripting component) primary contacts for each component, aka escalation path encouragement for feedback from Support as to what else they want to see I'm sure lots of other things can be added, but these are the top priority in my mind.
