Estimating equations solve systems of linear equations. While, you could take the antiderivative of the estimating function and say that's a loss function, they're not entirely theoretically or practically equivalent. $$ 0 = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i (\theta X_i - Y_i))$$ For instance, it's true OLS minimizes $$\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta \mathbf{X}_i)^2$$ But it also solves: $$ 0 = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}^{-1})\mathbf{X}^T(Y - \mathbf{X}\beta)$$ and it turns out this gives us a nice interpretation of the regression coefficient. Also Bayesian methods update subjective evidence with data. This also has some ties to optimization routines, but like EEs that is not theoretically or practically equivalent.
