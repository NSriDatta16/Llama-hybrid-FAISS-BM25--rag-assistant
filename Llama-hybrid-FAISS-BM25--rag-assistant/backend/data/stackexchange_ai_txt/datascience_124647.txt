What kind of neural network are you using? It could be invariant if the initial weights are always the same, but some NN can also have stochastic inner mechanisms (ex, noise and minibatches). In all cases, you can use the same random root number to always find the same result. If you use CNNs, you can run them in a deterministic way. It requires some setups. For example: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html
