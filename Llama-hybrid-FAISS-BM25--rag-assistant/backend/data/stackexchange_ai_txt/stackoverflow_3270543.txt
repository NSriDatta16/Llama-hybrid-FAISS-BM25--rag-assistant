Using red black trees for sorting

The worst-case running time of insertion on a red-black tree is O(lg n) and if I perform a in-order walk on the tree, I essentially visit each node, so the total worst-case runtime to print the sorted collection would be O(n lg n) I am curious, why are red-black trees not preferred for sorting over quick sort (whose average-case running time is O(n lg n) . I see that maybe because red-black trees do not sort in-place, but I am not sure, so maybe someone could help.
