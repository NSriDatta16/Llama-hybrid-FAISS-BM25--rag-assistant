Because # is the standard prefix for introducing preprocessor statements. In early C compilers, the pre-processor was a separate program which would handle all the preprocessor statements (similar to the way early C++ "compilers" such as cfront generated C code) and generate C code for the compiler (it may still be a separate program but it may also be just a phase of the compiler nowadays). The # symbol is just a useful character that can be recognised by the preprocessor and acted upon, such as: #include #if 0 #endif #pragma treat_warnings_as_errors #define USE_BUGGY_CODE and so on.
