At least, as far as I know, you can't. The reason is clear. In neural networks, you attempt to find appropriate weights to diminish a typical cost function. You have to find appropriate weights for a specified number of predefined weights. When you specify an input shape, the rest of the network weights will depend on the weights of input. You can't change the input size of a network. In other words, you can't feed your network with different input sizes for convolutional networks. A typical solution for dealing with such situations is to resize the input.
