for selecting usefull features that affect the outcome you could use some measure like PCA. here is a discription PCA toturial and here is a sample code : (its in matlab but you could easily code it to other languages) X = bsxfun(@minus, X, mean(X,1)); %# zero-center C = (X'*X)./(size(X,1)-1); %'# cov(X) [V D] = eig(C); [D order] = sort(diag(D), 'descend'); %# sort cols high to low V = V(:,order); mydimension = 10; newX = X * V(1:mydimension);
