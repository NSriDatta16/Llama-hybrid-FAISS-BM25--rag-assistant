WPF vs Windows Forms in desktop applications

I've been developing C# Windows Forms applications for a couple of years and while I've heard and read about WPF I've never really come in close contact to it. With some time to spare this spring I though I'd give it a go though, but first it'd be intresting to know what you guys thought about it. What do you think, is it worth the time to learn for a .NET desktop application developer? There's alot of other cool stuff I'd like to spend some more time with too, so if it's just "fun" and to no practical use I'd rather put my attention elsewhere.
