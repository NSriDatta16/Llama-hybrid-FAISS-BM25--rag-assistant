No, it isn't a good way to do it. Ajax is a tool best used with a light touch. Reinventing frames using it simply recreates all the problems of frames except that it replaces the issue of orphan pages with complete invisibility to search engines (and other use agents that don't support JS or have it disabled). By doing so, the ajax using version of the page would be some kind of extra feature, wouldn't it? No. Users won't notice, and you break bookmarking, linksharing, etc.
