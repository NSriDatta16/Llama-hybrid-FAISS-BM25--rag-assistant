Compute the power of Tukey's Honest Significance Difference (or cognates)?

I've got a simple computational model I can run experiments with. Experiments are "free" but I don't want to run it more times than necessary because it still takes time. All the simulation use the same parameters except for one condition which I vary and can take 4 different values (categorical condition). I know how many times to run the model if I want the power to be $x$ for the ANOVA test that tells me that not all categorical variables have the same mean. What I don't know how to do is compute the power of the post-hoc analysis that follows where I use Tukey's HSD to tell me pairwise which categorical variable is on average better/worse than the other. Is there a table (or function) anywhere that compute the HSD power? so far I am using the t-tests tabls but even they are not taking into consideration the bonferroni correction that the R package automatically applies when running it pairwise (sensibly, so).
