As you used tslm for forecasting on your timeseries, it would be important to see that tslm is used to fit linear models and both trend and seasonality components to the time series, taking the prediction horizon and the confidence level as parameters. Forecast intervals increase in length as the forecasting horizons ( h=length(x.for) in this case) increase. So, the longer the forecasting horizon gets, the wider(or broader) the forecasting interval gets as the uncertainty increases. This might not be the case for non-linear forecasting techniques like snaive , etc You might want to have a look at this excellent article for understanding better about forecasting intervals and how they get influenced with the forecasting horizons.
