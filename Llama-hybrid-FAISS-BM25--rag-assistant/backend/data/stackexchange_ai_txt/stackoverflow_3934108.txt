What you need is a setup for Hudson , Maven, Nexus Repository Manager and a Bug Tracking Tool like Redmine. The Redmine can be started with a Bitnami Stack which includes Subversion. The code analysis can be done by using cobertura, findbugs etc. with Maven (using Plugins). If you need more metrics take a look at sonar with support of a Maven Plugin. The Web-Site etc. can be done by using Maven (site generation).
