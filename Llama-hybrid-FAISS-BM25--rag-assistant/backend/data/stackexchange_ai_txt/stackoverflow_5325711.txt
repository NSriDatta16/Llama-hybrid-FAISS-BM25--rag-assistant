Cocoa: Create iTunes/Things like Sidebar with Xcode 4.0

Does anyone know how I can create a iTunes/Things like Sidebar with Xcode 4.0 (Screenshot: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7uvCt.png )? I'm pretty new to this and tried to play around with NSSplitView and NSTableView, but I've no idea how to get the "Title" (like "Erfassen" or "Fokussieren") and the Badges with the Numbers ("8" in Eingang, "4" in Heute) in it. Thanks a lot!
