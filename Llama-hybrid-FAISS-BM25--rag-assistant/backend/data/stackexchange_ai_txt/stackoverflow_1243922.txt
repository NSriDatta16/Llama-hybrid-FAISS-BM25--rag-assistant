It depends on what Prolog implementation you're using, but there may be library functions you can use. e.g. from the SWI-Prolog reference manual : 4.22.1 Case conversion There is nothing in the Prolog standard for converting case in textual data. The SWI-Prolog predicates code_type/2 and char_type/2 can be used to test and convert individual characters. We have started some additional support: downcase_atom(+AnyCase, -LowerCase) Converts the characters of AnyCase into lowercase as char_type/2 does (i.e. based on the defined locale if Prolog provides locale support on the hosting platform) and unifies the lowercase atom with LowerCase. upcase_atom(+AnyCase, -UpperCase) Converts, similar to downcase_atom/2, an atom to upper-case. Since this just downcases whatever's passed to it, you can easily write a simple predicate to sanitise every input before doing any analysis.
