Binary logistic regression in R - assistance with determining odds of a predictor at different levels

I have performed a binary logistic regression in R with whether or not a sportsperson was re-contracted or not as the DV. My final model is as follows; Model1.0 Draft year is a significant predictor in the model. I would now like to know what the probability of being re-contracted is for each draft year (1999-2012) but am unsure how to write the R code for this. For example, what is the probability of being re-contracted if you were drafted in 1999, 2000, 2001 etc (up to 2012). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Below is the summary output of Model1.0. Please let me know if any further information in required. Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.4290 0.0967 0.2981 0.6764 1.5981 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
