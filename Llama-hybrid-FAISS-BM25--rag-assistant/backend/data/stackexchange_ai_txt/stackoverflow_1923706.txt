Multiprocessing launching too many instances of Python VM

I am writing some multiprocessing code (Python 2.6.4, WinXP) that spawns processes to run background tasks. In playing around with some trivial examples, I am running into an issue where my code just continuously spawns new processes, even though I only tell it to spawn a fixed number. The program itself runs fine, but if I look in Windows TaskManager, I keep seeing new 'python.exe' processes appear. They just keep spawning more and more as the program runs (eventually starving my machine). For example, I would expect the code below to launch 2 python.exe processes. The first being the program itself, and the second being the child process it spawns. Any idea what I am doing wrong? import time import multiprocessing class Agent(multiprocessing.Process): def __init__(self, i): multiprocessing.Process.__init__(self) self.i = i def run(self): while True: print 'hello from %i' % self.i time.sleep(1) agent = Agent(1) agent.start()
