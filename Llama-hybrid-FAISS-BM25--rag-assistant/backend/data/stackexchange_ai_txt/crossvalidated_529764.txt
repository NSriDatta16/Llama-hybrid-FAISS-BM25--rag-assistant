Does Reinforcement Learning Make Sense for my task?

I've been tasked with using RL to detect a specific and sudden change in real-time waveforms. But I can't think of a way to frame it as a purely RL problem! The issue is that the algorithm won't be able to learn on its own; its reward would be based on how close it was to the time at which the change occurred. So if I simulated the waveforms, I would have to label each input waveform with the correct time. If I did the test in real life, I'd have to manually set the reward myself depending on how close it was. I don't think there's a way to do this without some form of supervision. The other issue is I'm not sure what the states/actions would be. I guess the action is detecting whether or not the change has occurred, but there wouldn't be a transition to a new state (kind of like the multi-armed bandit problem). Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!
