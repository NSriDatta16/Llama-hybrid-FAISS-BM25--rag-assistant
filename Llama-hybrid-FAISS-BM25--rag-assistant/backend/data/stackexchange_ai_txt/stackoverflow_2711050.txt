Fragment Shader Eye-Space unscaled depth coordinate

I'm trying to use the unscaled (true distance from the front clipping plane) distance to objects in my scene in a GLSL fragment shader. The gl_FragCoord.z value is smaller than I expect. In my vertex shader, I just use ftransform() to set gl_Position. I'm seeing values between 2 and 3 when I expect them to be between 15 and 20. How can I get the real eye-space depth? Thanks!
