sorry for slow response. I have been away. Analysis generally looks good. You state what your analysis shows in terms of significant main effects, interactions etc. Perhaps you are trying to keep your post short, but you don't always interpret your analysis. This makes it difficult to understand and to spot where you might have done something wrong. You've done a reasonably job of interpreting, but it could be improved. Make sure that every time you say you found a 'main effect' or an 'interaction effect' or you have 'removed data', you describe what this means in plain English. For example you talk about excluding data for Time...but i don't know why you have done this (this might be inappropriate). in general it look likes than analysis is appropriate and you understand what it means. One thing to bare in mind is that ANOVA is not always appropriate when your outcome is measured as a percentage. If your data was originally in the form of 'correct/incorrect' or zeros and 1s then chi square tests or logistic regression might have been more appropriate (see Using ANOVA on percentages? and Why use a z test rather than a t test with proportional data? ). People often use anova on percentage data, so i wouldn't worry too much about this. However, you could comment on the 'correctness' of using ANOVA when you discuss your results.
