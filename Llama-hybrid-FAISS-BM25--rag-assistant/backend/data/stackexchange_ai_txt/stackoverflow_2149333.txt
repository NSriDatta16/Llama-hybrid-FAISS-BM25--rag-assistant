ant keeps recompiling

I expected ant to figure out when not to recompile the files which are up to date - unfortunately it keeps happening. My build target contains only: In verbose ant output I get: conf: [javac] MissingConfigurationException.java added as MissingConfigurationException.class doesn't exist. [javac] TestConfiguration.java added as TestConfiguration.class doesn't exist. [javac] TestConfigurationStorage.java added as TestConfigurationStorage.class doesn't exist. [javac] Compiling 3 source files to /blah/build but they do exist and are available in the "/blah/build/com/blah/configuration/..." directory. How can I fix this?
