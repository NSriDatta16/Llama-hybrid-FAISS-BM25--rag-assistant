Test for change over time in a time series

I have a time series of anomalies in some data, with 69 observations in total. I want to statistically test if the number of anomalies in the time series have increased over time? Can I use a t-test for the purpose, possibly by dividing my data into 2 or 3 groups, and then comparing these groups? In case, I'm completely off, please suggest a better test/approach. Statistics, unfortunately, isn't my strong suit.
