HMCM vs Viterbi algorithm for calculating most likely path of an HMM

My expertise in machine learning and statistics is probably at a sophomore level. But anyway, my question is this: Given a Hidden Markov Model returned over a sequence of events with some states, how do you find the most likely path over the states given only the information to create this HMM? There are 2 things I've learned about in my research: the Viterbi Algorithm and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. As far as I can tell, the Viterbi algorithm is an analytical approach applying some math over the transition matrix of the HMM to find the most likely sequence of future states. And a MCMC is an empirical approach using a stochastic method over the transition matrix to find the most likely path over the states. I'm wondering if the previous paragraph I wrote is correct. And, if paragraph is correct, in what situations would I use one method over the other?
