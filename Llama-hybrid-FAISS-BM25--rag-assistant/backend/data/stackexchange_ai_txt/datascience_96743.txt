encoding of text data in NLP

I'm getting data using web scraping to create a dataset. I have a 'company' column that contains the names of the companies. I would like to encode this column but i don't know how to find the sentences that represent the same companies . For example: "International Business Machines Corporation", "IBM", "IBM India Pvt.Ltd" reprsent the same company. Any suggestion? Thank you
