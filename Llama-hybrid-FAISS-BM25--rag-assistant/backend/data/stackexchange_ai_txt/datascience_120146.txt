What are some approaches to improve the classification of ONE particular instance of interest?

I'd like to know if there are some methods to correct a specific misclassified instance of interest (e.g. in a Logistic Regression or Random Forest). Like maybe increasing the error for that particular observation or some other approach. Thanks.
