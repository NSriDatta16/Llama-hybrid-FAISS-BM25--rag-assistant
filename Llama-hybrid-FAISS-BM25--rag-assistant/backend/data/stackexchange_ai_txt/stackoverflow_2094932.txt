There isn't a general answer , only ones specific to language/platform ... but Small memory footprint ... Don't use Java, C#/mono, PHP, Perl, Python or anything with garbage collection Get as close to the metal as feasible , Use C Do alot of profiling to see where memory is getting allocated, if you are using dynamic allocation Ensure you prevent heap-fragmentation by allocating sensible chunks and sizes of the heap Avoid recursive functions especially those that use malloc(). Better allocating a chunk and passing a pointer around. use free() ;) Ensure your types are no bigger than required Turn on compiler optimizations There will be more.
