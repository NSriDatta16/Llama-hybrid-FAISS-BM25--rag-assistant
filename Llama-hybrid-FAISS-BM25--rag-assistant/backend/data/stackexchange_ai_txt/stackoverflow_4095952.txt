At Unicode, x3040-x308f: Hiragana including a few old chars. x30a1-x30ff: Katakana. including a few symbol. However,x4e00-x9eff are assigned for CJK character set. Not Japanese. CJK means China, Japan and Korea. You can describe CJK char area by unicode. However you can not describe Japanese Kanji area by unicode. Because in CJK code area, Chinese Kanji and Japanese Kanji are mixed. Not completely separated. Chinese and Japanese Kanji share some chars. But most of chars are different due to each sides' own evolution. See following site. It is quite heavy. And your computer should have enough fonts to read it. http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/en/general-info/unicode.html
