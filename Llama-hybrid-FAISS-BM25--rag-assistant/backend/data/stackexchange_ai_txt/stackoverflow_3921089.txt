lines not breaking in a paragraph

I am probably missing soemthing very simple, but the following is a comment posted on in my rails app and if the content is too long..then it doesnot wrap automatically withing the paragraph and overflows onto the page. The content of the paragraph is generated by Redcloth, though this particular paragraph does not contain any textile markup and I doubt the final result has anything to do with textile..I am probably missing a very basic css property somewhere. really really long paragraph ksdjfklajdskfjsdaklfjlaksdjflkdjsafkljasdfkljasdklfjs;lafj;klajsdf;kljdsakfljsa;ldkfjldaksjfklasjdf;kljadsfkljsad;kfjsa;ldkfj;adksljf;lkadjsfk;lajsdf;lkjsad;fkjads;lkfj;ladksjf;lkasdjf;lkdjas;flkjads;lkfjs;adklfj;ladkjf;lkdajsf;klsajdf;lksjadf;lkjsad;kfjsa;ldkfj;kladsjflkdsajfkljdask;lfjkldasjflk;ajdsflkadsjflkjdflkjadslk;fj;ldksajf;lkasdjf;lkjadsfk;ljads;klfjdask;lfj;ladkjf;lasdjf; Like
