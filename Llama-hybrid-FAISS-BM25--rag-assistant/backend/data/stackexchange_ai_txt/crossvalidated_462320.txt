Simplest example of a non-reversible irreducible Markov chain is a deterministic one with three states, that goes $1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...$ Observing that chain, you can tell if time is going forward or backward. I think your definition of an irreducible Markov chain is flawed, also. In fact, it's vacuous; $T_{ij} \geq 0$ no matter what. You might be thinking of aperiodicity, one definition of which is that for any fixed $i,j$ , $T_{ij}^{(n)}$ is always $>0$ for large $n$ .
