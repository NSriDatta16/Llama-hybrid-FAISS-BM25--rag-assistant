Why am I seeing a low F-statistic, but a very significant p-value in permanova?

So I am having some numbers which I can't understand...basically I am performing a permanova test using the adonis2 function, from the vegan package, and what I see is a very significant p-value with a very low f-statistic and I was wondering how this is possible. This is what I have: Permutation test for adonis under reduced model Terms added sequentially (first to last) Permutation: free Number of permutations: 999 adonis2(formula = transposed_taxa ~ Treatment, data = adonis_meta, permutations = permuts, method = "bray", by = "terms") Df SumOfSqs R2 F Pr(>F) Treatment 1 0.3506 0.08074 1.581 0.002 ** Residual 18 3.9912 0.91926 Total 19 4.3418 1.00000 I also tried an online F distribution calculator and, if I did the computations correctly (i.e., filled the proper number of degrees of freedom), the calculator gives me a non-significant p-value for the f-statistic I get from the test. Also, I tried the other way around, i.e., I provided the p-value and I got a very high f-statistics. However, I may be completely wrong and/or this calculator does not work for permanova test. What am I missing here? EDIT: this code provide the results i am seeing: # load library library("vegan") # set seed set.seed(131) # build metadata meta
