This question seems trivial to statisticians, but I managed to make this mistake twice, and after a colleague of mine also made the same mistake, I decided to write the answer, in order to help myself and other people making the same mistake. The standard deviation does not become lower when the number of measurements grows. . The standard deviation is just the square root of the average of the square distance of measurements from the mean. So, for example, if the "real" value that is measured is 1, half of the measurements are 1.05, and half of the measurements are 0.95, then the mean will be 1, which is just the correct value, and the std will be 0.05, regardless of the number of experiments. The thing that does become lower when the number of measurements grows is the confidence interval , which is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of measurements. For example, the radius of the 95% confidence interval is approximately: $$1.96 \cdot \frac{SD({\rm Measurements})}{\sqrt{{\rm Count(Measurements)}}}$$ So, the question comes from confusing between the standard deviation and the confidence interval.
