I'm most familiar with the machine-learning - data mining axis - so I'll concentrate on that: Machine learning tends to be interested in inference in non-standard situations, for instance non-i.i.d. data, active learning, semi-supervised learning, learning with structured data (for instance strings or graphs). ML also tends to be interested in theoretical bounds on what is learnable, which often forms the basis for the algorithms used (e.g. the support vector machine). ML tends to be of a Bayesian nature. Data mining is interested in finding patterns in data that you don't already know about. I'm not sure that is significantly different from exploratory data analysis in statistics, whereas in machine learning there is generally a more well-defined problem to solve. ML tends to be more interested in small datasets where over-fitting is the problem and data mining tends to be interested in large-scale datasets where the problem is dealing with the quantities of data. Statistics and machine learning provides many of the basic tools used by data miners.
