Estimate a sum using proportional sampling

I have some set of items. Each item has a weight and I can sample the items from the population with probabilities proportional to their weights. I know the size of the population. I want to estimate the total/average weight of the population. The population is assumed to be finite. What is known about this problem? Could you please give me some pointers to the literature?
