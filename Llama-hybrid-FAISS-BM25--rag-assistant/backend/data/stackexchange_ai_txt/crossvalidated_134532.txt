For binary classification you usually use 0/1 or -1/1. Due to symmetry it does not matter which label corresponds to which class. For multiclass classification e.g. for 3-class classification you cannot use 0, 1 and 2 because this way of labeling implies an order (I am not familiar with Iris dataset though) and cannot be used for categorical data. One way to encode categorical labels is to use (1 0 0), (0 1 0) and (0 0 1). You can think of these labels as vertices of a an equilateral triangle in 3-D. Therefore, no order is implied. However if you are using a binary classifier (such as SVM) instead of a truly multiclass classifier we cannot use this labeling. Instead multiple binary classifiers are trained and their results are somehow combined with each other. For example if you have N categories you can train ${N \choose 2}$ classifiers and for each pair you use labels 0/1 to indicate the two classes (out of N) you are training against each other. At the test time majority vote between all ${N \choose 2}$ classifiers can be used to make a prediction. If you are using an interface, perhaps it converts your 0/1/2 labels before interacting with the classifier(s) depending on what that classifier is.
