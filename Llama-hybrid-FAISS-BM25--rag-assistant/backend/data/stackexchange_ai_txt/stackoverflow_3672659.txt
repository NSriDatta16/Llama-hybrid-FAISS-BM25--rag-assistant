The shell sets that variable, but stores the knowledge internally (which is why you can't make cd an external program, it must be a built-in). The shell prompt is composed just before it is displayed each time, and you have specified using $PWD in yours, so the shell reads that in. Remember: the shell is just a program, like any other program. It can---and does---store things in variables. As AndiDog and John point out unix-like systems (i.e. including linux) actually maintains the working directory for each process through a set of system calls. The storage is still process local, however.
