Help in creating Enum extension helper

Take this enum for example: public enum PersonName : short { Mike = 1, Robert= 2 } I wnat to have en extension method like this: PersonName person = PersonName.Robert; short personId = person.GetId(); //Instead of: short personId = (short)person; Any idea how to implement this? it need to be generic to int, short etc..., and to generic enums as well, not limited to PersonName.
