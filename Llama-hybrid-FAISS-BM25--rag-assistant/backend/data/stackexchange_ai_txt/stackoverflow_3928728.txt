Any TWinControl's HWND can be created and recreated multiple times during its lifetime. The best place to call DragAcceptFiles() is in overriden CreateWnd() and DestroyWnd() methods so that you can (re)register during all (re)creations and unregister during all destructions, eg: procedure TMainForm.CreateWnd; begin inherited; DragAcceptFiles(Handle, True); end; procedure TMainForm.DestroyWnd; begin DragAcceptFiles(Handle, False); inherited; end;
