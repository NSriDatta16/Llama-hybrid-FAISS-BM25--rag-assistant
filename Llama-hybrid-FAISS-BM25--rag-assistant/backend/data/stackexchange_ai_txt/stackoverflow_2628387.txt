I don't know if you like to consider this. but I was once in your position and the neatest way i found for it was to put the whole #mygalley stuff in a separate page and call them from stepcarousel's ajax functionality. they will look nice. try it but then again. I think smoothly showing ajax loader and fading images when loaded is neat. you might think its crap.
