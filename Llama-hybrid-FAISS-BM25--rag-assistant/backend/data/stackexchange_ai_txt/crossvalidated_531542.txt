The results of logistic regression with glmer and glm are quite different

I'm trying to analyze the longitudinal data of clinical trial. The variables are event : Dichotomous (1, 0) variable indicating whether event occured. treat : Dichotomous (1, 0) variable indicating whether patients were assigned to treatment group or control group. time : The time point indicating when the patients were observed. We observed the patient at 1week, 1month, 3months from baseline. id : The id of individual patient For example, the data of patient1 is constructed as follows id time treat event patient1 1week 1 0 patient1 1month 1 1 patient1 3months 1 0 I analyze the model with generalized linear-mixed effect model using glmer function. Also, I analyzed it with glm function. Both model use binomial distribution with logit link. To analyzed the difference in change according to time from baseline, the model includes interaction term. model1 However, both model outputs very different results. For example, the coefficient of treat*3months in model1 was 1.25, and in the model2 , it was 0.81. When exponentiated, the odds ratio became 3.5 and 2.2. What's even stranger is, when I fitted both model with poisson distribution, the results are identical (0.51). How this happened? I would really appreciate for all your help.
