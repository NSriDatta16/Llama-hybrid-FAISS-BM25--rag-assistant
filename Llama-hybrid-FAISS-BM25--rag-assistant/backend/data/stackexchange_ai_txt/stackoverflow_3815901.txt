storage for uploaded images on a web farm

I work on mvc.net application. Client is going to move production on a cluster environment. The problem is I store images in the local file system. Images can be dynamically uploaded by users through web site interface. How can I change the application in order to keep the images in working state? The possible solution is the using of shared folder for all servers, but in that case I think I have to develop HttpHandler which will return images from this folder. So, it can affect the performance.
