Should I treat variables representing level of disease risk as ordinal?

I'm working with a study where we have collected the subjects' genotypes for risk factors for a disease. These can be homozygous non-risk (e.g. AA), homozygous risk (e.g. TT) or heterozygous (e.g. AT) where that may have no risk or partial risk. Typical analysis: logistic regression: Does MarkerConcentration predict disease independently of the risk factors, or visa versa? lm(Case ~ MarkerConcentration + Genotype1 + Genotype2) linear regression: Can the risk factors affect marker concentration independently of disease state? lm(MarkerConcentration ~ Case + Genotype1 + Genotype2) In our analysis, we only include cases which homozygous risk or non-risk. and coding those as 1 and 0 respectively. Would there be any value to treating these as ordinal variables with risk > non-risk? Note that we do not have sufficient confidence in any estimate of relative risk to use that information EDIT: I have rephrased the question to clarify that the genotype risk-factors are predictor variables.
