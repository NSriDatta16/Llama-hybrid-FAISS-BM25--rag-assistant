Inferring incidence from prevalence

I have a data set of patients with a risk factor for disease "A", which can be of grade 1, 2 or 3. The grade is determined by a lab value, i.e. Healthy , Sick (1) 20-30 , Sick (2) 30-40 , Sick (3) >40 . I have data that looks like so: No. Age1 Lab1 Age2 Lab2 1 21 21 30 30 2 23 28 34 37 3 22 26 27 29 ... Age1 is the first time Lab1 was measured in this individual. Age2 is the second time, Lab2 , this lab was measured in the same individual . I'm struggling with how to statistically describe the change in my own population. Should I average age 1 ( age1_mean ) and lab1 ( lab1_mean ), average age2 ( age2_mean ) and lab2 ( lab2_mean ) and discuss the average mean difference in lab values ( lab2_mean - lab1_mean $\pm$ 95% CI ) over x amount of years ( age2_mean - age1_mean $\pm$ 95% CI )? To determine the significance of the change in lab2 from lab1 in my population, I would use a paired T-test , correct? Because this is essentially just a "before and after" study of the same cohort. How can I determine incidence of this disease such to say the incidence of "healthy to grade 1" is x% $\pm$ 95% CI per year, "grade 1 to grade 2" is y% $\pm$ 95% CI per year, etc.? Lastly, I have access to CDC data that demonstrates: Healthy Age % SE 20-34 37.6 1.8 35-44 20.5 1.6 45-54 18.7 1.6 55-64 22.7 1.4 65-74 22.2 2.2 Grade 1 Age % SE 20-34 60.4 1.8 35-44 79.3 1.6 45-54 80.8 1.7 55-64 76.7 1.4 65-74 76.1 2.3 ... And so forth to include tables for grade 2 and grade 3. The CDC data is actually just prevalence since its a snap shot in time, but can I infer incidence in any way? I'm assuming you can but it is subject to many assumptions. If so, how would I conduct a hypothesis test to demonstrate that the incidence I determined in question 3 is significantly higher or lower than the what the CDC incidence suggests?
