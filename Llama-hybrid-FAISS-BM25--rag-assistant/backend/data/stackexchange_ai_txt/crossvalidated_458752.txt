As a rule of thumb, independent of multi-label classification, it's better to use stratified folds such that each fold has similar amounts from each class. This is useful in adjusting prior beliefs, which can prevent errors causing from over-representation. This is harder for multi-label problems, depending on your way of course. But, since your average number of classes per sample is close to $1$ , it doesn't seem to be a major problem for you.
