Lisp, OCaml or what for Runge Kutta?

Which language would you propose for solving a system with: first order differential equations complex variables N-dimensions using 4th order Runge Kutta or the like. Speed matters a lot but would sacrifice for: Elegant (clean and short) code Flexibility + scalability I'm mostly between a Lisp and OCaml but any other suggestion is welcomed. Thanks!
