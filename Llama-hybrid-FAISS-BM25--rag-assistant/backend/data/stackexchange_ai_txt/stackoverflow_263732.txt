The script x-git-update-to-latest-version will compile and install the latest version of git (from the git repository). It's set to use the current HEAD revision of the master branch, but it should be easy enough to add a line or two to git checkout the stable branch. It installs git into /usr/local/git-v1.6.0.2-287-g3791f77/ (for example), then symlinks /usr/local/git/ to the latest directory. You can set it to run periodically (nightly?), either via cron (which is extremely simple, but has some irritating issues on OS X 10.5.x), or the slightly convoluted launchd ( Lingon is a nice interface to this, although to start the job running without logging in/out, you have to run the command launchctrl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/mylaunchagent.plist )
