Presumably user_name is a variable, originally provided by a user of your site? In that case you absolutely must escape it when embedding it in an SQL query, or you will be prone to injection attacks: $result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM mail WHERE to='".mysql_escape_string($_SESSION['valid_user'])."'");
