How to determine what % of variance is due to noise (with limited data)

this is a difficult question and perhaps not answerable without further data. I have a list of staff that get monthly scores that are averages of customer ratings. (95%, 75%, 89%) So, the most granular data I have, is each individual rating score from customers for each individual staff. My question is -- how do I determine what % of that score is either noise, or outside the scope of the variable (individual's name). Let's get down to brass tacks. Of office has an overall satisfaction rating. Say one month it's 80% ---- the next month it's 81%, or 79%. Some colleagues are really putting a lot of stock in these tiny needle moves. Moves that are quite possibly --- just noise variance and are ultimately meaningless. But, at what point due we separate noise from true movement? Would I be looking at standard deviation of the individual scores, or the aggregate monthly scores? Hmm for some reason I just don't know where to begin here.
