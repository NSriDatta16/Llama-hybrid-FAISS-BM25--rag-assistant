Rust or C++ for computational statistics?

I'll work on developing computer-intensive Bayesian sampling algorithms for spatio-temporal applications (e.g. MCMC, KF). So far, I'm thinking of coding my algorithms in C++. However, I've heard that Rust is becoming popular within the scientific computing community. Would you recommend Rust over C++ and why/why not? Or for the matter, which language would you recommend for developing statistical computing algorithms?
