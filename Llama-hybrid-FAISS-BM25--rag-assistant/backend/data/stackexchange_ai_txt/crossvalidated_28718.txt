I don't think that the fact that you have found significant differences in all fifteen of your comparisons makes a difference. To maintain the familywise error rate, I would be tempted to simply apply a Bonferroni correction. Perhaps it's good to be conservative in this instance given your small sample size (indeed, even smaller than the number of comparisons you are making) and the fact that you began the analysis with no predefined assumptions. Although if this latter fact is true, replication in an independent population would really be in order if you want to make stronger conclusions.
