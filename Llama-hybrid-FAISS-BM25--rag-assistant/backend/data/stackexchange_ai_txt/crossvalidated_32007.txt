Which statistical method should I use to prove significant difference for my picture?

I would like to confirm my biological hypothesis with statistical approach. Red line on picture represents average frequency of some biological phenomenom for whole chromosome. Chromosome consists of milions of bases, which can be understood as positions. So that we have milions of positions total. Then I, using certain rule, pick up 100 positions. For these 100 positions I determine frequency of the same biological phenomenon (so that I have 100 isolated points, for every x there is y and they are connected by lines, as seen on picture). Because picture shows just these positions, red line does not represent average of picture (it represents average of whole chromosome). I want to show that freguency at my certain positions is significantly higher than average (so that the biological process I observe is really there). My data are from database,so my output is what I calculated using this database-there are no more measurements or data of this kind. y-axis represent counts, not ratios. Adjacent points on graph are neighbours on the chromosome, so one could expect that two neighbours on the chromosomes do experience same/similiar biological process. I am a computer scientist (with one course of statistics so I have an idea) - detailed howto would be appreciated. However, advice about which method to use may be fair enough :-)
