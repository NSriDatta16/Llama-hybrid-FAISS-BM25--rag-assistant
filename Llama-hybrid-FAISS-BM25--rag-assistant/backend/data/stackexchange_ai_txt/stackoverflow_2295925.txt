Here's a variant of @RTBarnard's answer using the tabularx package: \documentclass[a4paper,twoside,draft,12pt]{article} \usepackage{tabularx} \begin{document} \section{Work Experience} \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\raggedleft}X|p{8cm}} Current & Your job at Your Company, Town \\ Jan 2009 & What your company does \\ & A description of what you do\\ \end{tabularx} \section{Education} \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\raggedleft}X|p{8cm}} Somewhat wider than first column, overflowing into additional lines & University, Town \\ Jan 2009 & Thesis subject \\ & A description of what you did\\ \end{tabularx} \end{document} Notes: Why tabularx ? Because it's often easier to know the width you have available for the whole table, and to let TeX calculate the unknown column widths. The first parameter is the overall table width. Here, I've specified \textwidth to fill the width of typeblock, but you can change that to whatever measure you need. I've used \raggedright rather than \hfill : if the item flows onto a second line, \hfill will only right-align the first line of the paragraph. Was the \multicol significant? I've removed it to keep the answer as simple as possible. Run with XeTeX under TeXLive.
