Measure execution time

I want to measure the time it takes to generate DES Key, and I want to compute it several time, so that I can find the average value. for (int x = 0; x but the result comes out like Total Time Taken : 251 Total Time Taken : 0 Total Time Taken : 0 Total Time Taken : 0 Total Time Taken : 0 Total Time Taken : 0 Total Time Taken : 0 Total Time Taken : 0 Total Time Taken : 0 Total Time Taken : 0 I tried to dispose the key object by setting it to null and then calling System.gc(); but it didn't work. Any suggestion or idea to overcome this problem.
