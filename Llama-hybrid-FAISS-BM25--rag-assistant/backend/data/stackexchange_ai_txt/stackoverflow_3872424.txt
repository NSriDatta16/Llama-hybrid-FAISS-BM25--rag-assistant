WiX GAC install and regasm for the same dll doesn't work

I am creating an installer using WiX which contains few dlls. In the original script first gacutil.exe and then regasm for each dll is called. I am having a problem when transfering this idea into WiX. Here is the code fragment for installing into GAC : Now the question is how WiX will perform the assembly registration? My problem is: I can't create another in the same component cause there must be only one keyPath="yes" attribute/component. I can't put keyPath="yes" in component level, as it breaks component reference counting system. I can't create without keyPath="Yes", as it generates compilation error. I can't create a seperate component as two components will try to install same file. I know I don't need to call regasm or regsvr32 when using heat . In the component code : should be enough for the registration. I'm using heat and now I'm stuck as I have to do assembly registration also.
