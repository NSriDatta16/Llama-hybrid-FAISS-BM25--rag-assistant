To address the implied second question, the reason you have validation issues when you have a inside a is because nesting headers inside of paragraphs is not allowed in HTML 4.0 and XHTML. To expound, headings and paragraphs are semantic concepts, meant to inform the structure of your document and not imply anything about the appearance of their content (granted, they do appear different by default but that's not the point of their usage). It follows that a heading shouldn't be contained within a paragraph. If your implementation calls for nesting headers inside of paragraphs you might want to rethink your approach to what you're trying to accomplish. If the intent is to indicate structurally "this is a heading", consider why a heading would be inside a paragraph. If the intent is to make certain text within a paragraph look different, then you would want to use one of the inline elements such as a span or em, with associated CSS styling.
