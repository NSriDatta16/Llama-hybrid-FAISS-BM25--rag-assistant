Is it still considered time series if one uses additional signals

Apologies in advance, time series is not my strength. Say I want to predict f(T+1) using f(T-1, T-2, ..., T-N) -- for example using a multi-level preceptron. If I want to enhance this using some other signals say using weather data on times T-1, T2, ..., T-N Would this still be considered Time Series Analysis? Thanks.
