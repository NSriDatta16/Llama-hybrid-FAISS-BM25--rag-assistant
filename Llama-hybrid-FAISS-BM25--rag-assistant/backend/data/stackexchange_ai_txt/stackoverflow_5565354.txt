It would appear that re-building a clean CE Image and copying it onto the flash disk isn't enough when dealing in configurations like this. Once I formatted the flash disk and created it clean with this image the new settings 'took' and everything went to the correct places. I believe this is down to my set-up using a flash based storage for the registry which isn't automatically over-written when a new NK.BIN file is deployed.
