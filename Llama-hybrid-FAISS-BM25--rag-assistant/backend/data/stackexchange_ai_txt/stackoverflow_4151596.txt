It is hard to tell from the above error message and code snippet, but is it possible that this action is making the assumption that you are logged in to the site? My first thought is that the application has some type of a state (cookie, session, etc) and that when you are visiting the website you already have established your state with the app and therefore you do not experience any problems. The Google Bot on the other hand, may just be jumping right to this page and will lack any state your site might assume was already setup. Another thing that pops to my mind, is the captcha control could be making some rendering decisions based on user agent. Perhaps the user agent the Google Bot is using isn't liked by your captcha control. Try getting one of those Firefox plugins that lets you change your user agent, and set it to the value you see in your logs. Hit your website and see what happens.
