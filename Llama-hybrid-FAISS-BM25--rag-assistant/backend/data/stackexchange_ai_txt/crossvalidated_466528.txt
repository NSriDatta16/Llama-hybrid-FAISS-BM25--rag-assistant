That differential equation is how Gauss arrived at the normal distribution in 1809. Gauss wanted to rationalize the choice of the average as an estimator of a location parameter. He imposed the following conditions for the distribution of errors: The density function $\phi(x)$ is differentiable. $\phi(-x) = \phi(x)$ . $\phi(x)$ is maximum at $x=0$ . Given multiple measurements of the same quantity corrupted by additive i.i.d. errors, the most likely value of the quantity is the average of the measurements. From these conditions, he obtained the differential equation $\phi'(x) = -hx \phi(x)$ from which the normal pdf follows (recognizing $h$ as the precision parameter). You can find the full derivation (in modern notation) in "The Evolution of the Normal Distribution" by Saul Stahl .
