OK, I tested both. Even for my basic formatting requirements, CKEditor generated quite ghastly html Now this is the input This actually appears to be better I hope users understand what we are doing Lets see But in the meantime CKEditor Output This actually appears to be better I hope users understand what we are doing Lets see &nbsp; But in the meantime And Markdown Output This actually appears to be better I hope users understand what we are doing Lets see But in the meantime Now if this is the difference between these two for the most basic formatting (linebreaks and paragraphs), what will it be like in a 200 word submission. I think most users will need to know only this For line breaks, two SPACES and hit ENTER. For new paragraphs, hit ENTER twice The rest of the stuff could be learnt incrementally Is it that hard to engineer a 'basic' WYSIWYG editor? EDIT After adding these to config.js above problem is solved config.enterMode = CKEDITOR.ENTER_BR; config.shiftEnterMode = CKEDITOR.ENTER_P;
