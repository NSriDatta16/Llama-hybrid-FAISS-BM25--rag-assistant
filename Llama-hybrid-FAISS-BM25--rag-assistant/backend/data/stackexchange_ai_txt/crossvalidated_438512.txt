Yes, because SVM is trying to maximize the margin between supporting planes. The margin is $2\over||\theta||$ , which is the distance between the supporting hyperplanes. Distance between parallel hyperplanes is $\frac{\text{bias difference}}{||\text{normal vector}||}$ , where normal vector is $\theta$ here. For classes $1,-1$ the bias terms are $1-\theta_0$ and $-1-\theta_0$ , so their difference is $2$ . Maximizing this term is equivalent to minimizing $\frac{||\theta||^2}{2}$ .
