Neural network performance evaluation

I'm just getting started with NN in tensorflow/keras, and need some basic guidelines for what to do. I'm going to use pretrained model, and set of random images - totally random, few (~20) of them. Now, I want to evaluate how model is performing. I would like to generate some plots or score that would show, lets say low values -> indicating that model is not trained to recognize this kind of objects , and high values when predictions are good. What should I keep track of? Overall model prediction certainty? It's not done via model.validate - rigt? Validation is made with validation dataset with correct labels, right? I know its a broad question, but any answer will help!
