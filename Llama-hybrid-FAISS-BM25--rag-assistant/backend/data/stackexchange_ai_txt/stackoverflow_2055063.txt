I've observed, and certainly read somewhere, here or here , that unit-tests that test the implementation are more brittle that tests that test the behavior of the code. Or, white box unit-tests are more brittle than black box unit-tests. For instance, a test of a class that stores things directly peeks into the object data members to verify if things are stored, will be broken when the storage implementation changes.
