xsl:include of another xslt file from Win32 resources

I'm using xslt transformer in my C++ Win32 application and several xsl files that have a common part that I would like to separate into another xsl file. All xsl files are stored as resources. The only way I encountered for xsl:include is using res:// protocol that does not work properly for xsl files (at least on two of my Windows installations loading of resulting xslt file returned an error and on one installation it worked allright). MSDN also mentions about the problem: http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb%3Ben-us%3B220830&x=13&y=12 Do I have any other options except: Implementing my own protocol handler for loading included xsl files - does not worth doing. Avoiding and substituting included files myself - too clumsy. Duplication of common part in all templates - no, thanks.
