Pseudo-$R^2$: what are the null models for linear and non-linear regressions?

I have data from an experiment. The independent variable is time, the dependent variable is mass loss of organic matter. Now I want to compare whether a linear or a non-linear model fits better. From my understanding the $R^2$ (adjusted or not) should not be used and instead I should go for pseudo-$R^2$ measures (e.g. McFadden, Nagelkerke). Is this true? If so I don't understand how to get the null models for the linear and non-linear model which are needed to calculate the McFadden Pseudo-$R^2$. I am doing all statistics in R and I used the nls function for the non-linear and the lm function for the linear model. Now, I wanted to implement the Pseudo-$R^2$ by McFadden (1-(LL1/LL0)) but I am stuck in finding the null models. Can someone please explain me the best way to compare a linear and a non-linear model? Any search on the web did not yield a solution. Any direct help or linkage to other websites/posts is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance and have a nice weekend, Stefan
