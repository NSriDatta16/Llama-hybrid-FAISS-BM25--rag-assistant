Logistic Regression Power Analysis with Multiple Predictors

So I'm working on my dissertation and I'm trying to figure out a binary logistic regression power analysis to show how many participants I should collect. My proposed analysis is as follows and the range of sample sizes I've gotten. My question is, am I doing this correctly using R and if not, where would you suggest modifications. There are 3 binary outcomes: past, present, and future treatment seeking (answered as yes/no during interview). To run this power analysis in R, there were two packages I could use (powerMediation and WebPower). Both packages required finding values that represent the probability of observing 1 for the outcome variable Y when predictor X equals 1 (p1) and probability of observing 1 for the outcome variable Y when predictor X equals 0 (p0). As the literature did not explicitly look at the proposed predictors, and a pilot study has not been done, I had to make some assumptions for these values based on what the prior literature showed based on mental health treatment utilization. I have several predictors that are all continuous variables. Ideally, I would run these together with each out my 3 outcomes (so 3 tests overall), but I'm not seeing where any of the power analyses take multiple predictors into consideration. For WebPower this is the formula I was using: wp.logistic(p0= value , p1= value , alpha=0.05, power=0.80, alternative="two.sided", family="normal") For powerMediation this is the formula I was using: SSizeLogisticBin(p1 = value , p2 = value , B = 0.5, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8) The range of values I used are below. The range of sample sizes vary from as low as 21 participants to as high as 1907 participants.
