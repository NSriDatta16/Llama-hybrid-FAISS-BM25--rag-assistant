Is it meaningful to perform statistical methods after multidimensional scaling?

Suppose I have data which I want to cluster, for example. I am not sure that the data are Euclidean i.e. they are really points in a Euclidean space with Euclidean metric. So I can try to first perform multidimensional scaling to get a Euclidean representation, and then do usual k-means clustering on this representation. Is this a meaningful idea? It just seems to me that since MDS respects the original (non-Euclidean) distance matrix, clustering by k-means would yield similar result both before and after MDS. Similarly, once I do get Euclidean data after doing MDS, can I do PCA, ICA, etc. because these depend on the variances, and variance is associated with Euclidean distance?
