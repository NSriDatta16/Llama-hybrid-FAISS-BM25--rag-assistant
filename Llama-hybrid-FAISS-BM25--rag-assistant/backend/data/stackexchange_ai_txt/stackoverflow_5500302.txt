A different kind of jquery sortable

I have elements of different sizes that are arranged somewhat acording to a grid (like in the image below) and I want to drag and drop properly those elements. Is there a plugin that would do that? Sortable does not do it properly... EDIT: By "properly" I mean it should act normal (meaning if I drag and drop the big one on the right it should rearrange inteligently). Maybe I just need to see one that does what I want and I'll make it do stuff "properly" EDIT: If you move the big block on the right (how it should look like). EDIT: I just want a way to rearrange a grid-like layout like this one. I can accept other ideas..
