A common answer is to suggest that covariance is used when variables are on the same scale, and correlation when their scales are different. However, this is only true when scale of the variables isn't a factor. Otherwise, why would anyone ever do covariance PCA? It would be safer to always perform correlation PCA. Imagine that your variables have different units of measure, such as meters and kilograms. It shouldn't matter whether you use meters or centimeters in this case, so you could argue that correlation matrix should be used. Consider now population of people in different states. The units of measure are the same - counts (number) of people. Now, the scales could be different: Vermont has 600K and CA - 38M people. Should we use correlation matrix here? It depends. In some applications we do want to adjust for the size of the state. Using the covariance matrix is one way for building factors that account for the size of the state. Hence, my answer is to use covariance matrix when variance of the original variable is important, and use correlation when it is not.
