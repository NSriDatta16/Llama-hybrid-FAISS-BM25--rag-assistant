Using UIPanGestureRecognizer and CATransform3DScale to enlarge dragged element

I want to implement a delayed 'enlarging' animation on an UIView that is being dragged using an attached UIPanGestureRecognizer. I've been using something similar to the following code: UIView* innerView; CGPoint startingPoint; - (void)viewDidLoad { innerView = [[[UIView alloc] autorelease] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 200)]; [[self view] addSubview:innerView]; [innerView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor blueColor]]; [innerView addGestureRecognizer:[[[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] autorelease] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(pan:)]]; // resize it later [self performSelector:@selector(anim) withObject:nil afterDelay:1.5]; } -(void)pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer*)gr { CGPoint gesturePoint = [gr translationInView:[self view]]; if (gr.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) startingPoint = innerView.center; else innerView.center = CGPointMake(startingPoint.x + gesturePoint.x, startingPoint.y +gesturePoint.y); } -(void)anim{ innerView.layer.transform = CATransform3DMakeScale(1.5, 1.5, 1); } But the view 'jumps' when being dragged after the scale is applied. This behavior doesnt happen always, but in pseudo-random manner. Any one can shed light on this issue or propose a different approach?
