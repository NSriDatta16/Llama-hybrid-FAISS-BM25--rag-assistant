It's best to save them directly on the file system. Why would you want to store it in a database? are there additional information you need to store together with it? (Like titles, descriptions etc)? If not, I'd write it directly into the filesystem. Basically you could save it into the data folder of your app (where the shared preferences, and sqlite db are stored too). However, I personally think this should be discouraged, as it reduces the available memonry on the /data partition (which is already tooo small on Android phones. Most phones have less than 50 MB free on data (this means: less than 50 MB for apps, which can't be partly moved to SD card). You should always safe such fines on SD card if possible, so you don't lower free space on data partition too much. Even with Froyo's A2SD feature, not all data of an installed app is moved on the SD card. The *.dex files (which often ranges between 10-50% of the total size of an app) still remains on /data partition. So does the settings and sqlite databases this apps uses. So even with A2SD the space will become less and less the more apps the user installs
