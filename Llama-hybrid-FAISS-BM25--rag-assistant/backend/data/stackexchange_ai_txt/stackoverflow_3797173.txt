Simple jQuery fade-in when document loads / no user interaction should be required

Platform: ASP.NET 3.5, ASP.NET Ajax intermixed I'm very green to jQuery, so have been having a hard time with what I assume to be trivial. All I need to do is create the following scenario user logs in to my site, and I take him/her to a 'dashboard' I want a nice little bar to 'fade in' with some information I want to draw his/her attention to The examples on jQuery seem to suggest I need to click something to make it happen - but I don't want any user interaction. User logs in, user sees a nice fadein info bar. That's it. I saw a few examples and can't get it to work and I have tried both the following: (1) $(document).ready(function () { $("#fadein").fadein("slow"); }); (2) $("#fadein").bind("load", function () { $(this).fadeIn(); }); My div is as follows this will fade in now yeah (PS - I have tried with display:none and without it. Made no difference) What am I missing? What am I doing wrong? Just in case it helps I moved the from the contentpage to the masterpage, made no difference Any help appreciated.
