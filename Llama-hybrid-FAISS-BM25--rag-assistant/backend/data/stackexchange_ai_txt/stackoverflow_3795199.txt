jQuery, creating an HTML block that I can insert into the page

I have the following html: stuff..... What i'd like to do is create a JavaScript variable with this html... Then with jQuery be able to insert that into the page with something like $('#contentCol').html(mystuff) Is there an elegant way to do this rather than a long string of html?
