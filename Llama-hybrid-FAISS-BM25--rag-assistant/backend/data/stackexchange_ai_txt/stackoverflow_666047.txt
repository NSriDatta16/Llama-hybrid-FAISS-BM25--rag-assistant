Drag and drop in mozilla canvas

I want to implement a drawing pane (similar but smaller version to what visio gives for flow charts) in mozilla canvas. Is there any support for this? I have used jQuery till now to create the rectangles and move them around. While this is easy here..creating lines (connections between objects) is a real pain. I am using some crude way to color pixel by pixel in javascript and it is neither looking good nor scalable and also I need to build a lot of functions to make the connections stick to a set of objects etc. Does anyone know if the canvas and the functions available there will make my life easier. Any pointers to what is a better solution in this case. (I am hoping it is not applet) Thanks in advance.
