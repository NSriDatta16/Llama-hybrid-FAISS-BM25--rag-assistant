Why are eigenvalues so significant in DR techniques?

I've read PCA and few more dimension reduction algorithms and all of them talk about using eigen values and matrix operations. How are they so significant in discovering geometrical significance of data? More relevant what properties make them so relevant to Dimension Reduction
