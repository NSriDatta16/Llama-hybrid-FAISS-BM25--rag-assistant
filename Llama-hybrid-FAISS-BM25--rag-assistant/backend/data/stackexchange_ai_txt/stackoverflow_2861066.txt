I initialized a variable of class type B in class A #pragma once #include "B.h" class A { public: B* Z; A() { Z = new B(); } } B.h #pragma once class B { } C.h #pragma once #include "A.h" class C { A a; //here you construct A C() { a.Z = new B(); //you can read/write Z } } This should work! Be careful to include the #pragma once or a header guard/include guard ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_file ) so the headers won't be included twice (if should have done it). There are 3 classes, car, model and camera. in car I declare a new model Z and I want the camera to follow that model so I'll have to access the model positions in camera class A = Car B = Model C = Camera
