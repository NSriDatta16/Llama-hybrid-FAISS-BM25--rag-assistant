The only Google Data API that should return a gsessionid is the Calendar Data API. None of the others do this, to my knowledge. That being said, in general there's options here: Scrape the gsessionid query parameter from the redirect body, which it sounds like you tried. (In general, this is fragile and not a good idea.) Use the gsessionid query parameter located within the redirect's Location: header. The redirect will also contain an S= cookie. If you can make sure this cookie gets set for future requests, Google Calendar will use it in place of a gsessionid query parameter. If neither of these will work for you, your only option is to write a proxy. There's no way to get the gsessionid outside of the redirect, and the Calendar Data API won't serve requests without it.
