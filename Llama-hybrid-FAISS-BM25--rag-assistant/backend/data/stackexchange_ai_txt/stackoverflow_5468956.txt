Consider using the printenv function. It does exactly what it says on the tin, prints your environment. It can also take parameters $ printenv SSH_AGENT_PID=2068 TERM=xterm SHELL=/bin/bash LANG=en_US.UTF-8 HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth ...etc You could do printenv and then grep for any vars you know you have defined and be done in two lines, such as: $printenv | grep "VARNAME1\|VARNAME2" VARNAME1=foo VARNAME2=bar
