Testing iPhone Software on Different Versions Of OS

Before submitting my app I want to test it on devices with the full range of iPhone OS available. So, I have 2 questions that I am struggling with and would greatly appreciate any help or advice. What versions of the OS are in use? I know that the App Store will only accept apps for 2.2.1 and 3 but all the features I'm using have been available since 2.0. Is it safe to assume that everyone is running at least 2.2.1? Where can I find the other OS disk images, so that I can do the test? The iPhone Development Guide (p43) says search the developer website but I can't find them. Searching the internet just seems to throw up jailbreak sites. I can see some dmg files that were installed with the SDK at: Macintosh HD/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/x.x but XCode Organizer ignores them. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks in advance.
