This is a straightforward use case for collaborative filtering . Transform your customer transactions dataset so that you have a matrix where each row is a customer, each column is a product, and the value of each cell is 1 of that customer has bought that product, and 0 otherwise. Train a collaborative filtering model on your data. This will result in one matrix with a vector per customer, and another matrix with a vector per product. Cluster the vectors from the product matrix. Caveat: this method does not leverage any of the information in your articles metadata table.
