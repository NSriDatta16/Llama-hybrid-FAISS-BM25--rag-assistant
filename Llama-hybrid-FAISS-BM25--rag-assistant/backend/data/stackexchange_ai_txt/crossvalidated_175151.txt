The Fisher Exact Test is not set up to handle covariates. There are exact tests that do handle covariates, but they require additional packages in R. I would set the data up like this: > res2 Pass Tot Sex Grp 1 28 30 Male Int 2 41 42 Female Int 3 23 27 Male Ctl 4 30 33 Female Ctl Then run two models (admittedly not using exact tests): one with both Sex and Grp and another with Grp removed. Clearly these two groups are not matched, so McNemar's test is not used either, although it could be argued that the selection methods for grouping were not described very well, if at all. Clearly there is nothing approaching a significant difference using logistic regression: glm( cbind(Pass, Tot-Pass) ~ Sex + Grp, data=res2, family="binomial") #----------- Call: glm(formula = cbind(Pass, Tot - Pass) ~ Sex + Grp, family = "binomial", data = res2) Coefficients: (Intercept) SexMale GrpInt 2.3946 -0.7147 1.0965 Degrees of Freedom: 3 Total (i.e. Null); 1 Residual Null Deviance: 3.922 Residual Deviance: 0.1249 AIC: 16.65 #---------------- glm( cbind(Pass, Tot-Pass) ~ Sex , data=res2, family="binomial") #------------ Call: glm(formula = cbind(Pass, Tot - Pass) ~ Sex, family = "binomial", data = res2) Coefficients: (Intercept) SexMale 2.8764 -0.7363 Degrees of Freedom: 3 Total (i.e. Null); 2 Residual Null Deviance: 3.922 Residual Deviance: 2.688 AIC: 17.21 #------ Looking at the actual numbers you can see why random variation could easily explain differences of just a few students one or two groups. Comparing the deviance of two models, which is what I am implicitly doing, is a likelihood ratio test. The difference between that approach and an exact test would be expected to be very slight when the cell sizes all exceed 5. Furthermore the calculation of an exact test with this set of values would be prohibitive. I seem to remember that the R fisher.test may allow a more relaxed accommodation of data than just 2x2, but when the cell counts are this large the function would default to approximate methods anyway.
