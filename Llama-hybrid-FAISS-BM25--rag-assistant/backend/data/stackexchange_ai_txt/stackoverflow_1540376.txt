I recommend following the Apache Software Foundation's standard directory structure , which yields this: module/ src/ main/ java/ test/ java/ This keeps tests separate from source, but at the same level in the directory structure. If you read through how Apache defines their structure, you'll see it helps partition other concerns out as well, including resources, config files, other languages, etc. This structure also allows unit tests to test package and protected level methods of the units under test, assuming you place your test cases in the same package as what they test. Regarding testing private methods - I would not bother. Something else, either public, package, or protected calls them and you should be able to get full test coverage testing those things. By the way, the link above is to Maven, Apache's standard build tool. Every Java project they have conforms to this standard, as well as every project I have encountered that is built with Maven.
