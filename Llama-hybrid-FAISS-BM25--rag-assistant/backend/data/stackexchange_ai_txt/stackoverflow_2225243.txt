JNLP java.security.AccessControlException with TargetDataLine.open()?

I have the following line which caused this error message run under JNLP : java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (javax.sound.sampled.AudioPermission record) at java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(Unknown Source) TargetDataLine targetDataLine.open(audioFormat); How to fix it ? Or does that mean in JNLP, we can't record sound ? PS : I'm not running it in all-permissions mode, because it requires a 3rd party paid cert. to sign the jar before I can submit my app to Sun's Java Store. I wonder if there's any other way, like using JNLP's FileSaveService / FileOpenService ? Frank
