HTC Incredible displaying blank ImageView

I have an app that displays an an image in an ImageView using the setImageDrawable(Drawable) method. However, with the release of the Droid Incredible the images are coming up as a blank screen. I am using Drawable.createFromPath(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "\\imagefile") to access the image from the SD card. I don't get any sort of error, just a black screen. I will get a null pointer exception if after trying to load the image I try to access a property of the Drawable. This makes me believe that the Drawable wasn't loaded, but I don't know why or how to make it work. This code as been working on all other Android devices, so I'm not sure what is different with the Incredible. Unfortunately I don't have access to an Incredible to test on, so I've got to rely on others to test and send me the log files. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. If anyone knows how to replicate this issue on the emulator, that would be helpful too. I've configured an emulator with firmware 7 and the correct screen resolution, but I was unable to replicate the issue.
