All previous answers are correct. I would like just to clarify one point of your question: My question is, how does this make sense? Because in theory, if we passed the whole training set to each individual model, wouldn't all the models be exactly the same? As you have seen in previous answers, we are doing Bootstrapping, so the weak decision trees we are creating are going to be different since they have different dataset. But, imagine you set the bootstrap=False . Will you obtain the same week trees since you have the same dataset? The answer is NO . Why? Because Random Forest selects also randomly some features to create every decision tree. So, you will have same dataset, but different features you are playing with. The hyperparameter to tune this idea is called max_features .
