How do I use chi square distribution with C++ Boost library?

I've checked the examples in the Boost website, but they are not what I'm looking for. To put it simple, I want to see if a number on a die is favored, using 600 rolls, so the average appearances of every number (1 through 6) should be 100. And I want to use the chi square distribution to check if the die is fair. Help!, how would I do this please ??
