Parsing blocks of line comments using MGrammar

How can I parse blocks of line comments with MGrammar? I want to parse blocks of line comments. Line comments that are next to each should grouped in the MGraph output. I'm having trouble grouping blocks of line comments together. My current grammar uses "\r\n\r\n" to terminate a block but that will not work in all cases such as at end of file or when I introduce other syntaxes. Sample input could look like this: /// This is block /// number one /// This is block /// number two My current grammar looks like this: module MyModule { language MyLanguage { syntax Main = CommentLineBlock*; token CommentContent = !( '\u000A' // New Line |'\u000D' // Carriage Return |'\u0085' // Next Line |'\u2028' // Line Separator |'\u2029' // Paragraph Separator ); token CommentLine = "///" c:CommentContent* => c; syntax CommentLineBlock = (CommentLine)+ "\r\n\r\n"; interleave Whitespace = " " | "\r" | "\n"; } }
