While I have never experienced this behavior and cannot explain it, a pragmatic solution is to setup a loop around your call accessing the directory. Catch DirectoryNotFoundException inside that loop, and retry access a few times after a short pause each time. Rethrow the exception if the retry count is exceeded. Adding detailed logging at this point may help you determine the actual cause of the problem.
