How to get MessageBox.Show() to pop up in the middle of my WPF application?

I have a 700w x 300h WPF application and can drag it anywhere on my large screen. When my application executes: MessageBox.Show("Sorry, this function is not yet implemented."); the mesage box appears in the middle of my screen , which may or may not even be near the application itself. How can I get my MessageBox to appear in the middle of my application instead?
