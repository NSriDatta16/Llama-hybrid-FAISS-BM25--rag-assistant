How to go about selecting an algorithm for approximate Bayesian inference

I am wondering if there are any good rules of thumb for how to go about selecting an approximate inference algorithm for a problem/model (specifically when exact inference is intractable)? When you are faced with a problem, what are the things you consider when selecting an approach for inference (e.g. MCMC, belief propagation, variational, etc.)?
