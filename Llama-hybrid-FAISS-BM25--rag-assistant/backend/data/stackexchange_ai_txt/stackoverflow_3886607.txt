Infinite UIScrollView for whiteboard-like app

Naturally an "infinite" UIScrollView question has been asked about before, but it always seem to be related to this sort of scenario: A scrollview with 4 card subviews on a "carousel", i.e. reaching the 4th card and then swiping in the direction of continuation would yield the 1st card again (and therefore no need to scroll backwards). What I want help with is what the folks at popplet.com implemented on their iPad app, as you scroll in any direction (which is unlimited/infinite) the canvas resizes allowing for practically infinite widget placement. I know this involves some sort of KVO observing but I'm a bit lost. My general idea is to have a main contentView placed within the scrollview and then all other views are placed inside that (those are the ones that can be dragged, etc.)
