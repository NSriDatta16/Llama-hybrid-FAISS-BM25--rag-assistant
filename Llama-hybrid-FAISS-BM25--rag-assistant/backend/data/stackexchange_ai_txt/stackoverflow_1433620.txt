We have worked hard to give error messages that are accurate, so read them carefully. The error message is telling you exactly what is going wrong: you are accessing a non-static field in a context where it is only legal to access statics. So why is a base constructor call argument list a context where it is only legal to access statics? When you call a base constructor, the arguments you pass must not reference "this" . Why? Because neither the derived constructor nor the base constructor for your "this" has run yet, and therefore "this" is almost certainly in an inconsistent, partially-initialized state. That is a recipe for crazy bugs. We therefore restrict you from accessing "this" until we know that at the very least, the base constructor has run. This feature encourages sensible, well-ordered, understandable, maintainable and bug-free construction logic; I recommend working with, not against, those safeguards.
