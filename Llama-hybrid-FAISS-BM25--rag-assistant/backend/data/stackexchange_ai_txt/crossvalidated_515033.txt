How does the probablity a sandwich is more than 12 inches relate to how long the sandwich actually is?

I'm having a lot of trouble googling this because I'm not sure what the correct term is for this problem. If I have a logistic regression model that gives the probability a sandwich is more than 12 inches how do I use that probability to estimate how long the sandwich actually is? If the model says the sandwich has a 65.5% chance of being more than 12 inches long does that imply a length the sandwich actually is? Perhaps I use the mean and standard deviation of known sandwiches to somehow relate the 65.5% probability to actual sandwich length? Please help.
