On Visual C++, I use /W4 and /WX (treat warnings as errors). VC also has /Wall , but it's incompatible with the standard headers. I choose to treat warnings as errors, because that forces me to fix them. I fix all warnings, even if that means adding #pragma to ignore the warning - that way, I'm stating explicitly, that I'm aware of the warning (so other developers won't e-mail me about it).
