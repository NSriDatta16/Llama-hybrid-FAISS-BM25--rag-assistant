Being a cracker nightmare!

I am trying to make a code hard to crack using Objective-C on a Mac. One of the things I have to do is to check to see if the application was cracked. I am new to Objective-C and Xcode and whatever way I imagine to test my application I always end in a basic test that can be patched easily. For example: suppose I am about to test for the existence of a given value in a certain part of the binary. That operation will be something like: "is this value = x?" if NO, it is cracked. This is very easy to crack. The hacker can easily patch the test and make it be true always. I am trying to imagine something that could test something, not appearing as a test that can be easily patched. I know I cannot stop 100% piracy, but at least I am trying to make things more difficult, to discourage most part of crackers out there. Any ideas of ways stuff like this can be done without and turns things difficult for someone looking at the binary? thanks for any help.
