C++ isn't an easy language to learn as noted by everyone else, but there are a few reasons that it makes a decent place to start: it doesn't tie you to a specific programming paradigm (e.g., Java and OOP) so you can experiment with different techniques easily C++ doesn't have the bells and whistles so you can concentrate on making the building blocks if you want to know how they are built since it is a language and not a platform, you can choose the library or libraries that best fit the task at hand or your chosen programming style (e.g., choosing something like Poco for a Javaesque feel, ACE for the gritty early style OO, etc.) it is a general purpose programming language, not a platform (had to say that twice) The trick is learning it carefully and correctly the first time. I know that I, like many others, have struggled with it by learning it as "C + objects" before really understanding it. It is a hard language to learn. I would recommend looking for an experienced C++ mentor to attach yourself to as well as reading a lot of the "highly recommended" books on how to and how not to write C++. Avoid learning bad habits up front. For a starting reading list in no particular order: "Accelerated C++" by Koenig and Moo "Effective C++/STL" by Scott Meyers "Object-Oriented Software Construction" by Bertrand Meyer "Expert C Programming" by Peter van der Linden "STL Tutorial and Reference Guide" by Musser, Derge, and Saini "The C++ Standard Library" by Josuttis
