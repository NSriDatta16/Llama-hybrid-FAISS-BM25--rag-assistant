If the elements are replaced by the ajax update, and the jquery event bindings that make the drag work are on the elements themselves, then yes, the event bindings won't be there on the new elements. One option is to re-run, in the ajax success callback, whatever initialization method creates those event bindings. Another option is to use jQuery's delegate() method to bind those event handlers to any element within a given container that matches a selector (even if it's added after the bindings are set up).
