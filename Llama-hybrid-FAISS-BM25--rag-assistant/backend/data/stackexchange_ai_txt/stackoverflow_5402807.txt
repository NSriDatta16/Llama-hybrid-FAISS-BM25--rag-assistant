html / css / pre / code: how to force carriage return

I've got a very long text (an HTML page actually) (almost an entire book) where there are many thing including some code. These paragraphs are either enclosed by "pre" tags or enclosed by "code" tags. The big problem is that some lines are far too long and when I print them out, they are cut. Moreover the author has put some very long questions in "code" tags (>_ Any idea how to force carriage return between those tags? I can add css easily in the header.
