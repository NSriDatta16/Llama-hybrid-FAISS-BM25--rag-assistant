Evaluating clusters (e.g. built by kmean) using Random Forest

I have made clusters for my data set (1.5 million samples and 800 features) using k-mean. I am aware of internal indices for evaluating clusters. However, I was thinking about training a supervised classification model (e.g. random forest classifier) in which cluster numbers are dependent variable and all other features are independent variable. Is using the accuracy of this model a good evaluation of the kmean cluster and why?
