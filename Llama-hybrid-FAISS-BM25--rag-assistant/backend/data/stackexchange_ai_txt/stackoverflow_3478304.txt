I'll play devil's advocate: if increasing your coverage meant writing a test that "didn't test anything useful," then why was that code there? To me, this would be an argument to remove some mainline code. Or to develop a test that does do something useful. For example, you may consider that it's not useful to test setters and getters. Neither do I. However, those methods should be tested while testing something else . Otherwise, again, why are they there? But you raise a good point that coverage tools should not be an end in themselves. Especially since they can't tell you what code you need to write. I've gone into more detail here: http://www.kdgregory.com/index.php?page=junit.coverage
