it looks like you're trying to setup a watermark for a textbox, is that correct? I'm going to refer you to a basic example of textbox watermarking that should be able to give you an example and give everyone a bit of a common codebase for discussion, since you didn't include a lot of code in your post: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/WatermarkTextBox.aspx In it, I'll reference one of his codeblocks, that is similar to the one you posted: User ID While I realize he used ASP.NET instead of ASP, I wanted to draw attention to the fact that he put text so that you could see part of the answer to the question you directly asked above. EDIT: Let me try this again: You would have something like this: Hopefully tho, the whole example given on that page will help you. Feel free to ask more questions.
