I think mounting the drive makes a lot of sense for your scenario, but to be honest I haven't tried it with any load. The good news is that you could always try the easy approach and then refactor if it doesn't perform under load. I'd hope Rackspace accounted and tested for this exact scenario, it seems logical to me. For some extraneous information, we faced the same question here and did a cost comparison of using Cloud Site vs Cloud Files. We had to factor in both bandwidth and amount of storage into the costs because communication between Sites/Servers and Cloud Files still incurs bandwidth charges. In other words, do you have a lot of files that sit around, or do you have a few files that get accessed often. We spend a lot of time talking with RackSpace support about performance and scalability differences between Cloud Sites and Cloud Files - I'd recommend giving them a call. We ultimately chose to just use Sites because of our needs, the cost difference was pretty insignificant as it scaled. Also because the Cloud Files API didn't have the granular security that we needed, so we would have to have written a gateway service anyway.
