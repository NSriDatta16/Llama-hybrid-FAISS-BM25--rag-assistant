As mentioned already in the comments, you successfully deleted the three rows from the data frame, so the labelled points from df2 are new "outliers" (if you want to call them that) after having removed the previous three. You should have a clear goal and strategy in mind for outlier exclusion and reasonable justifications, because it can easily become a highly iterative and arbitrary process. Good references are for example: Barbato, G., Barini, E. M., Genta, G., & Levi, R. (2011). Features and performance of some outlier detection methods. Journal of Applied Statistics, 38(10), 2133-2149. McClelland, G. H. (2014). Nasty data: Unruly, ill-mannered observations can ruin your analysis. Your residuals look far from random because your dependent variable is all-positive, only has discrete values from 1 to 6, and is highly left-skewed . This looks like a situation where a linear regression in not well suited. Are the outcomes of the Criterion variable categories? Then you could try multinomial regression instead, potentially after clustering some of the low Criterion values with small N together. Are they ordered categories (e.g., ratings or severity scores)? Then ordinal logistic regression should do a good job here. A suitable transformation if you really want and need to stay on the numerical scale (e.g., if these were counts which can also have values > 6) could be a log-transformation after inverting the variable and thereby the skew ( but if the Criterion data are indeed fixed nominal categories this is of course not sensible): df $Criterion_log Criterion)
