ASP.NET MVC Exception?

since today i get an Exception on IIS7.5 with ASP.NET MVC, but i dont know why. It occurs while using System.Net.WebClient.DownloadString() [WebException: The remote server returned an error: (500) Internal Server Error.] If I open URL in Browser. Site shows up fine. In VS2008 Debug Trace Status is: "200 OK" The only thing it could see was: Response.Headers" of Type Exception "System.PlatformNotSupportedException" caused. System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection {System.PlatformNotSupportedException} Please use integrated Pipeline Mode in IIS. Both Website run within the same v2.0 .NET Application Pool with Integrated Pipeline enabled. DownloadString from e.g. google.com etc works. Only if I call the MVC it corrupts. Called Controller in MVC looks like this: public void online() { Response.Write(Date.Time.Now); Response.End(); return; } It worked before. May someone can help to get more details to track down the error. UPDATE: Got it. Damn it. I checked Subversion History in ASP.NET MVC an checked every line. In my BaseController, i added recently: string strUserAgent = Request.UserAgent.ToString().ToLower(); After remove. Everything works again. But why is System.Net.WebClient crashing when asking for UserAgent? Even with 200 Status. I'll give this a little investigation.
