The general answer to your question (how to fix various parts of a statistical model involving a categorical term varying across groups) is ?dummy . Let's suppose that the model with random effects (Cond1|subject) , with 3 variance-covariance parameters (variation among groups in the response to the "homo" condition; variation among groups in the "hetero" - "homo" response difference; covariance between these two terms) seems too complex (for some reason) and you want to simplify it. Depending on what you thought made sense, you could (1) allow the "intercepts" but not the "slopes" (I'm using quotation marks here because among-factor-level differences don't really feel like slopes to me, although at the model matrix level they really are) to differ among groups: this is just the random-intercept model, (1|Subject) [1 parameter] (2) allow just the slopes (i.e., the "hetero" - "homo" response difference) but not the intercepts to vary among subjects: this is (0+dummy(Cond1,"hetero")|Subject) , and is closest to what you've done above. [1 parameter] (3) allow both the intercepts (responses in the "homo" condition) and slopes ( "hetero" - "homo" differences) to vary, but assume they're uncorrelated: (1|Subject)+(0+dummy(Cond1,"hetero")|Subject) [2 parameters] (4) allow the responses in the "homo" condition and the responses in the "hetero" condition to vary in an uncorrelated way; (0+dummy(Cond1,"homo")|Subject) + (0+dummy(Cond1,"hetero")|Subject) [2 parameters] One reason to be suspicious of strategies that drop the correlation between random effect terms is that the model then depends on the contrast coding (i.e. #3, which corresponds to treatment coding, vs. #4, which corresponds roughly to sum-to-zero coding). The reason I'm particularly suspicious of #2 is that it is the most asymmetric of all of the options in how it treats the two levels. The (just-now-modified) ?expandDoubleVerts man page discusses this concept: Because || works at the level of formula parsing, it has no way of knowing whether a variable is a factor. It just takes the terms within a random-effects term and literally splits them into the intercept and separate no-intercept terms, e.g. (1+x+y|f) would be split into (1|f) + (0+x|f) + (0+y|f) . However, || will fail to break up factors into separate terms; the dummy function can be useful in this case, although it is not as convenient as || . } Example: library("lme4") m If you wanted to fit an uncorrelated model with three treatment levels, your suggestion in the comments (1|Subject) + (0+dummy(Condition, "hetero")|Subject) + (0+dummy(Condition,"homo")|Subject) would work. I would strongly recommend against removing variation in one of the treatment levels from consideration because of lack of significance; this is analogous to dropping non-significant random factors from the model that are intrinsic parts of the experimental design ("sacrificial pseudoreplication, sensu Hurlbert 1984), and is generally deprecated.
