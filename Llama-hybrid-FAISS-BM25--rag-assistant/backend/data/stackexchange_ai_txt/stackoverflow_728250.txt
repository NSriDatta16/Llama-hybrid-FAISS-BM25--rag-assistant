there's nothing better than Lua for embedding a language in a C/C++ application. do that, and you can simply add Xavante , which with the full Kepler environment supports very flexible and modern web apps. (disclaimer: i'm one of the Xavante authors; but i'm writing this more because i love Lua than because of any pride about Xavante)
