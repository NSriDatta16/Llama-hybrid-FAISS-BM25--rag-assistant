Multistep Markov Chain Problem

Let's say there is a machine whose condition at the start of every week can be modeled by a Markov Chain and the condition can be categorized as low, medium, high, failed. I will denote the state of the machine as $X$ where $X_n$ is the state at the start of week $n$ . The transition matrix $P$ is as follows (the order is low, medium, high, failed): $\begin{bmatrix}0.9 & 0.05 & 0.03 & 0.02\\0 & 0.85 & 0.09 & 0.06\\0 & 0 & 0.9 & 0.1\\1 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$ For instance, a machine in the medium state has a probability of 0.09 and 0.06 of being in the high or failed state, respectively, at the start of the next week (it cannot, by itself, go to the low state). My questions are What is the probability that a machine has at least one failure three weeks after it is new? On average, how many weeks per year is the machine working? Just in case you need the multistep transition matrices, I have calculated second-step and third-step matrices in python: matrix([[0.83 , 0.0875, 0.0585, 0.024 ], [0.06 , 0.7225, 0.1575, 0.06 ], [0.1 , 0. , 0.81 , 0.09 ], [0.9 , 0.05 , 0.03 , 0.02 ]]) matrix([[0.771 , 0.115875, 0.085425, 0.0277 ], [0.114 , 0.617125, 0.208575, 0.0603 ], [0.18 , 0.005 , 0.732 , 0.083 ], [0.83 , 0.0875 , 0.0585 , 0.024 ]])
