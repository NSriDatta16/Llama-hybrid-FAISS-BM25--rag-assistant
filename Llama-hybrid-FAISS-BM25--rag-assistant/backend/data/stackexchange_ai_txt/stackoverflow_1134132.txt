You need to be more specific what the 'flakiness' is, how does it manifest. If I understand this correctly, you are trying to drive manually a merge replication with RMO classes, in lack of the Agent support. One thing to note is that SQL Express supports only one scheduler so adding multiple workers (pending requests) to it won't make much of a difference, they'll just pile up in the runnable queue and fight for the one CPU to run them. Second, I'm not sure the RMO replication classes (which I assume you use) support doing sync in multiple, parallel, instances, so I probably there's no point in doing more that just one BackgroundWorker per db (I may be wrong on this one, I'm not an RMO expert by any stretch).
