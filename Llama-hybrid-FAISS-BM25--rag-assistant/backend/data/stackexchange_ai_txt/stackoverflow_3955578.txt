The problem you are experiencing is unlikely to be C# itself, but probably that your code is getting into an infinite loop where the Organisation is asking the Employee for information that causes the Employee to ask the Organisation for the same information again... All you should need to do is break this link, so that requesting information on the Organisation does not chain the call on to its Employees (and vice versa). i.e If you want the full information on an organisation, instead of org.GetAbsolutelyAllInformation(); you would call org.GetOrganisationInformation(); org.Leader.GetEmployeeInformation(); If you must return the information in one lump, then rather than returning the information in a new object, pass in a "blank" object to be filled in. If you are called with an object that is already filled in, return the cached information rather than fetching it from the database again. That way, it won't matter which order your methods are called, they will just fill in the org or leader information in the object you pass in, and the "loop" will be stopped on the next iteration when it's found that all the information has been filled in. In general, one way to reduce the risk of this sort of loop happening in the first place would be for the organisation's "Leader" to be an ID (e.g. employee number) rather than a direct reference. This encourages any programmer using this code to get the leader ID and then look up the leader's information as a separate step.
