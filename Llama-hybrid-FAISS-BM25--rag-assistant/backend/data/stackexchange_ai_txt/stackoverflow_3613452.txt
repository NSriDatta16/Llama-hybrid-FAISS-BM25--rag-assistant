mysql empty columns

I'm on an optimization kick, at the moment. I tend to use multiple tables, so I don't have empty columns. My question is, are empty columns a big deal? I'm not talking for space. I'm referring to speed of indexing, data retrieval, etc... My bet example is when I have a simple customers table, and some columns are not always filled. Like email, dob, ssn, or pic. I'd say most of the time they are not filled in. That causes me to create a new table to house just the ancillary data. but would it really make a difference if I put these columns in the same table with the rest of the customer info? If I do this, then there will be many records with empty columns. Which causes me to wonder how much this affects performance when the record count is huge.
