I'm not sure what your aiming at with your code, but one thing is for sure myQuery.execute() will block until it is finished. If you want to do it in the background, you would have to spawn a separate thread for it: new Thread() { public void run() { rs = myQuery.execute(); } }.start(); However, this has many implications. Some are obvious, some are not, and it would definitely require some synchronization code. Unless you know what you're doing, I would strongly encourage you to go with a single-threaded approach.
