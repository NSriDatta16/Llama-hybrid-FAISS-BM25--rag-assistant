You did it like this, right?: spec = tabHost.newTabSpec("create").setIndicator("Create", res.getDrawable(R.drawable.testimg)) .setContent(intent); tabHost.addTab(spec); you'll have to set the drawable to be 'create.xml' put 'create.xml' inside 'drawable' folder (no hdpi, ldpi, mdpi. if any 'drawable' folder doesn't exist, create one) (Although it may not be necessary to put it inside a 'drawable' folder only, and perhaps you can put it under other drawable folders too, I haven't researched on that, but its a good practice) then set it like this- res.getDrawable(R.drawable.create) It should work then.
