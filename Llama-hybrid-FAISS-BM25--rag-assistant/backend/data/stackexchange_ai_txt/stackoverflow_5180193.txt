Do you need AOP here? the Decorator pattern can be a lot simpler and requires a lot less magic. Just wrap the implementation with: class ProtectedWindowOpener implements WindowOpener { WindowOpener delegate ... void openWindow(Window w) { if (!allowOpen(w)) { throw new PermissionDeniedException... } delegate.openWindow(w); } boolean allowOpen(Window w) { // security logic here } } Which keeps the security logic separate and also has the advantage of not embedding code in a string, which means eclipse can do its business.
