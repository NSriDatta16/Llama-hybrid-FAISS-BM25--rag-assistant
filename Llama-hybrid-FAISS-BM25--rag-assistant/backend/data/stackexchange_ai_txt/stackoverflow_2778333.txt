Here are some "code review" comments: In main(): Change SIZE to " size_ t" instead of int Why SIZE is uppercase? (May be the author's convention is to have constants as uppercase, in that case it is fine.) Combine temp declaration and assignment into one statement as: double * temp = array; What if inFile is not available or can't be opened for reading? What if inFile have less than SIZE number of items? Change the loop variable i to size_t . Remove blank line before declaration of inFile . Return some number (e.g. 0 ) from main() . Correct the allocation of array. In Average(): Change the second argument of Average to size_t . Assert and/or guard for pointer being non-NULL Assert and/or guard against division by zero. Acknowledgement : Some points are collected from other answers. I tried to make a complete list as far as I could.
