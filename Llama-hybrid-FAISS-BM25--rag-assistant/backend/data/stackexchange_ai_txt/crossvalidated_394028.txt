Calculate the probability of an event using prior statistical information

i have a probability problem and i dont know if im using the right way to find a solution to it. Here the problem : A person drink in average 490ml of water from a bottle of 500ml and i have a standard deviation of 4 ml. It is specified that this data is normally distributed So : $$\mu = 490$$ $$\sigma = 4$$ I want to calculate the probability that he will drink 500 ml of water (the entire bottle) using the mean and the standard deviation as information. I tried to use the z-score, so i did $$z = \frac{500 - \mu}{\sigma} = 2,5$$ then i can know that there are 0,62% of data over 500 ml but this isn't the probability to drink 500 ml right ? What i'am not understanding ?
