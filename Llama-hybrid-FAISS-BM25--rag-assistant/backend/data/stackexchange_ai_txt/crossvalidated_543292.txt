Difference between token embedding and character embedding in ELMo model

I am learning about a famous NLP model called ELMo . In the explanations, they talk about two types of embeddings. 1) character representations 2) token representations. Why is there a need to consider two types of representations? What are the differences between them? How do they affect the training?
