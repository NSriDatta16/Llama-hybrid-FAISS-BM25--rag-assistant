Maximum request length exceeded exception

I'm trying to upload a 20 meg file using the upload control and it's working fine on visual studio's built in webserver but once I publish it to the production server (which I have no access to) I keep getting the following error : Server Error in '/' Application. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maximum request length exceeded.

Any direction on this would be very helpful.
