Contradictory PDP plots

Let's say we have two models: one is a random forest, and the other one is a xgboost model. Those two models yield similar accuracies but in the PDP plots, one model says features A, B, C have a relatively strong positive impact on the label, whereas the other model says the exact opposite (strong negative impact). In that case, what should we do? Should I be concerned and find out which model is more sane?
