I do not consider this a correct answer to my question and would still like an elegant, generic solution to this problem. What I'm posting is my temporary workaround which got me past my issue in the most brute force, inelegant way. I explicitly excluded these items from obfuscation by adding them into a keepclassmembernames option: -keepclassmembernames class * {com.common.license.LicenseSessionStore licenseSessionStore; com.common.license.LicenseStore licenseStore; } This is not a preferred solution as it requires specific named overriding in each and every class and will become a maintenance nightmare. A better answer is still needed! Grant
