Answer is NO Why? weights are hyperparameters of the linear regression model and they are not the same as the ones for xgboost or catboost. What you can do is combine models (if you really want to use xgboost or catboost additionally) SEE this NOTE just because model is more powerfull it does not mean that it will beat linear regression on every dataset ;)
