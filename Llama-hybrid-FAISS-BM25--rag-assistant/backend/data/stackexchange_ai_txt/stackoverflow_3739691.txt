Organising classes - Best practice?

A quick question about best practice with PHP classes. I have seen people use filenames such as something.class.php to organise their classes in external files. So, is it best practice to have one file per class, or multiple classes per file. At the moment, I am scripting an RPG and have a single class_lib.php file. I currently have just character-related classes in there, and before I go any further would like to know if it's more suitable to keep classes grouped in files, have all classes in a single file, or keep each class to its own file. What are the advantages/disadvantages of each approach? Made this CW as it may not have a definite answer
