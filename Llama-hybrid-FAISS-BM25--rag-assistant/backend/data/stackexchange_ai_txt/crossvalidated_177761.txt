Cointegration test between a stationary and non-stationary time series

I would like to determine if there is any association between two time series. One of the time series is stationary, the other is not stationary. In this scenario does a cointegration test make sense and if so what R based test/package can I use? I have been using the Johansen procedure in R for scenarios where both time series are non-stationary.
