Magento, add Clothing size attribute without Configurable Product

I want a simple way to let my user pick there clothing size before buy but Configurable Product seems like to much overkill. you have to make a product of every size and then you have to make a configurable product. the shop is for my dad and if i have to explain him how he has to do this it would be weeks for him to know this, (it took several days to make him learn to create a simple product) Is there any other possibility to create a product and in the front end let the user select the size attribute .. there has to be a more simple way than this ?
