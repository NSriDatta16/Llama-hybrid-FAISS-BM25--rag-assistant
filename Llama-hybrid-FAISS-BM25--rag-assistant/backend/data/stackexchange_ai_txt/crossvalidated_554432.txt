RMSE or MAPE? which one to choose for accuracy?

I have a weekly times series for which I would like to find the best fit model. So far I've tried arima, Harmonic regression with arima error, neural network and in the end I would like to decide which one has been better fitted to my raw data. The time series look like this, with heavy seasonal and cyclic pattern: I also put the Ljung-Box test and the plot of predicted values here for each: # Arima fit % auto.arima(lambda = 0) fit %>% checkresiduals() Ljung-Box test data: Residuals from ARIMA(3,1,0) Q* = 23.619, df = 23, p-value = 0.4252 Model df: 3. Total lags used: 26 #Harmonic regression with arima error fit2 % checkresiduals() Ljung-Box test data: Residuals from Regression with ARIMA(2,1,1) errors Q* = 21.642, df = 15, p-value = 0.1175 Model df: 11. Total lags used: 26 #Neural Network fit3 They all seem fine based on Ljung-Box test but they somehow failed to capture the wiggly form of the time-series here which I don't know how important it is. But my main question is when I check the accuracy if I choose RMSE I have to pick the harmonic regression one and if I choose MAPE I have to pick neural network model. And I would also like to know why RMSE and MAPE values are so different here. # Arima accuracy(forecast(fit, h = 16), test) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Theil's U Training set 1.948693 27.56683 19.09467 -4.402578 25.87164 0.5790763 0.21495069 NA Test set 43.293579 61.02374 46.31065 32.745528 39.26652 1.4044442 0.09636865 1.158678 # Harmonic Regression accuracy(forecast(h = 16, fit2, xreg = fourier(training, K = 4)), test) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Theil's U Training set 4.323546 24.4800 16.05035 -1.464388 21.89874 0.4867525 0.1751586 NA Test set -2.495049 42.1323 33.03114 -171.095704 194.16485 1.0017220 0.2349017 4.288442 # Neural Network accuracy(forecast(fit3, h = 16), test) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Theil's U Training set 3.414448 22.63083 14.31504 -2.615375 16.93870 0.4341265 0.2253450 NA Test set 40.095160 58.90628 44.16645 28.908539 37.72779 1.3394181 0.1107563 1.119875 Thank you very much for your help, I really appreciate it in advance.
