incorporating extra predictors in a forecasting model

I have a Machine Learning demand forecasting task for a healthcare service. I have some columns such as date, diagnosis, hospital etc and each row represents a particular time that this service was used. Now I want to make weekly forecasting models for the usage of this service, so I group-by the date column and get the counts for each week, creating this way a 'demand' column. Now I have only a DateTime and demand columns. How I could incorporate my other predictors in a forecasting regression model. Maybe I am missing something as I am new to time-series.
