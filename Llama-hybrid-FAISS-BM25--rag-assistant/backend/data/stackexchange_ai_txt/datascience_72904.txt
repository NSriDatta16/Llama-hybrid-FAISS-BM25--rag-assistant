How do I iterate over my images in dataset?

I am building an autoencoder with help from this site. There I was trying to build an autoencoder for my own custom data. My images are stored in a folder IMG and have names like 0.jpg, 1.jpg, 2.jpg..... I tried to develop an iterator to iterate over all my images but the problem arises that when I convert all of my 124 images in a single training_data array the model responds that it expected a single array yet 124 arrays were given to it. Can anyone tell me how I should write the iterator? I tried using the keras flow_from_directory function from the "Machine Learning mastery" website but it shows 0 images from 0 classes . Here is my code:--> import tensorflow as tf from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, UpSampling2D from keras.models import Model from keras import backend as K from keras.callbacks import TensorBoard import numpy as np from PIL import Image i = int(0) images_dir = "/home/awesome_ruler/Documents/Atom projects/Compression_enc/Images/IMG/{}.jpg".format(i) training_data = [] while i Also I want the images to retain the 'color' feature so I am using the input shape as (600,400,3) because RGB is on 3 channels. is it correct? I would have simply used my iterator but it is my understanding that I need a different function that communicates to the model and gives it images one-by-one while I am just loading them all in a single variable. So can anyone help me with this? Here is the full TraceBack:- Traceback (most recent call last): File "autoencoder.py", line 46, in callbacks=[TensorBoard(log_dir='/tmp/autoencoder')]) File "/home/awesome_ruler/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 1154, in fit batch_size=batch_size) File "/home/awesome_ruler/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 579, in _standardize_user_data exception_prefix='input') File "/home/awesome_ruler/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/keras/engine/training_utils.py", line 109, in standardize_input_data str(len(data)) + ' arrays: ' + str(data)[:200] + '...')
