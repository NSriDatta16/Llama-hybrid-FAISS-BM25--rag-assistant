There is no stated limit, only the limit of most HTTP servers. Keeping that in mind however, I would implement a column with a reasonable fixed length (use Google to find a list of known user agents, find the largest and add 50%), and just crop any user agent that is too long - any exceptionally long user agent is probably unique enough even when cropped, or is the result of some kind of bug or "hack" attempt.
