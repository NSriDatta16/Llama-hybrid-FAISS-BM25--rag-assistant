Communication between c++ objects

This is an issue, that I have come acrosss earlier. Basically a c++ object has a member object that does some work, once the work is done , a notification needs to made to the parent. What is the most elegant solution to allow this communication. Does being in this position indicate a flaw with the design to begin with? To elaborate. class A { B member; void do_something(); } class B{ void talk_to_network(); }; void do_something() { //Conditional wait on a variable that will change when talk to network completes. //So need a way for B to inform A, that it is done. }
