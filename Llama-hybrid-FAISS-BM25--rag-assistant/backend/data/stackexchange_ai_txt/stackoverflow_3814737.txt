Loading the data for a Simulink Lookup Table from a file

I've built a Matlab/Simulink model that I'm using to simulate the performance of an underwater robotic vehicle that uses acoustics for various key navigation and localisation functions. Since the characteristics of the ocean change with seasonality and geolocation, I would like this data to be dynamically loaded into the model from an ASCII data file (space separated data organized in rows and columns). Simulink has a number of Lookup Table Blocksets, but none of them seem to provide a "read from file" option directly. Having to use the Table Editor would be taking the model in the wrong direction. Is there another way, perhaps using Matlab, to load data into the Blockset from a file? For a 1-D table, I'm looking for something akin to the Matlab commands A = load(filename) A(:,1) % for the index A(:,2) % for the table values AKE
