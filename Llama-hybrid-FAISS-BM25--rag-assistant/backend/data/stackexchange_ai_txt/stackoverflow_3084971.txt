Conditionally set column values in SQL result

I'm creating a result set based on a join of multiple tables. For the sake of simplicity, I have attached an image showing my theoretical layout: Diagram http://www.liquidarts.net/images/stackoverflow/sql-theo.png My result set normally looks like: table1.value, table2.value, table3.value However, if table3.table4_key is set, I would want the result set to instead be: table1.value, table2.value, table4.value Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm trying to do all of my data organization purely in SQL, and avoid doing any procedural data smashing in PHP. Solution SQL, as per answer below: select table1.value, table2.value, COALESCE(table4.value, table3.value) from table1 join table2 on table2.key = table1.key join table3 on table3.key = table2.key left join table4 on table4.key = table3.table4_key
