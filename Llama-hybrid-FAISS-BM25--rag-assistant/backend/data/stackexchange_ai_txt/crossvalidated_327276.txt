Multiple time-series symbolic regression

I have few columns of technical data as a time-series, let's say column a, column b and column c. I want to find out the impact of both a and b on c. If I search for these keywords I find pandas corr function that computes (several) correlation coefficients on (only) two columns. models like ARMA or ARIMA where the first "A" means autoregressive that's a regression of the same but time-lagged column. So, what I am looking for is a kind of symbolic regression (or similar) that can compute correlations of several columns of time series on another.
