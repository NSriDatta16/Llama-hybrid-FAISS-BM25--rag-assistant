Taking aside the technical aspects of applying the math, why would you want to do this? What you're basically saying is that each time you see new data point, you want to forget everything that you have learned until now and assume that you know nothing about your data besides the very recent history. Assume that your batter mis-hit one thousand times in a row and then had four hits, would you be prone to assume that he is a very good better because among the recent four bats he had 100% success rate? Unless you could assume that after four tries batter "forgets" all his previous skills and he becomes a totally different player, i.e. his past history tells you nothing about the current state, then your approach would be very flawed. If you want to take consideration the recent history and the changes over time, where past history has somehow less "weight" on the recent outcomes, then the current history, then you should probably consider some kind of time-series model that takes those factors into consideration. I doubt that discarding valid data does any good in here. Speaking more Bayesian, if you know the previous history, then you should adapt your prior to it, since prior tells you about your prior knowledge about the data. In this case, the past history is your prior knowledge. By discarding it you basically say that you don't care about the history and you know better what the batter's ability is -- this doesn't sound reasonable. This is the idea behind Bayesian updating .
