The whole idea of dimensionality reduction, then followed by a clustering algorithm (sometimes referred to as "tandem analysis" in the literature) is something that is commonly done but of course, the clustering problem is more generally seen as a question of whether there is an inherent structure in your data. If K-Means is actually producing some hardly interpretable results, this could be for several reasons; perhaps you might have got outliers in your data set? Especially K-Means is not the most robust clustering algorithm when it comes to outliers (K-Medians is a much better choice and there exist some more involved algorithms out there as well that you could go for). Also PCA is not fully robust to outliers, so I would be quite cautious about this. Sticking to your original question, the clusters might be "nicely separated" (since that is what K-Means seeks to find) but this is true for the observations once these are projected in PCA space. Moreover, have you used a certain method for obtaining the number of clusters or is this something you know in advance? This can also affect things, since different intrinsic measures of cluster quality (e.g. the average silhouette width) seek to find the number of clusters which yields clusters that are as dense and well-separated as possible, but even then you would need to apply this in the transformed feature space. Of course, as long as you can get some nice interpretable results out of your clustering output, that's all you really need so you may ignore some of these if you feel like it.
