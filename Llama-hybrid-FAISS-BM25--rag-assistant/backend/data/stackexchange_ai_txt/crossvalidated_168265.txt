Logistic Regression: Classification Table, Sensitivity and Specificity

I'm currently working with binary logistic regression in SAS to predict the probability of loan default and I have a problem with sensitivity and specificity. I have a data sample of about N=3650 with dependent variable DEFAULT(=1) or NOT DEFAULT(=0) and 14 independent variables (both continuous and categoricals). I used stepwise selection with 0.1 significance level to select only the significant variables (finally 7 of them). My problem is when I get the classification table with probability level 0.5, the percentages of sensitivity and specificity are 0% and 100% respectively. I have tried with different prob. levels (0.4 and 0.3) with no luck. Searching on the internet I found that one possible reason is the rare of events. In my data, the events(=1) are about 7% of the data and non events(=0) are about 93%. What is the reason of that and finally how can I improve the classification?
