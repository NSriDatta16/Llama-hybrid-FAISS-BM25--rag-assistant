No, there isn't. You could, however, write code which does this yourself. You would need to: Partition the returned HTML into different "areas" which you will apply to different parts of the page. You could do this on the controller (perhaps by rendering multiple actions and storing a list of the HTML fragments returned) or in JavaScript. Write JavaScript code to take the returned HTML, iterate the targets you'd like to update, and apply the appropriate HTML fragment to each. The code would look something like the code below. Don't use the Ajax form HTML helper. Instead, render a standard form and submit it via JavaScript. Example: $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "/action/controller", success: function(data) { var key; for (key in data) { $("#" + key).html(data[key]); } } }); This presumes that the action you call will return an object where the property names are the IDs of the elements to update, and the property values are the HTML fragments as strings.
