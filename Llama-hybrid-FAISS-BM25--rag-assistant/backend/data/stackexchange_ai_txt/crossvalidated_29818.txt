For linear Gaussian models it is better to use the bayesm package. It implements the semi-conjugate family of priors, and the Jeffreys prior is a limit case of this family. See my example below. These are classical simulations, there's no need to use MCMC. I do not remember whether the credibility intervals about the regression parameters are exactly the same as the usual least squares confidence intervals, but in any case they are very close. > # required package > library(bayesm) > # data > age tension y # model matrix > X # prior parameters > Theta0 A0 nu0 sigam0sq # number of simulations > n.sims # run posterior simulations > Data Prior Mcmc bayesian.reg beta.sims sigmasq.sims apply(beta.sims, 1, quantile, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) [,1] [,2] 2.5% 53.33948 1.170794 97.5% 77.23371 1.585798 > # to be compared with: > frequentist.reg
