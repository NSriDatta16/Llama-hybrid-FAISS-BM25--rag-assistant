How to work with an asymmetrical distribution

I'm looking at estimated and actual time taken for a range of projects, as these vary in length quite a lot I've normalised them so they are just estimate/actual, so an estimate of 16 days work that took 12 days shows as 0.75 and estimate of 5 days work that took 7 shows as 1.40. The total estimate/actual for all the projects is 1.09 so on average the estimates are ok and many are within 10% (45/127), but individually there is a very wide range. I can see the data is asymmetrical, of course nothing can be completed in less than zero time, but more generally there are about as many projects in the 1.0 -> 2.0 range as there are in the 0.5 -> 1.0 range. I believe this may follow for any 1.0 -> x vs 1/x -> 1.0. 0.23 0.36 0.48 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.58 0.58 0.60 0.63 0.63 0.65 0.69 0.69 0.70 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.80 0.81 0.83 0.83 0.83 0.83 0.83 0.86 0.86 0.88 0.88 0.88 0.89 0.90 0.91 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.94 0.95 0.95 0.96 0.96 0.97 0.97 0.97 0.98 0.98 0.99 0.99 0.99 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.02 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.06 1.08 1.09 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.11 1.14 1.14 1.15 1.15 1.17 1.17 1.19 1.20 1.20 1.20 1.21 1.21 1.21 1.22 1.24 1.24 1.25 1.26 1.28 1.28 1.29 1.32 1.33 1.34 1.36 1.39 1.40 1.41 1.42 1.46 1.58 1.60 1.61 1.63 1.75 1.81 1.82 1.94 2.12 2.15 2.44 2.56 2.67 2.73 If this were a standard distribution I would work out the sigma value and put a value on the accuracy of the estimates. I could then compare the sigma values between years to see if estimating accuracy is improving. Is there an equivalent or a transformation I can use to apply the same to this asymmetrical distribution?
