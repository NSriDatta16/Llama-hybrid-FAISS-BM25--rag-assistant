Google Visualization in JQuery Tabs not Displaying in Firefox 3.6.3

I seem to have a strange problem. I am working on a simple dashboard that is using JQuery tabs to organize and display Google Visualization graphs. I am using a modified PHP wrapper to generate the JavaScript for the Google Vis side of things. The Google Visualization graph renders correctly in Chrome, Safari, and Safari for the iPad, but not in Firefox 3.6.3. The iFrame that the Google Visualization creates is empty according to firebug, while it is populated and filled according to the Chrome developer tools. Has anyone run into something similar? Thanks for the help, Pat
