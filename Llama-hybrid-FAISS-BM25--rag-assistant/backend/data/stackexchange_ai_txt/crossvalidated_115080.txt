If the output volume for i-th person is $V_i$ while the input time is $t_i$, the average output per hour is $\sum_i V_i \over \sum_i t_i$ . If the median of $\sum_i V_i \over \sum_i t_i$ is far from $V_i \over t_i$, this means that the average output per hour is so big/so small due to few people who are either much more productive or much less productive than others. You may also look at the distribution of $V_i \over t_i$ and examine the variance.
