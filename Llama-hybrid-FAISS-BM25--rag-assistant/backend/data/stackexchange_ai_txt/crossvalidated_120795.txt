Not sure if this will help, but your problem reminds me a little bit of macroeconomic time series modelling where a similarly high number of regressors is available, although the time series are much shorter. J. Stock and M. Watson have a nice overview paper on dynamic factor models employed in this kind of setting. There you should find some tips on how to reduce the number of variables in your system to a comfortable level. This would allow you to model them as a vector autoregression (VAR) or similar. References Stock, James H., and Mark W. Watson. "Dynamic factor models." Oxford Handbook of Economic Forecasting. Oxford University Press, USA (2011): 35-59.
