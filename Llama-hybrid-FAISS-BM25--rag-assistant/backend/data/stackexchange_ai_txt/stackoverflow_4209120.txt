Subprocesses can be pretty awesome, but I guess you are looking for something like pango or the font rendering engine in Qt. It looks like you can achieve everything you need with QPainter::drawText(...) . See also QFont . It is worth noting that I have dragged in Qt specifically for font rendering before, without using it for anything else. It needs you to create a QCoreApplication -object, but that's it. Works like a charm :)
