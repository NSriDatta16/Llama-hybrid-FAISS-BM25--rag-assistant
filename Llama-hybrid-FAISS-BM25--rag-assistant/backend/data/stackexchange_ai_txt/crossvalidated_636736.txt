Assumption of logistic regression: How to check if the independent variables are linearly related to the log odds (in R)?

I want to check if my logistic regression assumes linearity of independent variables and log odds. I have made the model and tried to construct the linearity of independent variables and log odds, but I am unsure if this was done correctly. Furthermore, I do not know how to interpret this. I have used this code in R: model And I get this output, but I am not sure this is the correct way to check this. And I don't know how to interpret this.
