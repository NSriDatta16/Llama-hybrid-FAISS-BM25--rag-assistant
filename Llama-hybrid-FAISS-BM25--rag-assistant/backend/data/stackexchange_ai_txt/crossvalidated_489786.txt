In what way is what you are doing related to supervised learning? PCA does not require labels/outcomes. If you have 13 variables and 94 % of the variance can be explained by 10 components... then you haven't done much, may as well keep the 13 columns. In what way do your results "improve largely"? One would expect the new model to perform at most as good as the original model and not better, given that PCAs' main goal is feature reduction. There is one limitation (assumption) of PCA, and that is that it can capture linear correlations between the variables. Given that your variables are "totally independent", then I don't see the point of PCA in this case.
