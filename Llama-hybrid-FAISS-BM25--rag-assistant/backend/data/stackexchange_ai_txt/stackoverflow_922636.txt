as n8owl reminded us, automating a mess yields an automated mess - which is not an improvement. Many paper-forms systems have evolved over decades and can be quite redundant and unruly. Some may view "messing with the forms" as a violation of their personal fiefdoms, so watch your back ;-) model the workflow in terms of the forms used by whom in what roles for what purposes; this documents the current process as a baseline. Get estimates of how long each step takes, both in terms of man-hours and calendar time understand the workflow in terms of the information gathered, generated, and transmitted consolidate the information on the forms into a new set of forms for minimal workflow be prepared to be told "This is the way we've always done it and we're not going to change", and to gently (a) validate their feelings, (b) explain how less work is more efficient, and (c) show concrete benefits [vs.the baseline from step 1] soft-code when possible; use processing rules when possible; web services and html forms (esp. w/jquery) will go a long way if you have an intranet beware of canned packages (including sharepoint) unless you are absolutely certain they encompass your organization's current and future needs good luck! --S
