Exponential distribution doesn't imply that time between events grows exponentially. All it tells you is that probability to wait longer between events declines very quickly with waiting time. The probability density is: $$\lambda e^{-\lambda t}$$ where $\lambda$ is Poisson intensity, i.e. average number of events in unit of time, and $t$ is the waiting time. The average waiting time is obviously $1/\lambda$ .
