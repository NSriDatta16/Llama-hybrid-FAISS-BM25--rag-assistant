To be honest, if the project is in the middle ground where you may or may not be able to fund it personally, I'd say err on the side of caution. Too often, a project that should be able to be completed in a certain amount of time drags on. That can be the result of a mistaken estimate or because of opportunities that open up in the project that expand the scope. The worst thing I've seen happen to a promising project is that it runs out of funding just as it start to build steam.
