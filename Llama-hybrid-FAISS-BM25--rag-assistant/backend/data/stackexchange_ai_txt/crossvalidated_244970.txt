Given $N$ votes with $N_A$ voting for $A$ and $N_B$ for $B$, the most naive estimate for the standard deviation of the estimate $$ \hat \epsilon_A = \frac{N_A}{N} $$ is $$ \hat \sigma_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\hat \epsilon_A (1-\hat \epsilon_A)}{N} } $$ For your example, this yields an uncertainty of $\pm 0.6\%$. However, this is an approximation and breaks down when $\hat \epsilon_A$ is near 0 or 1 or when $N$ is small. In general, creating confidence intervals for fractions estimated from data sampled from a binomial distribution is difficult. Bayesian methods can yield superior results. See this good Wikipedia page . A much bigger issue than the mere statistical uncertainty, however, is the systematic uncertainty involved in making extrapolations to the final results. The earliest results are not iid sampled from the votes as a whole. For example, rural areas and urban areas report at different times. Factors like this end up being much more important than the mere statistical confidence interval, which can be much narrower than reality.
