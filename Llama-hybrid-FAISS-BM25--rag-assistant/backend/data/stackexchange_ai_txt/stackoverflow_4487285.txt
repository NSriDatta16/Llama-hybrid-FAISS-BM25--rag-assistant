My experience with Jasper and Birt (and the commercial Windward Reports) is that they will not help you much with the number crunching part of the report; they are best suited to presenting data that you have already transformed into a suitable structure. Jasper, Birt and Windward Reports can easily handle running totals and averages, but any calculations more complex than that are a real pain (and may be impossible depending on your calculations). I am not familiar with Pentaho. In your situation I would either implement the calcuations in custom Java code, or in an ETL process. You could then use a reporting engine to present the results of the calculations in HTML and Excel formats. But if you don't have Jasper or Birt, etc, already integrated into your application then I wouldn't recommend adding one just for this. It would be quicker to manually write out the report data using JSP and POI respectively. Jasper and Birt reports are fairly easy to create, but only once you've got the reporting engine integrated properly!
