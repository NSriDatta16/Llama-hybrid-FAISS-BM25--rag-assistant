Make my C++ Class iterable via BOOST_FOREACH

I have a class which I want to expose a list of structs (which just contain some integers). I don't want the outside to modify these data, just iterate over it and read them Example: struct TestData { int x; int y; // other data as well } class IterableTest { public: // expose TestData here }; now in my code I want to use my class like this: IterableTest test; BOOST_FOREACH(const TestData& data, test.data()) { // do something with data } I've already read this article http://accu.org/index.php/journals/1527 about memberspaces. However, I don't want to (or can't) save all TestData in an internal vector or something. This is because the class itself doesn't own the storage, i.e. there is actually no underlying container which can be accessed directly by the class. The class itself can query an external component to get the next, previous or ith element, though. So basically I want my class to behave as if it had a collection, but in fact it doesn't have one. Any ideas?
