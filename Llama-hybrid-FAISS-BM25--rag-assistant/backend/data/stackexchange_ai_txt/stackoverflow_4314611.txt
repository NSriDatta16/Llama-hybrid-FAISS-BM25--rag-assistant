Take a look at the Dialog Boxes Overview . The overview covers Message Boxes, Common Dialog Boxes, and Custom Dialog Boxes. In your case you'll want to create a simple Custom Dialog Box that includes a message, a checkbox, and however many buttons you need. Basically you need to define a new code-behind file that includes your TextBlock , CheckBox , and Button s in a panel object, and you need to extend Window . In your code-behind file you implement any necessary logic to implement the user's choice, and you return this result to the object containing the custom dialog box. Make sure to pay special attention to this line of code when creating your custom dialog box: // Open the dialog box modally messageBox.ShowDialog(); The call to ShowDialog() will ensure that the user must take action against your dialog box before moving on to other parts of your application.
