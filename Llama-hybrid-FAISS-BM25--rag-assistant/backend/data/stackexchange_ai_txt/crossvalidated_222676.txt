People sometimes break that quantity up a little differently and call $\bf{P=X(X^T X)^{-1}}X^{T}$ the P rojection matrix, influence matrix, or hat matrix. You can think of the projection matrix as mapping between the actual $y$ values and the predicted ones. The projection matrix has a number of handy properties. In particular, the $k$th element of its main diagonal ($\mathbf{P}_{k,k}$) contains the leverage score for the $k$th piece of data, which can be a useful piece of diagnostic information.
