auto.arima warns NaNs produced on std error

My data is a time series of employed population, L, and the time span, year. n.auto=auto.arima(log(L),xreg=year) summary(n.auto) Series: log(L) ARIMA(2,0,2) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 intercept year 1.9122 -0.9567 -0.3082 0.0254 -3.5904 0.0074 s.e. NaN NaN NaN NaN 1.6058 0.0008 sigma^2 estimated as 1.503e-06: log likelihood=107.55 AIC=-201.1 AICc=-192.49 BIC=-193.79 In-sample error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE -7.285102e-06 1.225907e-03 9.234378e-04 -6.836173e-05 8.277295e-03 MASE 1.142899e-01 Warning message: In sqrt(diag(x$var.coef)) : NaNs produced why does this happen? Why would auto.arima selects the best model with std error of these ar* ma* coefficients Not a Number? Is this selected model valid after all? My goal is to estimate the parameter n in the model L=L_0*exp(n*year). Any suggestion of a better approach? TIA. data: L
