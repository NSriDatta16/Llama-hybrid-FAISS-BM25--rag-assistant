Divide both numerator and denom. to the numerator term: $$p=\frac{1}{1+\exp((\hat\alpha_{apple,0}-\hat\alpha_{orange,0})+(\hat\alpha_{apple_1}-\hat\alpha_{orange,1})x)}$$ Basically, they're equivalent models and when fitted to the same data, they'll predict the same outcomes when trained enough. This is because the minimum is unique for logistic regression (using cross-entropy loss).
