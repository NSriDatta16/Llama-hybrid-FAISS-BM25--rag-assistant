You should read Design Patterns. You will find that Interfaces are critical to many types of useful Design Patterns. For example abstracting different types of network protocols will have the same interface (to the software calling it) but little code reuse because of different behaviors of each type of protocol. For some algorithms are eye opening in showing how to put together the myriad elements of a programming to do some useful task. Design Patterns do the same for objects.Shows you how to combine objects in a way to perform a useful task. Design Patterns by the Gang of Four
