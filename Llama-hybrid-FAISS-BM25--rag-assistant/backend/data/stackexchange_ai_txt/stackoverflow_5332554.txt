Transform and pivot like in mysql question

I hope someone could show me the light. I'm trying since a long time to get the result o some sales by week, day and year in one query with no chance. I have found a syntax that can help me but dont work in mysql. TRANSFORM Sum(Cantidad) AS Ventas SELECT Producto, Cantidad FROM Pedidos WHERE Fecha Between #01-01-1998# And #12-31-1998# GROUP BY Producto ORDER BY Producto PIVOT DatePart("m", Fecha) My real query is this one: select sum(orders.final_price) AS total , orders.id_comercial , vendedores.nombre from orders , vendedores WHERE orders.id_comercial = vendedores.id AND DATE(orders.date_purchased) = DATE(NOW()) GROUP BY orders.id_comercial I really will appreciate some ideas, it's maybe to late in teh night here in spain ;) The result of my query is this one: total id_comercial nombre 740.83 24 AITOR ANGULO 2069.37 29 FERNANDO I 482.05 32 JOSE ANDRES 961.32 33 ALBERTO FERNANDEZ -CANTABRIA- 908.66 34 GONZALO 49.54 38 LUIS LOPEZ 4082.42 39 JULEN DEL CURA 1512.87 43 ALBERTO POBLACION 1268.91 44 MASSIMO 3269.08 45 JOSE RAMON BURGA 56.49 47 EMPRESA 2791.65 48 MARCO MORILLO 1445.57 61 TINO 869.73 63 SONIA 1052.02 381 DAVID ARIAS Really thnx to all.
