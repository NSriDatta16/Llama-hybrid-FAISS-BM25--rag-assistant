Ranging [0,1] test set with parameters from training set

I am working on Machine Learning, particularly I have a dataset with 50+ columns and 100,000 rows. I need to get the data normalized with ranging to [0,1] (not with standardization) and I've split the dataset in a 80/20 percentatge for the training/test sets. My question is: I must normalize first the training set and then normalize the test set with the means and deviations extracted from the training set normalization. How can I do that to each one of the columns? I mean, is there a defined method to get the (mean, deviation) tuples for every column in the training set in order to be able to normalize the test set with those values?
