I assume both your "REST" and "SOAP" APIs must do the same thing and are therefore quite parallel. You ought to (re)read Roy Fielding's description of the REST architectural approach and then decide if these APIs are truly RESTful in Roy's very precise definition of the term. If they are both RESTful, then just ditch your SOAP APIs: SOAP is harder to use, doesn't leverage HTTP caches, and adds nothing over your REST APIs. If they are both non -RESTful (ie, they have a Remote Procedure Call flavor and the "REST" APIs just happen to do RPC operations using HTTP and XML), then assuming you can't convert them to the REST architectural style, you can at least factor out the POJO XML mappings using a library like XStream.
