The book 'The Ruby Programming Language' (David Flanagan & Yukihiro Matsumoto) gives two reasons to use 'and'. readability: if x > 0 and y > 0 and not defined? d then d = Math.sqrt(x*x +y*y) end make good use of the lower precedence: if a = get_from_db(x) and b = get_from_db(y) then do_stuff_with_true_values(a, b) end (code adapted by me) The last one just wouldn't work with '&&'. Personally, I use 'and' and 'or' combined with parentheses in case of doubt, for readability.-
