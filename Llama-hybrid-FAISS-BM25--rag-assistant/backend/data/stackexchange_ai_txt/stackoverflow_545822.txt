As far as Cruisecontrol.net is concerned, a project is a project. It doesn't care whether it's a branch or a trunk. Simply setup another project in the ccnet.config that points to where the branch is located. To keep things organized, i like to add the version number to the name of the branch projects like this: ProjectX ProjectX-4.0
