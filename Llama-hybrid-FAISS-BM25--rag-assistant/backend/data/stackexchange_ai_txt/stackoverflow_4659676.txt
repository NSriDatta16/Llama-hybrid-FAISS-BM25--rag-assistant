Most email clients (like Outlook) are nowhere near standards compliant. I don't know of one that fully support CSS 2. I've never heard of anyone embedding a CSS file inside an email and I doubt it would be very cross-client compatible even if it was possible. Unfortunately, the way to go with emails is old school HTML 4 tables with inline styles. Anything more than that and there will be big differences among the different clients.
