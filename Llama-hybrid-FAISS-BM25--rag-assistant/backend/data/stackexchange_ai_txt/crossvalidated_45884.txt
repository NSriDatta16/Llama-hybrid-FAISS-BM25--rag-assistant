Optimize Weights used in a Weighted Average

I want to calculate a weighted average, mostly for illustration purposes. However, I have an outcome variable that is Y/N and would like to optimize the weights relative to this outcome. What are some basic ways of doing this? Basically, I want/hope to use past data to drive the weights instead of arbitrary assignment.
