When your search function calls itself recursively, it has to pay attention to the returned value, and somehow determine whether it's found it or not. Your function doesn't do anything special when it finds nothing, which I suppose is OK because the return value will be undefined. else { var t = searchJson( tree.rows[x].tree,url); if (t) return t; }//end else That way, the first loop that finds the url will return the (hopefully non-empty) "title", and that will propagate up the stack as a non-empty value for all the "if (t)" statements on the call stack.
