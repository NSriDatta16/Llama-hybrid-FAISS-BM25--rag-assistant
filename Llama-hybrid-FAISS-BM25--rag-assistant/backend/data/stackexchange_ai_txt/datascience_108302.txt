Using XGBoost it is relatively easy to invoke a custom loss function . There are also quite a lot of already implemented options . It would look something like: library(ISLR) library(xgboost) library(tidyverse) library(Metrics) # Data df = ISLR::Hitters %>% select(Salary,AtBat,Hits,HmRun,Runs,RBI,Walks,Years,CAtBat,CHits,CHmRun,CRuns,CRBI,CWalks,PutOuts,Assists,Errors) df = df[complete.cases(df),] train = df[1:150,] test = df[151:nrow(df),] # XGBoost Matrix dtrain
