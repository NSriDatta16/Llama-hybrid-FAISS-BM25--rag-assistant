Your screen only has 320 x 480 pixels, so putting anything more on the layer seems to be a waste of memory. So you might as well translate the origin of and scale the original image from 2048 x 1526 pixels down to 320 x 480 pixels, before putting it onto a layer. If you use a UIScrollView to present the layer, for example, you would write code so that pinching and stretching would calculate a new 320 x 480 pixel representation based on the current zoom level, determined from the frame and bounds of the view. In your code, tapping-and-dragging would translate the origin and recalculate the missing bits. You can see this effect with Safari, when you zoom into the document. It goes from blurry to sharp as the new view is rendered. Likewise, as you drag the view, its newly missing parts are calculated and added to the view. Regardless of the touch event, you would probably only want to put a 320 x 480 pixel representation on the layer.
