To my knowledge, WCF does not provide any kind of automation to aid time conversions, and personally, I wouldn't expect it to. And I agree with you. Having to manually call the conversion routine is not the ideal. It doesn't "feel" elegant. To me, a more elegant solution would be to "lazily" evaluate the DateTime as it is needed. Instead of providing a function that must be called to convert the UTC times to local times, put this logic inside each DateTime property's get function. That way, when the DateTime is retrieved from the object, it is automatically converted to local time.
