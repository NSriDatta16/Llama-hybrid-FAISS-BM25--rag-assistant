I can not comment so I am answering this directly. Your problem is to find if there is a relationship between proportion spent and average score. Let us ignore standard deviation as of now and focus on the average score. I see three problems. It is risky to take averages of mechanics and electricity score - as you do not know how much proportion is spent for each of these individually. Assume proportion spent on mechanics is 0.3. It will establish a negative relationship between proportion and average score. However if proportion spent on mechanics is 0.2, it will establish a positive relationship between proportion spent and average score. An exactly similar case exists for Biology score. Number of data points that you have are too less to establish a relationship. And given that total Proportion spent in English is less than that spent in Biology, but average score is higher in English, the expected relationship of higher proportion implying higher average score is not valid. May be there are more parameters which need to be considered - Difficulty of exam/subject, Interest of students, IQ level of students taking the tests etc. However, even if you do have additional parameters, with only 3-4 data points, it is hard to establish a relationship.
