Expected time to wait for no events to occur within a sliding window assuming Poissson process

I wish to model the following: I am maintaining a sliding window (history) of 10 samples of the output of a signal detector. I model the probability of a detection failure (i.e absence of signal) as a Poisson process with a probability of (say) 0.2, so an average rate of 2 detection failures in any window of 10 samples, assuming the failures are independent. I wish to model the expected time & pdf, from the point where there are 10 consecutive detection failures, to the point where there are no detection failures present within the sliding window.
