Depends pn the database vendor... In SQL Server for example, you can create a column that calculates it's value based on the values of other columns in the same row . they are called calculated columns, and you do it like this: Create Table MyTable ( colA Integer, colB Integer, colC Intgeer, SumABC As colA + colB + colC ) In general just put the column name you want, the word 'as' and the formula or equation to ghenerate the value. This approach uses no aditonal storage, it calculates thevalue each time someone executes a select aganist it, so the table profile remains narrower, and you get better performance. The only downsode is you cannot put an index on a calculated column. (although there is a flag in SQL server that allows you to specify to the database that it should persist the value whenever it is created or updated... In which case it can be indexed) In your example, however, you are accessing data from multiple rows in another table. To do this, you need a trigger as suggested by other respondants.
