Out of Bag Prediction Error Estimate from Random Forest Regression (i.e., not classification)

I would like to use the OOB cases from a random forest fit to estimate the mean squared prediction error so I don't have to cross-validate. I am using the randomForest package in R. It is clear from the documentation that OOB error is reported for classification, but I can't figure out how to get OOB MSPE for regression. Am I missing it or is it truly not reported, which seems odd?
