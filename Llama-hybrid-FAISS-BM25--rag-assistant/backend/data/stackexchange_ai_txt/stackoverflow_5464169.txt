Overlapping UIViews

I have 4 UIView (each has a visible part on the screen) and I want them to be draggable. I am adding them just like any other view on a controller with addSubview:dragViewTop addSubview:dragViewBottom addSubview:dragViewRight addSubview:dragViewLeft My problem is that if I drag one view on top of another, even if I change it's layer.zPosition , I am able to drag one that is supposed to be beneath. That behavior is given (I think, not sure) by the order of the added views. I want that the view I am dragging stays on top. Any ideas? I hope I made myself clear.
