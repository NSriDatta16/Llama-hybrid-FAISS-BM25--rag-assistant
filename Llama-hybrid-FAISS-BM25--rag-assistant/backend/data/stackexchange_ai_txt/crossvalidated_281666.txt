How does ACF & PACF identify the order of MA and AR terms?

It's been more than 2 years that I am working on different time series. I have read on many articles that ACF is used to identify order of MA term, and PACF for AR. There is a thumb rule that for MA, the lag where ACF shuts off suddenly is the order of MA and similarly for PACF and AR. Here is one of the articles I followed from PennState Eberly College of Science. My Question is why is it so? For me even ACF can give AR term. I need explanation of thumb rule mentioned above. I am not able to understand thumb rule intuitively/mathematically that why - Identification of an AR model is often best done with the PACF. Identification of an MA model is often best done with the ACF rather than the PACF Please note:- I don't need how but "WHY". :)
