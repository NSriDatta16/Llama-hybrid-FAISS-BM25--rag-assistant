Static Variables in WCF

I have some WCF services. These services run in ASP.NET. I want these services to be able to access a static variable. My problem is, I'm not sure where the appropriate server level storage mechanism is. I don't want to use the database because of speed. But, I want the static variables to stay in memory as long as possible. In fact, I'd like it to stay until I restart my server if it all possible. Can anyone provide me with any ideas?
