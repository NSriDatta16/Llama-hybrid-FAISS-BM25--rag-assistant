Deep neural networks are very successful over a wide range of applications on raw and unstructured data, such as image pixels, signals, texts, etc. Their main advantage in these contexts is their ability to identify relevant features in the data. This task-oriented, data-driven feature identification usually outperforms generic hand-crafted feature extractors and models built on top of them. In your case, you have a very few features (possibly hand-crafted to represent aspects of the data that a domain expert would consider important?), which takes away the main advantage of neural networks. I do not see a reason why they should perform considerably better in this context. At the same time, as mentioned in the comments, neural networks require more engineering and parameter tuning, implying higher development costs.
