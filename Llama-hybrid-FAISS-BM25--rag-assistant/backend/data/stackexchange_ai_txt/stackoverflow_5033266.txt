Can I receive a callback whenever an NSPasteboard is written to?

I've read Apple's Pasteboard Programming Guide , but it doesn't answer a particular question I have. I'm trying to write a Cocoa application (for OS X, not iOS) that will keep track of everything that is written to the general pasteboard (so, whenever any application copies and pastes, but not, say, drags-and-drops, which also makes use of NSPasteboard). I could (almost) accomplish this by basically polling the general pasteboard on a background thread constantly, and checking changeCount . Of course, doing this would make me feel very dirty on the inside. My question is, is there a way to ask the Pasteboard server to notify me through some sort of callback any time a change is made to the general pasteboard? I couldn't find anything in the NSPasteboard class reference, but I'm hoping it lurks somewhere else. Another way I could imagine accomplishing this is if there was a way to swap out the general pasteboard implementation with a subclass of NSPasteboard that I could define myself to issue a callback. Maybe something like this is possible? I would greatly prefer if this were possible with public, App Store-legal APIs, but if using a private API is necessary, I'll take that too. Thanks!
