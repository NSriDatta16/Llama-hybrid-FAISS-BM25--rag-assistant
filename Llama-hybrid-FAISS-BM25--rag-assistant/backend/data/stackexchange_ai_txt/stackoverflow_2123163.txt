What does this stack trace possibly mean?

I'm having segfault problem in my application written using C++ and compiled using GCC 4.3.2. It is running under Debian 5 x64. The process crashed on the following line of code: #0 0x00000000007c720f in Action::LoadInfoFromDB (this=0x7fae10d38d90) at ../../../src/server/Action.cpp:1233 1233 m_tmap[tId]->slist[sId] = pItem; The stack trace that i got from the core dump is as follows: #0 0x00000000007c720f in Action::LoadInfoFromDB (this=0x7fae10d38d90) at ../../../src/server/Action.cpp:1233 ItemGuid = ItemEntry = pItem = (class Item *) 0x2b52bae0 fields = tId = 1 '\001' sId = 0 '\0' result = (QueryResult *) 0x7fadcae3d8e0 #1 0x00000000007c7584 in Action::DisplayInfo (this=0x0, session=0x7fadbdd44a20) at ../../../src/server/Action.cpp:1090 data = { = {static DEFAULT_SIZE = 4096, _rpos = 220043248, _wpos = 5469086, _storage = { >> = { _M_impl = { > = { > = { }, }, _M_start = 0x41200000 , _M_finish = 0x0, _M_end_of_storage = 0x7fad00000000 }}, }}, m_code = 51152} #2 0x00000000007d01a3 in Session::HandleAction (this=0x7fadbdd44a20, recv_data=@0x25d83780) at ../../../src/server/ActionHandler.cpp:862 pAction = (Action *) 0x0 ActionId = 1079 GoGuid = In frame #1, Action::DisplayInfo was called from Session::HandleAction on pAction . However frame #1 shows this=0x0 , and frame #2 shows pAction = (Action *) 0x0 . I can't understand why this caused a crash. What does this possibly mean? DisplayInfo can't be called on a null reference ! Any help is most appreciated. Thanks
