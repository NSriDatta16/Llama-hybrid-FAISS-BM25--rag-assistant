Is there a SQL server performance counter for average execution time?

I want to tune a production SQL server. After making adjustments (such as changing the degree of parallelism) I want to know if it helped or hurt query execution times. This seems like an obvious performance counter, but for the last half hour I've been searching Google and the counter list in perfmon, and I have not been able to find a performance counter for SQL server to give me the average execution time for all queries hitting a server. The SQL Server equivalent of the ASP.NET Request Execution Time. Does one exist that I'm missing? Is there another effective way of monitoring the average query times for a server?
