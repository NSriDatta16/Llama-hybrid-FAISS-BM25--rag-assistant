Managing Time Series Compute Costs

This is a question about how to build time series models with a reasonable compute cost. I have about 100 items to forecast. For each of these forecast items, I am building 8 separate models to accommodate limitations in the exogenous data I am using to build the models. So, one model is built to forecast steps 1 to 5 , a second model to forecast steps 6 to 11, etc. Due to the limited amount of data I have, I'm building SARIMAX models, using brute force grid search to find optimal sets of hyperparameters. To test individual sets of hyperparameters, I am using a simple holdout data set. I would prefer to use some sort of time series cross validation to get more reliable measures, however that quickly increases my already high computing cost up by maybe 5 to 8 times. Is there a way to get the benefits of time series cross validation without the enormous computing cost?
