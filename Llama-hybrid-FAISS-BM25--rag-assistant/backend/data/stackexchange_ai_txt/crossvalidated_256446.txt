In A, a standard deviation in the measured values which is smaller than the error on a single measurement would come about from measuring, say, 7.30 $\pm$ 0.05 cm over and over again, in which case the uncertainty in each measurement cannot be ignored in the error propagation -- in fact it dominates. In B and C, rounding the average value to the matching most significant digit or keeping one additional digit are typical, as can be seen, for instance, in the PDG review of particle physics books/booklets or in papers on arxiv.org. In C, note that 7.3 $\pm$ 1.3 cm has useful information: if someone else measures 8.5, this is 'within uncertainty,' but would not be if you reported 7 $\pm$ 1 cm.
