Does logistic regression try to predict the true conditional P(Y|X)?

Consider a binary classification dataset (X, Y), generated according to some unknown distribution $P(X, Y)$ . I have a question about models which output probabilities by minimizing the cross-entropy loss (logistic regression and deep models using a final softmax layer). do these models attempt to predict the true conditional probability $P(Y|X)$ ? or do they aim for a weaker result, like for example trying to get the order between the classes right?
