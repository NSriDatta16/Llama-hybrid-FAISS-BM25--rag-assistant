How do you determine the weight of different sample sizes?

I'm not intimately familiar with statistics, please keep your answers in the realm a layman could understand. I've been tasked to create rankings for QA scores at a company. I could just use the average scores and throw that up on the board. However, that does not seem correct. If I have someone that has had 200 QA's and averages out at 80%, and another person who has had 5 QA's and averages out at 85%, it does not seem like a fair comparison to rank person #2 higher. A single high-QA could bump his score up significantly where the same would hardly touch the first persons overall average. What would be a good way to weight these? Do these need to have weights based on total number of QAs?
