You mention it in your post, but I think this is an important point that deserves more attention: unless every input parameter is a different type, the big problem with huge constructors is that it's very easy to transpose a couple of variables. The compiler is an unreliable safety net -- it will catch some mistakes, but the ones that slip through are going to be much more difficult to identify and debug. Especially because the input list for a huge constructor is quite opaque unless you've got the API open in another window. Getters and setters are vastly easier to debug, especially if you institute safeguards that throw a runtime exception if the object isn't properly populated. And I'm a huge fan of "easy to debug." Prior to this thread I'd never heard of the Builder pattern Rob mentions. Never used it myself (obviously), but it's damned intriguing.
