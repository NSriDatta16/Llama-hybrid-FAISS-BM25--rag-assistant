Beginning Java (Working with Arrays; Class Assignment)

I am to the point where I feel as if I correctly wrote the code for this homework assignment. We were given a skeleton and 2 classes that we had to import (FileIOHelper and Student). /* * Created: *** put the date here *** * * Author: *** put your name here *** * * The program will read information about students and their * scores from a file, and output the name of each student with * all his/her scores and the total score, plus the average score * of the class, and the name and total score of the students with * the highest and lowest total score. */ // import java.util.Scanner; import java.io.*; // C:\Users\Adam\info.txt public class Lab6 { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { // Fill in the body according to the following comments Scanner key boardFile = new Scanner(System.in); // Input file name String filename = getFileName(keyboardFile); //Open the file // Input number of students int numStudents = FileIOHelper.getNumberOfStudents(filename); Student students[] = new Student[numStudents]; // Input all student records and create Student array and // integer array for total scores int totalScore[] = new int[students.length]; for (int i = 0; i = totalScore[maxScore]){ maxScore = i; } else if(totalScore[i] avg){ System.out.print("+"); }else{ System.out.print("="); } } // Given the number of students, this method outputs a message // stating what the total number of students in the class is. private static void outputNumberOfStudents(int n) { System.out.println("The total number of students in this class is: \t" + n); } // Given the average total score of all students, this method // outputs a message stating what the average total score of // the class is. private static void outputAverage(int average) { System.out.println("The average total score of the class is: \t" + average); } // Given the Student with highest total score and the student's // total score, this method outputs a message stating the name // of the student and the highest score. private static void outputMaxStudent( Student student, int score ) { System.out.println(student.getName() + " got the maximum total score of: \t" + score); } // Given the Student with lowest total score and the student's // total score, this method outputs a message stating the name // of the student and the lowest score. private static void outputMinStudent( Student student, int score ) { System.out.println(student.getName() + " got the minimum total score of: \t" + score); } } But now I get an error at the line totalScore[i] = totalScore[i] + students[i].getScore(j); Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException at Lab6.main(Lab6.java:42)
