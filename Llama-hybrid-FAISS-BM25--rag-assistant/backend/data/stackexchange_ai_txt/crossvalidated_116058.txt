Missing data on Extreme Value Analysis

I am analyzing (extreme value analysis) the dataset which contain daily rainfall over 100 years of a single location. However there are around 500 missing values on the whole dataset. In this case the exact reason why data is missing is not known, but it is highly likely that it is due to flood. The place where rainfall is gathered is sorrounded by flood. That means there is high probability of that data might contain high rain fall values(Missing Not at Random). So mean substitution or omitting missing values won't be a good choice. What are the options that are available in this case ( I am open to classic statical approaches as well as machine learning based approaches as well).
