How to determine if a categorical variable affects an independent variable?

I am looking at the wine dataset from the R FactoMineR package to find out whether the categorical variable soil type affects the feature set. Basically there are four distinct soil types and 29 different features and there are 20 observations obs soil f1 f2 ... f29 1 1 11 87 ... 20 . . . . ... . 7 2 13 10 ... 10 . . . . ... . 15 3 77 53 ... 54 . . . . ... . 20 4 88 81 ... 21 Given that I cannot use ANOVA or logistic regressions what other ways are there to figure out if the soil type affects the features? I am considering using box plots for visual inspection, but 29 box plots seems like a bit much. Are there any succinct plot types that could give me this kind of information?
