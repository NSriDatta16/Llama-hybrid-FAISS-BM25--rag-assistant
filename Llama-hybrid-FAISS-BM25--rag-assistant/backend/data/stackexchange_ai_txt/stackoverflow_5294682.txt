Looks like the Watir documentation rating system is set up through polldaddy . For this particular case, it appears they include the polldaddy javascript which populates the rating div container with their star rating widget. Looks like there's a corresponding javascript object which you can inspect: console.log( PDRTJS_101132_page_2.avg_rating ); //=> 4 If you had numerous rating widgets like these on a page, and you were able to make a collection of the javascript objects paired with their divs, presumably you could sort them based on that average rating property.
