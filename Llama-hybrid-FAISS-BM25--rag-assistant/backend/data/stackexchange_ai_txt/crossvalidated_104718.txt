The standard solution to this is a checksum. A checksum is a linear combination of the numbers. It is designed to change when certain kinds of errors are made. For example, the average of the grades is a checksum: it multiplies each of $n$ grades by $1/n$ and adds up the results. If any single grade is altered, the checksum is altered. A convenient checksum to detect swaps in a list of numbers is to multiply the grades by $1,2,\ldots, n$ (in any order). Specifically, writing $(g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)$ for the list of grades, compute $$g_1 + 2g_2 + \cdots + i g_i + \cdots + n g_n.$$ When $g_i$ and $g_j$ are swapped, the checksum changes by an amount $$(i g_j + j g_i)- (i g_i + j g_j) = (i-j)(g_j - g_i).$$ It is an error to swap two different grades when $g_j-g_i\ne 0$; but since $i\ne j$, the change in the checksum must be nonzero, demonstrating that this checksum always detects a single swap. (It often will detect multiple swaps, but it is not guaranteed to do so.)
