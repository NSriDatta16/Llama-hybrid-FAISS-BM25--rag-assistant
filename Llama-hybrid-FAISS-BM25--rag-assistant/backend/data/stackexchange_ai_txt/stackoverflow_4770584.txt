check box value posting and jquery ajax

i have this scenario in my program, i'm printing a list of check boxes to my main page using below codes query($sql); $counter = 0; echo " "; while ($row = $result->fetch()) { $output[] = " "; $output[] = " "; $output[] = " "; $output[] = " "; $output[] = $row['name']; $output[] = " "; $output[] = " "; $counter++; } echo join('',$output); echo " "; ?> after that i'm using the below code to get the process done using jquery ajax $('#see').click(function(eve){ eve.preventDefault(); $.post('two.php', function(data) { $('#results_of_interactions').html(data); }); }); but i need to get the selected check box values inside my two.php(the files handling the processes of the above form) file in order to execute a sql query, but when i use this jquery approach the check box variables are not available at my two.php file, so my query is not properly executed and i can't get the results, how can i correct this issue?please suggest some thing to do, a modification to this or another approach? regards, Rangana
