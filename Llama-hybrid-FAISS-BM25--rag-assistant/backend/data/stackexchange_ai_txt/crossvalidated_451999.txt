'Median scaling' and 'Normalization by median deviation'

Here I am providing a paragraph from a paper, "This “median” scaling is performed by subtracting the median of the variable’s distribution in the data sample and normalising by the median deviation." Could anyone throw some light on the same? What exactly is median scaling and median deviation and how these both are used in the normalisation as mentioned above? Thanks in anticipation.
