Sequential inference of a Gaussian process with large data

In Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis 3 , on page 504, in the chapter on Gaussian processes, it says: In the univariate case the computation can be made in time O(n) using sequential inference, and computation is no problem even for n greater than million. What method(s) are the writer referring to here? I tried browsing trough the references in the Bibliographic note, but couldn't get far.
