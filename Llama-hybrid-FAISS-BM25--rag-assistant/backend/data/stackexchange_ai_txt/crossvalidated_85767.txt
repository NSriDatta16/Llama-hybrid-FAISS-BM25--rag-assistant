How are kernels applied to feature maps to produce other feature maps?

I am trying to understand the convolution part of convolutional neural networks. Looking at the following figure: I have no problems understanding the first convolution layer where we have 4 different kernels (of size $k \times k$), which we convolve with the input image to obtain 4 feature maps. What I do not understand is the next convolution layer, where we go from 4 feature maps to 6 feature maps. I assume we have 6 kernels in this layer (consequently giving 6 output feature maps), but how do these kernels work on the 4 feature maps shown in C1? Are the kernels 3-dimensional, or are they 2-dimensional and replicated across the 4 input feature maps?
