Just spitballing here, but this seems like as much of an economics problem as a statistics one. Given your application, it seems like you want to pick the model that maximizes your "profit": what the user would spend without the voucher plus the additional spend due to the voucher less the cost of the voucher. I'm assuming you are predicting spend and, based on predicted spend, classifying them into one of a small number of voucher categories. If so, misclassification costs you more for different types of spenders, depending on how many there are, how much they spend, and how sensitive they are to your vouchers. If so, you could do something like the following: Write down an equation for profit from a user conditional on their predicted and actual spend category. Aka, what will the average person in a spend category spend given their assigned voucher / predicted spend. $ \pi(s,\hat{s})$ = ... Write down total expected profits using the the share of people in each category (from historical data) and the probability of misclassification. $ \pi = \sum_sPr(s)\sum_\hat{s}Pr(\hat{s}|s)\pi(s,\hat{s})$ Now you have a function for profit based on your probabilities of misclassification. You can use this to select a model. Like RMSE or other metrics, this weights different size errors more or less, but it's based on your specific situation rather than a mathematical function.
