I would have pointed to Buck Woolley's dwExtreme site for an example of how to do a gantt in native DataWindow. However, "simple" I don't think is in your future if you want to roll your own. In fact, I'll be pleasantly surprised if someone writes a posting that includes a full description; I think it would take pages. (I'd be happy if someone proved me wrong.) In the meantime, here are some DataWindow basics I think you would need: You can create an external DataWindow whose data source is not tied to a table Columns in the data set do not have to be shown on the user interface Columns in the data set can be used in expressions to evaluate attributes, so you could have a column for each of the following attributes of a rectangle: x width color I'd expect this to be a lot of work and time, and very likely to be worth the purchase the component (unless your time is valued at next to nothing, which in some IT shops is close to true). Good luck, Terry
