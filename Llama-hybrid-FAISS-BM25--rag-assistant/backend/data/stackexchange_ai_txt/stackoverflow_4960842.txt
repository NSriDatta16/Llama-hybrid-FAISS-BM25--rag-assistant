Since you're using MATLAB already I suggest you look into the Genetic Algorithms solver (known as GATool, part of the Global Optimization Toolbox ) and the Neural Network Toolbox . Between those two you should be able to save quite a bit of figuring out. You'll basically have to do 2 main tasks: Come up with a representation (or encoding) for your candidate solutions Code your fitness function (which basically tests candidate solutions) and pass it as a parameter to the GA solver. If you need help in terms of coming up with a fitness function, or encoding of candidate solutions then you'll have to be more specific. Hope it helps.
