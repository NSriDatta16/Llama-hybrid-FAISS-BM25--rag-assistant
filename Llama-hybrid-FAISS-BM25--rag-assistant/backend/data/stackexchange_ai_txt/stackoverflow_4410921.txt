flash UI, how to drag symbol with tween

I want to drag symbol that has a tween. As soon as I drag, tween gets messed up, since flash thinks I want to manually adjust tween. No, I just changed size of stage and want to tween start and end same way but in different position. You could drag by tween line, but this particular tween just changes opacity so no luck. Is there some shift-control-something key sequence to drag symbol with tween intact?
