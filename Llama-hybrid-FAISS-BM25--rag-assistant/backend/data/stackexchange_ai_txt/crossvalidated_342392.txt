Time Series One Step Ahead vs N-Step Ahead

When building a time series model is there a difference both from a theoretical perspective and a practical performance perspective to train a one-step ahead prediction model and forecast one-by-one in to the future for N steps vs to train directly an N-step ahead model? If the purpose is to forecast N steps into the future, would an N-step ahead model have any performance advantages?
