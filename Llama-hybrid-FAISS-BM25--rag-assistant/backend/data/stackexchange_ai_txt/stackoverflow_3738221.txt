Creating and downloading CSV with PHP

I'm using PHP to create a CSV file from a database query. I run the query, set the headers, and load the page up in Firefox and the file promps for download and opens in excel just like it's supposed to. When I try it in IE, I get an error saying Internet Explorer cannot download ReportPrint.php from www.website.com. Internet Explorer was not able to open this Internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found. Please try again later. Not sure what can be done to fix this. header('Content-Description: File Transfer'); header("Content-Type: application/csv") ; header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=Report.csv"); header("Pragma: no-cache"); header("Expires: 0"); echo "record1,record2,record3\n";
