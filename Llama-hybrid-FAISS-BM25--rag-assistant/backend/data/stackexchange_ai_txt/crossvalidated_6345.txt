The main advantages of a Bayesian approach, at least to me as a researcher in Psychology are: 1) lets you accumulate evidence in favor of the null 2) circumvents the theoretical and practical problems of sequential testing 3) is not vulnerable to reject a null just because of a huge N (see previous point) 4) is better suited when working with small effects (with large effects both Frequentist and Bayesian methods tend to agree pretty much all the time) 5) allows one to do hierarchical modeling in a feasible way. For instance, introducing item and participant effects in some model classes like Multinomial Processing Tree models would need to be done in a Bayesian framework otherwise computing time would be insanely long. 6) gets you "real" confidence intervals 7) You require 3 things: the likelihood, the priors, and probability of the data. the first you get from your data, the second you make up, and the third you don't need at all given proportionality. Ok, maybe I exaggerate a little ;-) Overall, one can invert your question: Does this all mean that classical frequentist stats are not sufficient? I think that saying "no" is too harsh a verdict. Most problems can be somewhat avoided if one goes beyond p-values and looks at stuff like effect sizes, the possibility of item effects, and consistently replicate findings (too many one-experiment papers get published!). But not everything is that easy with Bayes. Take for instance model selection with non-nested models. In these cases, the priors are extremely important as they greatly affect results, and sometimes you dont have that much knowledge on most of the models you wanna work with in order to get your priors right. Also, takes reaaaally long.... I leave two references for anybody that might be interested in diving into Bayes.
