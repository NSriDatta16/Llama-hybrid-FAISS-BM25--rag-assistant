DES is broken so far as storing sensitive data, and so I would certainly not use it in anything new, and would replace it in anything used for long term storage of any information of interest (data that someone would have a profit for national security interest in stealing). At the moment a DES message can be broken by brute force in a couple of days (or less) using under $100,000 worth of custom hardware. But there are some key factors in that: The hardware is custom - the chips used to quickly brute a DES key are not the general purpose processor you'd find in a PC. That being said there is probably room today for using a cluster of Playstation 3s or current generation graphics cards with a GPGPU to crack a DES message in a reasonable amount of time, perhaps bringing down the cost to maybe $15,000. The other factor is time - a DES message can be cracked in a day, but if your CAPTCHA library has a timestamp that specifies a 30 minute timeout for any given CAPTCHA response, it would still be effective (you could scale up your hardware, but then you're talking millions). Overall I'd say that for non-long term storage, DES is still secure against "script kiddies".
