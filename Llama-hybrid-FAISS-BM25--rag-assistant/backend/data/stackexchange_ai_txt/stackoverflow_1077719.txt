Fastest way to debug Firefox addons during development

Debugging a Firefox addon is a slow process: (1) edit source code in a JS editor (2) package into XPI using a build script (3) drag into Firefox to install (4) restart Firefox (5) open the JavaScript Debugger Can we speeden up the process? Like install it into Firefox without a restart, or configure the build script to install it into Firefox as well?
