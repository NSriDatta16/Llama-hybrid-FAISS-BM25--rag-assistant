I'm having a problem with my dissertation. My research is "level of satisfaction in relation to customer service: comparative study between 2 fast foods my questionnaire consists of 19 questions. I'm using SERVERF, the 5 dimensions. 8 questions for Tangibility, 3 for Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance and 2 questions for Empathy. Example in Tangibility, "Personnel's appearance" the respondents will choose between 1 to 5. 5 - very satiesfied to 1 very unsatisfied. I have dissected my data, results of survey according to age, gender, year level and schools. Example, in gender, female, I have the mean per question, example Q#1 and so on, average mean of all the dimensions, exmple tangibility (Q#1 to Q8) then other dimensions, WAM of female, overall satisfaction to fastfood 1 & 2. then male... My respondents are students whose customer of both fastfood. my question is, how to know if there's a significance between the two establishment according to age, gender, year level and school. I've tried using regression analysis, dependent variable is Gender then independent variable are the overall satisfaction of my respondents in the two fast food. SPSS gave me the sig. of gender and fastfood 1; fastfood 2 and gender. my null hypothesis is "There is no significant difference in the overall level of customer satisfaction in relation to customer service between the 2 fastfood" I want to know if there's a significant between the 2 fastfood when it comes to gender. is that possible? in spss? btw, I know that my data is ordinal because I used likert scale. also checked if my data is normally distributed, it's not. so non-parametric. I'm new to spss. been using it for a week now. can someone help me? Thanks
