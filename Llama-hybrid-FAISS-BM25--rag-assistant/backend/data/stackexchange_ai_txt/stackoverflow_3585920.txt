If an immutable map fits your needs then there is a library by google called guava (see also guava questions ) Guava provides an ImmutableMap with reliable user-specified iteration order. This ImmutableMap has O(1) performance for containsKey, get. Obviously put and remove are not supported. ImmutableMap objects are constructed by using either the elegant static convenience methods of() and copyOf() or a Builder object.
