1) The advantages and disadvantages of each training alg. i.e SMO, LS and QP SMO: state-of-the-art for nonlinear SVM. Always use SMO over traditional QP as it is way faster. By LS I assume you refer to LS-SVM, which is a distinct algorithm from standard SVM and should not be compared directly. 2) In general case, what is the suitable alg. ? SMO. 3) If the choice of one of them can impact the classification performance ? No. Unless you heavily use additonal heuristics to decrease training time. 4) If the are any relationship between the choice of training method (or alg.) and the choice of the kernel function. No. The choice of kernel defines the optimization problem. The methods you list are ways to solve said optimization problem (SMO and QP solve traditional SVM, LS-SVM is a different optimization problem).
