Your approach is broadly valid. It's not the case that: this just seem to be because when the time-series are not fully overlapping, the cross correlation is summing fewer data points. The value of the correlation does not depend on the N. Of course the accuracy of the estimate does depend on N, but not the expected value. Another frequent approach in time series is also the check the correlation of the trend - often used in financial time series. Then each new data point i would be: ( x_t=i / x_t=(i-1) )
