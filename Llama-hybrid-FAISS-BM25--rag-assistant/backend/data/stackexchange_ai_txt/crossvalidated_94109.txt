Standard deviation of several measurements with uncertainties

I have two 2 hours of GPS data with a sampling rate of 1 Hz (7200 measurements). The data are given in the form $(X, X_\sigma, Y, Y_\sigma, Z, Z_\sigma)$, where $N_\sigma$ is the measurement uncertainty. When I take the mean of all measurements (e.g. the average Z value of those two hours), what is its standard deviation? I can of course calculate the standard deviation from the Z values, but then I neglect the fact that there are known measurement uncertainties... Edit: The data is all from the same station, and all coordinates are remeasured every second. Due to satellite constellations etc., every measurement has a different uncertainity. The purpose of my analysis is to find the displacement due to the an external event, (i.e. an earthquake). I would like to take the mean for 7200 measurements (2h) before the earthquake and another mean for 2h after the earthquake, and then calculate the resulting difference (in height for example). In order to specifiy the standard deviation of this difference, I need to know the standard deviation of the two means.
