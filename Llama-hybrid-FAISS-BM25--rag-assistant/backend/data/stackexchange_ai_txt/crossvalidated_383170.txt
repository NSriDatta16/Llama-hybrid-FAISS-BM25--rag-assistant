Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing by Simo Särkkä is one of my favorites. It's all about state space models. It starts with high-level discussion of the modeling philosophy and domains of application. It then works its way from linear, Gaussian systems and the Kalman filter to the advanced Monte Carlo techniques that are used for non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. I don't think you'll find much "giving the pros/cons when comparing it to other approaches." But otherwise, give it a whirl.
