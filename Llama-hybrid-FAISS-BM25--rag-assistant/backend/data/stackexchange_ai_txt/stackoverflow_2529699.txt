I've just come off the "helper functions" path and the one thing that bugged me was that I continued adding functions in one file which grew and grew with identical or similar or defunct functions. I think the line count was at 600 and that is way to much for a single file in my opinion. This has not put me off the idea but I'll be more organised for the next trek. I'll probably split the db functions into multi files according to the db operation (select, insert etc...). So my advice is to go try the "helper functions" and be as organized as you can. Also, I used PDO for the first time and quite liked it. Its not as low tech as the mysql() functions or as bloat tech like some we could mention but won't. I'll be using PDO again.
