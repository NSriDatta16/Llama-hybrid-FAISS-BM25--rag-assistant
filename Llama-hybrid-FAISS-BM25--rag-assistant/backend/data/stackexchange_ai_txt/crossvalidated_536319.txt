Per @whuber's comment, np.std() provides a biased estimate of the sample standard deviation . Fortunately, the function allows you to correct for that by specifying a number of degrees of freedom with the ddof parameter: s = samples.std(axis=1, ddof=1) Fixing this gives coverage probabilities that are consistent with the expected 95% CI: (0.9485, 0.9508)
