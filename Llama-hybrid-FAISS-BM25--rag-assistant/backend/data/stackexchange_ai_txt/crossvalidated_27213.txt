Negative weights in a moving average?

A number of well known moving averages, such as Spencer's 15 point MA , and Henderson moving averages have negative weights in the averages. What does this mean in a conceptual sense? What information are you trying to obtain from the data corresponding to those terms? Why is this more sensible than just weighting those terms = 0, and reducing some of the weights on the more central terms proportionally? Clarification : As Emre correctly points out, these negative weights satisfy a mathematical criterion. But that begs the question: what is the real world statistical/conceptual effect of that mathematical requirement ? Does it make logical sense to negatively weight data that you know isn't giving "negative" information (ie. data that isn't lying)?
