I side with your editor. You plot the obtained values on the plot, then draw a mean (average) line, then calculate three standard deviations above and below the line to show the boundaries. There's really no modeling involved here, hence, there's no random variable defined explicitly. You could argue that implicitly the variables are introduced, of course, but I'd go with your editor's choice to de-emphasize modeling at this stage. Here's the original page with a chart. If you read the whole text they consistently use terms значение (величина) that stand for value or quantity , in my opinion, to emphasize the phenomenological nature of the approach. There's very little of statistical content in the paper. All they do is to watch control boundary breaches to detect stochastic controllability as they define it. I'd definitely stick with value here. UPDATE: The link I gave was just one example how this paragraph is copied in Russian from one text to another. Google will spit you out dozens of example such as this one from medical field. There must be the original text from which this is copied, I suspect it's Russian translation of Chambers Wheeler book Understanding Statistical Process control. So, the precise answer would be to locate the English original in this (or other?) book. UPDATE 2: I don't the have the original English text from translation of which the Russian paragraph was copied, but here's a control chart description on NIST web site. Notice how they never use the term "variable". Consistent with my answer they use "measurement", "value" and "data point".
