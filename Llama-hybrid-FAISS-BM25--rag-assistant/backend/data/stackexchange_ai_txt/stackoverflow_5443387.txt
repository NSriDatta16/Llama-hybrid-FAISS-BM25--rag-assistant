assuming that your UIPickerView instance (object) is called pv; This is how your header-file may look like: @interface YourViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UIPickerView *pv; } @property (nonatomic, retain) UIPickerView *pv; @end You then need to connect the pv-instance within the InterfaceBuilder to your Picker-View. Trivial Approach: somewhere in your viewDidLoad of the embedding view-controller: pv.hidden = YES; within the button action method (connected to your button-touch-up-instide event): pv.hidden = NO; within the action method of your "menu" pv.hidden = YES;
