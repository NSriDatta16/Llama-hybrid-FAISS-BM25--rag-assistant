Best clustering algorithm for real estate data

I want to cluster real estate data to determine average price patterns in city and rural regions. My data set contains size, number of dorms, bathrooms and coordinates of the properties. Which would be the best clustering algorithm for this problem? I’m familiar with k-means, but in this case I don’t think it would be the best approach because I don’t want to pre determine the number of clusters in data.
