A problem with statistical hypothesis tests is that they are directly testing the models and only indirectly your interpretations of these models. Say you determine the absence of some effect is not present in your model, then either the effect is not present or the effect is present but you modelled it wrongly. It can go both ways: In the case of interventions you need to consider a lag between the time the interventions started and the time series starts to show the difference. If you do not do this, then you may wrongly conclude absence of the effect. Also most interventions are not part of a controlled study and multiple factors that can have an influence change at the same time. And you may observe a change in the time series that you wrongly ascribe to the intervention.
