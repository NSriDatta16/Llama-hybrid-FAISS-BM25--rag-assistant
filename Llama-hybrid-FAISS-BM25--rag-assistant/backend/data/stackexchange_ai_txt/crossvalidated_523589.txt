This is probably unsettled terminology, especially once you start crossing disciplinary boundaries, but according to Baby Wooldridge (7e), APE and AME are synonyms: There are at least three calculations that you can do that correspond to different thought experiments about what happens to $\Pr(Y=1 \vert X, age)$ when age: goes from observed $age$ to $age+1$ (most common) goes from $20$ to $21$ (i.e., pretend everyone is 20 in your data, less common) when $age$ goes from $age$ to $age+1$ for all the folks who are 20 in your data (fairly uncommon, equivalent to (2), but for a subset of the data) The only difference between (1) and (3) is the sample over which the average is computed. The latter is occasionally interesting, but usually, you would do something like the effect of age for women rather than the effect of age for 20-years-olds. (2) used to be common, but typically you would also set the other covariates to some interesting value (like means, medians, modes, or something like an 18-year-old male HS graduate). You can think of this as the effect of age for an "interesting" or "representative" person. It's hard to recommend which one to use since we don't know what you have in mind. However, (1) is probably a reasonable default. I am using effect here, but these are associations or correlations.
