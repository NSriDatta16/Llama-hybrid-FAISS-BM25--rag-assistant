In the absence of more information, no one is going to be able to give you any insight into what "the values in each coordinate column" mean. Since you have the data, you can do this yourself if what you want is a simple, heuristically driven method for deriving insights. Simply run features by cluster means, medians or sums, as appropriate, and pass this into a spreadsheet with the clusters in the columns and the features in the rows being sure to include a "grand mean" (or median) column. By indexing the cluster results to the grand mean for each feature and reranking the features by column indices for each cluster in turn, a profile should emerge as to how the clusters differ from (or are similar to) one another. Another step that is definitely worth pursuing is to use training and test (or holdout) samples since most clustering algorithms (this includes SVM routines) virtually guarantee solutions that are significantly different for the calibration data. Comparing or projecting the solution onto test data permits development of a misclassification rate, provides evidence for any redundancy in the assignments.
