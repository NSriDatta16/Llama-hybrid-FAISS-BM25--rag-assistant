The Running tests task failed....if any non-essential task fails, this results in a Partially Succeeded status. Can you post the MSBuild file being used, specifically the Running tests section? That being said, you should always pay attention to the warnings and resolve them whenever possible... they are warnings for a reason . They often alert you to unintended behavior in your code (e.g. a property that doesn't override properly).
