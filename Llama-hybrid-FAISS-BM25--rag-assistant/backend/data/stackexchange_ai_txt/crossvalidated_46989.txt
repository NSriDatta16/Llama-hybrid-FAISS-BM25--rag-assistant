How do I do basic hypothesis testing in a Bayesian framework?

This seems like it should be a widely-answered, but I've spent a lot of time searching and reading textbooks and have not been able to figure it out. Let's say I give my exciting new treatment pill to a random sample of N people and a placebo pill to a random sample of M people. A of the N people die and B of the M people die. I'd like to know the probability that more people die taking the placebo than the treatment. Currently I do: > data chisq.test(data, correct=FALSE) and look at the p-value (which I realize isn't actually the answer to my question, but that's frequentists for you). And if I want to know the interval there's a 95% chance the actual value is in, I just do: > pbar = A/N; se = sqrt(pbar * (1-pbar)/N); e = qnorm(.975)*se; pbar + c(-e, e) But I want the Bayesian equivalents. Now I know I can compute a Beta distribution with a uniform prior and then use Monte Carlo sampling to figure out the answers, but that seems hackish and inefficient. What's the more direct way to compute the answer?
