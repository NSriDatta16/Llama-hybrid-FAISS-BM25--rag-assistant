The SwapCache method provides a mechanism for the application to be in control of how an when updates are applied. In regular HTML apps, it can be difficult to determine if the correct JS is present on the clients browser. Also browser implementations vary on when a cache would be updated, I found the iPhone particularly stubborn. swapCache put me back in control of how my app is updated i.e. I could choose to automatically apply the patch or let the user choose when to apply etc.
