Is there still a bug in IE8 with jQuery droppables?

I have a page which has a tabbed view which contains 3 sortable columns below it. Currently, the tabs don't have any jQuery code associated. I gave them all the droppable class, however, and now in IE if a piece of content is dragged between columns and then moved again, jQuery blows up while trying (i think) to access the parentNode in the DOM. I found this article which discusses a similar problem, but is a year old and refers to IE7. Does any one know if there are similar issues in IE8? UPDATE: The bug is somehow related to UpdatePanels...each of the columns is a seperate updatepanel, and if I remove the updatepanels the page works normally.
