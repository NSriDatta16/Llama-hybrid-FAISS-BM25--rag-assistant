Choice of prior to restrict coefficient to negative values?

I'm slightly embarassed to be asking this question, but I couldn't locate a satisfying reference. I'm a complete novice in Bayesian regression, working through the textbook Statistical Rethinking . In an example where weight is regressed on height, the author explains that it is sensible to restrict the coefficient on height to positive values. This is accomplished via the Log-normal distribution: $$ \beta \sim \text{Log-normal}(0, 1)\ , $$ for instance. My question is straightforward: is there a similarly natural choice if one wanted to restrict a coefficient to only take negative values? Does something naive like multiplying the log-normal distribution by $-1$ work?
