The previous answer correctly explains what you see, but I would like to add that one of the properties of PCA is that it makes all variables uncorrelated. So after doing PCA each component is guaranteed to be uncorrelated with any other component, and you should not be surprised. If you are a bit familiar with mathematics behind PCA, you know that it is equivalent to diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the data. If the covariance matrix is diagonal, then covariance (and also correlation) between any two different components is zero.
