How to add up int pointer values in a linked list in C++?

I've been working at this homework assignment for awhile and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. How my program is suppose to work: User enters as many positive numbers as they so desire, Numbers are in a linked list, Numbers entered should be added up, Divide by the amount of numbers entered, Resulting in the average, However, it's not working out as I had intended and I've been playing with this for over 3 hours now. I'd contact my teacher but she hasn't responded to my last message still and I need assistance right away. Thanks in advance. Note: I need to traverse the list to add up all the entered numbers and count the number of nodes. #include using namespace std; int num, total, num_entries = 1; struct number_node { int number; number_node *next; }; number_node *head_ptr; number_node *current_ptr; int get_number_data(int &number); void add_node(int &number); void move_current_to_end(); void display_avg(); void delete_list(); int main() { if(get_number_data(num)) { head_ptr = new number_node; head_ptr->number = num; head_ptr->next = NULL; while(get_number_data(num)) { add_node(num); } display_avg(); delete_list(); } system("pause"); return 0; } int get_number_data(int &number) { int keep_data = 1; cout > num; if(num number = num; new_rec_ptr->next = NULL; move_current_to_end(); current_ptr->next = new_rec_ptr; } void move_current_to_end() { current_ptr = head_ptr; num_entries++; while(current_ptr->next != NULL) { current_ptr = current_ptr->next; total = current_ptr->number + total; } } void display_avg() { current_ptr = head_ptr; cout next; delete current_ptr; current_ptr = temp_ptr; } while(temp_ptr != NULL); }
