You will save yourself a lot of bother by using the Magento structure. require PATH_TO_MAGENTO_FOLDER . '/app/Mage.php'; Mage::app(); $newCustomer = Mage::getModel('customer/customer'); $newCustomer->setFirstname('Foo') ->setLastname('Bar') ... // Set all the various details here ->save(); Trying to handle the assorted entity tables is a recipe for disaster as they might be altered significantly by upgrading/adding new extensions to Magento which would then break your script.
