What is the so-called held out training set?

I heard about the "hold out evaluation set" from C3W1L05 and the "held-out test set" from the deep learning book on page 119 of chapter 5 . I thought "held out" or "hold out" implies not being trained, but in this paper I see "held-out training data". What does that mean? Do the three just a standard saying of "evaluation set", "test set" and "training set"? Maybe it is the so-called training-dev set?
