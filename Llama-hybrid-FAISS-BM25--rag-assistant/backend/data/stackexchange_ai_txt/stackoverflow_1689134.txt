How can you support something that doesn't exist? Something you can't validate against because there's no accepted spec? Yes they could build in support for the experimental DTD, but they did that with XML/XSLT/XPath and ended up fragmenting XML support for far too long and were attacked for it from all sides. Giving that people like Google are now pushing for tags they want just to make supporting Wave easier it's going to be a long time before HTML5 is done, and the "standard" is going to fluctuate and change - so why waste time and resources trying to hit a moving target?
