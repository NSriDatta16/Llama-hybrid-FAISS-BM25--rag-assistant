Qt QWebView class custom User-Agent

Is there an easy way to setup the User-Agent the QWebView class is using? The only relevant link I found searching was this http://www.qtforum.org/article/27073/how-to-set-user-agent-in-qwebview.html I'm learning C++/Qt right now and I don't really understant what's explained on that website. Maybe someone knows an easy way to do it? Or can help me understand that code?
