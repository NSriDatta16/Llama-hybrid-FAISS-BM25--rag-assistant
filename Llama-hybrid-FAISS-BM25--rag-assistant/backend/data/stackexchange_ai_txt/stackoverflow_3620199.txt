mail($email, $subject, $message, '-f info@mycompany.com\r\nfrom: noreply@mycompany.com\r\nreply-to: info@mycompany.com'); Surely that should read: mail($email, $subject, $message, 'From: noreply@mycompany.com\r\nReply-To: info@mycompany.com', '-f info@mycompany.com'); If not, it's little wonder your spam filters don't like it. Reverse engineering/bypassing spam filters is not supposed to be easy - but you might start by having a long hard look at how spamassassin decides what's spam and what isn't. Certainly its unusual to have a spam filter which does not implement Bayesian filtering - go check the manual on how to train it properly.
