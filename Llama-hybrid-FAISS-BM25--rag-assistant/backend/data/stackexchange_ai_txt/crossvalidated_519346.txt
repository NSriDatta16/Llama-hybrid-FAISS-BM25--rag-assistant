Are you familiar with censorship in survival analysis modeling? Censorship means that a patient was removed from the study without explicitly dying (at least in the context of survival analysis.) There are appropriate architectures to handle censorship; however, it's more a question of model architecture than the underlying MCMC sampling algorithm. For exploration of survival analysis via PyMC3 (uses HMC), see here . In your write-up, it's not clear whether you have a survival analysis problem or something different. Nonetheless, I'd recommend approaching your problem from a model architecture perspective not an MCMC-variant-specific perspective. If you could provide some more details, we (the community) could provide some recommendations on how to handle observed and latent values (censoring.) You didn't explicitly say that you're approaching this from a Bayesian perspective, however, MCMC is very common in the Bayesian paradigm, so I'll assume you prefer to be as Bayesian as possible. With that said, imputing values is not very Bayesian at all, as you'd be adding biases to your dataset without properly defining them via prior distributions. Censorship is the way to go so you have a "fork" so to speak that distinguishes the observed from the latent, and this will be captured nicely by your posterior distribution.
