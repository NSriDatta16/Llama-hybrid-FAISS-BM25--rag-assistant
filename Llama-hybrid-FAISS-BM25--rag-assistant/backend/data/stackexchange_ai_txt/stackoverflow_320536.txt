You can even allocate variable numbers of objects on the stack. You have to mix C and C++ to do so though. // allocate storage for N objects on the stack // you may have to call _alloca and include something to use this. object * data = (object *) alloca (N * sizeof (object)); // initialize via placement new. for (int i=0; i Code is untested, but in principle it works that way.
