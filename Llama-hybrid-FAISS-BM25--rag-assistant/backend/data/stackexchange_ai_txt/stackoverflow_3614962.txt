Is ID a GUID by any chance? SQL Server has an issue with the hash generation on GUID columns which makes them perform badly in indexes. Take your exact query and grab the "estimated execution plan" from Sql Server Management Studio. If you query is triggering a table scan (which it shouldn't be) then this would explain the timing. Perhaps the plan might show you what else is happening. I assume that you have already rebuilt the index (based on your 0.8% fragmentation comment).
