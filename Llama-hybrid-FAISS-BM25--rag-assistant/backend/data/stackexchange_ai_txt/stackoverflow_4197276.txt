Translation and caching in PHP powered websites

I have a very simple question to ask! I wish to make a website that supports multi languages; - i intend to use smarty templates for caching purposes. - i intent to use tables or csv files for multiple language strings storage. - i would like to use google translate api to translate LIVE a string which could not be found in the language pack (incase). - i know using google would make the page loading slow. my question here is; keeping in mind the aforementioned scenario; would the smarty caching make it helpful to use google or table fetching translations to load pages faster?? furthermore, can u guide me a little bit how caching is done in smarty ?? thanks! any help is greatly appreciated.
