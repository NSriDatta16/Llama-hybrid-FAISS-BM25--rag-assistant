Foreign Key Problem in SQL

I just wanna ask coz I created a table with a column with two primary keys as shown below: CREATE TABLE Parent( Mother varchar(50) NOT NULL, Father varchar(50) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(Mother, Father), Organization varchar(50) NOT NULL ); Then I am trying to create another table which will have a foreign key to the table shown above: CREATE TABLE Child( Name varchar(50) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, Child_Mother varchar(50) REFERENCES Parent(Mother), Child_Father varchar(50) REFERENCES Parent(Father), Sibling varchar(50) NOT NULL ); So I basically am trying to references two columns on the Child Table to a single column from the Parent table with two primary keys. Is this even possible? Thank you very much! :) *Sample Tables only. But the actual are similar to this.
