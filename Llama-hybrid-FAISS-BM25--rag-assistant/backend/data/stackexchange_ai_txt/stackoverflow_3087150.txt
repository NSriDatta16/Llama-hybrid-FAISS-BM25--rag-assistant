SQL authentication and Windows authentication are distinct. The two are not interchangeable by specifying similar usernames. SQL auth enables the storage of password information within the database and are portable, while Windows auth tells SQL to rely on Windows for authenticating users. Therefore, you don't specify passwords along with Windows auth users in the database. If you need to use SQL authentication, just specify any username and password and include that information in your connection string. There's no reason why the name must match existing Windows users.
