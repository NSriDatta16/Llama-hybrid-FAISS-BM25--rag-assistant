Mismatch Between the Parameters of a Logistic Regression in R and My Computed Parameters

By converting and by trying to interpret the parameters of a logistic regression ran in R, I just find them to be overestimated. Therefore I tried to compute them myself but I can not obtain the same values reported by the regression. I used this web-page for computations: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/odds_ratio.htm Let say we only focus on the LagC parameter: Logistic Regression > model summary(model) Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.81039 0.22040 -3.677 0.000236 *** DistractorC1 0.33129 0.06393 5.182 2.2e-07 *** DistractorC2 0.03436 0.10011 0.343 0.731467 LagC 2.09567 0.12725 16.469 Odds of the parameters: > show(Odds Probabilities of the parameters: > show(P My Estimations > Means % group_by(Subject, Lag) %>% filter(RepT1 == 1) %>% summarise(repok = sum(RepT2) / (n())) %>% group_by(Lag) %>% summarise(Means = mean(repok)) > show(Means) Lag Means (fctr) (dbl) 1 Lag3 0.1972174 2 Lag8 0.5475624 Odds of the parameter: > OddsLag3 OddsLag8 OddsLagC show(OddsLagC) [1] 4.926377 Probabilities of the parameter: > show(OddsLag / (1 + OddsLag)) [1] 0.8312628 We can see that it is close, but not accurate. Does anyone have an explanation? Note that I compute a mean for each subject and then only a mean for each condition. I also did estimate the parameters without taking into account the subjects, but still, the mismatch was here. Graphical representation
