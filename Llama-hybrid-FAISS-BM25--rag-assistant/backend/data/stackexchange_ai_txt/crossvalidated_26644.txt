If the cells are not interrelated then the fact that they are in matrices rather than just equal length columns of numbers doesn't matter, right? Given they are counts, a suitable way of comparing them is probably the sum of squared differences, weighted by the inverse of the average of the two observations for each comparison cell. $\sum\frac{(a_{i,j}-b_{i,j})^2}{(a_{i,j}+b_{i,j})/2}$ But what does this tell you about "how close", except that smaller means closer? Turning this statistic into something you can compare to any other number would depend on why you are doing this eg are there a range of candidate Bs trying to look like A.
