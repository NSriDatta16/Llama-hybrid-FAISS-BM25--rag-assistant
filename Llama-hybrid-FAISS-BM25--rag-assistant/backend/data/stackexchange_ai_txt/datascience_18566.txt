What algorithm would I use to create a grade based on 3 numeric attributes?

I'm currently using Weka to prototype some possible applications for machine learning. One such application is a grade based on the performance of a user's mailing list. I have the following attributes: Attribute | Type ----------------------------- List Name | Nominal Total Sent | Numeric Total Opened | Numeric Total Clicked | Numeric My goal is to break up the data set into 9 categories, one for each grade (A+ to C-), but I'm not sure which algorithm I would use, or the proper parameter to begin prototyping. Here's what some of the data looks like: List | Sent | Opened | Clicked -------------------------------------- list 1 | 51587 | 17251 | 1787 list 2 | 22128 | 8538 | 815 list 3 | 211007 | 24803 | 1719 list 4 | 12910 | 1530 | 183 list 5 | 148054 | 41171 | 0 list 6 | 182392 | 17579 | 1749 list 7 | 68212 | 4765 | 447
