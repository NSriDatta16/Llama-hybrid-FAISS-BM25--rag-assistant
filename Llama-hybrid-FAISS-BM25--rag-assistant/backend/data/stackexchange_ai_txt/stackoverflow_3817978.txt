Is there a way to pull valid script from html content and execute it using jQuery?

Say I have a something like this: $("p").css("color", "red"); Is there a way to select the script contained within the tag and execute it using jQuery? In this case, the script $("p").css("color", "red"); would be executed and then cause itself to be rendered with a red font color within the paragraph tag. I can select the text perfectly fine, but haven't found a way to actually execute it. I don't want other solutions - I am aware of them, I am just trying to figure out if this specific case is possible, and if so, how. Thanks.
