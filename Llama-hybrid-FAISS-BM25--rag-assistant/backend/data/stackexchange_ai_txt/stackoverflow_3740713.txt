Strictly speaking, there is no way. Although there are non-direct techiques, but I would never discuss it in public, especially on a site like Stackoverflow, which encourage screen scraping, content swiping autoposting and all this dirty roboting stuff. In some cases you can use CAPTCHA test to tell a human from a bot.
