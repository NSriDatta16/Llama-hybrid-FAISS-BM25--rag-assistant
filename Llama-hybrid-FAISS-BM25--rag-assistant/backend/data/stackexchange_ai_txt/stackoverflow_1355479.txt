Icon on Silverlight web page

I was wondering how to add our own custom icon to the web page for our Silverlight application? I know how to set the text (using the Title property for the Page), but the icon eludes me. For example, see the below image. The most left tab has the G for Google, and the most right one has the CNN icon. How can I get my own there? alt text http://www.umail.ucsb.edu/~mguidry/firefox/tab.jpg Thanks for your help :)
