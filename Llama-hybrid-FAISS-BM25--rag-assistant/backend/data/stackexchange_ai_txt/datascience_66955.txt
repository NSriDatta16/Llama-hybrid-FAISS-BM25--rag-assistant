How do we define a linearly separable problem?

When we talk about Perceptrons, we say that they are limited for approximating functions that are linearly separable, while Neural Networks that use non-linear transformations are not. I am having trouble understanding this idea of linear separability. Specifically, does it apply only for binary classification or it generalizes for N classes? If so, how does a linear decision boundary for lets say 4 classes even look like?
