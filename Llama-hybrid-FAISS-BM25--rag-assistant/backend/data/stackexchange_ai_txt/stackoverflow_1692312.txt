Yes, the problem should be an space after the php end tag somewhere. As the php end tag is not mandatory, remove any end tag in all your models (if there're any), the controller you're asking about, from app_controller.php and app_model.php and from your view helpers... It should be somewhere but it is not easy to find EDIT : In fact it could be also an space before the php begin tag, look into those files and check that the begin tag is at the absolute beginning of the file EDIT AGAIN : There are people that have created some scripts for doing that automatically for you, take a look to: http://ragrawal.wordpress.com/2007/11/07/script-for-removing-blank-spaces-before-and-after-php-tags/
