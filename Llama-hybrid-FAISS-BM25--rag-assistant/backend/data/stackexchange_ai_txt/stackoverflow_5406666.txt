jQuery UI sortable - Change CSS class while dragging over specific element

I'm searching for a possibility to change the CSS class of an element in a sortable jQuery list while dragging over a specific element. For example if I drag an element of a sortable list over a specific layer, the dragging layer should change the background color but still stay in the dragging mode. Does anybody know if and how that could be done?
