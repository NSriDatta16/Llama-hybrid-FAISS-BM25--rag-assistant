Multiple confusion matrix for multiple training instances. Which one to take?

I am using Matlab Neural Network toolbox for a classification problem. Now considering a single set of data, if the inbuilt neural network is trained and classified with same data multiple number of time, different accuracy and different confusion matrix is obtained. Now which result should I take? Should I take all the vales obtained in all the training instances and average them fix on one particular result?
