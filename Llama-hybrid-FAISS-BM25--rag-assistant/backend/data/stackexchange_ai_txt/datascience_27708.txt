How to describe the process of using existing weights for training a deep learning model?

I have weights which I use for initializing the training of a convolution neural net model as follows (in Keras): model = load_model("my_weights.hdf5") Now I want to rerun the entire model with further data augmentation and training using these loaded weights. I would like to know if this is a feasible approach to apply. And also, would this be considered as fine-tuning? or transfer learning?
