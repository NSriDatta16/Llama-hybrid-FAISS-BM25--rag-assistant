Are the two models parametric? If yes, you can weigh them with respective likelihood scores. This is equivalent to Bayesian aggregation (weighing with Bayesian scores) when the prior distribution over candidate models is uniform. Bayesian aggregation is a popular, scientific way of combining models when there is belief that each of them carries some useful information (when one model does not stochastically dominate another). For example, my suggestion works if you have performed classification using logit or probit models. On the other hand, if you are using tree-based methods an extension of the aforementioned ideas is necessary.
