How to predict table sizes Oracle?

I'm trying to do a growth prediction on some tables I have and for that I've got to do some calculations on my row sizes, how many rows I generate by day and well.. the maths. I'm calculating the average size of each row in my table as the sum of the average size of each field. So basicaly: SELECT 'COL1' , avg(vsize(COL1)) FROM TABLE union SELECT 'COL2' , avg(vsize(COL2)) FROM TABLE Sum that up, multiply by the number of entries of a day and work the predictions from there. Turns out that for one of the tables I've looked the resulting size is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and got me wondering if my method was right. Also, I did not consider indexes sizes for my predictions - and of course I should. My questions are: Is this method I'm using reliable? Tips on how could I work the predictions for the Indexes? I've done my googling, but the methods I find are all about the segments and extends or else calculations based in the whole table. I will need the step with the actual row of my table to do the predictions (I have to analyse the data in the table in order to figure how many records a day). And finally, this is an approximation. I know I'm missing some bytes here and there with overheads and stuff. I just want to make sure I'm only missing bytes and not gigas :)
