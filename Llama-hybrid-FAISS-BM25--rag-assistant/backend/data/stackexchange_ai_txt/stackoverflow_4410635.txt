There's an old* saying that technical solutions to social problems rarely work . What you have here is a social problem - Person B is performing an action which is probably not what they intend. The solution should be a social one - encourage all your People to take responsibility for their checkins and above all to think while they're interacting with the shared source control system. All the policies in the world can't substitute for thinking. Sure, you might say, but it would be nice to have a 'safety catch', or a warning mechanism, or whatever. To which I say - there already is one, and it's being explicitly acknowledged! Also, what should happen when Person B's changes include and subsume Person A's, so they really do want to throw away the delta contributed by Person A? (*) I found this reference from 2002, which is practically in Renaissance times for software development - I'm sure there are older
