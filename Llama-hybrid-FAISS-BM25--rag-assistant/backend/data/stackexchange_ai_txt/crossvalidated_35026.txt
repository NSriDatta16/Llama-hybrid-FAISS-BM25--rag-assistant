Two options: Use an $L_0$ penalty on $\vec x$. The obvious drawback is that this is nonconvex and hence difficult to optimize. Reparameterize, $x_i = \frac{\exp(w_i)}{\sum_j \exp(w_j)}$ and use a penalty on the new (natural) parameter vector, $\|\vec w\|$. This will encourage events to be equally probable unless there is a good reason for them not to be.
