What would be the most appropriate method for constructing a bootstrap percentile confidence region?

The situation: let suppose we have a random variable that follows some parametric distribution $X\sim F_{\boldsymbol\theta}$, $\boldsymbol\theta\in\mathbb{R}^2$. We are provided with the bootstrap distribution (parametric, non-parametric, ...) of the estimates $$ \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{1},\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{2}, \dots, \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{B} \sim \hat{f}(\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}), $$ where $B$ represents the number of replicates. We want to measure the uncertainty around $\boldsymbol\theta$ from $\hat{f}(\hat{\boldsymbol\theta})$. Assume that if $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are independent , we can build two confidence intervals from the marginal percentiles of $\hat{f}(\hat{\boldsymbol\theta})$ that leads to the exact overall coverage of $1-\alpha$ (for example by applying Dunn-Sidak correction https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0id%C3%A1k_correction ). The problem: if $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are '' dependent enough '', the coverage will not be exact and this dependence should be taken into account somehow. My question: Since we have at our disposal the distribution $\hat{f}(\hat{\boldsymbol\theta})$, it is tempting to use it. How can I construct an equivalent of the percentile method in 2-dimensions, that is, a 2-dimensional percentile confidence region? Example: We observe a sample of size $n=35$ from a Lomax random variable ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomax_distribution ). This distribution has two parameters. From my experience, both parameters are highly correlated (see the graph below). The red points are the estimates $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{1},\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{2}, \dots$ (on the log-scale!) The black point is the true value $\boldsymbol\theta = (2, 2.3)^T$, on the log-scale. The black lines are the percentile marginal 95% confidence intervals (no correction, otherwise too wide for the graph). The green area is the 95% Highest Density Region (see What is a Highest Density Region (HDR)? ). The gray-shaded area was built using the post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31893559/r-adding-alpha-bags-to-a-2d-or-3d-scatterplot It seems to be ''closer'' to what ''should be'' the confidence region. Are there other methods? Which one seems more appropriate?
