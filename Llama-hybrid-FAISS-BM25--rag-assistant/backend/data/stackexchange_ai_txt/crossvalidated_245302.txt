Polls tend to have an error margin of 5% that you can't really get rid of, because it's not a random error, but a bias. Even if you average across many polls, it does not get much better. This has to do with misrepresented voter groups, lack of mobilization, inability to go to the vote on a workday, unwillingness to answer, unwillingness to answer right , spontaneous last-minute decisions, ... because this bias tends to be "correlated" across polls, you can't get rid of it with more polls; you also can't get rid of it with larger sample sizes; and you don't appear to be able to predict this bias either, because it changes too fast (and we elect presidents too rarely). Due to the stupid winner-takes-all principle still present in almost all states, an error of 5% can cause very different results: Assume the polls always predicted 49-51, but the real result was 51-49 (so an error of just 2%), the outcome is 100% off; because of winner-takes-it-all. If you look at individual states, most results are within the predicted error margins! Probably the best you can do is sample this bias (+-5%), apply the winner-takes-all extremes, then aggregate the outcomes. This is probably similar to what 538 did; and in 30% of the samples Donald Trump won...
