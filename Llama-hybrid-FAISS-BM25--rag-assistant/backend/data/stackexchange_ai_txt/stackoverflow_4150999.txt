A couple things. First, start reading about how to support multiple screens. Pay close attention to learning about dips and how they work. Next, watch this video (at least the first 15-20 minutes of it). This subject isn't a cakewalk to grasp. I found it best to start playing around inside my code. I would suggest creating a surfaceview and start messing around with some bitmaps, different emulators (screen sizes and densities), and the different types of drawable folders. Unfortunately, there is more to this topic than I think Google wants to admit, and while it's definitely do-able is isn't simple to get started on it for some types of applications. Finally, you should consider boiling down your question to be more straight forward if you aren't looking for an abstract answer (like this one). Good luck!
