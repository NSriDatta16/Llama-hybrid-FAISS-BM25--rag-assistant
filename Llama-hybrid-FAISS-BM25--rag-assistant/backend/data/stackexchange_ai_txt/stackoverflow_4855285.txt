Wpf Treeview bind base on Project Folder Structure

I currently have a catalog of files I want to read into my program in my Project. Structure. Project - Properties - References - Manufacturers (want to project this as treeview) - Honda - file1 - file2 - Toyota - file1 - file2 In my program each file above is represented by its own business object. I want to be able to in my program have this in my treeview. - Honda - file1 - file2 - Toyota - file1 - file2 I only load these file once so I want to just read these file once and bind them to the tree view. Is there an elegant way to do this??? Thanks, Kev
