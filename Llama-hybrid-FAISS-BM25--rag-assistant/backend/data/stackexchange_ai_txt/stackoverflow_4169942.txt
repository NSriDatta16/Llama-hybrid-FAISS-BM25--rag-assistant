How to auto-complete/suggest places (with address) on my website like on Google maps?

I am working a Yelp-like project that associates reviews to places. Yet, we don't have any database of places and we'd like to leverage a third-party api. We'd like to start with a auto-complete search box like on Google Maps. For example, the user enters "tamar" and it suggests "Tamarine Restaurant, Palo Alto, CA, United States". 1) is it possible? what third party api would you use? Is Google maps the best? Once the results are returned, the user selects one place and will leave a review. 2) how would you associate that review to that specific place in the DB? My concern is if later on we change api provider, that we can still associate our reviews to the new api places. Thank you SO MUCH! Any suggestion would help. Fab
