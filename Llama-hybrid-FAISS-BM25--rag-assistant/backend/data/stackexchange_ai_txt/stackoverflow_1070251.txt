Can you post your current view that pulls all of this data together? It sounds like changing your tables to actually declare the primary keys as clustered and using some well written JOIN statements would help your queries run much faster without too much work. Also, whenever running selects in SQL Server, unless you have a specific need for locking a table your looking at, be sure to run the Select with NOLOCK as this can give quite the speed boost if you're loading data and selecting from the same set of tables at the same time. Ex: SELECT X, Y, Z FROM Table AS t WITH(NOLOCK) After looking at your query, it looks like you're probably slowing down because you're calling the ListLookupToString function all over the place, which has to be called for each row. The better, faster way to do this is with normalized tables and JOINing across the tables. I've taken one of the lookups and shown how to convert it below. Current Lookup: dbo.listLookupToString(gar,'a,Attached,b,Detached,c,1 Car Garage,d,1.5 Car Garage,e,2 Car Garage,f,2.5 Car Garage,g,3 Car Garage,h,3+ Car Garage,m,Garage Door Opener(s) (Auto),n,Transmitter(s),o,Carport,p,Heated,q,Leased,r,Owned,s,Underground,u,None,v,Deeded Sold Separately,w,On-Site,x,Off-Site,z,Tandem') as GAR Create the Lookup Table CREATE TABLE GarageLookup (GarageID VARCHAR(4), GarageTypeName VARCHAR(64)) INSERT INTO GarageLookup (GarageID, GarageTypeName) VALUES('a', 'Attached') INSERT INTO GarageLookup (GarageID, GarageTypeName) VALUES('b', 'Detached') /* Insert all rows into GarageLookup that are in the Lookup function currently */ Use the lookup table in the SELECT instead of the lookup function SELECT /*Everything ommitted to be brief*/ gl.GarageTypeName FROM rets_de AS r WITH(NOLOCK) JOIN GarageLookup AS gl WITH(NOLOCK) ON r.gar = gl.GarageID
