MEL VS linear spectrograms for bioacoustics machine learning

I don't have background in bioacoustics but working on a data-science project in bioacoustics. I am working with animal vocalizations recorded at sampling rate of 250000. Animals are bats, which are known to produce sounds in high frequency. In background literature, I found the use of MEL spectrograms also for bats, and learnt that MEL spectrograms compress the range into log-scale. But if so, I would expect infomation is lost for highest frequencies, and if so, I would expect worse results in using MEL. Now, for the sake of benchmarking, I would like to reduce the number of variables of my study, and if other works used MEL, well there shoudl be a reason. First goal : I am trying to identify vocal units, i.e. discretize vocalizations that seems (at human perception) kind of continuous screeches. Can you help understand pros and cons of MEL VS linear spectrograms , when dealing with animal vocalizations? Can you mention some good practices to keep in mind, considering the above goal ?
