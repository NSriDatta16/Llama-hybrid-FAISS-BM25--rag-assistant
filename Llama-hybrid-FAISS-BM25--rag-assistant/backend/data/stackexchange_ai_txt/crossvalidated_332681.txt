derivation of probability that an entire species will die out given an initial number k for first generation

I hope someone would be able to shed some light as to why equation 1.33 is the way it is from first principles. It looks a lot like the case where the initial state is randomised but the final state to which the Markov chain is, is fixed. From the expression, there are two probability terms which isn't clear to me why this is so. Any help is appreciated.
