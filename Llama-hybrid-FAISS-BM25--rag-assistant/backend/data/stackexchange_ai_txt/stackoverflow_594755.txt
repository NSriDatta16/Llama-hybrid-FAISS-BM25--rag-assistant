Casting is a wee bit faster than parsing but slower than searching. Also, in Firefox the fastest method turns out to be parseInt() followed by searching. Firefox also turned out to be 6 times faster on average than IE. Interesting. Cool idea using the unary operator. In Firefox that turned out to be comparable to parseInt(). In IE it turned out to be the fastest method.
