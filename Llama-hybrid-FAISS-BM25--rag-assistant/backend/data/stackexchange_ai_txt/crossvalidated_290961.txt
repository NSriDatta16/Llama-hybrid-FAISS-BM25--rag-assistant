Logistic regression results interpretation from R - Odds ratio/likelihood of species presence

I'm running logistic regression for ecological samples using R Deducer.. Specifically, I'm studying the habitat preference of a specific bird species.. There are eight predictor variables believed to affect the presence of this bird species and I'm looking for the most significant habitat (predictor) variable that affects the presence of the species.. Of the eight predictor variables, only one came out as significant, the variable X.21m (trees with height equal or greater than 21m) .. I understand that the relationship of the variable X.21m is positive with the presence of the species but by how much (odds ratio)? Attached is the photo of the results output from R.. I'm not familiar with interpreting the coefficient results, and I would like to ask help in this matter and for suggestions to make it better.. P.S. I'm trying to learn statistics that's relevant in my line of work as I find it really interesting and adds more dimension in what I do.. Thank you in advance for your time..
