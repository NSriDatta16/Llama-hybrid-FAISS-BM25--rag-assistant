Assuming this is about Common Lisp, there is a function last which returns a list containing the last item of a list. If you use this function with mapcan , which applies a given function to each element of a list and returns the concatenated results, you'll get what you want. Note though that accessing the last element of a list is an O(N) operation, so if this isn't just homework after all, you might want to consider if you can't solve the real problem more efficiently than taking the last item of each list (maybe use another datastructure instead).
