magento example module

I'm reading through chapter 4 of the magento developers guide which explains how to build a shipping module I've built the config.xml put it in the proper place, put the MagentoBook_ShippingModule.xml file where it needs to go then it tells me I can configure it in the admin panel but it doesn't show up do I need to reboot the server or something for it to take effect ?
