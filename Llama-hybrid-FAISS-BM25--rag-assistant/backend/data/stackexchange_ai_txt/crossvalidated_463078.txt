Non-linear regression to fit a circle shaped data

My data looks like this: I have tried a neural network model to fit a curve to the data, but my error is too high. I can see that the x-y mappings are not one-to-one, as multiple x values correspond to the same y-values. However, I want to fit a curve to the data to make predictions. How can I do that? Is the data not sufficient?
