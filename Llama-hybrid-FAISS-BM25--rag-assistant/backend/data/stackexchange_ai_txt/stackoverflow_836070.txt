I've not tried this, but I know that WinPCap allows you to do a raw send . Since it works at a pretty low level, it might allow you to send low enough on the stack to bypass the full broadcast. There are various C# wrappers out there, and of course you can use the normal C/C++ code available out there. I think the trick might be to bind to the right adapter you want to send out of and it might just work.
