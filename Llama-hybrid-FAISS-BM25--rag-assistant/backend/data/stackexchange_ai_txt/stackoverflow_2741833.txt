OK, let me just start off by saying that the whole premise of security by not being able to connect to the internet is completely misplaced. I shouldn't be judging without knowing all the facts, but considering the fact that you are asking this kind of basic question on StackOverflow means you are not a multi-national corporation developing a next generation of rail-guns and is under constant hacker attack. Depriving developers of internet connection improves security by about 0.01% and slows them down as they can't research relevant stuff by about 1000%. You need to start off by advocating a better environment to whoever is in charge and have a hosted repository on a server somewhere. You can pay for a private github repository or roll out your own git repo on linux using gitorious or gitosis. As for the actual problem. Instead of pushing from your bare repository, all you do is pull into it. You are on the right track with the last paragraph. Set up a bare repo at each site. Set up a bare repo on the USB stick. Developers push their changes to the site repo. Set up remotes on the stick to each of the sites. Pull to the USB stick from each of the site repos. This is a good solution in theory but you would find that you will at some point get conflicts when syncing repos. In that case the developer needs to resolve those conflicts. A better solution would be to not have the site repository. Because the whole repository is contained in a directory, you can make as many copies of it locally as you want. This will also address your "playing around" concern. If the developers need to share code, they can just pull from each other. Then the USB stick comes in and they pull/push their changes. This way the people who create conflicts are the ones responsible for merging. Let me again reiterate how much of a productivity burden this will be. It's hard enough to have a single shared repository with multiple people involved. With the time delay of manually synchronising the sites chances are if there is a bug, it won't be fixed today, but the day after.
