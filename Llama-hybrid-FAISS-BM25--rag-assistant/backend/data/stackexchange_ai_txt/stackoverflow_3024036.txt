You could use a rolling average . This is how a lot of stock trackers work. By tracking the last n data points, you could see if this change was a substantial change outside of their usual variance. You could also try some normalization -- one very simple one would be that each category has a total number of mentions ( m ), a percent change from the last time period ( δ ), and then some normalized value ( z ) where z = m * δ . Lets look at the table below ( m0 is the previous value of m) : Name m m0 &#948; z Steve Jobs 4950 4500 .10 495 Steve Ballmer 400 300 .33 132 Larry Ellison 50 10 4.0 400 Andy Nobody 50 40 .20 10 Here, a 400% change for unknown Larry Ellison results in a z value of 400, a 10% change for the much better known Steve Jobs is 495, and my spike of 20% is still a low 10. You could tweak this algorithm depending on what you feel are good weights, or use standard deviation or the rolling average to find if this is far away from their "expected" results.
