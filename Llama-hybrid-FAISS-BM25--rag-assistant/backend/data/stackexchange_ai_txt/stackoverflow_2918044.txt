How do I use Amazon's new RRS for S3?

Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) is a new service from Amazon that is a bit cheaper than S3 because there is less redundancy. However, I can not find any information on how to specify that my data should use RRS rather than standard S3. In fact, there doesn't seem to be any website interface for an S3 services. If I log into AWS, there are only options for EC2, Elastic MapReduce, CloudFront and RDS, none of which I use.
