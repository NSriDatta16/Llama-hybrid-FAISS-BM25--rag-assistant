If I have a 58% chance of winning a point, what's the chance of me winning a ping pong game to 21, win by 2?

I have a bet with a co-worker that out of 50 ping pong games (first to win 21 points, win by 2), I will win all 50. So far we've played 15 games and on average I win 58% of the points, plus I've won all the games so far. So we're wondering if I have a 58% chance of winning a point and he has a 42% chance of winning a point, what's the percent chance that I would win the game? Is there a formula that we can plug in difference % chances? We've googled all over and even asked the data scientists at our company but couldn't find a straight answer. Edit: Wow, I am blown away by the thoroughness of responses. Thank you all so much!!! In case people are curious, I have an update to how my bet is going: I've now won 18 out of 50 games, so I need to win 32 more games. I've won 58.7% of all points and my opponent has therefore won 41.3% of points. The standard deviation for my opponent is 3.52, his average score is 14.83, and his median score is 15.50. Below is a screenshot of the score of each game so far. I can keep updating as the bet goes on, if people are interested. Edit #2 : Unfortunately we've only been able to play a few more games, below are the results. I'm just going to keep replacing the picture so I don't have a bunch of screenshots of the score. Final Update : I finally lost to my co-worker on game #28. He beat me 21-13. Thanks for all of your help!
