No, check this page: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.html You can use maybe VARCHAR or VARBINARY instead of the TEXT or BLOB field. For VARHCHAR and VARBINARY you can specify a length of 4096 if you want. Example: MYSTRING VARCHAR(4096); . But pay attention that, as the manual says: The effective maximum length of a VARCHAR in MySQL 5.0.3 and later is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is shared among all columns) and the character set used. So if you use a lot of large columns, you must be sure to stay under the 64k limit for a row
