Java : Getting the currently executing Method corresponding object

What is the most elegant way to get the currently executing method as a Method object ? My first obvious way to do it would be to use a static method in a helper class, which would load the current thread stack, get the right stack trace element, and construct the Method element from its information. Is there a more elegant way to achieve this?
