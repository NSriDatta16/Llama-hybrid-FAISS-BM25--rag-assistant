Listview/DetailsView: Hide a null field

I imagine this is quite a common problem, but as yet I haven't found an elegant solution. I have a number of instances where I have either a ListView or a DetailsView control that is bound to a SQL Server SProc. The problem I have is that there are numerous instances where, when a column is Null, I want to display something different in the UI. A typical example would be where I have a URL column that is rendered as a LinkButton (in the ListViews) or as a HyperLinkField (in the DetailsViews) - when a Null URL is returned, I'm rendering links with no src attribute. Ideally, I's want to display nothing in this field in such a scenario. In each of these cases, when a null value is returned, how can I skip/alter the rendering of that item? Thanks in advance. Update: I haven't had chance to actually try these out, but all helpful suggestions. I think I like Ricks answer the best, but thanks again to the others...
