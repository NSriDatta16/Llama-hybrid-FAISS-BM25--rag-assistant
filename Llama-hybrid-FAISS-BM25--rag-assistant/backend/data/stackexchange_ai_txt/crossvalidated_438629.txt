Model evaluation when training set has class labels but test set does not have class labels

Training set and test set are separated in 2 files. The training set has class label and Random forest, svm, and KNN can fit. However, the test set does not have class labels. How do you evaluate the model? for example, confusion matrix, accuracy, and ROC require actual class for test set.
