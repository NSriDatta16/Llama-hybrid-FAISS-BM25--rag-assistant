Optimal combination of biased samplers

Suppose we are interested in the mean $\mu$ of a random variable $X$ but the only way to sample it is from known biased distributions $p_{\lambda}(x)$ , such that $\left _{\lambda} =\mu_{\lambda} \neq \mu$ . However, the total average of all biased distributions is unbiased, i.e. $\left _{\lambda} \right> = \mu$ . Suppose also that each biased distribution comes with an equal initial cost $C_0$ (expensive) and an extra cost for each subsample $C_1$ (cheap). Given an allotment of a total cost $C$ , what is the optimal way to partition the resources between different distributions and within each of them to get the most precise estimate for this cost? A simple discrete example of this problem would be having access to $N$ unfair coins, half of which only give tails and half of which only give heads, meaning that they are fair on average. If we have access to \$100 and the initial toss costs \$10, while subsequent tosses cost \$0.1, clearly the best strategy is to buy 10 coins and toss each one of them once. On the other hand, if we know that all coins are fair, the best strategy would be to toss a single coin as many times as we can. How can we formalise this problem mathematically in less obvious cases and in the continuous case? Is this possible?
