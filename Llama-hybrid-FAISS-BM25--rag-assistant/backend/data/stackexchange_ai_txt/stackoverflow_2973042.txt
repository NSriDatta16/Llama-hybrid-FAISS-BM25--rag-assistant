Dlls built and strongly named in .NET v 4 cannot be installed in the GAC? - Anyone else experienced this?

This was driving me a bit nuts as testing strong singing and installation to GAC of assemblies was working on one of my PC's, but not the other. This was the case with snk key files and pfx. They could not be installed via either a drag and drop into the Assembly via explorer, or using the mscorcfg.msc tool. I then realised the test class libraries I was using were defaulting to framework version 3.5 on one PC, and v 4 on the other. So hey presto, change the target framework to 3.5, and the assemblies that were subsequently built can be installed in the GAC as normal. Can anyone verify this issue and possibly advise a work around for it? Thanks.
