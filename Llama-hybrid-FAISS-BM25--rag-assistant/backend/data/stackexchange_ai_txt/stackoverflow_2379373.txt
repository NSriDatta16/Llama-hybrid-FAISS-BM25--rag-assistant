Adding text content is treated as if you wanted text content, and not "inner XML". I think you would be best converting the string of XML into a Document Fragment, and then adding that fragment (essentially the sring needs to be converted into nodes, and then add the nodes). Use XElement.Parse to create the document fragment.
