I also had this question before. On a higher level, in (samples, time steps, features) samples are the number of data, or say how many rows are there in your data set time step is the number of times to feed in the model or LSTM features is the number of columns of each sample For me, I think a better example to understand it is that in NLP , suppose you have a sentence to process, then here sample is 1, which means 1 sentence to read, time step is the number of words in that sentence, you feed in the sentence word by word before the model read all the words and get a whole context of that sentence, features here is the dimension of each word, because in word embedding like word2vec or glove , each word is interpreted by a vector with multiple dimensions. The input_shape parameter in Keras is only (time_steps, num_features) , more you can refer to this . That's basically how I understand this, hope make it clear for you.
