First off, don't try to do everything with a keyboard, start by forcing yourself to use keyboards for the top 3 things that you do all the time. Get the biggest bang for your buck/effort and you will quickly want to use more. Keep a sheet of paper near by where you write down keyboard short cuts you use. (Alternatively, add this to a company wiki so others can benefit.) Pay attention to menu items, they frequently have keyboard short cuts. Find out the keyboard shortcuts that show all other keyboard short cuts. I use Eclipse all the time, there are several keyboard short cuts that I find invaluable: CTRL + SPACE - Content Assist CTRL + 3 - Open any UI Element in eclipse by typing CTRL + SHIFT + T - Open by type (Uses Capital letters to do word searches and * for wild card, for instance NuPoEx would find NullPointerException) ALT + SHIFT + R - Rename current selection ALT + SHIFT + T - Refactor Menu And CTRL + SHIFT + L gives you a list of all keyboard shortcuts
