Only fully specified full likelihood models will correctly take into account varying numbers of measurements, and this and all methods being discussed require a missing at random assumption. Your Y is ordinal so I suggest a longitudinal ordinal model, either using a Markov process or subject random effects. These are detailed here . It is usually best to analyze the rawest form of the data rather than taking averages first. There is some power gain from using all the individual measurements.
