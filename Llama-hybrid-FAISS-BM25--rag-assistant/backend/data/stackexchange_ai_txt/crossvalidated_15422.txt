Logistic regression for questionnaires on 7 points Likert scale

I want to analyze some data of a questionnaire on presence (I deal with experiments on virtual reality). The questionnaire was provided twice to particpants performing the experiment, after each of the two provided conditions. The 6 questions of the questionnaire were evaluated by participants on a 7-points Likert scale. Following what I found in bibliography, I have to analyze the data in the following way in order to find if the differences between the two conditions are significant: I have to count the number of answers that have a score of 6 or 7, then I will have for each condition a variable equal to the mean of the count of 6 and 7 scores among all the 6 questions. Afterwards, I have to treat those two variables as binomially distributed for a logistic regression on group. My problem is that I donÂ´t know how to perform the logistic regression. I tried to study but I do not understood how to apply it to my case. In addition I have also problems in undestanding how to perform it in R. Do you also have an example in R? Let's say that the two variables are (meand +-std): Count_condition1 = 1 +- 1.7 and Count_condition1 = 2 +- 2.0
