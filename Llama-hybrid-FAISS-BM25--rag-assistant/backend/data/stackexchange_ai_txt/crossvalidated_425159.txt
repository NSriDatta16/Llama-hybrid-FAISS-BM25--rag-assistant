Statistical analysis with very small sample size, 5 independent variables and 2 (possibly) dependent variables

I have a small sample size of 6 (they're conservation projects). They have been scored for 5 project design parameters (5 independent variables). And they have been scored for 2 desired project outcomes (2 [possibly] dependent variables). What I want to know is do either of these two dependent variables correlate with any of the 5 independent variables - are they dependent? If so how strong are the correlations and can we compare? With such a small sample size (6 projects) I really don't know what statistical analysis I'm supposed to run. I also don't know what statistical figures I should be paying attention to and comparing.
