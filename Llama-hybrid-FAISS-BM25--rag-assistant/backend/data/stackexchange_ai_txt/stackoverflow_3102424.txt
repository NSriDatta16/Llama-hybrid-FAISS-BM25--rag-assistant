Create a UserControl with the contents of the button you created. The easiest option to create the user control is to use Expression Blend. Select all of our controls to whom u want to make UserControl. Right Click and Select "make into Usercontrol". Thats it. U can use this control anywhere in your project just by drag and drop. Hope it will help u, Saghar Ayyaz
