The asymptotic confidence interval may be based on the (asymptotic) distribution of the mle. The Fisher information for this problem is given by $\frac{1}{\theta^2}$. Hence an asymptotic CI for $\theta$ is given by $$\bar{X} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\bar{X}^2}{n}}$$ where we have replaced $\theta^2$ by its mle, since we do not know the population parameter. And here is a very simple R-simulation of the coverage for the case of a sample of size fifty from an exponential distribution with parameter $2$. r =mle+qnorm(0.025)*sqrt((mle^2)/50)){r[i]
