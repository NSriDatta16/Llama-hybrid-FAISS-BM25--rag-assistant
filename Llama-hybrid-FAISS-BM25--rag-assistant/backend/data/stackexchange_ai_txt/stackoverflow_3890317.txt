How can I parse incomplete XML fragments with Perl's XML::Twig?

I'm trying to extract data from log files in XML format. As these are huge, I am using XML::Twig to extract the relevant data from a buffer instead of the whole file(s) As these are concatenaded data from STDIN, the XML is far from well formed. So frequently the parser stops with an error. How can I get the XML parser to ignore the errors and only extract the tags I am interested in? Do I have to fall back to regular expression parsing (start-tag - end-tag)?
