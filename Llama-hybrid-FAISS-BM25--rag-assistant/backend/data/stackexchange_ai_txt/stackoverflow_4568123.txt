Organizing a MySQL Database

I'm developing an application that will require me to create my first large-scale MySQL database. I'm currently having a difficult time wrapping my mind around the best way to organize it. Can anyone recommend any reading materials that show different ways to organize a MySQL database for different purposes? I don't want to try getting into the details of what I imagine the database's main components will be because I'm not confident that I can express it clearly enough to be helpful at this point. That's why I'm just looking for some general resources on MySQL database organization.
