IE7 and "inherit": ignoring entire rule?

I know that IE7 doesn't support the value inherit for any CSS properties except direction and visibility . When a browser doesn't support a value, it should simply not apply the given declaration (that particular line). Does anyone know why IE7 doesn't use the first ul a color declaration, instead choosing to use the plain a color declaration? Is it just ignoring the entire ul a rule? To be clear: in most browsers the first link is red and the second link is blue. In IE7 the first link is red, but so is the second, even though I have at least one declaration it should understand in the ul a rule. Anchor Inherit Test body { color: #369; } a { color: #f00; } ul a { color: #369; color: inherit; /* this should be ignored by IE7, right? */ } This is testing a red link in a paragraph. here is a link that should not be red
