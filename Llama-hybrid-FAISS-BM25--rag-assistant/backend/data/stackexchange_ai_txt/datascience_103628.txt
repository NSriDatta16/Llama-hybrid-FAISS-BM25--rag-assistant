How do I work with noisy real world text data for text classification?

I have a topic classification model built upon Bert, when I deploy my model people input strings of a random nature like : "aaaaaa" "aaa bbb" "ab ab ab" and so on. My model predicts a false positive for these types of inputs 10% of the time. How do I make my machine learning model robust to these inputs?
