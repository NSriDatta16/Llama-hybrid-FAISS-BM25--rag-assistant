You can can begin collecting this data without adding any javascript to your Site's pages, using your server's access logs . If your server is Apache, then as long as you set your config file to record data to your access log in the Combined Log Forma t , then you are already collecting referrer (i.e., this is one of two additional fields appended to each line in the logfile when you specify the Combined Log Format versus the (default) Common Log Format, the other field is the user agent; both 'referer' and user-agent are taken from the respective HTTP request headers). Another advantage of this method is that if you have been logging using the Combined Log Format, then you also have the data you want going back in time, as far back as you archive your logfiles.
