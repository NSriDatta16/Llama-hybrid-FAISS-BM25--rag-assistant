This is what your post looks like to me: "I have these data, what can I do with them?" The answer is "A LOT". What do you want to do exactly? what is the goal? From the topic, I assume your goal is to find the relations between "Keyword", "Average Position", "Clicks", "Cost", ... with "Impressions". If this is true, then you have multiple predictor variables and a target variable (Impressions) in which you would like to know the relation. This can be done through multiple statistical techniques such as: Pearson Correlation Spearman Correlation Kendall Correlation Mutual Information Simple regression (and checking importance of each predictor variable) RReliefF algorithm etc.
