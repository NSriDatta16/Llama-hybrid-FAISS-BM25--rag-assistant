Hard to say. Yes, I agree, that it will be more elegant - at least for you. But think, what the next programmer will think about it. It will be even more complicated. Previously mentioned strategy pattern and java's enum are definitely better solution, but since you are maintaining this code, I'm not sure if your boss will be happy with time consuming refactoring. My advice would be to use enums - not so big code change.
