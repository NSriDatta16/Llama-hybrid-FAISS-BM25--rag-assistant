well, 11.8 sec is pretty slow (so slow i would call site seriously broken) its so slow i would investigate if your blog has technical problems. use a tool like pingdom http://tools.pingdom.com/ and loads.in (click on Waterfall chart after the first test) to find out what is slow. if it's the first part (HTML delivery) then you must investigate what is the slow part (the server, the database, ...) for this look at you internal logfiles and run some DB test scripts (google it). lets say that from a technical point everything is ok (which i seriously doubt) - or - you dont have the knowledge or tools to find the issue....... then change your webhosting provider. find out (via google analytics) where the majority from your users come from and then choose a - good (so not the cheapest) - in the same country / region. what i outlined above was the right way to do it, now some quick tips: if you are on a cheap webhost, try disabling gzip (which is default enabled via a lot of caching plugins) gzip kills a lot of cheap webhosts (i"m looking at you one.com). change your template to a default template, a lot of customized templates are created by web design students on LSD - and are just overkill. note: 11.8 sec also means that about 20% to 40% of your visitors don't wait for the first pageload. so if you fix it you will see an immediate traffic growth (and more average page views, too).
