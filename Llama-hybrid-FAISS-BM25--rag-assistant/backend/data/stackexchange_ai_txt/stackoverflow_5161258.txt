(As seen in: BASH FAQ entry #68: "How do I run a command, and have it abort (timeout) after N seconds?" ) You can use timeout *: timeout 10 ping www.goooooogle.com Otherwise, do what timeout does internally: ( cmdpid=$BASHPID; (sleep 10; kill $cmdpid) & exec ping www.goooooogle.com ) In case you want to do a timeout for longer bash code, use the second option as such: ( cmdpid=$BASHPID; (sleep 10; kill $cmdpid) \ & while ! ping -w 1 www.goooooogle.com do echo crap; done ) * It's included in GNU Coreutils 8+, so most current Linux systems have it installed already, otherwise you can install it, e.g. sudo apt-get install timeout or sudo apt-get install coreutils
