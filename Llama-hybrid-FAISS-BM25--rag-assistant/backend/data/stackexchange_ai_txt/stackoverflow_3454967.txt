C++ inherits from c the need/desire to work efficiently on many platforms, and therefore leaves certain things up to the compiler. Aside from requiring elements to appear in the specified order, this is one of them. But many compilers support #pragma s and options to let you establish come control of the packing. See your compiler's documentation.
