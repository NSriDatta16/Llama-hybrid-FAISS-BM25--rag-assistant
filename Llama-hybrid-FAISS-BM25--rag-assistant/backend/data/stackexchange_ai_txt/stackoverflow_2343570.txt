Both namespaces and classes can be used to organize information in hierarchy. However namespaces allow to distribute definition across dll boundaries, but classes do not. Also classes require to put class name before type name, but namespaces allow to use keyword "using". So if you want to define delegates in one namespace in different dlls, you use namespaces. If you want to force people to prefix type name with any other name without being able to rely on namespace context then you use classes.
