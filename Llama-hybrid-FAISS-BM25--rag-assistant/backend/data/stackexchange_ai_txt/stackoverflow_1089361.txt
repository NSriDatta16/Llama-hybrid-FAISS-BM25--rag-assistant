This seems a little shaky to me. Is there any chance of the trigger being called frequently, leading to many launches of the application? Also, I don't think the trigger will complete until the console application has finished or failed. Meantime, the operation that caused the trigger to fire will still be waiting. Does the application need to run right away? If not, then maybe you could run this as a SQL Agent job periodically.
