I can't comment yet, so I'll use this form: Usually one uses PKCS #12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS#12 for storing a certificate with its private Key. Also, one can store a public/private key pair in a PCKS #8 Container and ship the certificate separately. If you're interested, i think i have some java code samples for PKCS #12 storage. Also, the open source Java Certificate Authority EJBCA (http://www.ejbca.org/) is a great source for examples.
