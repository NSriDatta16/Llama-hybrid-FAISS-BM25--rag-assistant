This may not be a complete answer, but I would like to offer some reassuring news about rainbow tables and the web. I wouldn't worry too much about Rainbow Tables with regards to the web for the following reasons: (1) Rainbow table cracks work by examining the hashed password. On the web, the hashed password is stored on your database so to even consider using rainbow tables one would first need to hack your entire database. (2) If you use a salt as most password storage systems do, then rainbow tables rapidly become unfeasible. Basically a salt adds a series of extra bits to the end of a given password. In order to use a rainbow table, it would need to accommodate the extra bits in each plaintext password. For example the first link you showed us had a rainbow table implementation that could crack up to 14 characters in a password. Therefore if you had more than 14 bytes of a salt that system would be useless.
