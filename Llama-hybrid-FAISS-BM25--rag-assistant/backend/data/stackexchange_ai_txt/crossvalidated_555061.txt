A core discipline in statistics is inference; the process of using data to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability, i.e. creating confidence intervals, p-values. The use of the CLT is at the heart of hypothesis testing (at least in the frequentist setting), where you need to quantify how likely/unlikely an observed summary statistic is given some assumed model. Without CLT you would be unable to produce such inference which is at the core of sound decision making theory. Of course in some settings you do not need to rely on CLT for inferential results, such as in the Bayesian framework where you can do approximate inference on the exact posterior.
