Twitter Streaming API recording and Processing using Windows Azure and F#

A month ago I tried to use F# agents to process and record Twitter StreamingAPI Data here . As a little exercise I am trying to transfer the code to Windows Azure. So far I have two roles: One worker role (Publisher) that puts messages (a message being the json of a tweet) to a queue. One worker role (Processor) that reads messages from the queue, decodes the json and dumps the data into a cloud table. Which leads to lots of questions: Is it okay to think of a worker role as an agent ? In practice the message can be larger than 8 KB so I am going to need to use a blob storage and pass as message the reference to the blob (or is there another way?), will that impact performance ? Is it correct to say that if needed I can increase the number of instances of the Processor worker role, and the queue will magically be processed faster ? Sorry for pounding all these questions, hope you don't mind, Thanks a lot!
