Please note that there is a difference between the kernel questioned here and the one in the answer above. See here . The best and first resource on the kernels in question is "Theory of Reproducing Kernels" by Nachman Aronszajn. You can also look at Grace Wahba's book: "Spline Models for Observational Data". A reproducing kernel uniquely identifies a reproducing kernel Hilbert space .
