Stepping away from Magento's ORM (as resource hungry as it can be) isn't really a good idea. Here's a patch for 1.4 CE memory leak and I would do it the "Magento" way and save the headaches of missing or partial data needed. You may also consider Unigry's Data RapidFlow as well, hefty price tag but well worth every penny if your having to manage a lot of product/category data often.
