Linq's InsertOnSubmit not added to changeset

Related to How to debug a linq to sql InsertOnSubmit statement? I Execute the following bit of code: db.DBUsers.InsertOnSubmit(new DBUser { Id = id, BrandCode3 = brandCode3.ToLower(), LoweredUsername = username.ToLower(), Username = username, CreationDate = date, Salt = salt, Password = SecurityService.CreateMD5Hash(salt + password), PasswordQuestion = passwordQuestion, PasswordAnswer = passwordAnswer, Comment = comment, Email = email, IsApproved = isApproved, LastPasswordChangedDate = date, FailedPasswordAnswerAttemptCount = 0, FailedPasswordAnswerAttemptWindowStart = date, IsLockedOut = false, IsOnLine = false, LastActivityDate = date } ); db.SubmitChanges(); UPDATE Here's the attributes for the primary key: [Column(Storage="_Id", DbType="UniqueIdentifier NOT NULL", IsPrimaryKey=true)] public System.Guid Id I noticed that the Auto-sync property has the value "Never" in the properties window. My guess would be this needs to be OnInsert. Gonna check that. Right before I call submitchanges I check the change set and it shows no inserts, updates or deletes... SQL profiler shows me no query is sent, attaching a db.Log shows me no action is executed. Why isn't anything submitted?
