Separable case If you want to get the weights for the separable case, look at the transformed dataset: \begin{bmatrix} &1&\sqrt{2}&1\\ &1&-\sqrt{2}&1\\ &1&-\sqrt{2}&1\\ &1&\sqrt{2}&1\\ \end{bmatrix} and your y values are basically $[1, -1, -1, 1]$ . You have to apply the SVM method in the transformed space, i.e., your equation would be: $$\alpha_i(y_i(W.\phi(x_i)+b)-1)=0.$$ Notice that if you take the second coordinate of the $\phi(x_i),$ you can have a direct relationship with the y values. So take W to be $(0, 1, 0)$ which picks the second coordinate. Now your $W.\phi(x_i)$ values are $\sqrt{2}\ [1,-1,-1,1].$ If you if you scale the $W$ to be $(0, 1/\sqrt{2}, 0).$ and look carefully, the $y_i * (W.\phi(x_i))$ values are all $1.$ Hence, $b=0$ and any real values of $\alpha_i>0$ would work in this case. Non-Separable case Now you are in two-dimensional space, and your quadrant 1 and 3 basically have 1's, and the rest have -1's. First, take any line visually and check that it can not divide them. If the first and the fourth points are on the same side, at least one other point would be in the same side too. Mathematically, why? Take any line in the form $f(x_1,x_2)=x_2 - m x_1 - c = 0.$ Now if a point $(x,y)$ satisfies $f(x,y)>0,$ it will lie on one side, and if the value is $ it will lie on the other side. The values of $f$ for your four points are, respectively: $-1+m-c, 1+m-c, -1-m-c, 1-m-c.$ If $-1+m-c and $1-m-c both happen (i.e., first and fourth points are on the same side), then $1-c If $c>0,$ the point $(1,-1)$ will be less than 0 too, i.e., that is on the same side of $(1,1) (-1,-1).$ If $c the other point will be on the same side of them. Similarly, you can show that if $-1+m-c>0,$ and $1-m-c>0,$ both happen, one of the other points will be on the same side. Also, note that the y-axis can not separate them. You can translate this whole argument in the form of hyperplanes too.
