R - Applying cforest to a dataset with no outcomes

I want to build a random forest model using a genomic dataset that has 1000+ columns and 20 samples and has no outcomes. I decided to generate an outcomes column with random true and false values. I am using this as my dependent variable. So when the model completes, I get both the predicted and actual outcomes (the ones generated by me and bound to the data frame). Does this technique work in predicting the values? Here is an example using the iris data set: irisDF 2/3){ Iris_Rand_outcomes I am looking to see if cforest can find an underlying pattern in the data and maybe give me some prediction on this pattern. I want to find the outcome of the data. Can the random forest see a pattern in the data and give me a prediction that can help me label (put them into classes) the samples? Does having a dummy column actually help me in getting the classes?
