Why the RMSE of training is very small but the test error is very big

I am a beginner in machine learning , and I use Matlab machine learning toolbox to build machine learning model. I have some question about my model. My input data has 20 predictors and 1 response. I use Gaussian Process Regression model with Squared exponential kernel function, and I also use 10 fold cross validation. By this way the RMSE of training is very small. However, when I output the model I use some test data to predict, the error of test is so big. How do I improve my model? I would appreciate it if someone answered me...
