Roughly speaking, I would say to a journalist that I could declare the daily level of nitrogen dioxide being sure, after discarding the highest values and the lowest values, that in each one of one-half of the days in that year the observed value is not beyond a distance of IQR/2 from the declared level. For example, if your first quartile and third quartile are 100 and 124, you could say that daily level is 112 (average of 100 and 124) and assure your interlocutor that in half of the days the error you make isn't greater than 12.
