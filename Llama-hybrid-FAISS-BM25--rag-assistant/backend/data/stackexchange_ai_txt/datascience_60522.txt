A Question: is it possible for me to create an AI that learns to play games which I did not create?

Mainly, I have a question that I could not find an answer for anywhere, about an AI machine learning game. Is it possible for me to create an AI which can learn a game that I did not myself create, without any source codes or APIs? And I'm talking about simple games such as chrome t-rex, snake, etc. I was told this is possible using image processing but I am still not so sure. I am referring to just open up a game, not a downloaded one, a one available at google, such as the mentioned above, run my code, and it will start playing and learning the game. Just creating 1 algorithm to learn multiple easy 2D google games, is such a thing possible with image processing?
