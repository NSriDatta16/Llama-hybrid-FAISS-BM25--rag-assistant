R random forest what level of error rate is fine

I am building the regression model using random forest with package randomForestSRC in R. My error rate at the last line is 16.17. I think it is high, although I am new to the random forest and actually have no idea about the error rate. My question is what level of error rate is fine? How about my error rate? If it is high, what should I do to deal with it? Here is my result of the model. rfsrc(Response~. data=selected_preditors_train, importance=TRUE) Sample size: 6508 Number of trees: 1000 Forest terminal node size: 5 Average no. of terminal nodes: 1388.569 No. of variables tried at each split: 11 Total no. of variables: 25 Resampling used to grow trees: swr Resample size used to grow trees: 6508 Analysis: RF-R Family: regr Splitting rule: mse random Number of random split points: 10 % variance explained: 43.35 Error rate: 16.17
