I tend to fall back on a pretty standard answer for this: what does your theory suggest? Should rain from a month ago actually impact streamflow? A year ago? A decade? 10 minutes? Surely there is some soil research (it's a thing, I have a family member that studied it!) that gives some hints about this. If you're simply in need of the best possible prediction and you are not interested in why, then theory can at least give you a starting point for some test-and-trial (guess-and-pray) steps. Other than that, time series analysis has some basic steps for choosing lag structures to use in, say, a VAR model. This answer might be a good place to start.
