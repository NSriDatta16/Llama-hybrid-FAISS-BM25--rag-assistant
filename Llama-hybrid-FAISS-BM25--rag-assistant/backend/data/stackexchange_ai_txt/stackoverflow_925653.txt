Is there an alternative to CSS?

Is there a style sheet formatting language alternative to CSS? Or is CSS the current single language for doing Style Sheet formatting type things? I looked at the write up of CSS on Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets ) and a few other comments about CSS and became discouraged about the lack of full support for CSS in the different Layout engines, so I am just curious if there is an alternative or I must learn to also use CSS filters. Thanks for any insights.
