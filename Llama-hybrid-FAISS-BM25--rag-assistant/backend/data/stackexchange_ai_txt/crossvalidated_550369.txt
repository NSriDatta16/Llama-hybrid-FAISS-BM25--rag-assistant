Is the probability calculated by logistic regression a conditional or an unconditional probability?

As far as I understand, logistic regression takes the linear model from linear regression and uses it as input to the logistic formula (pardon my complete lack of technical accuracy): $\frac{1}{1+exp(-(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{(i)}_{1}+\ldots+\beta_{p}x^{(i)}_{p}))}$ My question is: Does this formula calculate $P(y)$ or $P(y|x;\beta)$ ? I have seen both.
