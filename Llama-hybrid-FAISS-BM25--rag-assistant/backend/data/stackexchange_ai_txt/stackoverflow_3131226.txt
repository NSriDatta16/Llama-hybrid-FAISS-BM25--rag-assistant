We have a large organically grown application that has very little documentation, so using flow charts to document components within the application has proven very usefull to the business side of the operation, as even they don't understand how everything fits together. They aren't at line by line level, but do cover all branches of business logic with the subsequent processing and outputs (although not following strict flow chart rules - some blocks describe multiple processes).
