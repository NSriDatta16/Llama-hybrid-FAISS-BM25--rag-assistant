New idea: This is another idea that's sort of a workaround in that it's not very elegant, but it's very simple. Put element (1) in its own configured like so: That linear layout will always span from the top of screen to just above element (2), and since its gravity is "center", element (1) will always be in the middle of whatever space is available for it. Note: The line android:layout_height="..." is required, but doesn't seem to actually do anything. Whether it's fill_parent or wrap_content, its height is overridden by the lines anchoring its top to the ParentTop and its bottom to element(2). However, not having the line makes it crash with a Runtime exception. Original, not very good idea: Another less-than-ideal solution is to use two layout files. Put the portrait layout xml in your layout folder and the landscape layout in a new folder called layout-land. Android then automatically selects the right one based on the orientation of the phone. I think you could use layout-port , but putting the portrait one in just layout makes sure it knows which one to use by default.
