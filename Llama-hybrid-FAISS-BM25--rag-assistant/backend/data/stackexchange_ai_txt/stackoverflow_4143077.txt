Can we add a specific CFLAG to a eCos package when an cdl_option was enabled?

Say we have a package named CYGPKG_FOO, which has a cdl_option "CYGPKG_FOO_FEATURE_A_ENABLE". I want a specific gcc flags (e.g. "-DFEATURE_A=1") added to the CFLAGS of this package when this cdl_option was enabled. But "The eCos Component Writer's Guide" said: http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-3.0/cdl-guide/build.make.html#BUILD.FLAGS From the link above, it looks like we can't add/remove CFLAGS based on cdl_option selections... So my question here is: can I do what was described in first paragraph, and if yes, how? Thanks!
