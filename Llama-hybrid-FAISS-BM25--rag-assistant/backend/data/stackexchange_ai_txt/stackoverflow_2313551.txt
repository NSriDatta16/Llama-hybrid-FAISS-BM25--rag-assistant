Can I :select multiple fields (*, foo) without the extra ones being added to my instances (Instance.foo=>bar)

I'm trying to write a named scope that will order my 'Products' class based on the average 'Review' value. The basic model looks like this Product I've defined the following named scope on Product: named_scope :best_reviews, :select => "*, AVG(reviews.value) score", :joins => "INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM reviews GROUP BY reviews.product_id) reviews ON reviews.product_id = products.id", :group => "reviews.product_id", :order => "score desc" This seems to be working properly, except that it's adding the 'score' value in the select to my Product instances, which causes problems if I try to save them, and makes comparisons return false (@BestProduct != Product.best_reviews.first, becuase Product.best_reviews.first has score=whatever). Is there a better way to structure the named_scope? Or a way to make Rails ignore the extra field in the select?
