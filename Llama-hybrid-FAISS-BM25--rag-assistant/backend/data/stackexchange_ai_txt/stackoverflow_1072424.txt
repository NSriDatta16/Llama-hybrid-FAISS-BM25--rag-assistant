I write a free book about this. You can read it here: http://python3porting.com/ In short: Make sure all your third party libraries are available for Python 3. Prepare your code by removing common ambiguities: Use // if you really want integer division. Make sure you flag binary files with the 'b' flag when you open them, to clearly indicate if you mean the data to be binary or not. The higher your test coverage is, the better. Make sure it runs without warnings under "Python 2.7 -3". Now run 2to3. Fix any bugs. That's it, more or less.
