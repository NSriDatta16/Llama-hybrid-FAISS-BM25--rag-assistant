JQuery focus() on jQuery-applied anchors works in Chrome and IE, not Firefox

Update: This question has been solved, so the buggy Firefox behavior will no longer appear when loading my example webpage My webpage has very long passages of text, so I want to make each paragraph its own permalink. To do this, I use jQuery to add an anchor and link to each paragraph after the page loads. This worked perfectly in Chrome. To get this to work in IE I added an explicit jQuery focus() function after applying the anchors. However, this does not work in Firefox if I either load the page for the first time or refresh it (e.g. http://www.readsherlock.com/study.php#p4 ). The relevant javascript is pasted below. $(document).ready(function() { var i = 1; $("#text p").each(function(i){ $(this).html(' ' + $(this).html() + ' '); }); if(location.hash != '') $(location.hash).focus(); }); Thanks!
