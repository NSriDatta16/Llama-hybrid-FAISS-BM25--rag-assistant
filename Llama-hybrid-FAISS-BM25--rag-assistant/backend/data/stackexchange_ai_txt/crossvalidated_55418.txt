Why is it futile to use the deviance as a goodness-of-fit measure for Bernoulli data?

In Ordinal Data Modelling by Johson & Albert, page 102-103: For Bernoulli observations [...] the asymptotic chi-squared distribution of the deviance statistic may not pertain. Indeed, for the linear logistic models with Bernoulli observations, the deviance function can be expresses solely as a function of the MLE of the regression parameter, which demonstrates the futility of using this statistic to measure goodness of fit for such data . Could someone kindly explain what this means, please?
