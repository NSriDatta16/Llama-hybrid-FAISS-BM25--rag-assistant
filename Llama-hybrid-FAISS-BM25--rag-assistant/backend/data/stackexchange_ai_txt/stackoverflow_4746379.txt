interface/abstract class

i have read some lines from somewhere but i cant understand the meaning of this line clearly .. i dont know why i cant understand. I know the difference between this two very well.. But plz help me .. and explain that what it does mean... ? In design, you want the base class to present only an interface for its derived classes. This means, you donâ€™t want anyone to actually instantiate an object of the base class. You only want to upcast to it (implicit upcasting, which gives you polymorphic behaviour), so that its interface can be used. This is accomplished by making that class abstract using the abstract keyword. If anyone tries to make an object of an abstract class, the compiler prevents it. Thanks in advance....
