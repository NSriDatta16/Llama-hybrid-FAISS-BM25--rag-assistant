It sounds like either your professor gave you an incorrect recommendation, or you misunderstood, or you have not communicated what you want in a clear way. Something is wrong, in any case. If you are trying to predict a numeric score (like IQ, SAT, etc) then you do not want logistic regression of any type. You probably want linear regression. But perhaps that is not what you want to do. Perhaps you want to use the scores to predict the group that the person is in; since there are three groups, you do not want "ordinary" or binomial logistic regression, but you might want either ordinal or multinomial logistic, depending on whether the outcome is ordered or not. One additional possibility is that your professor expects you to turn the numerical value of score into a categorical one; this is nearly always a bad idea, but it is often done, nonetheless. In this case, you would probably want ordinal logistic regression If you are using SAS, you may find a presentation of mine informative; it is at www.nesug.org/Proceedings/nesug10/sa/sa03.pdf
