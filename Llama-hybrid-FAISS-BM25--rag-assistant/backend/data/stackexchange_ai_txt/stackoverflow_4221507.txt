If the foo element in the namespace http://languagemainsite.org/lang/1.0/ is semantically a different concept to a foo element in the namespace http://languagemainsite.org/lang/1.1/ , the namespaces should be different. If they're not—if a Lang-1.1 foo is just a Lang-1.0 foo maybe with a few extra features—they should be in the same namespace. Consider, for example, the element in XHTML 1.0, XHTML 1.1 and XHTML5. It is semantically the same thing (a paragraph) in all versions of XHTML, so they can all live in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace, even though they have different capabilities in the different language versions. Including a version number in the namespace makes backwards-compatibility very difficult. Applications supporting two versions of the language would have to switch namespaces to cope with the same named elements, and a version-1-supporting application can't practically read a version-2 document at all. So only use versioned namespaces for new ‘major version’ updates that deliberately completely drop backwards compatibility. Otherwise, a version attribute on the root element is generally a better idea. And yes, you should use a URL, in order to avoid clashing with others' namespaces. It's polite to put some descriptive information up at the URL you use.
