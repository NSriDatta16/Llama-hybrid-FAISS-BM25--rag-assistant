PCA simply finds more compact ways of representing correlated data. PCA does not explicitly compact the data in order to better explain the target variable. In some cases, most of your inputs might be correlated with each other but have minimal relevance to your target variable. That's probably what is happening in your case. Consider a toy example. Lets say I want to predict stock prices. Say I'm given four predictors: Year-over-year earnings growth (relevant) Percent chance of rain (irrelevant) Humidity (irrelevant) Temperature (irrelevant) If I apply PCA to this data set, the first principle component would relate to weather since 75% of the predictors are weather related. Is this principle component relevant? It's not. The two options you've highlighted boil down to using CFS or not using it. The option that uses CFS does better because it explicitly selects variables that have relevance to the target variable.
