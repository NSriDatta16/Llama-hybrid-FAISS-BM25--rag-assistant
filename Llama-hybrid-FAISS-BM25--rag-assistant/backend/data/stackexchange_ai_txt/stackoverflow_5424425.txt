Determining the state of the dropIndicator for a tree component in Flex 3

I have a custom class that extends the Tree component so I can add some logic to the drag and drop functionality and not allow folders to be dropped inside folders. In the dragOver function, I am using: var currNodeOver:TreeItemRenderer = TreeItemRenderer(indexToItemRenderer(calculateDropIndex(event))); to determine the drop target, and setting: DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE); accordingly. My issue is that I can't seem to determine the state or position of the drop Indicator. So if I have an open folder with nodes followed by another folder, and I drag a folder in between, it can go in 2 different locations: at the bottom of the open folder OR above the following folder on the root...the only indication to the user is the drop indicator, but in the dragOver function the dropIndex remains the same for either situation. How do I detect between these 2 locations?
