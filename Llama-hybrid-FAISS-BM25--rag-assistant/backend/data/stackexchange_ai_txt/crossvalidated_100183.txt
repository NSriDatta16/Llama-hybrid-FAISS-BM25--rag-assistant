Comparing success ratio based on unequal distribution of samples

I wish to compare the success ratio of offers according to the day of the week. Here is a table with the last column giving the average success ratio across all offers for that weekday. It seems that Mondays are performing the best (0.33 success ratio) tab = table(t$weekday,t$repeater) cbind(tab, tab[,2]/(tab[,1]+tab[,2])) f t SuccessRatio Friday 3806 1359 0.26 Monday 4829 2426 0.33 My problem is that the offers were not equally distributed across the day of the week. So for example if the offer 1221663 was very successful (whatever the weekday) and was proposed a lot on mondays, this could mislead us to believe that mondays are good to propose offers in general. Here is an extract of the offers distribution across weekdays: tab = table(t$weekday, t$offer) tab 1219903 1220502 1220503 1221658 1221663 1221665 1221666 1221667 1230218 Friday 2 43 93 305 369 62 21 308 286 Monday 3 81 90 105 147 20 11 146 144 Saturday 1 33 78 264 323 67 33 250 275 Sunday 6 29 71 201 268 55 29 229 209 Thursday 1 51 101 306 431 72 38 377 317 Tuesday 6 100 95 80 113 22 7 91 0 Wednesday 2 82 76 69 91 17 5 65 394 etc (only extract of data here) Is there a statistical technique to somehow create a more equally weighted subset of the data in order to have a more realistic weekday success ratio ?
