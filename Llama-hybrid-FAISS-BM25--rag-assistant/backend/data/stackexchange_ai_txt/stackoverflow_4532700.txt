.htaccess removes trailing periods from query

Having some trouble where .htaccess is removing the trailing period from strings. I am running Apache/2.2.12 (Win32). This is not a production system, so there is nothing else in .htaccess other than: RewriteEngine on ...and rules, and this works well in all cases so far, unless there is a trailing period in the name. Rules all take the form of: RewriteRule ^thing/(.*)$ showthing.php?thingname=$1 A link on A.php: ...CLICK So in showthing.php , I simply do: $sTHINGname= !isset($_REQUEST['thingname']) ? NULL : $_REQUEST['thingname']; ...then $sTHINGname is run though the db to find the ID. The trouble is that when thingname has a trailing period (e.g.: " M.O.X. ") echo $sTHINGname; // shows M.O.X, which does not match an ID One solution is to do: str_replace( '.', '%2E', $name ); But when the links are placed in the referring page (A.php), and this works, but the links read: ...which is a bit inelegant and does not solve the problem, because if a user types as a URL "...thing/ M.O.X. " they still don't get a result. I checked out replacing $_REQUEST with $_GET, but the result doesn't change. Also: RewriteRule ^(thing/)(.*)$ showthing.php?thingname=$2 ...and variations all show the same results. Most search results dealing with htaccess and periods are domain issues, so I wonder if anyone has any ideas about this one?
