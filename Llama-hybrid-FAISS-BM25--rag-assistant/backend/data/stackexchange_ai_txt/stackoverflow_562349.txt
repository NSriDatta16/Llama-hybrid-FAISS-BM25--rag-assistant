I want to load all of the unit-tests in a tree, can it be done?

I have a heirarchical folder full of Python unit-tests. They are all importable ".py" files which define TestCase objects. This folder contains thousands of files in many nested subdirectories and was written by somebody else. I do not have permission to change it, I just have to run it. I want to generate a single TestSuite object which contains all of the TestCases in the folder. Is there an easy and elegant way to do this? Thanks
