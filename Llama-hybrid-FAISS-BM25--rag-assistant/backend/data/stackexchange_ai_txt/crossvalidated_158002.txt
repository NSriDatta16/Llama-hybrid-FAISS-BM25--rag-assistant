First: independent of the predictors, if your response has 2 classes (binary), we would usually use a logistic regression 2 classes, we are speaking about a multinomial regression . Second: regardless of what regression model you use (linear, logistic, multinomial), if you have categorical predictors, most software packages offer the choice between showing Regression tables (which include tests for the individual predictors, i.e. n-1 tests for a categorical predictor with n classes), and ANOVA , which tests for the overall significance of a predictor (i.e. test for an influence of all classes of a predictor at once). Hence, regression tables and ANOVA have the same model underlying, but apply a different test. You can always do both. It's your choice what you want. In R, if you are doing a logistic regression, you can do an ANOVA as you would do for the linear model (with the catch discussed here Choice between Type-I, Type-II, or Type-III ANOVA ). You have to check to what extent ANOVA functions are implemented for the various multinomial regressions options in R. If ANOVA is not available, a simple substitute for a specific hypothesis would be a likelihood ratio test.
