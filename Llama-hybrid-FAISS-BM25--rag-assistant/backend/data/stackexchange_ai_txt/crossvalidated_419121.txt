For an analytic solution, you need to start by finding the distributions of differences between adjacent order statistics. Then you need to deal with two cases: (a) where $X_j$ is the max or min because those to order statistics have only one neighbor, and (b) where $X_j$ is somewhere in the middle. Intuitively, if you have $n$ observations, the order statistics are on average spaced equally, so that the average distance between them is $\frac{1}{n+1}.$ That takes care of case (a). For case (b), the closest of two differences will be smaller. By simulation, the average distance from the min $X_{1:n}$ to the next larger value $X_{2:n}$ does indeed seem to be $\frac{1}{n+1}.$ By symmetry, the average distance between $X_{(n-1):n}$ and $X_{n:n}$ is the same. Simulation if you happen to choose the smallest of $n=5:$ set.seed(725) # for reproducibility m = 10^6; n = 5; d = numeric(m) for(i in 1:m) { x = sort(runif(n)) d[i] = x[2] - x[1] } mean(d) [1] 0.1666103 # aprx 1/6 Simulation, if you happen to choose a value other than the max or min. This seems to be half as large as for the max or min. set.seed(2019) m = 10^5; n = 5; d = numeric(m) for(i in 1:m) { x = sort(runif(n)) d[i] = min(diff(x[2:4])) } mean(d) [1] 0.08302884 So it seems the answer for a randomly chosen one of $n = 5$ is $(2/5)(1/6) + (3/5)(1/12) = 7/60.$
