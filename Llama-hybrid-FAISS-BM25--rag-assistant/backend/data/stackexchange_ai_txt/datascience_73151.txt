How to identify topic transition in consecutive sentences using Python?

I'm new to data mining. I want to detect topic transition among consecutive sentences. For instance, I have a paragraph (this could be a collection of dozens of sentences, sometimes without transitional words) as follows: As I really like Mickey Mouse, I was hopping to go to Florida. But my dad took me to Nevada. Obviously, Mickey Mouse was not there. But, I attended a camp with other children. And, I really enjoyed and learnt a lot from my camp. Here, I want to automatically split this into following sub-paraphs: As I really like Mickey Mouse, I was hopping to go to Florida. But my dad took me to Nevada. Obviously, Mickey Mouse was not there. But, I attended a camp with other children. And, I really enjoyed and learnt a lot from my camp. As far as I know, this is not the sentence similarity measurement. What technique should be used here? Any example using python or tensorflow models would be greatly appreciated.
