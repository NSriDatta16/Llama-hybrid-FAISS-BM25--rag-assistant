How to handle level shift with ARIMA model?

I have some data that fits an ARIMA(1,1,4) model pretty well and prior to COVID it was a reasonably stable time series. Since COVID, there has been a level shift downward where it continues to be reasonably stable but at volumes around 80% of what they were before. Since we are unsure of when things will return to previous volumes (if ever), I would like to forecast out at this lower level. Is there a best approach for handling this type of data? I have been using Dr. Hyndman's book and the approach I was thinking about was adding a Boolean variable for pre and post COVID using the xreg argument. I am using R for my analysis if it makes a difference.
