If you think about this, would you really ever want to load 100's of thousands to 1 million records in a grid or any control for that matter? Well unless you're trying to come up with some marketing fodder? I don't know of a monitor that could load that many at once to look at. Even if it could, maybe I'm just slow but I can only process them a couple at a time. What can an average user look at and process. 10 records, maybe 20. I could see maybe wanting to load a 100 or so and not have to page to get new recors, but thousands or millions? Personally I'm going to require filter capabilities and paging and if I have a developer trying to load 1 million records into a grid, we're going to have to have a sit down because the performance of a grid or any other control is not the issue. Let's look at a multi billion $ company who has a site and it's sole purpose is to return data to a users. I'm referring to Google. Do a search and you get back around 10 records. I just did a search and got 21,400,00 results. If I don't find what I'm looking for in the first page or two (20 records), I know I didn't filter good enough. I'm not not sifting through a million records. So that puts your performance back to your logic of retrieving records and giving your users the correct ability to filter down the data they really need at the time. How fast one grid shows 1.5 million records seems like fodder for "bench racing" and who cares if it's sluggish scrolling because why pull back that many records to start with? I apologize if I'm missing the point and you're just having fun with bench racing. But I read you are talking about real world, LOB applications and if that's the case then we need to be realistic about the scenarios. We use the Telerik grid and it performs just fine for real world LOB app. Again though the users we write for can't look at or process 1.5 millions at once nor would they care too. Also as you're finding out in this thread their support is second to none and I'll take that anyday from a any company we buy a these types of products from over whether they can load a million records in a grid or not. Telerik, Infragistics or whoever. For anybody serious about real world scenarios and trying to find a quality suite, the first thing to realize is who's on this thread trying to answer questions about their products.
