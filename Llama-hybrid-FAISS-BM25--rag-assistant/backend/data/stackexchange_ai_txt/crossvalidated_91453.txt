Hypothesis testing multiple choice question with single answer

I have a survey questions with five options and I ask respondents to pick their single top choice. What test should I use to figure out if the top voted answer is statistically more popular than the other answers? How could I construct a confidence interval for each answer? Is there a different Bayesian approach to this problem?
