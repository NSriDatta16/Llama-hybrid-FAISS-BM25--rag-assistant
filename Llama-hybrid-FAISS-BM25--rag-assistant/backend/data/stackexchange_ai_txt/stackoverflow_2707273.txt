How to let the CCSprite handles Touch event?

I created my OwnCCSprite, and it get the implemented CCStandardTouchDelegate protocol, and ccTouchesBegan event. But it seems not working. When I click the CCSprite, the ccTouchesBegan in the CCLayer is called, but the CCSprite's ccTouchesBegan can't called. How can I detect the CCSprite is being touched in CCLayer / OwnCCSprite? or I need to calculate the touch position, and compares it to the OwnCCSprite positions? Thz.....
