What Would Be a Good Measure of Feature Importance in Regression?

Doing simple supervised regression where the label is a floating point number (guaranteed positive) and the features are a mix of continuous floating point values and some categorical features. What would be a good metric of global bivariate dependence that would assign a value to each feature, based on the training dataset. By that I am trying to say The importance will be calculated for each feature, not each feature and each sample Best if all of them are positive and add up to one, which can be easily achieved by doing a SoftMax as the final step after getting the values otherwise. The importance should not be dictated by any specific model, such as CatBoost or XGBoost etc. Just a measure based on the data alone. If all the features were continuous floats, I would just take the Pearson correlation, but some are categorical as I pointed out. Even for categorical, likely measures like mutual information or entropy can help, but then it is difficult to compare the numbers among features.
