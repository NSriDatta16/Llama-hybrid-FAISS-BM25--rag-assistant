How to organize a Python Project?

I'm new to Python and I'm starting a mini Project, but I have some doubts on how to organize the folders in the "Python Way". I'm using PyDev in my Development Environment, and when I create a new project a folder is created called src + src Now, in the PyDev , I can create Pydev Module and PyDev Package I need to organize my Project in the following way: + Indicators - Moving_averages.py - Stochastics.py + Strategies - Moving_averages_cross.py - example.py How can I organize this in terms of Modules and Packages? What is the meaning of Modules and Packages?
