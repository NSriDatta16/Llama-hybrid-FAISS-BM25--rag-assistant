What is the discrepancy function in structural equation modeling?

Excerpt from Book I am currently trying to improve my knowledge of structural equation modeling, and have been reading through Structural Equation Modeling with Lavaan by Gana & Broc to do so. They have the following simple model: The table they reference thereafter looks like this, which is a collection of iteration cycles: To explain this table, they give the following details: Question However, I'm still not entirely sure what they are getting at here. Does SEM software simply start off with some prior estimate of what a regression path should be , then take multiple "guesses" until it is the most accurate? It appears the residual matrix is based off the "misfires" of these guesses, which seems functionally similar to how residuals normally work in regression. My previous assumption was this wasn't pre-specified by the user other than your normal constraints (fixing a path to be 1, etc.). I also noticed that they mentioned the iterations stop and so I assume that is just when the guessing is found to not improve. Or is there something I'm missing here? To summarize this into one question, how does the discrepancy function in SEM work? Please explain like I am a small child if possible.
