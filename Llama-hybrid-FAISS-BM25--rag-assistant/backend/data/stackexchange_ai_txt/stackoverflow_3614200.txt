Draggables and Resizables in SVG

I want to make an svg element (path, rect, or circle) be able to be draggable and give it resize handles. But unlike HTML DOM, not all elements have an upper left hand corner x,y coordinate and a width and height for a box surrounding the content. This makes it inconvenient to make a generic resize or drag procedure. Is it a good idea to have each path or circle be drawn inside its own svg object to give me a box to play with? How is draggable/resizable typically implemented in SVG?
