Differences between these representations of classification problems in probability terms

Say that $\mathcal{X}$ is the set of observations, and $\mathcal{Y}$ is the set of classification labels. Also say that $X$ is a continuous random variable that takes values in $\mathcal{X}$, and $Y$ is a discrete random variable that takes values in $\mathcal{Y}$. Then for a testing sample $x\in\mathcal{X}$, I find that text books often define classification tasks in probability terms as follows: $$ \hat y_1 = \underset{y\in\mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \Pr(Y=y|X=x) $$ Questions: Is there any difference between $\hat y_1$ and these: $$ \hat y_2 = \underset{y\in\mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \Pr(Y=y,X=x) $$ $$ \hat y_3 = \underset{y\in\mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} f_{Y,X}(y,x) $$ $$ \hat y_4 = \underset{y\in\mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} f_{Y|X=x}(y) $$ $$ \hat y_5 = \underset{y\in\mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} f_{Y=y|X}(x) $$ where $f_{X,Y}$, $f_{X|Y}$, and $f_{Y|X}$ are joined and conditioned probability density functions. Are there any differences? If so, what are they? If not, why do most (all from the little that I have seen) text books show $\hat y_1$ and not the others? Below is my attempt: I think I have only managed to show that: $\hat y_2 = \hat y_1$. $\hat y_5 = \hat y_1$ only if $Y$ is uniformly distributed. I still can't show for the rest. I also need confirmation on whether what I did below is right. Does $\hat y_2 = \hat y_1$? Let's start from here: $$ \hat y_2 = \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \Pr(Y=y, X=x) $$ From there, we can manipulate around and achieve the following: $$\require{cancel}\begin{split} \hat y_2 &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \Pr(Y=y, X=x)\\ &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \cancel{\Pr(X=x)}\Pr(Y=y | X=x) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(since $\Pr(X=x)$ is constant)}\\ \hat y_1 &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \Pr(Y=y | X=x)\\ \end{split}$$ So we confirm that $\hat y_2 = \hat y_1$. Does $\hat y_5 = \hat y_1$? $$\require{cancel}\begin{split} \hat y_1 &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \Pr(Y=y | X=x)\\ &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \frac{\Pr(Y=y)\Pr(X=x|Y=y)}{\Pr(X=x)} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(bayesian rule)}\\ &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \lim_{d \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Pr(Y=y) \big(d \times f_{X|Y=y}(x)\big)}{\big(d\times f_X(x)\big)}\\ &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \lim_{d \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Pr(Y=y) \big(\cancel{d} \times f_{X|Y=y}(x)\big)}{\big(\cancel{d}\times f_X(x)\big)}\\ &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \frac{\Pr(Y=y) f_{X|Y=y}(x)}{\cancel{f_X(x)}} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(since $f_X(x)$ is constant)}\\ \hat y_5 &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{arg max }} \cancel{\Pr(Y=y)} f_{X|Y=y}(x) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(by assuming $Y$ is uniformly distributed)}\\ \end{split}$$ So we confirm that $\hat y_5 = \hat y_1$ is true only when $Y$ is uniformly distributed, I.e. $\Pr(Y=y_1) = \Pr(Y=y_2) = \ldots = \Pr(Y=y_n)$.
