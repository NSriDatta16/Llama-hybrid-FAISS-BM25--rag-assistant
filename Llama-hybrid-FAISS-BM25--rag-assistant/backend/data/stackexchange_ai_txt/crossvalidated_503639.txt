How many neurons are in DALL-E?

OpenAI DALL-E is a version of GPT-3 with 12 billion parameters. Can one really estimate how many neurons are there given the number of parameters? If I understand it right, and parameters are just weights of connections between neurons, the amount or neurons should be significantly less, so it is not technically correct to compare, for example, the number of 12 billion parameters in DALL-E to the count of 86 billion neurons in human brain. So for the sake of better analogy with humans, the question is how many neurons are there in DALL-E?
