For the answer to both questions, check the slick.checkboxselectcolumn.js plugin. You can alter the column header with the grid.updateColumnHeader(myhtml) methods, where myhtml is some html fragment (including buttons) that you want to insert to the header. If you want to check the selected rows, just bind to the grid.onSelectedRowsChanged() event.
