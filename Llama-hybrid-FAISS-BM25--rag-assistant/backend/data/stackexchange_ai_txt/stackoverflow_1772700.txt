In the worst case scenario, all 1000 users use the app at the same time, so max # oc concurrent users is 1000. 1000 users * 10 minutes = 10000 total minutes One day has 24 hours * 60 minutes = 1440 minutes. Assume normal distribution, you would expect 10000 / 1440 = 6.9 users on average using your app concurrently. However, normal distribution is not a valid assumption since you probably won't expect a lot of users in the middle of a night.
