Repo within a repo means generally submodule . If you can make ProjectFolder a "parent repo" and each of your subdirectory a submodule, you would achieve the kind of organization you are after. Each subrepo could be changed independently one from another. Even if ProjectFolder is not a repository, nothing prevent you to make one in it ( git init . ), and you could add in it directly my_file and my_other_file , plus the reference to the other subdirectories declared as repo of their own.
