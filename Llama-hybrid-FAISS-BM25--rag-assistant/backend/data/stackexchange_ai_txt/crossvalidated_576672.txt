Under what circumstances is a m-class classification Neural Network equal to a base category logit model for nominal responses

Here is the setup for an m-class classification neural network. $$z_j=\sigma(\alpha_0j+\alpha_j^T x), (j=1,...,k)$$ $$t=\beta_0+\Sigma^k_{j=1}\beta_j z_j)=\beta_0+\beta^Tx, (l=1,...,m)$$ $$ y=f(x)=g(t), (l=1,...,m)$$ And here is the baseline category logit model for nominal responses: $$log (\pi_j(x)/ \pi_k(x))=x^T\beta, (j=1,...,k-1)$$ (some of the above are matrices but i can't bold them - i don't know how so any tips on that would be appreciated) I have a question that asks how the NN can be made equivalent? ie under what constraint and what discrepancy function. My thoughts are: remove the hidden layer set the discrepancy function to the negative of the log likelihood of the Bernoulli distribution (because this is needed in classification tasks) set the $\sigma(.)$ function to something that'll then sort everything out (but I don't know what). Any ideas gang?
