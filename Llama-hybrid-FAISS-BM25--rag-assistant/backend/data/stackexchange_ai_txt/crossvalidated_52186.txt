How are "scores" measured? If it's numeric with a small number of levels, you could try ordinal logistic regression. If it's a count (number of items correct) then try a zero-inflated count model (probably zero-inflated negative binomial). Hurdle models are also a possibility. If it's a 0 to 100 rating, the count models might still work, but a more general class of models is finite mixture models. If you are using SAS there is now (in SAS 9.3) PROC FMM which will allow quite a bit of flexibility. In R there is the package flexmix - but I haven't used it.
