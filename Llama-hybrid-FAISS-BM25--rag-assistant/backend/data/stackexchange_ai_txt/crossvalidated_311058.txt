A bit late but an alternative to David's suggestion would be to combine your daily data sets. Assuming the mean function is constant from one set of measurements to the next you could create a combined data set in which you store: the unique observed covariate values, $\vec x_{i}$; the number of times each unique combination of covariate values has occurred, $m_{i}$; the average value of the response, $\bar y_i$, for observations with these covariate values. The combined data can then be used as the training data in Gaussian Process Regression but where the known constant noise variance, $\sigma^2$, is divided by $m_i$. In other words, the sample average process is the same as the process you are interested in but where the noise variance is inversely proportional to the number of measurements at each unique covariate value. For inference regarding $\sigma^2$ you could also store the average squared response, $\bar{y^2}_i$.
