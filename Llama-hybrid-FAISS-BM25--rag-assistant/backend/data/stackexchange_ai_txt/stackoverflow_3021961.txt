TinyMCE normally only edits a HTML fragment (the bit between the body tags) rather than a full page. If however, you load the "fullpage" plugin ( http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Plugins/fullpage ) it will then edit the full page and also give the option to have a dialog box for editing properties like page title etc. Regards, Adrian Sutton http://tinymce.ephox.com
