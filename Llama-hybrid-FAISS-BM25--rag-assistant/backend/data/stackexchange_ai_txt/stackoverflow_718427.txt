If the text is already broken up into paragraphs with newlines, it could be as simple as text = Regex.Replace(text, ".+", " $0 "); This assumes there are no HTML special characters (as Thilo mentioned) or extra whitespace characters between paragraphs, like this: "text\n \nmore text" . You would want to deal with anything like that before you add the tags.
