Your options are limited, mostly by your choice of device. The HTC EVO's HDMI port will only play back apps via the built-in Gallery application (videos and still photos). You will need to use a "software projector" like Droid@Screen -- attach your EVO to a Android SDK-equipped notebook that is connected to a projector. Droid@Screen will display the EVO's screen on the notebook (and, from there, on the projector). However, the frame rate is limited to about 5-6 fps, due to limitations in the SDK tools that Droid@Screen leverages. Or, get your hands on an HTC Droid Incredible, which supports composite output to TVs of anything on the main display via a special cable. The Samsung Galaxy Tab also supports this for anything that does not involve a SurfaceView , based on my experimentation to date. Some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S also support this, at least to some extent. Or, use a webcam. Or, use an ELMO (basically a webcam designed for document or device projection).
