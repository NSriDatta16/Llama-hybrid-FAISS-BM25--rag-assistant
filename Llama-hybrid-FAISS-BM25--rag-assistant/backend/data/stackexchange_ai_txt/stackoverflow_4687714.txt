can't compile OpenCV 2.2 applications in eclipse

I have opencv installed on a win7 64 bit machine. I can't get eclipse to link to the appropriate libraries / includes in the project. All the documentation I can find is based on 2.1 or earlier and after 2.2 a lot of the structure was reorganized. I keep getting an error saying "C:\OpenCV2.2\include\opencv/highgui.h:47:39: fatal error: opencv2/highgui/highgui_c.h: No such file or directory"
