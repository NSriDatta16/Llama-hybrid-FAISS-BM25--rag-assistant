A neural network with no hidden layers and a softmax output layer is exactly logistic regression (possibly with more than 2 classes), when trained to minimize categorical cross-entropy (equivalently maximize the log-likelihood of a multinomial model). Your explanation is right on the money: a linear combination of inputs learns linear functions, and the softmax function yields a probability vector over classes.
