Neural networks is not the best way for text classification and for good improve you need to train it for a long time. If you just want use the NN read more about RNN and Word Embedding. RNN showed a good results for text classification tasks, but it hard to train for a complex tasks. Basically word Embedding is some input layers in network which transform your word (letter) in multi-dimensional space. The best thing that after long time of training words which have similar meaning would be together in a vector space. For example the can be words Cat, Dog, Mouse and so on. And in NN classification tasks will track all changes between similar words in sentence and put the in the same class. The best way to start with RNN is the original Elman paper Finding Structure in Time where he present his Elman RNN. There are a lot of simple examples and also you can find very simple word embeding for a small group of words. So this is of course a one of the simplest RNN but it will show you some basic ideas behind RNN.
