What's the fastest, pure Javascript, Graph visualization toolkit?

This question is about toolkits which draw graphs (those things composed of vertices and edges), not generic plots. The tool must be able to get a set of vertices and edges, calculate their layout, and display them either using the canvas tag, or SVG, that is be compatible with HTML5. Flash-based tools and java applets are out. to serve as unified benchmark, please measure and report how long it takes for the toolkit to layout and draw a Barabasi-Albert graph with 100 vertices and 5 edges per node. This python lybrary shows how to generate it and exports it to many formats: http://networkx.lanl.gov/tutorial/tutorial.html#graph-generators-and-graph-operations Please indicate browser and CPU.
