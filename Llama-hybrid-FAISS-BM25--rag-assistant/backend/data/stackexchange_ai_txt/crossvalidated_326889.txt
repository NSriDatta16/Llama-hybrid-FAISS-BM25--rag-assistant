The data should cluster with a large enough value of minpts (e.g., 10) and eps between 0.1 and 0.5 It shouldn't be difficult to get at least two clusters. Unfortunately, you did not share the parameters you tried. Default parameters are stupid for this algorithm. They cannot "usually" work (well, in your toy example even the default values should work!). Sklearn should remove the default values at minimum for epsilon. If in doubt, load the data into ELKI and use its OPTICS plot. And the heuristics suggested in the DBSCAN paper , as well as later work: Schubert, E., Sander, J., Ester, M., Kriegel, H. P., & Xu, X. (2017). DBSCAN Revisited, Revisited: Why and How You Should (Still) Use DBSCAN . ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS), 42(3), 19.
