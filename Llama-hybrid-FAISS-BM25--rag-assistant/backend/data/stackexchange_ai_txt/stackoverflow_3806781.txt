Drag Jquery draggable out of it's parent jquery dialog

I have a jquery dialog that is filled with draggable objects. The droppable target is outside of the dialog. When I initiate a drag, the droppable responds correctly (visual indications that it is a droppable target) and after a drop the correct events trigger so I can correctly handle the drop. The problem is that the dragged object stays visible only within the dialog, and does not "jump out". I already have draggables that drag from one scrollable div to another without problem, but from a dialog to the page containing the dialog it does not work. The dialog contents scroll in whatever direction the drag is going. My draggable arguments are as follows: var draggableArguments={ revert: 'invalid', helper:'clone', containment: 'DOM', zIndex: 999, addClasses: false } theObject.draggable(draggableArguments); Any suggestions so that my draggable objects can cross the dialog boundaries? Thanks.
