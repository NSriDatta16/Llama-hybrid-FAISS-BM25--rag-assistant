You shouldn't see the bin folder in the solution explorer, so that's not the problem. My suspicion is that NLog is included in a class library project that is required by some other project in the solution. For some reason, this class library project is not compiling and thus you have this library as well as NLog (which it brings along when it's compiled) not available. I'd make sure that you have NLog included as a reference directly in all projects which directly reference it or have a dependency that references it. Pay particular attention to any test projects, which won't typically get built when you build your production code using the right-click menu build action, but will when you build the entire solution.
