NLP for appartement ads

I want to analyse the Price situation for flat/appartements in my City. How can I process the Text from flat ads (like in newspapers or online with its typical structure!) to get Features like size or number of rooms? Is it simple to take a Package in R or Python (what is suitable?) and to Train the typical structure?
