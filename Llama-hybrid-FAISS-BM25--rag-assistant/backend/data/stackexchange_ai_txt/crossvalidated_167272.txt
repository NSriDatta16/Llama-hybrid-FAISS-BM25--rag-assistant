Is there a "smooth" version of a median of a data set?

So I'm thinking about how one would compare sizes of past civilizations in terms of population size and territory, and imagining that the distributions are basically continuous variables. I know there is a clear sense in which one can compute their average size over some defined time, namely if $f(t)$ is the population at time $t$ then $\frac{\int_a^bf(t)\, dt}{b-a}$ would be the average. But the average is influenced by skew so it'd be good to have a more robust statistic, if I'm using that word correctly. But how could you define a meaningful notion of "median population" for a continuous population function of time? If you just found the so-to-speak balancing point on the time-population graph it could easily be located at a very intuitively atypical population. I have in mind for example $-x(x-1)^2(x-2)$ from 0 to 2, which has a balancing point at 0 population. So is there a better definition for the median of such a function?
