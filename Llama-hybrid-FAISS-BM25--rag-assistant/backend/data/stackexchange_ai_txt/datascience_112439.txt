The aim of e-commerce is to maximize profit based on every customer's needs. Those needs are either known or unknown by the customer and are not necessarily the best overall value for money: Some customers just need basic quality for a cheap price, and others prefer the best quality for a huge price. As a consequence, advanced e-commerce adapts to every customer's needs and should propose frequently bought products without rating to the customers that don't care about quality. For instance, if a customer often buys apples in an important quantity with a bad rating, the e-commerce should propose to him cheap apples, instead of quality ones. This is easily detectable thanks to products frequently bought by customers with an average or a poor rating. In this case, instead of promoting the best-rated products, e-commerce should propose the most sold ones to have better chances to sell and increase customer satisfaction. To know if new products have a chance to be interesting, a similar value for money should be evaluated (i.e. cheap price and minimum quality), with adapted quality criteria that can be collected thanks to customer surveys in such a case (ex: by ordering quality criteria).
