Android: Delete app associated files from external storage on Uninstall?

It'd be convenient if an application I'm writing stored some files to external storage permanently (so they persist after the application has been exited[destroyed]), but on an uninstall I'd like to do the decent thing and have these files removed to free up the storage. Is there any way I can have these files removed on an uninstall? If there isn't (and I'm skeptical), then I'll have to create these files each time. I'm trying to save start-up time and also occupy required space by having them exist permanently. Note: I need to use external storage, so both internal storage or a DB would be inappropriate.
