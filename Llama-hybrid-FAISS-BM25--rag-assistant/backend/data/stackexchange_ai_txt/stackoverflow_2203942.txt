ANTLR - basic grammar including unexpected characters?

I've got a really simple ANTLR grammar that I'm trying to get working, but failing miserably at the moment. Would really appreciate some pointers on this... root : (keyword|ignore)*; keyword : KEYWORD; ignore : IGNORE; KEYWORD : ABBRV|WORD; fragment WORD : ALPHA+; fragment ALPHA : 'a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'; fragment ABBRV : WORD?('.'WORD); IGNORE : .{ Skip(); }; With the following test input: "some ASP.NET and .NET stuff. that work." I'm wanting a tree that is just a list of keyword nodes, "some", "ASP.NET", "and", ".NET", "stuff", "that", "work" At the moment I get "some", "ASP.NET", "and", ".NET", "stuff. that", (for some reason "." appears within the last keyword, and it misses "work" If I change the ABBRV clause to fragment ABBRV : ('.'WORD); then that works fine, but I get keyword (asp) and keyword (.net) - seperately - but I need them as a single token. Any help you can give would be much appreciated.
