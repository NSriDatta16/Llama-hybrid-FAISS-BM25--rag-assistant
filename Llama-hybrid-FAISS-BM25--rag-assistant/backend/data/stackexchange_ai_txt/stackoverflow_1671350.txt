Locking controls prevents them from being dragged to a new size or location on the design surface. However, you can still change the size or location of controls by means of the Properties window or in code. MSDN I guess it's a visible-to-designer-only property. I think you'd have to implement your own freeze mechanism - a little flag to toggle between Design and Use modes. Update: It seems that custom designer classes can add properties to controls based on whether they are in Design Mode or not. More details available here if you intend to take the VS architectural hammer path. In any case, worth 10 mins of reading time.
