You could either use AppleScript and attach a folder action to the /Volumes directory, or you could write a Launch Agent that watches that path. For the latter, you can refer to Tutorial: Backups with Launchd on MacResearch. The gist of it is that you create a plist configuration file to be interpreted by launchd ; then launchd will execute your script when the specified path has changed.
