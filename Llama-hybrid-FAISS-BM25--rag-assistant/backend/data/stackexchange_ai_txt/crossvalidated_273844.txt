I think you are overthinking quite a bit there. Feature selection, which is part of feature engineering, is usually helpful but some redundant features are not much harmful in early stage of a machine learning system. So best practice is that you generate all meaningful features first, then use them to select algorithms and tune models, after tuning the model you can trim the feature set or decide to use new features. The machine learning procedure is actually an iterating process, in which you do feature engineering, then try with some algorithms, then tune the models and go back until you are satisfied with the result.
