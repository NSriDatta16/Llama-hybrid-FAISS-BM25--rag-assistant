A Bayesian approach: Find the unique beta distribution $B$ that is induced by the experiments (and a prior, say, the Jeffreys prior), and then choose the smallest interval for which $B$'s density integrates to your desired "confidence". It's possible for there to be multiple solutions, and depending on your prior, the mean ratio might not be in your interval.
