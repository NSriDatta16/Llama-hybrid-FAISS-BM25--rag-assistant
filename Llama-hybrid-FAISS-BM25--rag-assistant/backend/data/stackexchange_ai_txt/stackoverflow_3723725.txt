src="/usr/local/agent/photo-name-here.jpg" HTTP address like: http://www.yourdomain.com/images/photo-name-here.jpg To accomplish that you will need to upload the foto to a localpath that is inside in your www root folder. If your webapp is installed in /home/apache/www/website/ you will upload your images to a folder like: /home/apache/www/website/images/ and then your HTTP address will be http://www.yourdomain.com/images/photo-name-here.jpg I got a little confuse with your two paths in /usr/ and C:\Tomcat I encourage you to put the upload localpath folder parametrized, so you will be only modifying the config file instead of every function or method that access to that local path.
