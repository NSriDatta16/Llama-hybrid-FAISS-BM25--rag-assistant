Not sure if it's the best way, but one way would be to write this into Connections.groovy class Connections { static SUPPORT2 = [ host:"host.name", port:"1521", db:"support2", username:"username", password:"password", dbType:"oracle" ] } Then, compile this with groovyc Connections.groovy to generate a class file Then, in your test script or on the groovysh prompt, you can do: import static Connections.* println SUPPORT2 To get the output: [host:host.name, port:1521, db:support2, username:username, password:password, dbType:oracle] If compiling the Connections.groovy class isn't good enough, I think you're going to be looking at loading the source into a Binding object by using one of the Groovy embedding techniques
