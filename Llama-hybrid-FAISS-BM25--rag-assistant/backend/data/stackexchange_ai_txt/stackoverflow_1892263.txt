As others have suggested you can use CreateThread or _beginthread or the threadpool APIs, the process and threads reference is best for Win32 threading, you can also use boost::thread which is very close to the C++0x std::thread standard. The other option if you're using Visual Studio is to take a look at the Parallel Pattern Library and Asynchronous Agents Library which are part of Microsoft's Concurrency Runtime (ConcRT) and are new in Visual Studio 2010. There are several how-to help topics which in the link that can help you get started here. The API's in ConcRT are 'task' APIs rather than thread APIs and let you work at a slightly higher level of abstraction than threads. i.e. parallel loops, parallel pipelines and groups of tasks. Like boost::thread, the APIs are primarily setup to work with functors rather than the CreateThread / ThreadPool style APIs though there are APIs which are similar syntactically to CreateThread (Concurrency::Scheduler::ScheduleTask for example). -Rick
