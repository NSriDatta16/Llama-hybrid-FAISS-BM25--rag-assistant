Bayesian statistics, what is the predictive distribution?

while doing some exercises I had a doubt about the last two points of this question: Let $X_1, ... X_{20} |\theta \stackrel{iid}{\sim} Bern(\theta)$ and suppose $\theta \stackrel{}{\sim} Beta(2,2)$, namely: $P[X_i = x | \theta] = \theta^x(1-\theta)^{1-x} \mathbb{1}_{0,1} (x)$ , and $g(\theta) = 6\theta(1-\theta)\mathbb{1}_{[0,1]}(\theta)$ (a) identify the posterior distribution of $\theta$, given $X_1=x_1, ... X_{20} = x_{20} $ (b) determine the predictive distribution of $X_{21}$, given the observed sample, namely $P[X_{21} = 1 | x_1,...x_{20}]$ (c) If the observed sample is such that $s_{20} = \sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i = 10$, determine $P[\theta I know that (a) is $f(\theta|x)$ but what is (b)? Is it just the marginal distribution of $X$? And also, in (c) why do I need the observed sample?
