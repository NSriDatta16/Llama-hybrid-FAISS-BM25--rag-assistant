You need to set figure properties. At the very beginning of the script, call figure('name','something else') Calling figure is a good thing, anyway, because without it, you always plot into the same window, and sometimes you may want to compare two windows side-by-side. Alternatively, you can store the figure's handle by calling figH = figure; so that you can later change the figure properties to your liking (the 'numberTitle' property setting eliminates the "figure X" text) set(figH,'Name','something else','NumberTitle','off') Have a look at the figure properties in the MATLAB documentation to see what else you can change if you want.
