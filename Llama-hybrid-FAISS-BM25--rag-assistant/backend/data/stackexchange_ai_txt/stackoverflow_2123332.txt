I spent two days struggling with all my productsRequest (for AppID) ended up in response.invalidProductIdentifiers list, instead of in response.products list. Apple definitely did an F grade job in dealing with their storekit. It is confusing, intertwined and complex. I did finally resolved it. One very important lesson I learned as indicated by few in the forums: It may take many hours for what you entered on the itunesconnect.apple.com to take affect. There are two parts: application name and AppID in your xcode and what you entered in itunesconnection, they have to match exactly (case sensitive). If you registered or modified your in-App AppleID (I also completed all my contracts and bank information as suggested by some that the purchase actions won't work without getting this part done), you may as well go to bed before testing it again because it really takes hours in my case to take affect. I was so frustrated battling with this issue before my 9 year old dragged me for bed time story then surprised to find the issue disappeared when I woke up. I found the suggestions by Eddy71 in http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/21035-problems-creating-test-user-app-purchase.html really helpful. Before resolving it I did everything I possibly could do in Eddy's check list and still got zero products, one of my fears was that whether without uploading the binary code to complete the application registration in itunesconnect was ok (no need to go live as taught in http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/coding/iphone-tutorial-%E2%80%93-in-app-purchases/ ). It is indeed ok. Make sure the "cleared for sale" is check and in the icon is green (you need an extra step to approve it after filling out the form). The other fear was that whether I can use developer provisional (not distribution provisional) in debug mode, it is also indeed ok. I hope this may help some of you. Good luck and have faith. It will work eventually.
