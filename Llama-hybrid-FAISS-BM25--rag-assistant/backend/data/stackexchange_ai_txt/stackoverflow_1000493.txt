To the excellent points that have already been made here, I would add that there is something about the high speed in which Flash projects are put together and the fact that most will not need to be maintained, that encourages people to just get things done as quickly as possible, and Singletons are a good way to make that happen, and you can use getInstance rather than passing around references, dependancy injection, etc. In practice, the fact is that you are only ever going to have one instance of many of your classes, even though in theory you might want more than one.
