How do I run the SWT Win32 extension example program locally?

I am looking into using the SWT Win32 Extension . I downloaded the extension jar files , and the example code . However, I couldn't find how to run the example. When I run the application with their jnlp file , it runs. When I looked into the file, I saw that they specify their main class as org.sf.feeling.swt.win32.extension.example.Example , but this class is not part of the sample code (although almost everything else is, including the "about" dialog. So what I'm looking for is either: A simple main class code to run the example - or - an explanation where I can get the original code for Example.java. UPDATE: Yay, it works. Thanks, @TrueSoft! But just to clear a few points: the source files to use come from org.sf.feeling.swt.win32.extension.zip, right under the src folder. That one includes the org.sf.feeling.swt.win32.extension.example.Example file I was missing in the first place the 4 jar files in that zip under the lib folder are required for compilation not one but 3 dll files (in that same lib folder) required for running dll file path should be specified as a VM argument: -Djava.library.path="{containing folder path}"
