Retrieve static data from database vs. file system

I am about to start a project using ASP.NET MVC. As part of the project, we need to display some data to the user. The data consists of an object graph that consists of 35 days per line. Each day can be a work day or off day. If it is a work day, there could be additional information associated with the work day. So basically, we have an html table with 35 columns and 4 rows for each of the lines (object graphs mentioned above). There can be up to approx 300 of these object graphs per user. The data inside these object graphs never change. For obvious performance reasons, we are only displaying 20 lines per page with an ajax call to retrieve successive pages on users request. So we have 20 of the above mentioned tables per page request. For performance reasons, we can generate the html for each of the above mentioned tables off line and we want to put them in a database or deploy to the web servers directory. My question is what is the performance implications for having the html in a database table and having a controller send the html back to the client on an ajax call vs. having the html fragments on a known location in the web server and client request the fragments via a http get request? Is it even possible for an ajax request to retrieve a file from the web server and change the inner html of some DOM object? Thanks in advance for your answers.
