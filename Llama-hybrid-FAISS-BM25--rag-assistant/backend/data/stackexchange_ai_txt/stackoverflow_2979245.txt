SQL Server 2008 - Document storage schema's

I'm looking to make a hopefully rather simple document storage system in sql 2008. We have a general idea of the elements we need, some meta data storage, filesteam, etc, but there are a few things we aren't quite sure of. Specifically, we would like to implement a fake folder structure, as well as some (flexible) permissions. Permissions could be on a group level or by individual users, and should we should be able to specify no access, read, read/write, on either file level or folder level. I'm not looking for someone to write this schema for me. But what I am hoping for is someone has resources that would cover these topics? Thanks ~Prescott
