CodeIgniter routing problem when using :any

I'm having issues with routing in code igniter. I've got the basics working though. $route['user/authorize'] = "user/asdf"; That dummy line is working fine. This isn't: $route['user/authorize?code=:any'] = "user/asdf"; and especially $route['user/authorize?code=:any'] = "user/authorize/$1"; I already changed the $config['permitted_uri_chars'] variable to an empty string (allow all). I've also tried using (:any) with brackets. I've assumed it was a typo in the manual, since (:num) uses brackets as well. To no effect. I'm out of ideas. Anyone? BTW the code variable is a Facebook access token and look something like this: 2.TOCElrzcR5MYz_J8O67hWA__.3600.1295467200-17044424246|4FPbz0N-pXqGWYR81PWGPTY06A4 Not sure if it's relevant, my .htacces file: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|css|images) RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /website/index.php/$1 [L]
