I think the problem may be that you are using EnitityConnection. Have you tried using OleDbConnection or OdbcDbConnection? OdbcDbConnection entityConnection = new OdbcDbConnection(entitiesConnectionString); Entities db = new Entities(entityConnection); DbCommand command = db.Connection.CreateCommand(); command.CommandText ="CREATE TABLE MyTable (Id int NOT NULL, OtherTable_Id nchar(40) REFERENCES OtherTable (Id) On Delete CASCADE On Update NO ACTION, SomeData nvarchar(1024) NOT NULL, Primary Key(Id) );"; command.ExecuteNonQuery(); There's also an ADO.Net provider for SqLite located here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlite-dotnet2/ I haven't used it, but it looks like you could use: SQLiteConnection cnn = new SQLiteConnection(entitiesConnectionString);
