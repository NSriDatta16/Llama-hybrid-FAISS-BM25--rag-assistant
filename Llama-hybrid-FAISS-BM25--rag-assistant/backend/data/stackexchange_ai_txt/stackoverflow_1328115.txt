If your code has Unit Tests (it does, right? ;-) then running NCover will allow you to identify methods that aren't being called from anywhere. If you haven't got any unit tests then it's a good excuse to use for starting to build them. In the general case, I'd suspect that code coverage tools are a good fit in most languages.
