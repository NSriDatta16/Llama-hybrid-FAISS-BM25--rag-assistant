It is true, getImageData() is far too inefficient. But there's a better start for specifically what you're trying to do: With canvas context's drawImage method, you can pass in an image but you can also pass in another canvas. So construct a temp canvas that will never be added to the page: // only exists in javascript, not on the page tempcanvas = document.createElement('canvas'); tempcanvas.height = (normal canvas width); tempcanvas.width = (normal canvas height); Then you can call tempcanvasContext.drawImage(normalCanvas, 0, 0) to take a snapshot of the current canvas right before the drop down menu is created. When the drop down menu disappears, you call normalcanvasContext.drawImage(tempcanvas, 0, 0) to draw it back. I hope this gives a good general idea, and it should be much faster than getImageData . You can make it even more efficient by only copying the exact portions of the screen you want to redraw.
