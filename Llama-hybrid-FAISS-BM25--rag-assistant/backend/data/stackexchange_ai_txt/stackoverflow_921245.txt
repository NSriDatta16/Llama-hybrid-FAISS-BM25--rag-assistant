If you have unlimited disk space with instant access time, you don't have to care about extents at all. You just make every table INITIAL 100T NEXT 100T MAXEXTENTS UNLIMITED PCTINCREASE 0 and forget about extents for next 300 years. The problems arise when your disk space is not unlimited or access time varies. Extents are intended to cope with data sparseness: when your data are fragmented, you will have your HDD head to jump from one place to another, which takes time. The ideal situation is having all your data for each table to reside in one extent, while having data for the table you join most often to reside in the next extent, so everything can be read sequentially. Note that access time also includes access time needed to figure out where you data resides. If your data are extremely sparse, extra lookups into the extent dictionaries are required. Nowadays, disk space is not what matters, while access time still matters. That's why Oracle created extent management. This is less efficient in term of space used than hand-crafted extent layout, but more efficient in terms of access time. So if your have enough disk space (i. e. your database will take less than half of the disk for 5 years), then just use automatic extents.
