(Major edit, Aug 5, 2022) The Minitab blog cited by the OP states why Minitab doesn't include $R^2$ with the results of nonlinear regression. They cite Spiess and Neumeyer (1) who evaluate various methods of choosing among two (or more) nonlinear models. Choosing the model that fits with the highest $R^2$ is far from the best method. Note that they compared models with different numbers of parameters, and $R^2$ doesn't "penalize" models with more parameters like AIC and BIC do. But there are other reasons to evaluate goodness-of-fit besides choosing among models. Sometimes the goal is to compare the fit of one set of data with the fit from prior runs of the same experiment (always fitting the same model). For this purpose, I think $R^2$ is useful. Say your lab repeats an experiment many times (with some variations of course) so know to always expect $R^2$ values between 0.6 and 0.8. If a new experiment has $R^2$ =0.2, you would be suspicious and look carefully to see if something went wrong with the methods or reagents used in that particular experiment. And if a new employee brings you results (using the same experimental system) with $R^2$ =0.95, you would be suspicious (too good to be true) and look carefully at how many "outliers" were removed, whether any data was made up, whether the analysis was conducted properly, .... Or maybe this new employee was a more careful experimenter and so obtained cleaner data, and your expectations for $R^2$ need to be updated. Bottom line. Whether or not $R^2$ is a useful way to assess goodness-of-fit in nonlinear regression depends on why you are assessing goodness-of-fit. More detail: $R^2$ and sum-of-squares-of-residuals really do measure goodness of fit. AIC, AICc, BIC (etc) assess the tradeoff of goodness-of-fit vs. number of parameters in the model (number of degrees of freedom really). When comparing models, these values are better (more likely to lead to the correct model) because they don't just measure goodness-of-fit but also take into account number of df (which depends on number of parameters fit by the model).
