No, two agents cannot both run on the same port as seperate applications for the reasons you assumed (except with a brittle packet sniffing hack, which we'll not go into). However, 2 agents can be accessed through the same port if there is some mechanism that handles the actual port and distributes requests based on MIB. For example the Windows SNMP service does this, allowing any number of SNMP agents to be added as "extensions" through the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters\ExtensionAgents) by writing them as DLLs and using the snmp.h headers in the platform SDK.
