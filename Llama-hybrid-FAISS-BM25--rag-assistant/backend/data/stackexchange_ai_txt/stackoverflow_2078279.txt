Disclosure: I am a former Amazon employee on the EC2 team, and I am now at a company that uses EC2 for a great deal of our processing needs. I will say this, to start: yes, I think EC2 is a good idea for backing a CPU-intensive process, and I have no idea what "change the way you think" is referring to there. The reason it is a good idea is because its the least-effort path to bringing up a server cluster. By "it" I am now referring to any kind of service that allows you to spin up / tear down machines at will, not specifically EC2. The downside is that it is more expensive than maintaining your own machines, though the cost covers the fact that it is less work and more flexible (for example, if you only need all that compute power for a day or a week). And generally speaking, if you have a web application that has to do CPU-intensive data processing and also needs to have a responsive interface, you certainly don't want to share those responsibilities on a single machine. Regarding persistent storage, depending on what you want to store, take a look at SimpleDB, S3 and EBS. SimpleDB is a key-value store, S3 holds file objects, and EBS is like the EC2 equivalent of hard drives - you get virtual storage that you can mount to / detach from EC2 instances. One of those will likely suit your needs, and all interface very nicely with EC2.
