Sleeping actors?

What's the best way to have an actor sleep? I have actors set up as agents which want to maintain different parts of a database (including getting data from external sources). For a number of reasons (including not overloading the database or communications and general load issues), I want the actors to sleep between each operation. I'm looking at something like 10 actor objects. The actors will run pretty much infinitely, as there will always be new data coming in, or sitting in a table waiting to be propagated to other parts of the database etc. The idea is for the database to be as complete as possible at any point in time. I could do this with an infinite loop, and a sleep at the end of each loop, but according to http://www.scala-lang.org/node/242 actors use a thread pool which is expanded whenever all threads are blocked. So I imagine a Thread.sleep in each actor would be a bad idea as would waste threads unnecessarily. I could perhaps have a central actor with its own loop that sends messages to subscribers on a clock (like async event clock observers)? Has anyone done anything similar or have any suggestions? Sorry for extra (perhaps superfluous) information. Cheers Joe
