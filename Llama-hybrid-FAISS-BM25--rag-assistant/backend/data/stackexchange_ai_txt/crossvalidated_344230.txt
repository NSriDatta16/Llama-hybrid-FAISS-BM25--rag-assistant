According to An introduction to conditional random fields 1 the marginal distribution in (4.20) is: $p(y_t|x) = \frac{1}{Z(x)} \alpha_t(y_t) \beta_t(y_t)$ (p. 318). The normalization function of X, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are identical to what you mention. We can of course rewrite this to: $p(y_t|x) = \frac{\alpha_t(y_t) \beta_t(y_t)}{Z(x)}$ Whether or not to include the $\theta$ and to use $X$ or $x$ seem like notation preferences. $y_t$ is a shorthand for $Y_t = y$ (p. 273), 2 $p_\theta(Y_t = y|X) = \frac{\alpha_t(Y_t = y) \beta_t(Y_t=y)}{Z_\theta(X)}$ I am not sure about $\alpha_t(y_t)$ being equal to $\alpha_t(y|X)$. Not sure of this is correct, but it might help someone. 1 : Sutton, C., & McCallum, A. (2012). An introduction to conditional random fields.
