What are core statistical model validation techniques?

I am self-taught machine-learning Data Science enthusiast. Over the course of self-learning, I have come across various validation techniques such as LOOCV, K-fold cross-validation, the bootstrap method and use them frequently. However, I came across an article where it was mentioned that core statisticians do not treat these above methods as their go-to validation techniques. I have been wondering ever since about the validation techniques that hard-core statisticians consider and/or use as model validation techniques. I am assuming that it would not just be hypothesis testing and p-values. Is there something fundamental I am missing about how core-statisticians work during the model validation process?
