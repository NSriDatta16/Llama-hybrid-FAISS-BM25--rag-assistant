Question about removal of duplicates in NLP, when specifically working on twitter data

Should we remove the duplicates before pre-processing or after pre-processing in NLP specifically when working on the twitter data? Actually main concern for me is that duplicates after pre-processing may have come from different tweets and so removing duplicates after pre-processing would be incorrect right? These are my thoughts, can confirm and give a clear insight about this?
