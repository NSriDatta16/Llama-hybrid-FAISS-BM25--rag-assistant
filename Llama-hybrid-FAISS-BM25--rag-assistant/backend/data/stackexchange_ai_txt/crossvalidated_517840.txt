Yes, all GBM implementations can use linear models as base learners. In the case of XGBoost we can them directly by setting the relevant booster type parameter as being as gblinear . LightGBM does not allow for this functionality (but it has an argument lineartree that is more akin to the Cubist (or M5) model where a tree is grown where the terminal leaves contain linear regression models). Please note that a GBM using only linear learners will essentially create a single linear regularised model. I have expanded a bit more on this matter in the thread: linear weak learners for Xgboost .
