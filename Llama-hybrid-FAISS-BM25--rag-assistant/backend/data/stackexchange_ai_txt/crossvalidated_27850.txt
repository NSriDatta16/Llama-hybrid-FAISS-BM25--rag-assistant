That it doesn't work does not come from the unbalanced size of the groups, but from the smallness of one of the groups. Downsampling the larger group is ok but does not help with overfitting. (BTW, there is an easy and elegant way to correct the predictions from the downsampled model, by adding Â±log(r) to the linear terms where r is the downsampling ratio.) If overfitting really is the problem, you need to either decrease the number of variables, or regularize the model.
