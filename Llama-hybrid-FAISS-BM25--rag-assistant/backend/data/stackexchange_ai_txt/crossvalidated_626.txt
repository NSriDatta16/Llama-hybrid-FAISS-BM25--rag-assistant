" Bayesian Core: A Practical Approach to Computational Bayesian Statistics " by Marin and Robert, Springer-Verlag (2007). "Why?": the author explain the why of the bayesian choice and the how very well. It's a practical book, but written by one of the finest bayesian thinkers alive. It's not exhaustive. Other books have that objective. It picks up a few topics that are relevant, useful, and illuminating the foundations. About "choice": if you really want to delve into bayesian foundation, Xi'an' "The Bayesian Choice" is clear, deep, essential.
