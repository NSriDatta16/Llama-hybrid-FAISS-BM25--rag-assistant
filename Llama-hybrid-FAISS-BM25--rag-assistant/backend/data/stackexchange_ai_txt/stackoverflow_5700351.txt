There isn't a simple/elegant way to do this. (Atleast not one that I have found in the last few years of looking). But depending on your scenario there might be specific workarounds that fit the bill. I've resorted to invoking COM Interop for word from an account that is different from the one that real users would login with. That has worked reliably so far. Would that do the trick for your scenario? If not do share your scenario. Also, what version of Word are you programming against?
