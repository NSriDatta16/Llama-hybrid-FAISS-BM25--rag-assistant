Showing a form from a webpage

I have a problem I am trying to solve in an elegant manner. I have a .net application that I have created. I am trying to get one of the forms to be shown from a webpage. This sounds strange I'll admit, so here is the backstory We have some large monitors at work, that show information on them. I have no control over how the information is displayed. Currently they are just using a browser and tabbing in the browser to show each different piece of information on the screen. Most of the info they show is just standard html stuff, text and images. Now along comes my winforms application. The part of the application I need to show is a graphical display. Everything on this display is drawn using GDI+, if that matters. I need to get this form into a format that I can show. Below is my own solution, but I am pretty sure this is not the best method, but it may be the only method I can use Create a console application. The application would do the following 1. Run as a service on a server 2. Create the display in memory, and save it to a bitmap every so ofter 3. Save the bitmap to a location on the network. 4. have an HTML file that links the image that can be shown in the browser I though about doing something with the clients, however the clients are not always up, so I could have periods where the image wouldnt be updated. I also was thinking about an ASP.net solution, but that would require me to learn ASP.net, and I am not quite ready to take that challenge
