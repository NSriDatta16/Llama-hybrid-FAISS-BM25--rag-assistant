How do I embed OpenOffice Calc into my own application?

I would like to provide spreadsheet capability in my Cocoa application. From what I've heard, OpenOffice does allow some level of embedding, but I'll be darned if I can find that information in their official SDK documentation. Can anyone here point me in the right direction?
