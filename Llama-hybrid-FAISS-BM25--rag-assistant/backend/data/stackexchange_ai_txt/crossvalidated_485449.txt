Are colored noises correlated / uncorrelated?

Let, $x$ be a random variable (r.v) that is white Gaussian, has a flat power spectrum. $y$ can be any colored noise. I think another term for uncorrelated is i.i.d (identically and independently distributed). Colored noises such as pink, brown, and red can be generated by filtering from a white Gaussian noise signal such as $x$ . Colored noises do not have a flat power spectrum. Question1 : If the power spectrum is not flat, then does that mean the colored noises are correlated? Reading through some texts I could understand that Brown noise has its random variable positively correlated to its previous random variable. Can this be generalized to other noises such as pink, blue, violet etc? and the other has a non flat spectrum so is colored, consider say brown color ( $y$ r.v). Since $x$ is white it is uncorrelated to itself and $y$ is correlated to itself (each random number for the red noise is positively correlated to the one preceding it). Question2 : The plot below is the time series which is the output of the sum of white Gaussian noise and pink noise. I don't know if pink noise is correlated or not. In general, does the addition of an uncorrelated r.v with a correlated r.v give an output that is correlated or uncorrelated? i.e., $z=x+y$ is $z$ correlated/uncorrelated? Please correct me if any information is wrong.
