I would discourage you from using density estimation in such a small data set. In non-parametric density estimation, the bias is on the same order as the variance, which generally is OK if and only if you have sufficient data that the variance is low. In this case both bias and variance will be high--very slight perturbations of your sample will yield wildly fluctuating estimates of your density, which on average are sufficiently incorrect as to be unuseful. Instead, you should use a wild bootstrap--that is, instead of using a multinomial weight (sampling with replacement), use a continuous weight, e.g. exp(1). Kosorok's free textbook contains useful information in the bootstrap chapter. This adjustment means that every data point will show up in each bootstrap resample. Each bootstrap resample will also have the same density as the original sample, as you requested.
