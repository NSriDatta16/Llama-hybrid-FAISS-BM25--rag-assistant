This is a common issue with random forest type algorithms as these algorithms cannot predict outside the training range. You may get better results with "bias corrected random forests" ( https://math.unm.edu/~luyan/research/biasrf.pdf ) or xgboost. You may also want to look up "bias-variance tradeoff" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff ). From your comment, I believe you are looking for "stacking". In your case, you are only stacking 1 model but I think it would still be considered stacking. stacking
