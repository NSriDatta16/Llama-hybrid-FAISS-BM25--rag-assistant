I do use regions to organize bigger constructs in a class, ie. a Dependency Property with callback and methods getting called by this, eg. you have a DP that takes an IEnumerable , and you want to use the weak event pattern to respond to INotifyCollectionChanged . This can take some code, and as I won't be touching it after coding it, I put it in a region. However, if you resort to regions to structure your logic, this is severe code smell and that's what the StyleCop rule in Mark's post is pointing hat.
