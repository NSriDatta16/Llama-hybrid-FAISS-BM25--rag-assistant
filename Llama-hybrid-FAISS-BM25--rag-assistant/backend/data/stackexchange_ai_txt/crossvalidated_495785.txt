Is there any direct relation in between accuracy and loss while performing text classification using neural network?

I am trying to perform text classification using the deep recurrent neural network. My network is incurring a huge loss of 94%, 80% and sometimes 100% with certain accuracy. It is surprising that with 64% validation accuracy the incurred loss is 96% . I want to comprehend that whether the incurred loss has direct relation to accuracy or accuracy is being calculated on correctly acquired data. I am using the categorical crossentroy function to estimate the loss. I am aware that the loss is a distance from true values and loss function basically calculate the error rate. But how this can be related to accuracy. For instance both the accuracy and loss is high than what does this depicts?
