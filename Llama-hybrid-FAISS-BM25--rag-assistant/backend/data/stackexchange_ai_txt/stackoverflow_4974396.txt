Consuming SOAP web services without the add reference approach

I am looking to make a service agent in C# from scratch. If the contracts/XSD are shareable via WSDL or dll. How do I go about writing a light weight service agent that can be configured to make calls to the SOAP webservice. When you do an add reference I feel too much code is generated behind my back.
