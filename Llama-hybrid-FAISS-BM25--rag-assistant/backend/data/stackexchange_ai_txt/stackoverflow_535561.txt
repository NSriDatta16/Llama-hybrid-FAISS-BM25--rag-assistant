As others have said, it means asking for a solution for a particular problem in the form of code. This is particularly relevant in the modern era where GUIs are everywhere and operating systems are big, sprawling things with innumerable functions. It may be incredibly easy to find out a particular piece of information or perform a certain action manually as a human but how to do so as code is less obvious and requires research. For example, consider how to delete a file and move it to the recycle bin in windows. Manually, this is trivial, select the file in explorer and hit delete. Or drag the file to the recycle bin. In code it's not remotely intuitive how you perform this action.
