Analyzing Videos using Deep Learning

Is there any work done on analyzing sequence of frames from a video using Deep Learning techniques? By "analyzing" I mean like memorizing them in order to classify or predict something (e.g. by taking into account first 10 frames of a video the model can make some sort of conclusion).
