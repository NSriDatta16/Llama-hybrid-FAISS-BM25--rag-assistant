This may not be the answer you want, but there are ways of working with C and Python other than embedding an interpreter inside a C application. Namely, why don't you do the opposite? Create C libraries for Python? You can control the general flow of your application in Python, which is much more comfortable, and call C code whenever you see fit. Again, I'm not really addressing your actual question, so feel free to ignore me.
