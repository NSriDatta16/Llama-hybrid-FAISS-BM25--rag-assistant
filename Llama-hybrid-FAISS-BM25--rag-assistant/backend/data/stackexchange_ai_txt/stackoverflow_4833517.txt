There's a similar related thread here about posting to facebook wall (unfortunately that was the case for the user him/herself only). I was thinking that you might be able to modify the graph path to use a friend's user_id instead of your own, in the fragment:- ...requestWithGraphPath:@"[user_id]/feed"... Need to first test it out to verify this, but this seems like an option to me.
