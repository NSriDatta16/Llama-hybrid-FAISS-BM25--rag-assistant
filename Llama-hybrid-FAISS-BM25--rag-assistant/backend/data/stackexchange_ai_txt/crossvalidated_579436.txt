This is a case of zero inflated lognormal distribution/ data generating process, which is a common model for lifetime value. Take a look at github.com/google/lifetime_value/blob/master/README.md . In EDA you can plot the proportion of zeros per group and the boxplots on log1p scale. For modeling use the algorithms above and the machines/days as features; then you can use bootstrap or bayesian inference to test differences among machines/days. For decision making it depends on your downstream use case if you care about mean spend, > 0 spend, or tail risk differences
