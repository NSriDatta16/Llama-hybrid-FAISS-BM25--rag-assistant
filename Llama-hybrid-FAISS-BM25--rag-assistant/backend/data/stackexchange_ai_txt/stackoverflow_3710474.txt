Jquery .load issue when dealing with Iframes?

I use successfully the following code to load asynchronously some content into a web page: jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery("#boxasync").load("box.php", "", function(responseText, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest) { if(textStatus == 'error') { jQuery('#boxasync').html('There was an error making the AJAX request'); }}); Now when trying to use the same code to load common sharebuttons (tweetme, facebook, digg) the webpage content is wiped out and the the browser is set in a sort of wait-state. I have discovered that those sharebuttons sport some code embedding iframes (and javascript too, I'm afraid). Could this be the reason jQuery .load is failing?
