I too have noticed this phenomenon with IE 8, though it seems to occur no matter what my element is floating above. I had an empty 4x4 px DIV that i was fading in and out on an interval (interval at 400ms, then element.fadeIn(100).fadeOut(500)) to debug element positioning and it was completely obliterating one of my cores! It took me a while to figure out why IE was constantly hitting 50% CPU while Chrome and Firefox barely broke a sweat -- I figured I had a rogue greedy loop somewhere until I scanned across my interval. Fire up IE and your task manager and head over to http://www.hv-designs.co.uk/tutorials/jquery/all.html for a little test. Sort your running processes by CPU desc and watch IE rise to the top on every test (20-40+% of my 1.2 GHz dual-core Intel SU2300 for the duration of the fade +/- a few hundred ms), even for the simple text paragraph! Running the same test in Firefox or Chrome doesn't even break 10% usage for me.
