While using requestFocusInWindow() is indeed encouraged over requestFocus() , it still produces the same problematic behavior on Macs (e.g., highlighting of full text field). One workaround I got to work was to explicitly set the cursor position after requesting focus: JTextField.requestFocusInWindow(); JTextField.setCaretPosition(JTextField.getDocument().getLength() - 1); Note the "-1" is necessary, otherwise it will continue to highlight the entire field. I'm curious to know if this solution is platform independent. Does this screw up the desired Linux or Windows behavior?
