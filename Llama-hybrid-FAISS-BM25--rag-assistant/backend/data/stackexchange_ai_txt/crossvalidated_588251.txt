Neural networks can be used to amortize the optimization part, effectively learning an adaptive solution given a corpus of data. The connection with VAEs is pretty easy to see here. So, in your notation, instead of optimizing for $Q*$ , you would learn an approximate posterior. See the Structured Inference Networks and Deep Markov Models presented in: R. G. Krishnan, U. Shalit, and D. Sontag, “Structured Inference Networks for Nonlinear State Space Models.” 31st AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI, 2017. doi: 10.48550/ARXIV.1609.09869.
