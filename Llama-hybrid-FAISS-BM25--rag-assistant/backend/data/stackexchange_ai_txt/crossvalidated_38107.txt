Sharing of a trained SVM model

I have been asked by a journal reviewer to provide the my final trained SVM models so that others can try to replicate or make use of the models. Is there an accepted way to do this? I was thinking of providing a spreadsheet detailing the selected features, the support vectors, the hyperplane bias and he support vector weights for each model. I am using Matlab's *SVM_train* function for this purpose. If have done this in the past for regression and regularized dircriminant models however this seems rather unwieldy for SVMs.
