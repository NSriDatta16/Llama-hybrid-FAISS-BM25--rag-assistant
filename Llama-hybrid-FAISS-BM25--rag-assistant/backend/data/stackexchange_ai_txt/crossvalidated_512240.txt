Staying at the image, in the square brackets of the first 3 columns there are the p-values for hypothesis referred on 3 parameters each. For example in position $[1,1]$ we have $[0.211067]$ that is about significance of DLCONS lag1 parameters, valid for the 3 dependent variable jointly. In the last column we have the test about the lag of order $i=1,2,3,4,5$ for all 3 predictors and all 3 dependent variables jointly, 9 parameters each. how can I find which lags are insignificant and how should I proceed to remove them from my model? Your question sound like: what's the best lag order for my VAR? From above table you do not have explicit answer, even if lag 5 probably can be removed. There are several alternatives about that, among them there are sequential hypothesis testing procedures and information criteria like BIC and AIC.
