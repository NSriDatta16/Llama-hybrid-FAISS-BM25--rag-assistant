Quadratic term of standardized predictor in logistic regression

A random intercept logistic regression is performed to assess the association between $Y$ : Disease (Yes/No) and Standardized Predictor( $X_1$ ) adjusting for control variables ( $X_2$ , $X_3$ ) based on clustered survey data. A $X_1^2$ term is considered in the model to explore the nonlinear relationship. Results: coef p-value intercept 0.240 I'm trying to interpret the $X_1$ and $X_1^2$ as follows: "A unit increase in $X_1$ (standardized) is associated with $exp(0.285)$ higher odds of disease when $X_1$ (standardized) is at its mean, each additional level of $X_1$ is associated with $exp(-0.084)$ decrease in the likelihood of disease." Is this appropriate? Does anybody have any thoughts on this? Thank you.
