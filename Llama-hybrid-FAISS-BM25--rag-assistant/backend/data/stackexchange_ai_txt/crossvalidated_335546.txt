There is no direct answer for this question, you have to try different things. From my experience, you can try different methods to boost your sensitivity: 1- If you have a lot of missing values you could try imputed methods such as KNN. 2- Try different Machine learning algorithms SUCH AS svm AND rf RATHER THAN LOGISTIC REGRESSION 3- If you have large number of features so I suggest you to try different features selection such as LASSO 4- Be careful to tune your parameters 5- If none of the above works, you can try Ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and stacking. Integrating different models will give you a good boost. Good luck
