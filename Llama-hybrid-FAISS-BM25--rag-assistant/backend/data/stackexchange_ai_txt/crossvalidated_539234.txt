1, Yes, the SAR models consider migration flows from all census blocks as important, but do so in a decaying fashion. One useful trick is to expand the "spatial filter matrix" in the reduced form of the SAR using Leontief expansion . Say, for starters, we have the SAR: $$\begin{align} y &= \rho \mathbf{W}y + \mathbf{X}\beta + \epsilon \\ \epsilon &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2) \end{align}$$ Then, we can turn it into the reduced form to isolate $y$ on the left hand side: $$\begin{align} y - \rho \mathbf{W}y &= \mathbf{X}\beta + \epsilon \\ (\mathbf{I} - \rho \mathbf{W})y &= X\beta + \epsilon \\ y &= (\mathbf{I} - \rho \mathbf{W})^{-1}(X\beta + \epsilon) \end{align} $$ The Leontief expansion works by taking matrices of the form $(I-A)^{-1}$ and transforming them into an infinite series: $$ (I - \rho \mathbf{W})^{-1} = (I + \rho \mathbf{W} + \rho^2\mathbf{W}^2 + \rho^3\mathbf{W}^3 + \dots )$$ So, this means that you can also spell the SAR model: $$ y = \sum_k^\infty \rho^k\mathbf{W}^k (\mathbf{X}\beta + \epsilon) $$ Which mirrors how back-substitution in a time series model results in an infinite sum. For the very typical "standard" case of a row-standardised spatial weights matrix, $\mathbf{W}^k$ represents a measure of the "kth" order of spatial weight, or the observations that you can visit using $k$ steps from each site. For a simple lattice/grid setup, the $i$ th row of $\mathbf{W}^2$ represents the cells you can reach in exactly two steps from $i$ . The usual term to describe this kind of relationship is that these are the "higher order" neighbours of observation $i$ . So, these "higher order" terms are what measure the "global" structure of the model. The typical $\rho$ is somewhere between $-1$ and $1$ , so these "higher order" terms get quite small quite quickly. But, when dependence is large, they decay more slowly. 2, Yes, the spillovers from the SAR do not arise in a CAR model, which can be stated as a typical multivariate normal model: $$\begin{align} y &= \mathbf{X}\beta + \epsilon \\ \epsilon &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, (\mathbf{I}-\delta\mathbf{W})\sigma^2) \end{align}$$ 3, I can't speak to why demographers and econometricians generally use the SAR model over other forms, other than the fact that it's the "true" analogue to the autoregressive model common in time series. They both have very "surprising" behaviours in terms of the implied correlations (from Wall (2006) , which I find to be very convincing). 4, I hope I've answered by way of the explanation in 1.
