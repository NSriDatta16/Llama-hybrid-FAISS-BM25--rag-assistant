Embedding multiple user controls into a page?

I've embedded multiple user controls into the same page. The user controls typically have 2 different views, an edit/default view and a completed view. When the user completes an edit then I switch the MultiView to the completed state. This pattern works okay in pages. The problem is when I go back to the master view/page then the user brings back the control, the view is still in the completed state. What are some simple methods for resetting/correcting the multiview state? I could have a Reset() function on every control but it feels like I may be able to avoid that. Update: This page is designed to show an account/profile view and it has the following parts: ...read only view etc.. And then each of those views has a user control. Inside the user control, we have something like this I've found the following problems with this design: When the user completes an action of user control such as changing an email. The view stays in the finished state even when they go back to it a second time. When the user goes back to the original form the data is stale. This design really screws with the postback mechanism. If I don't use !IsPostBack on the main form for databding then my dropdownlist on the sub forms will not work. However, once I add the !isPostBack on the main form then the data becomes stale. I can add a "reset" flag to every user control and add something like this if ((!IsPostback) || (reset) ) As well as resetting the view. In the other scenario, I can add an event handler to load the reload/bind the data when the user clicks "back", i.e where I change the form back.
