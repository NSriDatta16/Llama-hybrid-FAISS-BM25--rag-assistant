I just thought of a possible alternative: Your interface (or possibly abstract methods) could specify methods (e.g.) equals2() and hashCode2() . These would be mandatory to implement to any implementor of the interface, of course. You could thus force your library consumers to code something . And your library classes, that work with implementors of your interface, could then use these "custom" functions as replacements or implementations of the "real" functions, and to the re-definition themselves. It's not a very elegant concept, and not very fleshed out, but you may be able to make something of it.
