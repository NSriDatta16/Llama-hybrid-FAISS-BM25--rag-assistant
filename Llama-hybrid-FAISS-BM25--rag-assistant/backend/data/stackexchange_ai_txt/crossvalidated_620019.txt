[Survival Analysis]: Handling Data Acquired after an Event Occurs

I am conducting a survival analysis to examine the impact of a set of covariates X on the time-to-event Y. However, I have collected data on participants even after the event has occurred, where the event does not necessarily indicate death. I am unsure whether there is any valuable information in the observations obtained after the event. If there is, how should I handle this type of data in my survival analysis? Are there alternative models that may be more suitable than the Cox proportional hazard model? In other words, should I consider approaches other than survival analysis? It is important to note that the event is permanent, and using a (mixed effects) logistic regression does not account for this, making it unsuitable for my analysis. I have attempted to search the literature, but I am uncertain which keywords will lead me to relevant papers. Any assistance in identifying appropriate keywords would be greatly appreciated.
