Measuring level of uncorrelation from correlation matrix?

This question might not be completely well defined mathematically, but if so I am hoping that people can help point me in the right direction, since this is not a part of mathematics I have ever had much experience with. Suppose I have a correlation matrix $C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & c_{12} & c_{13} \\ c_{21} & 1 & c_{23} \\ c_{31} & c_{32} & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ associated with 3 variables. I would like to get a measure of the level of "independence" or uncorrelatedness of each of these variables so essentially the part of each variable that is not correlated to any of the other variables. I am not entirely sure such a measure is even well defined? Assuming that there is some measure of independence, how would I measure it? and is it derivable from the correlation matrix? or do I need additional information, like the generating time series? I have been looking for any litterature on this, but have yet to find anything to get started with.
