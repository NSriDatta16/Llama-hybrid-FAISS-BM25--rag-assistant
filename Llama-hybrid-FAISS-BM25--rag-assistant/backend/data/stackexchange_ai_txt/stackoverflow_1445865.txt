Convert C# DateTime object to libpcap capture file timestamp

I am stuck in converting a DateTime object to a timestamp for the libpcap capture file format (is also used by wireshark, file format definitiom ) in C#. The timestamp I can't manage to convert my object to is the Timestamp in the packet (record) header (guint32 ts_sec and guint32 ts_usec).
