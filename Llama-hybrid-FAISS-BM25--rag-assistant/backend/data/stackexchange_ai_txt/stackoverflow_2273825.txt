What .NET time series libraries are there?

I am looking for a .NET library for time series work. It can be either free or commercial. My basic requirements are the following: Handle time series in varying frequencies (daily, business daily, week ending Friday, monthly, quarterly, annual, etc). Convert between different calendar frequencies, going from both high to low frequency and low to high frequency. Supporting time series transformations like moving averages, annualized percent changes, etc. Allowing time series to be combined together; for instance time series A = B+sqrt(C)
