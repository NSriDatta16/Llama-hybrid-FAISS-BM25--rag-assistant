Drag-Drop a Control between multiple canvas

Greetings, I need to be able to drag and drop items that's contained in a Border. So far I managed to find the border on the MouseLeftButtonDown event. Now I wish for the item to move with the mouse when I have my mousebutton down. I assume this can be done by simple settinga bool "dragging" to true when the item is clicked and then handle the moving in the MouseMove event. But I can't seem to figure out how to move the item. Border doesn't have a property as Position or Location. Is there any way I can achieve what I want? Perhaps there are controls for it that I dont know of? Bit more background information: I'm showing multiple columns (each column is a new canvas) with rows in it. Each row and canvas represent a cell. In a some cells I have a border containing a textblock with information. Upon clicking this border I wish for it to be bound to my mouse and move where I move my mouse.
