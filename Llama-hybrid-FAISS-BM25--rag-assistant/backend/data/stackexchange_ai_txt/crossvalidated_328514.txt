Time series - autocorrelation

I have the following time series and need to show that the ACF is zero except at lag one. $$X_t=\frac{0.8\epsilon_{t-1}^2}{1+\epsilon_{t-1}^2}+ \epsilon_t, \text{ and that } \{ \epsilon_t\} \sim_{i.i.d} N(0,\sigma^2)$$ My guess is that I need to calculate the covariance for the lags and show they don't share the same components and such are not correlated since I have i.i.d. variables. However I'm not reaching the desired result. Any insights?
