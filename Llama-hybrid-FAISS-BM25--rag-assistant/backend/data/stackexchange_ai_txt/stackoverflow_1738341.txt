Every C++ member function has an implicit, hidden, first parameter, this . So the method double cls_lasvm::kernel(int i, int j, void* kparam) is really: double cls_lasvm::kernel(cls_lasvm* this, int i, int j, void* kparam) , and it is inappropriate/impossible to use it as a function-pointer parameter. To make progress, convert your method to be a static-member-method. That will remove the this pointer. You may still have other issues to overcome, but that is a good start.
