What's the point of Granger causality if we can just fit a VAR model?

I've read in multiple places that it's a good idea to run a Granger causality test before fitting a VAR model to a set of time series. Suppose I'm interesting in determining which of the $n$ time series $X_{1t}, X_{2t}, \ldots, X_{nt}$ are "Granger causes" of time series $X_{0t}$ , then I can run a Granger causality test $n$ on the pairs $(X_{1t}, X_{0t}), (X_{2t}, X_{0t}), \ldots, (X_{nt}, X_{0t})$ and then throw out the series that are not causes. I can the fit a VAR model on the remaining series. But can't I just fit a VAR model to all $n+1$ series, and then discard those series for which all lags have insignificant p-values (relative to $X_{0t}$ ) ? What is typically done in practice when we have many time series and are interested in modelling one in particular?
