If you think of your objects as heavy rocks, that could be a good thing. Since php isn't very oop by nature (except some default extensions), there's procedural functions enough, about 6000, isn't it? I'd encourage you to continue with OOP. Hundreds of classes seems overdone though. For starters, put all you need in one object, and split to subclasses when appropriate.
