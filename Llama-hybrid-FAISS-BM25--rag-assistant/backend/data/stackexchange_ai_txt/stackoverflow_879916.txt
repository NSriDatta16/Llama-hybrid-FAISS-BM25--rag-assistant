Semantically: After the JOIN. But in this case, there is no difference in timing, because it's on the LEFT side of the JOIN. As you already have it, "only rows in A from "Yesterday" are joined to B". The optimizer is free to reorganize its order of operations depending on the equivalences in the relational algebra. This returns only A.date="Yesterday" and joins B where it can find a match on foo: SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.foo=B.foo WHERE A.date="Yesterday" This returns all A regardless of any criteria and joins B where A.date="Yesterday" AND it finds a match on foo: SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.foo=B.foo AND A.date="Yesterday"
