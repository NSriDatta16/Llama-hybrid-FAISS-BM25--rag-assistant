To me this sounds like a classification problem. There are a multitude of methods that can be used to classify variables into categories, and yes, logistic regression is one of them (given that you only have two categories that you want to classify something into). As for recommendations of literature, I very much recommend The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman. It's a great book, well worth reading. It's also available for download from Hastie's homepage: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/ References Friedman, J., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2011).
