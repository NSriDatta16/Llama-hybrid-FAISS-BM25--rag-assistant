These best practices are still really being cleared up. With your setup here's how I would do the server maintenance. Backups Find a non-primary in each replica set. Perform an fsync & lock . Copy, tar, backup. Unlock the DB. You should be able to do this successfully on a replica set. If you're really worried, you can do fsync & lock and then a shutdown. Compressions You probably want to compress data at some point. The easiest way to do this is again to do an fsync & lock and then do a db.repairDatabase(). The repair command will basically do a "defrag / compression" for you. As above, this can also be down with a shutdown. Code pushes Ideally, there is very little that needs to be consistent with regards to a code push. At the worst, you'll need to manage index creation / deletion. But this really needs to be managed separately as you don't want devs just randomly adding indexes on a production DB. Monitoring This is a way more complex topic, but you'll probably want to watch for things like "who's master", "what the write throughput on each node", "how much RAM am I using", "how much data is shifting between nodes". There are limited tools for doing this right now, so expect to roll your own.
