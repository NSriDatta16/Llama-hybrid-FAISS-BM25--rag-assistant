Condense a time series into a given number of points

What is the term for condensing a time series consisting of an arbitrary number of points (X), into one consisting of K points? Google searches for "condensing" or "reducing array" weren't fruitful, so I'm probably using the wrong term. [1, 3, 7, 9] -> [2, 8] // X=4, K=2 Also, how should this be done for non-trivial cases, e.g. when X is not a multiple of K (condensing 150 points into 100 points) or when there are gaps in the timeline?
