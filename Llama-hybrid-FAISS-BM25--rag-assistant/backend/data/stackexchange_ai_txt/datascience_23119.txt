Orange3 summarizing data, grouping data values

Is there a simple way in orange3 (not writing a Python script) to summarize data and group similar data values? For example, instead of plotting a scatter with lots of data points, I would like to plot just the average y value at every x value. In pandas, this is easily done with groupby().mean(). Is there a similar widget/feature I'm overlooking in orange?
