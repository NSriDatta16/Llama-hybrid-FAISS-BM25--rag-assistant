I don't know of anything like console for asp.net. But I do know of an alternative to what you're doing because I used to do similar things all the time. You don't have to upload the newly compiled solution to the server. All you have to do is change your connection string from development to production . Then just run it locally and your production database will be updated. To organize things a little better I had an admin page where I could do various database management tasks. I'd just create button links on the page for whatever it was I needed to do and all the actions were placed in an admin controller. I set the permissions on that controller so that only an admin could access the actions. On a side note, why are you going from rails to asp.net MVC? I did asp.net for a few years and rails for a few months now. I find I prefer rails these days a lot more. Edit: (if you need something quick and dirty) add a button on one of your existing pages linked to a controller action point your connection string to the production database run locally and click the button Afterwards, remove or comment out the code you just ran.
