Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate time series data

I see that there are cases of GANs used with Time Series. The paper Recurrent (conditional) generative adversarial networks for generating real-valued time series data says that they generated synthetic data, just what I need. I am curious to know if I can create a time series of 1000 points from time series of 1000 points Is there a requirement for points in the time series (delta between nearest points) for the GAN to be effective?
