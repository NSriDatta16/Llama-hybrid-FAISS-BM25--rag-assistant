You shouldn't model only the users that exceed 30 minutes. What you are modelling is how duration varies with your predictor variables for only that group . Instead, you could try modelling the problem as a logistic regression by treating duration > 30 as a binary variable. If you haven't covered logistic regression yet, just model all the data and consider what values of (significant) predictors would lead to users taking trips of duration greater than 30 minutes. With the model on the full data, you could also try backwards elimination to remove unneeded predictor variables. i.e. step(dur, direction = "backward", trace=FALSE ) . Additionally, your model R2 is very low. This suggests your model is no better than a mean model (i.e. almost all of the observed variation is not explained by variation in your predictors). The model output doesn't show Sunday as this is the 'base' effect (or reference level) and all the other effects are relative to this. This is the default behaviour in R for regression with categorical predictors. The full answer for this is quite technical and can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41032858/lm-summary-not-display-all-factor-levels Edit: apparently there are various problems with backwards selection. Considering this is entry level modelling and didactic in nature, my view is that it's appropriate. If you have been taught different variable selection techniques, feel free to use those.
