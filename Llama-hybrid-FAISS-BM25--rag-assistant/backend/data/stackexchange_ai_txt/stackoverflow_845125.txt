Just wanted to add a couple of things: CB's code doesn't seem very elegant (+ for the most part does not use the powerful Joomla 1.5 MVC architecture. There are a couple of new social network extensions out there. JomSocial was mentioned, but there's also jCoummnity (though the code is protected, so you can't look into it's inner workings) and JooCommunity which is open source and free.
