Well, I sort of fall into the same boat... if I can put in one * html #id instead of doing a whole conditional comment and specific ie6 stylesheet I'll do it. It may not be so elegant, but it saves a whole new CSS file to maintan. However, If I end up having lots of * html and * prefixes, or the ultra long IE7 hack (which I can't recall right now), I'll prefer a conditional stylesheet. I don't really see * html as a true hack... it's a valid selector (as far as I know), it just shouldn't work because there is no parent element to HTML (except for some reason in IE6). However, prefixing a property with an underscore or specific character does make the selector property invalid. Another one I don't mind is using display: inline for IE6 to fix the double margin when an element is floated. I use this in my main CSS as it doesn't affect other browsers (only block level elements can be floated), and it's a hell of a lot easier to maintain. I generally leave a little note, something like #my-div { diplay: inline; /* ie6 */ float: left; margin-left: 20px; } So I'd say if it's a few hacks, I leave it in my main CSS. If it becomes unwieldy (and it often doesn't as I know the common ways that IE fail), I'll create an extra stylesheet and use conditional comments.
