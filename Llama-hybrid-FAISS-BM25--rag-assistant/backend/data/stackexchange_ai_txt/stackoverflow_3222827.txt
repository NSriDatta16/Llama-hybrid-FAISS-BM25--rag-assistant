Yes, we get this a lot. Usualy it is related to old hardware (eg. integrated graphics card), but it happens on new as well (eg. quadro NVS 295 with the latest drivers). Sometimes the amount of ghosting depends on the speed the windows is dragged with. Then again, we can't reproduce it on quadro 450 or 290 so it seems it's a driver issue. There are 2 ways to solve it - set AllowTransparency to false or disable HW acceleration. This being said, this is one of the smaller problems we had with WPF in multi-monitor environments...
