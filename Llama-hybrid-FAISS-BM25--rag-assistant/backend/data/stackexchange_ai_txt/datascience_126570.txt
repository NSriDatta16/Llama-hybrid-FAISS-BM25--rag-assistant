Heavy right skewed target

I scrapped Data science job postings of almost 1000 jobs for salary prediction. I wanted to bin the salary column and build a classification model from the job descriptions. But the (salary)target is heavily skewed right. What should I do here? Should I do log transform and build a regression model? What is the right way to bin the target?
