Embeddings model: out of sample prediction with Keras for Collaborative Filtering

I have been trying to play with an example on Collaborative Filtering for Movie Recommendations (keras.io) , which builds embedding layers for movies and users. Now, in a regular pre-trained word- and doc-embeddings we can use them to get embedding vectors for new text inputs. However, I could not find how to do that in Keras for an out-of-sample user (vector of movie ratings for the same movies), as model.predict methods expect the input to be a combination of user id and movie id. Is this true or and if it is, are there any workarounds/methods to deal with out-of-sample prediction, if I want to use an embedding model?
