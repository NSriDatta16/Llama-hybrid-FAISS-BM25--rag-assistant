Magento Quick Search - Search on short description attribute not working

I have developed a site with magento. I have enabled “Short Description” attribute for both quick search and Advance search. Now, when i search any word for example “Wool” which in product’s short description, no result comes. Is quick search have some issue with “Short Description”. I want this on since every product has short description and this search is not working at all. Jeff
