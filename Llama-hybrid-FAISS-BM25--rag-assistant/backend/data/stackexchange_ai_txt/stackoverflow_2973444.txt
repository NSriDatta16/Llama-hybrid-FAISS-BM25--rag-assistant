I'm not a fan of using the right mouse button on web pages. However, if you really want to do it, you could trap the right mouse button as described here . You could block the right mouse button (in other words return false in your event handler) conditionally if the mouse is over your grid cells. Regarding your bonus question: jquery ui has drag & drop functionality . It's probably easier to use that than rolling your own.
