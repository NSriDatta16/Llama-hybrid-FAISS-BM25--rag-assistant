This is how I interpret the exercise (- it may be completely wrong!) The distribution of a Poisson with lambda = 1.75 is far from a Gaussian: set.seed(1234) n However, if you average 30 Poissons, each with lambda = 1.75, the distribution is quite close to a normal one: x30 From this simulation, the probability of x > 1.5 is: sum((rowMeans(x30) > 1.5)) / n # 0.827 Which is not far from the probability of x > 1.5 in a normal distribution with mean and sd of x30: 1 - pnorm(1.5, mean= mean(rowMeans(x30)), sd= sd(rowMeans(x30))) # 0.842 (Does it make sense...?)
