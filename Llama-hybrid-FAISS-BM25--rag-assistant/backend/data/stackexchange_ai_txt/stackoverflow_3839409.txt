something like this may work: list.GroupBy (l => l).Where (l => l.Count () > 1).SelectMany (l => l).Distinct(); EDIT: the above code doesn't get the result the OP wanted. Here is an edited version that is taking inspiration from Ani's elegant solution below: :) list.GroupBy(l => l).Select(g=>g.Skip(1)).SelectMany (l => l);
