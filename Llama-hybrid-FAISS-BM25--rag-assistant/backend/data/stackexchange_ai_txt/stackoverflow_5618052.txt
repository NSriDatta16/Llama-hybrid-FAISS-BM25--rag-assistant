same with me. main reason we use Infragistics WPF libraries for Charting and DataGrid. I think the 3rd party library that you choose depends on if you can afford it :) and also how good is their support. have been using Infragistics for some time now, been OK (not great support wise). And it def improved productivity as you dont have mess around with boilerplate code
