It's a strange question. Numbers aren't random. As a time series of base 10 digits, $\pi$ is completely fixed. If you are talking about randomly selecting an index for the time series, and picking that number, sure it's random. But so is the boring, rational number $0.1212121212\ldots$ . In both cases, the "randomness" comes from picking things at random, like drawing names from a hat. If what you're talking about is more nuanced, as in "If I sequentially reveal a possibly random sequence of numbers, could you tell me if it's a fixed subset from $\pi$ ? And where did it come from?". Well first, though $\pi$ is not repeating, different random sequences will at least locally align for a small run. That's a number theory result, not a statistical one. As soon as you break, you have to scan on to the next instance of alignment. Computationally it's not tractable to align any random sequence because $\pi$ could match up to the $2^{2^{2^2}}+1$ -th place. Heck even if the sequence did align with $\pi$ somewhere, doesn't mean it's not random. For instance, I could choose 3 at random, doesn't mean it's the first digit of $\pi$ .
