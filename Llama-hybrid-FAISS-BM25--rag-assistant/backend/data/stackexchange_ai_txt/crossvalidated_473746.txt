In the general case: you can't The ROC curve shows how sensitivity and specificity varies at every possible threshold . Binary predictions, where predictions have been thresholded already, or a contingency table, have lost information about the other thresholds. Therefore you can't calculate the ROC curve from this summarized data. But my classifier is binary, so I have one single threshold Binary classifiers aren't really binary. Even though they may expose only a final binary decision, all the classifiers I know rely on some quantitative estimate under the hood. A binary decision tree? Try to build a regression tree. A classifier SVM? Do a support vector regression. Logistic regression? Get access to the raw probabilities. Neural network? Use the numeric output of the last layer instead. This will give you more freedom to choose the optimal threshold to get to the best possible classification for your needs. But I really want to You really shouldn't. ROC curves with few thresholds significantly underestimate the true area under the curve (1). A ROC curve with a single point is a worst-case scenario, and any comparison with a continuous classifier will be inaccurate and misleading. Just give me the answer! Ok, ok, you win. The easiest is to use one of the many libraries that provide ROC analysis. Here is an example with pROC (that I am authoring), but there are many others: library(pROC) plot(roc(df $actual, df$ predicted)) If you want to do it manually, you can assume you have a single threshold to calculate: tn $result == "True Negative") tp result == "True Positive") fn $result == "False Negative") fp result == "False Positive") specificity And then we can add "pseudo" thresholds at -Inf and +Inf, and plot: sensitivities To conclude You can technically plot a ROC curve for a binary classifier from the confusion matrix. But just in case I wasn't clear, let me repeat one last time: DON'T DO IT!
