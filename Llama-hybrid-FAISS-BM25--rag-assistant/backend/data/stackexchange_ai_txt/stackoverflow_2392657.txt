Need to write online circuit builder: please compare/contrast YUI3, GWT, and jQuery... what would YOU use?

I need to write a sophisticated website that does AJax, drag and drop, component re-sizing, with a tree view of all components. If this is controversial, please just close it, but could someone please recommend a good JavaScript Application Framework to use? I know YUI3 is still under development so I'd have to use the tree view from YUI2. I'm torn because it appears that YUI3 looks up and coming, jQuery is most popular, and GWT looks to be the fastest... and afterall, Google uses it for some amazing things. Any input?
