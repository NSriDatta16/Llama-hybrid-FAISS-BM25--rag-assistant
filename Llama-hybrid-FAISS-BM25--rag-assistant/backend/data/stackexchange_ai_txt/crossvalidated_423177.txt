Inverse Hyperbolic Sine Transformation (IHS) for dependent variable - How to back transform predictions?

I am doing IHS transformation for the dependent variable (count data, mostly 0 and small counts) while training a non-parametric tree-based machine learning model. I've seen posts saying it will induce bias if the predictions are back transformed using For example, this post . Instead of transforming using the above formula, the author proposed to multiply the formula by exp(s^2 /2) to adjust for biases. I want to back transform my predictions to the original scale and calculate the RMSE and then compare the performance of models with and without transformation. Is it a feasible comparison? In addition, the back transformed predictions will then be used further as an input to another model. There are also several questions which I cannot answer. Firstly, I do understand that back transforming without bias adjustment will bring some problems. The same thing applies to log transformation as well. The only thing I don't understand is why kagglers only use exp(pred) to transform the predictions to the normal scale? Will that not induce bias? Secondly, I am not sure if I have understood the above post correctly. My understanding is that s is the standard deviation of a list of predictions on the IHS scale before back transformation. Please correct me if I am wrong. Thirdly, does this formula also apply to prediction results from a non-linear regression model?
