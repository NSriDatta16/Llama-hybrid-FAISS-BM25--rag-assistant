Consistent outdent of first letter with CSS?

I'm trying to implement an outdent of the first letter of the first paragraph of the body text. Where I'm stuck is in getting consistent spacing between the first letter and the rest of the paragraph. For example, there is a huge difference in spacing between a "W" and an "I" Anyone have any ideas about how to mitigate the differences? I'd prefer a pure CSS solution, but will resort to JavaScript if need be. PS : I don't necessarily need compatibility in IE or Opera
