If you only need to match individual paragraphs against the fulltext query (as opposed to filters etc.), you could also do this using highlighting -- split up the paragraphs, prefix each one with its paragraph number, and then index the paragraphs as multiple values in a single field in a single document. At search time, you'd do a highlight on the field with a full match (e.g. fragment size of -1) and no decoration of the highlight; so what you'd get back is the paragraph that matched the fulltext query, prefixed by its paragraph number (which you'd probably want to then pull back out). Not sure if this fits your use case exactly but might be an interesting approach to try -- I do something similar to identify photos whose caption matches the fulltext query to display next to article search results.
