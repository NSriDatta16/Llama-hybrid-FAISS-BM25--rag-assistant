iPhone Localization: simple project not working

Im doing my first localized project and I've been fighting with it for several hours with no luck. I have to create an app that, based on the user selection, shows texts and images in different languages. I've read most of Apple's documents on the matter but I cant make a simple example work. This are my steps so far: 1) Create a new project. 2) Manually create a "en.lproj" directory in the projects folder. 3) Using TexEdit create file called "Localizable.strings" and store it in Unicode UTF-16. The file looks like this: /* Localizable.strings Multilanguage02 Created by Gonzalo Floria on 5/6/10. Copyright 2010 __MyCompanyName__. All rights reserved. */ "Hello" = "Hi"; "Goodbye" = "Bye"; 4) I drag this file to the Resources Folder on XCode and it appear with the "subdir" "en" underneath it (with the dropdown triangle to the left). If I try to see it on XCode it looks all wrong, whit lots of ? symbols, but Im guessing thats because its a UTF-16 file. Right? 5) Now on my view did load I can access this strings like this: NSString *translated; translated = NSLocalizedString(@"Hello", @"User greetings"); NSLog(@"Translated text is %@",translated); My problem is allowing the user to switch language. I have create an es.lproj with the Localizable.strings file (in Spanish), but I CANT access it. I've tried this line: [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject: [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"es", nil] forKey:@"AppleLanguages"]; But that only works the NEXT time you load the application. Is there no way to allow the user to switch languages while running the application?? Do I have to implement my own Dictionary files and forget all about NSLocalizableString family? Thanks for ANY advice or pointers. Gonso
