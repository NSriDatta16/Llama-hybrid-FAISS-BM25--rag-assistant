Your loading of the JSON data is a little fragile. Instead of: json_raw= raw.readlines() json_object = json.loads(json_raw[0]) you should really just do: json_object = json.load(raw) You shouldn't think of what you get as a "JSON object". What you have is a list. The list contains two dicts. The dicts contain various key/value pairs, all strings. When you do json_object[0] , you're asking for the first dict in the list. When you iterate over that, with for song in json_object[0]: , you iterate over the keys of the dict. Because that's what you get when you iterate over the dict. If you want to access the value associated with the key in that dict, you would use, for example, json_object[0][song] . None of this is specific to JSON. It's just basic Python types, with their basic operations as covered in any tutorial.
