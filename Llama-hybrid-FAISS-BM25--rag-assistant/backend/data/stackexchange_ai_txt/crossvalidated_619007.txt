Predict score based on rotated PCA

I have done a varimax rotated PCA on my "test" dataset. I would like to use this PCA (i.e. the varimax rotated PCA) on a new dataset and predict the scores. This function predicted doesn't allow me to do this because it doesn't incorporate the rotation step. PCA_test_data refers to the unrotated PCA. Any ideas how to predict scores based on a varimax rotated pca???
