Should I stop fighting Visual Studio's default namespace naming convention?

I'm working on an MVVM project, so I have folders in my project like Models, ViewModels, Windows, etc. Whenever I create a new class, Visual Studio automatically adds the folder name to the namespace designation instead of just keeping the project-level namespace. So, adding a new class to the ViewModels folder would result in the namespace, MyProject.ViewModels instead of just MyProject . When I first encountered this, it annoyed me. My class names are pretty clear, sometimes even containing the name of the folder in them (e.g., ContactViewModel ). I quickly found myself manually removing the folder name on the namespaces. I even tried at one point to create a custom class template (see this question ), but I couldn't get that to work, so continued doing it manually. I've begun to wonder, though, if this convention exists for a good reason that I'm just not seeing. I could see it being useful if you for some reason had lots of sets of identical class names organized into folders, but that doesn't seem like a particularly common scenario. Questions: Why is it common convention for namespace names to reflect folder structure? Do you abide by this convention? Why?
