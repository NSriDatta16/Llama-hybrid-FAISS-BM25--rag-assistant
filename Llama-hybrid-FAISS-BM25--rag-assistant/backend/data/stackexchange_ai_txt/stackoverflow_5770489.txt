If you want to run a java program from the desktop, you have three choices. The easy choice is to write a small shell script and put that on the desktop. The smallest example might be: #!/bin/sh java -cp YOUR_CLASSPATH YOUR_CLASS_NAME "$*" Next comes the use of 'jarjar' or 'shade' to make one big jar containing all your dependencies, and then run that with java -jar. (As a sub-option, if it's really just for you, you can make a jar with a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF containing a class path with absolute pathnames.) The more complex choice is to learn to use JNLP to build a launchable item.
