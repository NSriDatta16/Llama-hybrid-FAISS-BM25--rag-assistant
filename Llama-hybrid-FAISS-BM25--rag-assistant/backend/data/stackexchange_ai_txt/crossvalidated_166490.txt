Poisson process to determine request arrival times in LTE network

I need some help with this problem. A Poisson process is generally used to describe the arrival of calls in a mobile network. Since I am developing a simulator for LTE, i need to implement such a process to realistically randomize the entry requests of users wishing to connect. After reading about the Poisson process I still can't reach a simple solution just to return the arrival times of each request - such as: "new users will try to connect on seconds: 3, 10, 20, 24" - given the average arrival rate and the simulation duration. Can someone help me with this?
