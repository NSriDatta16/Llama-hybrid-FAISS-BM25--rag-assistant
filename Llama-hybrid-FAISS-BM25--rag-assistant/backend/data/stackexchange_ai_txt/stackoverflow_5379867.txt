Control click or shift click multiple items and drag them

I have been looking on these forums all day and tried lots of plug-ins namely : jquery.hotkeys.js and the http://thechriswalker.net/select-drag/ example here complete with an excellent plug-in, it's just a lot more complex than what I think I'm looking for. I already have a drag and drop situation with sortable in list 2 thanks for to CoolEsh for his amazing help earlier on.. connecting sortable lists disallowing sorting on the first list jQuery So now I'm needing a control click to select more than one and drag it across. But I don't want loads of mark-up and jQuery. but I also don't want to use a complex plug-in like the ones I mentioned. Any ideas?
