I am sorry to have to say this, but this would seem like you would have to apply some Pricing Rule Engine to achive what you are after . Would seem like you have to Store the available items, and their discounts on per pruchase. Store which items in combination would discount each other. Also maybe thinking of per unit/quantity purchased per unit, or maybe per package/special. Might want to look at keeping a archive/storage of these specials/packages, just incase the customer wants a reprint of the original invoice . In general there is a lot of possible rules/combinations that can be thought of, and you as developer can implement these and hide them from the user, or allow the user to create them, but somebody has to do so . And then, when you dont feel like implementing your own, GOOGLE shold provide some: Open Source Rule Engines
