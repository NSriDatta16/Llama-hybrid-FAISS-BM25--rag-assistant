For simplicity lets consider 2 time series Xt, Yt and their aggregate Zt = Xt + Yt. Then E[Zt] = E[Xt + Yt] = E[Xt] + E[Yt]. So you can indeed sum forecasts. For confidence intervals, summing the bounds directly doesn't make sense. Instead you want to compute the variance of the new aggregated series. Assuming independence of Xt and Yt we have Var(Zt) = Var(Xt) + Var(Yt). So you can compute Var(Zt) from here and use that to construct prediction intervals for Zt.
