Visual Development Tools

The company I work for is writing software for financial organizations and this often involves doing some complex calculations. Right now, a functional designer will just write down the calculation and then someone more technical (me) has to translate this to code. However, I realize that this should probably be done in an easier way. Isn't there already some tool in which you can just design your functions and calculations in an easy-to-understand visual way, which would compile to a .NET assembly that can be used within my projects? That way, the functional designer just has to "draw" the formula in this tool, generate the code/assembly and pass that on to me. (I must say, for this purpose we're already some graphical design tool but it's too limited for the more complex calculations.) [These calculations are related to loans, mortgages and insurances, often doing complex calculations to predict the profitability of a certain product compared to others.]
