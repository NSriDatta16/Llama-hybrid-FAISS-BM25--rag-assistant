Given the lack of detail in the question, here is a broad spectrum dose answer If you want to write an HTTP Server you can Use HttpListener Use TcpLister class and write your own TCP server Use the Socket class and write your own TCP server If your intention is to monitor the HTTP traffic that your server is receiving then you can Use WinPCap ( SharpPCap ) to capture the traffic and filter the traffic you are interested in If your intention is to send HTTP traffic to a server Look at WebRequest class Loot at WebClient class
