This is really a comment but exceeds the allowable so I post it as a quasi-answer as it suggests the correct way to analyze time series data. . The well-known fact but often ignored here and elsewhere is that the theoretical ACF/PACF which is used to formulate a tentative ARIMA model premises no Pulses/Level Shifts/Seasonal Pulses/Local Time Trends. Additionally it premises constant parameters and constant error variance over time. In this case the 21st observation (value=158) is easily flagged as an outlier/Pulse and a suggested adjustment of -80 yields a modified value of 78 . The resultant ACF/PACF of the modified series shows little or no evidence of stochastic (ARIMA) structure. In this case the operation was a success but the patient died. The sample ACF is based upon the covariance/variance and an unduly inflated/bloated variance yields a downwards bias to the ACF. Prof. Keith Ord once referred to this as the "Alice in Wonderland effect"
