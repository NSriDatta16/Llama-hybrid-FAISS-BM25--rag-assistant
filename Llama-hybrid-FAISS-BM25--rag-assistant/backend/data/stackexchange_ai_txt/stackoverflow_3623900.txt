Need to provide a proposed model solution, which UML diagrams should I use?

I need to provide my client with a proposed model of the solution I am suggesting. The problem is very vaguely as follows: We need to create a solution that amalgamates much of the information in the organisation Information will be available from several systems. INformation from the "central hub" will also be made available to other external systems (this information is not private - we are trying to share it as widely as possible). Essentially we want to model the interactions between different components in the system. What would be a good set of diagrams to use? So far I have decided to have a Use Case and Communication Diagram. Class diagrams are too detailed at this stage. What other high level diagrams do you think are appropriate.
