The type of model depends first on the outcome variable. As your outcome is binary, what you need is a type of binomial regression, such as logistic regression. That's pretty standard. The coding of the ordinal predictor is a separate issue. With only 3 levels, it's simplest to ignore its ordinal nature and just code it as a 3-level categorical predictor with the no-expression group as the reference level. In a logistic regression you will get 2 regression coefficients representing the log-odds difference between each of the gene-expression groups and the no-expression group in terms of the binary outcome. That would provide the same information as trying to code the gene-expression predictor as ordinal. If you have continuous values for the gene expression, you probably would be better off using them directly with a flexible fit (regression spline or other generalized additive model). It's generally poor practice to categorize a continuous predictor . If you are making measurements on different individuals at the 3 time points then you are all set. If there are repeated measurements on individuals you will need to take the within-individual correlations into account, typically with a mixed model.
