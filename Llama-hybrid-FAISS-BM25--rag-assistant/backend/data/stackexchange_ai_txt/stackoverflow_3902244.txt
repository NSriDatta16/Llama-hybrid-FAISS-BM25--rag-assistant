I agree on the fact there's no unique solution . I tend to keep validation which is related to the logic of the application in the controller . This has a great advantage in those cases where the model can vary (otherwise you need to replicate the checks in all models). In the model , I just keep validation which is dependent on the storage mechanism . The view could be a good place to implement some client-side validation , for immediate feedback. Again, this is just my opinion.
