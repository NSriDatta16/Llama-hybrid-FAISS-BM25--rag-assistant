As a much lighter weight alternative to XML, JSON provides you with all that you seem to be looking for. JSON is just a way for serialising your objects to strings suitable for writing to a file, for later retrieval. There is an active community of JSON users that use the JSONSharp module jsonsharp overview . For a discussion about why XML (may) be bad for your health there is an extremely helpful post here: xml is bad for humans returning to your question about CSV files, C# indeed does not include any solutions for writing and reading csv files, and as others have mentioned, your first port of call should be one of the many libraries that have sprung up to fill the void. This is what your structure might look like in JSON: ["LinkLabel","This is LinkLabel's text",170,40]
