Would convolutional neural networks be spatially invariant if we didn't feed it images of objects that appear in different locations?

If we are building a cat classifier and we fed the CNN images of cats that appear in the same location in the training images. Would the CNN work during inference if we gave it an image of a cat in a different location in the image? By "work" I mean (give a good performance as if we fed the CNN images of cats in different locations in the input images)
