You've already accepted an answer, but I'll put in my piece. I'll assume you already know how to make the sphere spin at a constant rate, and how to make it accelerate under the applied torque. Making it decellerate is just a matter of applying another torque, one that must be calculated. When an object slides on a solid surface, the rate of deceleration is constant. The force is in the direction opposite to motion, and its magnitude depends on a couple of things but not speed. When the object comes to a full stop, the force vanishes. The same applies to a globe turning on a solid pivot. When an object passes through a fluid, the force of decelleration increases with speed, so the faster the object the greater the drag. As the object slows down, decelleration grows weaker, and the object keeps slowing down but never stops. This describes a globe spinning in air or water. At reasonably high speeds, drag is proporional to v 2 , and at very low speeds it is proportional to v (I don't know about the transition between these domains). So I suggest t = -a w b , where w is angular velocity. The parameter a is the strength of the friction, and b describes the kind of decelleration; b =0 is like friction on a solid pivot, b =2 is like spinning in air, and b =1 is like rotating in syrup. Other values of b may or may not look realistic or be realistic.
