Visualizing mutual information of each convolution layer for image classification problem

I recently came across this paper where the author has proposed a compression based theory on understanding the layers of a DNN. In order to visualize what was going on the authors showed Figure 2 of this paper which is also shown as a video here . For my image classification problem I want to visualize the mutual information exactly in this format. Can someone kindly explain to me how to calculate this numerically for images passing through conv layers in a convolutional neural network. Do I need to fit a kernel density estimator for a vectorized feature maps at each layer and numerically calculate entropy or is there a simpler way to do this? Thanks in advance
