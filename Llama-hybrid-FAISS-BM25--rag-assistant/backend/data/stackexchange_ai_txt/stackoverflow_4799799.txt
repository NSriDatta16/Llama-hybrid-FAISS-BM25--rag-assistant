You could use the timestamp as column name to leverage column name sorting done automatically by Cassandra. The next questions that comes up is row size related. You may not be able to store all your time series data in one row. Your data may need to be broken up along several rows. Depending on the amount of data being generated, you may choose different options. You may decide to store each day's data in a separate row and the data with a row sorted by column name as I mentioned. In this case if the time range in your query spans day boundary, you will have to make multiple queries one for each row (i.e. day in your time span range). Essentially, the original range query will translate to multiple range queries.
