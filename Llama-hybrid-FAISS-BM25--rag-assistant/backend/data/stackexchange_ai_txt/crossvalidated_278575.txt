Stationary time series estimation first starts by centering. So the intercept estimation in arima is just mean(ar1) . Turning to lm . Did you not see that the intercept is not statistically different from 0, as ar1[-1] and ar1[-1000] have the same mean? That's what stationarity implies. In summary, arima here is doing real estimation for ar1 , while lm is only estimating its auto-correlation. You are doing different things! If this is still not that clear for you, let's just focus on the lm usage in general. # true model: y = 0.7 x + 0.5 x
