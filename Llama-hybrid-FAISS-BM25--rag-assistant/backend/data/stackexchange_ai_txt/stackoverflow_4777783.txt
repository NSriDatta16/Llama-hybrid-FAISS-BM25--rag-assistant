Well Three20 is famous but I would discourage you from using it. If all you need is a photo slider then putting the entire Three20 framework into your project and trying to figure out how the URL-based navigation thing works can be a real pain. Here is a better alternative, https://github.com/enormego/PhotoViewer . It's a standalone implementation of the photo slider and a corresponding image cache. You can read more about how the code works on the author's blog, http://developers.enormego.com/ .
