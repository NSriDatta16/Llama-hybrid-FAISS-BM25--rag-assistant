You don't have an ODF: you have empirical data. Computing the Fourier Transform will work, if carried out properly, but it's redundant and inefficient. It amounts to finding the mean direction by separately averaging the x- and y-components of the directions and then converting that average to a direction. For orientation data, all you need to do is double all angles. This identifies every direction with its opposite direction. After computing the mean direction of the doubled-angle data, halve its angle (so that the result will be between $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$). This designates the mean orientation. This figure shows ten random orientations and their mean orientation in red. The following R code shows how the figure was created. The mean.orientation function performs the calculation. It allows for weighted data via its weights argument as shown in the commented-out line for computing alpha.bar . mean.orientation
