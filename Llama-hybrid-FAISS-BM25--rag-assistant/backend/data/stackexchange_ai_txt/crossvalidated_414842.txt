SJ, if these are all categorical (assuming they are factors) then the scale doesn't really matter. The logistic regression isn't analyzing the actual number, but rather the presence or absence of that variable. You could easily rename all of the variables A,B,C,D, etc. within x1, x2, x3, and x4 and you would get the same results because they are categorical.
