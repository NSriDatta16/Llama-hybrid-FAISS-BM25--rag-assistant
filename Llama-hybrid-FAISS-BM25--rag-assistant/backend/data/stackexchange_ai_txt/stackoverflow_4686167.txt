Invalid Cast Exception when filling datatable wth table adaptor

I am using VB.NET 2010 (Visual Basic 2010 Express) on a WPF-based project. I am also using the SQL Server Express built-in to Visual Basic 2010 express. I have just about finished refining my code for hooking up my wpf-based form to an existing SQL database (agentroster.sdf). I have a global data source (AGENT_ROSTER) connected to this database. Connections are confirmed to work properly. This is the first part of the code I'm using, irrelevant code omitted, Dim table_adaptor As New AGENT_ROSTERTableAdaptors.AGENT_ROSTERTableAdaptor Dim roster_table As New DataTable("roster_table") Dim rowposition As Integer Private Sub ROSTER_Loaded... table_adaptor.Fill(roster_table) End Sub I am getting the following errors: (In Immediate Window) A first chance exception of type 'System.InvalidCastException' occured in VBP-WORD4WORD.exe (In Message, pointing to the line: "table_adaptor.Fill(roster_table)') InvalidCastException was unhandled Unable to cast object of type 'System.Data.DataTable' to type 'AGENT_ROSTERDataTable'. What am I doing wrong, and furthermore, how do I fill roster_table with table_adaptor (or alternate method)?
