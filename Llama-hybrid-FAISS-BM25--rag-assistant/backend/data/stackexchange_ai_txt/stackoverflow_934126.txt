Genetic algorithms can be usefully applied to optimising neural networks, but you have to think a little about what you want to do. Most "classic" NN training algorithms, such as Back-Propagation, only optimise the weights of the neurons. Genetic algorithms can optimise the weights, but this will typically be inefficient. However, as you were asking, they can optimise the topology of the network and also the parameters for your training algorithm. You'll have to be especially wary of creating networks that are "over-trained" though. One further technique with a modified genetic algorithms can be useful for overcoming a problem with Back-Propagation. Back-Propagation usually finds local minima, but it finds them accurately and rapidly. Combining a Genetic Algorithm with Back-Propagation, e.g., in a Lamarckian GA, gives the advantages of both. This technique is briefly described during the GAUL tutorial
