OK, after a bit of experimentation, this worked for me. SysInternals regmon showed that the Font And Colors options for VS2008 Pro are stored in the registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\FontAndColors Deleting this and restarting Visual Studio caused the key to be rebuilt and restored the String (C# @ Verbatim) option. The option is missing from the VS2005 Pro key too, so maybe that's why it never appeared in 2008. Is Magenta over Lime too masochistic??
