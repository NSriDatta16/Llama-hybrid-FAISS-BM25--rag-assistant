Given two sets $A, B$, the average weights have nothing to do with the probability $p$ that $a \in A$ is greater than $b\in B$. $p$ could be almost 100% despite $E(A) The only ways to do this are to either calculate the true probability by looking at all pairs (like Tusell's suggestion, but all pairs not just non-overlapping pairs) or making some assumption about the distributions of $A, B$ and then estimating hyperparameters. If you assume normality, then the estimated difference is (noncentral, scaled) student's T distributed hence the T test suggested by Mihir.
