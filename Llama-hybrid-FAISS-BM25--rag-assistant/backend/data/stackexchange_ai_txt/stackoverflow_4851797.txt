Without an example of your code already this is going to be hard, but here goes... If you have your code for dragging and dropping I'll assume you know some Javascript and are able to get the x and y coordinates you wish to save for the images in question. You will need to use AJAX to communicate with a server to store the coordinates, on the server you will use PHP to UPDATE the coordinates into the database. An example using AJAX from jQuery might look like this // Get X and Y and assign to javascript variables, you should do this using your existing drag and drop code // There is also a variable called imgId this might be an identifier for the image which was dragged and dropped $.ajax({ // POST the data to the script type: "POST", // This is your PHP script url: "save-coords.php", // These are the variables you'll be POSTing to the PHP script data: "x=" + x + "&y=" + y + "&imgId=" + imgId, // Here is a function which will be called when the script is successful success: function(msg){ alert( "Data Saved: " + msg ); } }); Your PHP script called save-coords.php might look something like this The echo result will be picked up by your AJAX script and will be output using the alert() function in Javascript. I hope that helps and gets you started, I haven't run it, but it is a start.
