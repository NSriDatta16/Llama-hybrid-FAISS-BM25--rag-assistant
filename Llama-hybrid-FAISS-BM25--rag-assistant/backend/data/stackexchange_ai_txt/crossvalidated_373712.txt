I think what you are doing is obtaining average survival probabilities through predictsmcure() in R. Through this you are actually obtaining the average survival probability on a given time and that remains same across the individuals irrespective of the measures of your covariates as it already takes that into account when you are specifying the covariates in the ~ part of the smcure() . In fact when you are applying the newx= and newz= arguments in the predictsmcure() in R, you are actually specifying the mean or median value of your attributes versus their minimum values like this newx=c(0.8,0) meaning the mean of the attribute which is 0.8 versus value =0 and in case of categorical variables it is like newx=c(1,0) meaning the variable with that factor taken versus not taken. Hence there itself you are taking this average probabilities into consideration.
