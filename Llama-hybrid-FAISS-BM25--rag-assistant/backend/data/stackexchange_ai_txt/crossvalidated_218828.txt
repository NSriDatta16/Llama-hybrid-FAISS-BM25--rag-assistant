Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): How many samples are needed to get a uniform sample?

I am interested in a general answer although my question is rooted in a specific document. I am using the R package "hitandrun": https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hitandrun/hitandrun.pdf On page 2, the author states that $0^*(n^3)$ samples are needed to get a uniform sample. I know the dimension of the sampling space $n$ but I don't know what is meant with $0^*$.
