I think you may find it difficult to find what you're after. The closest thing that I know of is LingPipe , which has some sentiment analysis functionality and is available under a limited kind of open-source licence, but is written in Java. Also, sentiment analysis systems are usually developed by training a system on product/movie review data which is significantly different from the average tweet. They are going to be optimised for text with several sentences, all about the same topic. I suspect you would do better coming up with a rule-based system yourself, perhaps based on a lexicon of sentiment terms like the one the University of Pittsburgh provide . Check out We Feel Fine for an implementation of similar idea with a really beautiful interface (and twitrratr ).
