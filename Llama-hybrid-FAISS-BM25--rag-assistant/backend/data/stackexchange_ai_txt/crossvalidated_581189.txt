In a VAE both the encoder and the decoder assign to an input a distribution. You correctly stated that for the encoder, but this is also true for the decoder: for the same latent input $\mathbf z$ you will always get the same distribution (often normal, so it is described by the decoder output $(\boldsymbol \mu, \boldsymbol\sigma^2)$ ), but sampling from it will give you different $\hat{\mathbf x}$ for the same $\mathbf z$ .
