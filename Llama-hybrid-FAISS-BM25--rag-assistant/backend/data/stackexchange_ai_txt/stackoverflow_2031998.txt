Recommended place for Windows Service state storage?

I have a Windows Service written in C# (.Net 3.5) and I need to store some state somewhere so that next time the service starts up, it knows where it left off. What is the recommended store for this type of thing? The registry? What if I just put some user settings in a Settings.settings file? Where would the user profile be for a service executing as LocalSystem or NetworkService?
