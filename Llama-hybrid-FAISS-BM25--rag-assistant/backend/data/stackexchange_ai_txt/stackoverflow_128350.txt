PHP: using preg_replace with htmlentities

I'm writing an RSS to JSON parser and as a part of that, I need to use htmlentities() on any tag found inside the description tag. Currently, I'm trying to use preg_replace() , but I'm struggling a little with it. My current (non-working) code looks like: $pattern[0] = "/\ (.*?)\ /is"; $replace[0] = ' '.htmlentities("$1").' '; $rawFeed = preg_replace($pattern, $replace, $rawFeed); If you have a more elegant solution to this as well, please share. Thanks.
