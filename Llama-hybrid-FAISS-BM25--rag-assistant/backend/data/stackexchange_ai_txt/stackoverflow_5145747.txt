jquery droppable only one child

I am new to jQuery and I am working with the droppable API. I want to have a group of divs that can all hold one and only one droppable item. I've set the class of my droppable divs to inv. I can drop items into the divs but I can find a way to reject a drop once in the drop function. I want to be able to detect that my div already has a child and if it does revert the dopped element. my code currently looks like this $( "div.inv" ).droppable( { drop: function( event, ui ) { childCount = $(this).children().length; if (childCount !=0) { //revert droppable to initial position return; } //if there is a child revert and return $( this ) .addClass( "ui-state-highlight" ) .append($(ui.draggable)) } });
