Looks like State Plane New York projection (East?). I tried importing your xy data in ArcGIS with that projection (NAD83 State Plane NY East, meters), then setting the dataframe projection to WGS84 lat/long, which returns lat/long values similar to what you would expect for NY... EDIT: State Plane uses a mix of transverse Mercator and Lambert Conformal Conic projections, so you should also try these.
