Due to the class imbalance, you should have a look at the probabilities that your forests outputs (I'm not familiar with the random forest R package, but I think there is an option ( type="prob" ) in the predict function that will give you a matrix of class probabilities. I believe, the next thing to do with these probabilities is to derive a ROC curve and see if it performs better than the majority vote. In that case, it just means you should consider a 'soft' voting approach while optimising the threshold (based on the ROC curve) to determine the predicted class (which is straightforward in a binary case) instead of a 'majority' voting one.
