C++ Transformer scripting

Im looking to see if there are any pre-existing projects that do this. Generally, I need something that will load in a c++ file and parse it and then based on a set of rules in script, transform it, say to add headers, reformat, or remove coding quirks for example, turning const int parameters in functions to int parameters, etc Or perhaps something that would generate a dom of some sorts based on the c++ file fed in that could be manipulated and written out again. Are there any such projects/products out there free or commercial?
