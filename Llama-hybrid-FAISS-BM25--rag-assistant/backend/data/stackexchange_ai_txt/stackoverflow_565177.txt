What is the best solution for organising test scripts required to pass a new feature/release

Has anyone experience with good software (or another way) of organising the individual tes scripts which need to be passed before a feature or whole release can be released to customers? I've heard good things about this http://www.rallydev.com/agile_products/lifecycle_management/test_management/ but am yet to use it myself. I know a lot of people use excel to organise test scripts but I'd like something which multiple people can work on simultaneously and is really designed for the purpose.
