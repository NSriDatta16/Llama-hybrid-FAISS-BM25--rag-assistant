Perhaps the PHP script expects to see some HTTP header or headers that the httplib module isn't sending. For example, httplib does not seem to send Accept, Accept-Language, or User-Agent headers by default. You may need to add one or more of those to the request() call. It does seem to send a proper Host header, though, which was my first guess.
