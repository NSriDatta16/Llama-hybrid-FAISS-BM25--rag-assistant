AFAIK cookie based authentication is only used once you have logged in successfully atleast ONCE. You can try disabling storing cookies from that domain by changing your browser settings, if you are still able to download files that it should be a HTTP based authentication. Try doing a equivalent GET request for the (possibly POST) login request that is probably happening right now for login. Use firebug or fiddler to see the login request that is sent. Also note if there is some javascript code which is returning you a different output, based on your useragent string or some other parameter. See if httplib , mechanize helps.
