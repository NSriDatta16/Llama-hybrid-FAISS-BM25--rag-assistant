The assignments to rkpktTo1. * are not apparently in a function or declaration, unless this is a code fragment. Wrap them in a function. The warning is a bit misleading. The declaration of tolayer2() should have a return type as well as a parameter type. Since there isn't one, int is assumed. This may not be what is intended, but it should compile without warnings and errors: node0.c struct rtpkt { int sourceid; /* id of sending router sending this pkt */ int destid; /* id of router to which pkt being sent (must be an immediate neighbor) */ int mincost[4]; /* current understanding of min cost to node 0 ... 3 */ }; /* Create routing packets (rtpkt) and send to neighbors via tolayer2(). */ void function () { struct rtpkt rtpktTo1; rtpktTo1.sourceid = 0; rtpktTo1.destid = 1; rtpktTo1.mincost[0] = minCost[0]; rtpktTo1.mincost[1] = minCost[1]; rtpktTo1.mincost[2] = minCost[2]; rtpktTo1.mincost[3] = minCost[3]; } extern void tolayer2(struct rtpkt *rtpktTo1); prog3.c void tolayer2(struct rtpkt *packet) { /* This has a lot of code in it */ } Passing a structure by value is often not appropriate, so I have changed it to pass by reference.
