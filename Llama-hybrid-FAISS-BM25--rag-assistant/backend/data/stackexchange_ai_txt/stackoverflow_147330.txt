One key difference occurs when you update a record. If the row format is fixed, there is no change in the length of the record. In contrast, if the row format is dynamic and the new data causes the record to increase in length, a link is used to point to the "overflow" data (i.e. it's called the overflow pointer). This fragments the table and generally slows things down. There is a command to defragment (OPTIMIZE TABLE), which somewhat mitigates the issue.
