You could create embeddings for the employees. If you are using NN, just add an embedding layer for the employees. Or, you could use something similar to a collaborative filter to find embeddings for the employees. e.g, Create a matrix E = Employee x Day of the month , where each row is an employee and each column is a day of the month and \begin{align} E_{ij} = 1 \quad &\text{if employee i worked at the day j}\\ E_{ij} = -1 \quad &\text{if employee i got a time off or sick leave } \end{align} then for each month, you can use, for instance, ALS (Alternating Least Squares) to create embeddings for the employee. You could average the embeddings out for several months and use them in your main model. This approach could also give you some kind of score for each employee that could be used in your model.
