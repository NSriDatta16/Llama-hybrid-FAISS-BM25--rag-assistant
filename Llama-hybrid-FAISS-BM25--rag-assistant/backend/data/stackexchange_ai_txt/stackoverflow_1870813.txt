Genetics algorithms theoretical question

I'm currently reading "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (Russell+Norvig) and "Machine Learning" (Mitchell) - and trying to learn basics of AINN. In order to understand few basic things I have two 'greenhorn' questions: Q1: In a genetic algorithm given the two parents A and B with the chromosomes 001110 and 101101, respectively, which of the following offspring could have resulted from a one-point crossover? a: 001101 b: 001110 Q2: Which of the above offspring could have resulted from a two-point crossover? and why? Please advise.
