doctrine regenerating models from yml only the base models?

I am wondering if there is a way to handle this more elegantly. After generating the "main" models and base models from yml files the first time I have to add at the very leased an include for the base model to the "main" model like so: include_once 'generated/BaseBlog.php'; At the moment before I regenerate the models I move my changed main models, which is mostly way more then just the include path, in to a tmp folder then I delete all the models. And after regenerating I move my modified models back overwriting the generated main models. isn't there a way to just create the base models and not touch the main models? Or how do you guys handle this?
