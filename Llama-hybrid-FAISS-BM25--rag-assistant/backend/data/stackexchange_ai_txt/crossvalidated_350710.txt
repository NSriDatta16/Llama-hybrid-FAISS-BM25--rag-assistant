Batch effects in survival data

I have a problem concerning batch effects in survival data of C.elegans. I read through a few forum posts and a paper but I am still not really getting it. In the experiment the effect of different interventions of lifespan were tested in different batches. The experiments were conducted on different dates in a machine which automatically captures the time of death. The problem is, that the temperature in each batch can not be controlled 100% and C.elegans is quite sensitive to changes in temperature. In the end I wanna put all the data of the batches together and fit a Gompertz function to them. My data has the following from: Batch/ Temp/ Time_of_death 1 20 1.5 1 20 1.7 1 20 1.9 1 20 1.4 2 20 1.3 2 20 1.2 2 20 1.6 2 20 1.7 . . . . . . . . . I know about the R function Combat but I am not sure how I would implement my data into it to get rid of batch effects and what the batch covariates exactly are. Any Help would be very much appreciated.
