Which cross-validation type best suits to binary classification problem

Data set looks like: 25000 observations up to 15 predictors of different types: numeric, multi-class categorical, binary target variable is binary Which cross validation method is typical for this type of problems? By default I'm using K-Fold. How many folds is enough in this case? (One of the models I use is random forest, which is time consuming...)
