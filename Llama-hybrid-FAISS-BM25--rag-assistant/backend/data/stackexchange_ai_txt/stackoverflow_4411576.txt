I suspect you're trying to use isValid on an object which isn't known (by the compiler) to be an instance of the derived class or a subclass of the derived class. protected has relatively subtle semantics like that. Personally I would encourage you to keep your fields private though, and use properties from any other class - even a derived class. As for a simpler way of implementing the properties - I don't think there is one really, no. You could have a wrapper type, but you'd still need to create a variable to hold the instance of the wrapper type, and the get/set accessors to proxy to the variable.
