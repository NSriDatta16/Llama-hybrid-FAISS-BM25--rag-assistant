Which is the best approach for permutation testing for deep learning models?

Should I just shuffle my labels and train my model for a certain number of iterations? The result of permutation testing should give low testing/validation accuracy, right? Is it necessary to do a permutation test to check the robustness of the deep learning model or 10 fold cross-validation is more than enough? Machine learning model has sklearn.model_selection.permutation_test_score , but deep learning model doesn't have any permutation test functions.
