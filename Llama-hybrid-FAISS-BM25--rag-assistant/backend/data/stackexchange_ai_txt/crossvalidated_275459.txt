What is a convincing way to replace missing values in income data in R

I am working with NLS data. It's cross-sectional data for different variables in 2013. On of my independent variables is annual income. I start off with 7k respondents and if I would drop data for the negative income and NA's I will reduce my sample to 5k. So I am thinking about replacing the NA's with the average and negatives with a 0. Do you think that replacing is better then dropping, considering the size of my sample? For the replacing option, how would I code it? My dataset name is nlsy.
