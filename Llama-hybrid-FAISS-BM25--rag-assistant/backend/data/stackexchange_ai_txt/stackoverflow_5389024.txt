How to register a custom module in OTRS 2.4

I have written a custom module for OTRS which is more or less a copy of an existing module (AgentTicketSearch). I placed it in Kernel\Modules\ like it was said in the developer manual. When i try to use it, i get the following Errormessage: "Module Kernel::Modules::AgentTicketMyModule not registered in Kernel/Config.pm!" Question: How do i register custom modules in the config.pm?
