Filling 4 variable in a struct type and using malloc

I need to write a simple program that ask the user to insert 4 double type variable in a struct variable data. struct Data { double a; double b; double c; double average; }; struct Data *ptr_name; int i; First, ask user the size: printf("Please enter the size:"); scanf("%d", &size); Then, use the malloc. (I dont know how to use it...) something like this... ptr_name = ()malloc(); and then use the for loop to get the a, b, c from user. for(i = 0; i finally, print everything out, including the average. for(i = 0; i That is pretty much all, I am learning struct type and malloc now, can't understand by browsing web... help, thanks.
