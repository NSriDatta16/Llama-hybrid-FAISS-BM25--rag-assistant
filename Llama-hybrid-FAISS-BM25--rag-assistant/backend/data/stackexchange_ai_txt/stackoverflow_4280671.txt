I got into a tree conflict by r-clicking on folder, selecting 'rename', and using "newpath\to\folder" as a parameter. After many rounds of failed cleanup commands and some other stuff I finally restored sanity by: open new clean checkout into a different folder svn deleting and committing the broken 'newpath\to\folder' from clean checkout select 'oldpath\folder' r-click drag and svn move to new location immediately commit change with no other operations in the middle go to broken checkin 'oldpath\folder' and manually copy files which were dropped or left behind to 'newpath\to\folder' add manually copied files as if they were new. The seamless history chain is broken for the manually updated files, but at least I can continue work now.
