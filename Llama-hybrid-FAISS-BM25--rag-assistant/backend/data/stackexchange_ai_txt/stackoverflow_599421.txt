Below are results of my own homework - hopefully someone finds this analysis of embedded EJB providers helpful on deciding if and which container to use. I went with Apache OpenEJB since it offers rich set of features, partially supports EJB 3.1 and seems as the most active and well rounded-up offering. As usual, which product should work best for you really depends on your actual requirements, goals, and environment. Embedded JBoss License : LGPL Java : JDK 5.0 Tomcat integration : Yes, modification to server.xml Tomcat Versions : 5.0 and above (?) Deployment to Tomcat : Embedded war List of features : JNDI (local), JBoss TS, JBoss Messaging, JCA, JNDI, EJB, JPA, local TX datasource/connection pool, EJB Security JNDI configuration: overrides Tomcat's JNDI implementation by layering itself on top of Tomcat's JNDI instantiation; Tomcat JNDI is read-only Deployment types : JAR only Management support : No Support : limited, built on top JBoss Microcontainer that is the core of JBoss 5.0, supported option for Seam on Tomcat JMS Provider : same configuration files as JBoss 5.x. JMS is configured in hsqldb-persistence-service.xml, and this can be adjusted to work with other databases XA Connection Pool : No EJB Timer Services : No *Persistence Providers:*Hibernate Limitations : no remote JMS; local interfaces only; local-only JBoss JNDI implementation Documentation : limited EJB 3.1 : No Apache OpenEJB 3.1 License: Apache License *Java:*JDK 5.0 or 6.0 Tomcat integration :Yes, modifications to startup shell script *Tomcat Versions:*Tomcat 6.x or 5.5 *Deployment to Tomcat:*war file *List of features:*EJB 3.0 and 3.1, JTA, JAX-WS, JMS, J2EE Connectors, JPA, JNDI. OpenEJB uses several other open source frameworks such as OpenJPA to provide JPA and CMP persistence, ActiveMQ for JMS/MDB, and Apache CXF for JAX-WS features. *JNDI configuration:*flexible JNDI naming schema *Deployment types:*Collapsed EAR (war), JAR Management support: ActiveMQ JMX mbeans *Support:*Community support, mailing lists and forums, EJB container for Apache Geronimo *JMS Provider:*ActiveMQ *XA Connection Pool:*Yes *EJB Timer Services:*Yes *Persistence Providers:*OpenJPA, Hibernate *Limitations:*OpenEJB uses OpenJPA to provide JPA and CMP persistence, and OpenJPA currently requires a JavaAgent to function properly. *Documentation:*limited but better than others *EJB 3.1:*partial EasyBeans *License:*LGPL *Java:*JDK 5.0 or 6.0 Tomcat integration : Yes *Tomcat Versions:*Tomcat 6.x or 5.5 *Deployment to Tomcat:*war file *List of features:*EJB 3.0, JAX-WS, OSGi support JNDI configuration: ? *Deployment types:*JAR Management support: ? *Support:*Community support and professional support, mailing list, JIRA, EJB container for JOnAS application server JMS Provider: ?
