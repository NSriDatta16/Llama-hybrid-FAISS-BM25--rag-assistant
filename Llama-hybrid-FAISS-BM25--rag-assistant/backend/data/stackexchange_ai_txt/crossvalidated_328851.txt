Modeling an Increasing Process

I want to model an unobserved, increasing (non-stationary) AR(1) process in a Bayesian setting $$X_t= 1.2 X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$ How does one model the residuals, $\epsilon_t$ to ensure that $X_t Is there a better way to model increasing processes ? Any reference is appreciated.
