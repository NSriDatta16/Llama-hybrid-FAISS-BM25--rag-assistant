Mean and variance for unequal samples

I have a sampling of variable sized plots. Each plot contains the number of trees present on the plot. Given: $n=$ the number of plots $s_i=$ the size of the $i^{th}$ plot $y_i=$ the number of trees on the $i^{th}$ plot What method should I use to determine the mean and the variance of the sample? Because the plots are variable sized, I'm hesitant to use the standard mean and variance formulas. My intuition tells me that larger plots should be weighted more than smaller ones. A colleague of mine has suggested to use the density of each plot as the sampling statistic and the average of the densities as the mean to calculate variance using the standard variance formula. In my opinion this method weights smaller plots equal to larger plots, thus in effect giving smaller plots more weight. I'm not a statistician, but an idea I had was to weight each plot by the number of averaged sized plots in the sample and to inversely weight the number of trees sampled, then use the weighted average formula to calculate the mean and the weighted sample variance formula for frequency based weights to calculate the variance. E.g., \begin{align} w_i &= \frac{s_i}{\bar{s}} \\ \ \\ x_i &= y_i\frac{\bar{s}}{s_i} \\ \ \\ \bar{x} &= \frac{\sum{w_ix_i}}{\sum{w_i}} \\ \ \\ s^2 &= \frac{w_i(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1} \end{align} It should be noted that: $w_ix_i=y_i$ and $\sum{w_i}=n$ thus $\bar{x}=\bar{y}$ where $\bar{y}$ is the number of trees for an averaged sized plot. Is this method statistically valid or is there another formula I should be using?
