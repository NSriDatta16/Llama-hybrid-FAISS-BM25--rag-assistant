Discrete state space sampeled from a symmetric proposal distribution (monte carlo sampling) in R

I am new to MCMC, but proficient in R. I want to draw Markov chain Monte Carlo samples for the following scenario: The state space consists of all combinations of n vectors out of a larger set of m > n vectors. I am searching for one of these combinations s with certain properties. Therefore I need to draw samples of s from a symmetric proposal distribution in a MCMC-type fashion. To illustrate Suppose we have m = 4 vectors (one per row), which are binary (my problem has m > 4, this is just to illustrate). everything We need to sample one subset s of the four vectors containing only n = 2 vectors. Our state space for n = 2 are all possible combinations of 2 vectors (2 of 4 = 6). statespace Now I wish to sample from this simple state space s = 1,2,3,4,5,6 . We start with a random proposal s_start , say number 4; and then draw the next proposal s_next such that it generates a Markov chain Monte Carlo sample such that the proposal distribution is symmetric. What I found is that usually we use a multivariate normal distribution for this. That is p(s_next | s_start) ~ N(s_start, some.variance). But this supposes continuous variables in s. In my case, there are two discrete vectors with binary values each. Which type of distribution can I use to generate MCMC samples for s such that the vector combinations s_next that are more similar to the current proposal s_start are more likely to be chosen compared to vectors more dissimilar? (This is my understanding of a symmetric proposal distribution, maybe I have gotten that wrong in the first place).
