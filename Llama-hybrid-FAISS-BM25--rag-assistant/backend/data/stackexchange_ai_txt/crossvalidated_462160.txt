Is covariance pca on standardized dataset equal to correlation pca on the original dataset?

would the following four methods be different? original data -> covariance on orginal data -> pca normalizing data -> covariance on normalized data -> pca original data -> correlation on orginal data -> pca normalizing data -> correlation on normalized data -> pca I reckon that 1,2 should be significantly different if variables are scaled differently. But should 2,3 be the same thing? and what would 4 mean?
