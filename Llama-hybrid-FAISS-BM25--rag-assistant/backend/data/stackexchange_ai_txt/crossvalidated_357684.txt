Suppose you see $X$ Successes in $n$ trials. Then the estimate of the binomial success probability is $\hat p = X/n.$ You cannot know the exact distribution of $X$ or of $\hat p$ because you don't know $p.$ As I showed in my answer below, there are various methods to get a 'confidence interval' for $p,$ using the fact that $X \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu = np, \sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}).$ Two Answers have also shown that $X$ is approximately distributed according to a beta distribution. But you say: No. I am interested in the distribution of the number of successes. In the limit of large number of trials, the fraction of successes should follow an approximately continuous distribution. This response is puzzling. And you have not responded to @whuber's Comments. It seems this matter will remain unresolved until you explain what you are doing and exactly why answers and comments to date are not what you are looking for. It seems as if you might be trying to get a confidence interval (CI) for $p$ based on seeing $X$ Successes in $n$ trials. Wald interval: Then a point estimate for $p$ is $\hat p = X/n.$ A traditional 'Wald' 95% confidence interval is of the form $$\hat p \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}.$$ It uses two approximations: (a) that $\hat p$ is approximately normally distributed and (b) that the standard error of $\hat p.$ $$SD(\hat p) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}.$$ Because these two approximations are best for large $n$ and $p$ relatively near $1/2,$ this style of CI does not provide the nominal 95% coverage probability in many practical situations. You mentioned one difficulty: the CI has length $0$ if $X = 0$ or $X = n.$ Example: If $X = 30$ and $n = 50,$ a 95% Wald CI is $(0.464, 0.736).$ n = 50; p.hat = 30/50; pm = c(-1,1); wald.ci = p.hat + pm*1.96*sqrt(p.hat*(1-p.hat)/n) wald.ci [1] 0.4642072 0.7357928 Agresti-Coull CI: The improved Agresti-Coull style of CI is of the form $$\tilde p \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\tilde p(1-\tilde p)}{\tilde n}},$$ where $\tilde n =n+4$ and $\tilde p = (X+2)/\tilde n).$ Example: For the data above, this CI is $(0.456, 0.729).$ n.tilde=54; p.hat=32/54; pm=c(-1,1); agresti.ci=p.hat+pm*1.96*sqrt(p.hat*(1-p.hat)/n) agresti.ci [1] 0.4563968 0.7287884 The procedure @Ben (+1) describes can be adapted to give a 95% Bayesian probability interval ('credible interval'), using $\mathsf{Beta}(1,1) \equiv \mathsf{Unif}(0,1)$ as a non-informative prior distribution and a binomial likelihood function proportional to $p^X(1-p)^{n-X}.$ Then the posterior distribution is $\mathsf{Beta}(X+1, n-X+1)$ and the interval estimate has quantiles .025 and .975 of that distribution as its endpoints: $(0.461, 0.724)$ in our example. qbeta(c(.025, .975), 31, 21) [1] 0.461141 0.724157 Note: If you are interested in interval estimation for binomial data, you may want to look at a similar Q & A and the link at the end.
