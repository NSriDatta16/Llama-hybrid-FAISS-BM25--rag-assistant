When Microsoft got the security religion, DCOM (and the underlying RPC) got a lot of attention, and there definitely were changes made to close security holes that resulted in stricter marshaling. I'm suprised you see this in Vista but not in XP, but its possible that additional checks were added for Vista. Alternatively, its possible that optional strictness in XP was made mandatory in Vista. While I don't know enough about MDAC to know if you could have prevented this, I do know that security is one of the few areas where Microsoft is pretty willing to sacrifice backward compatibility, so it is possible you could not have done anything "better" back in 1999.
