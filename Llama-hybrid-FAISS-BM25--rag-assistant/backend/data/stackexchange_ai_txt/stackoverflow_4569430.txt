website acceleration, loading other web pages resource?

I am wondering if such technology exists. In PageA, when the loading is completed, PageA began to load resouces in PageB, which is very likely to be accessed after some time(predict). If the loading is succeeded, then most of the resource in PageB will be already in cache. The resource including swf, js, images, etc. Thanks.
