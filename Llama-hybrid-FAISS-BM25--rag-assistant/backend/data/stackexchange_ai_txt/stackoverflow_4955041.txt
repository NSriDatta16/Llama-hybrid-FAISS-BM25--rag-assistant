I also have same issue, My app is rejected by apple by saying 2.1 Apps that crash will be rejected And they give a crash report, I search and find how to read a crash report. I think this may help you. Drag the crash report to Xcode>Window>organizer>Device logs This will show the crash report as a more readable form. In it some of your app function show as memory locations. The following line help you to find the line of error, Steps to analyze crash report from apple: Copy the release .app file which was pushed to the appstore, the .dSYM file that was created at the time of release and the crash report receive from APPLE into a FOLDER. OPEN terminal application and go to the folder created above (using CD command) atos -arch armv7 -o ' '/' ' . The memory location should be the one at which the app crashed as per the report. Example for Foo.app: atos -arch armv7 -o 'Foo.app'/'Foo' 0x0003b508 This would show you the exact line, method name which resulted in crash.
