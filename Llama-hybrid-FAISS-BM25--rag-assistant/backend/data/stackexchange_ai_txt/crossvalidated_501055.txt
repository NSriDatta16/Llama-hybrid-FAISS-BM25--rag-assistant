What does Rasmussen and Williams find "unexciting" about the Student's t-process?

Section 9.9 of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (aka Rasmussen & Williams), "Student's t Process", contains the following exercise: Exercise Consider the generating process implied by eq. (9.2), and write a program to draw functions at random. Characterize the difference between the Student's t process and the corresponding Gaussian process (obtained in the limit $\alpha \to \infty$ ), and explain why the t process is perhaps not as exciting as one might have hoped. equation 9.2 is $$ \begin{align} \tilde{k}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x'}) = \tau^{-1}k(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x'}), \qquad p(\tau|\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\alpha^\alpha}{\beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)}\tau^{\alpha-1} \exp\left(-\frac{\tau\alpha}{\beta}\right) \end{align} $$ "where k is any valid covariance function", and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the parameters of the t distribution. As one without the skill or ambition to work the exercise, I'm still intrigued â€” what about the sampled functions are we expected to see, and find disappointing?
