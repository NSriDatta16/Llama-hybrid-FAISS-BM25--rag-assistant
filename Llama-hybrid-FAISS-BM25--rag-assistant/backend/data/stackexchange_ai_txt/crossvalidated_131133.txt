Here are some introductory guides on performing time series analysis in R : Introduction to R's Time Series Facilities Working with Financial Time Series Data in R If you're interested in more detailed exploration of the rich variety of R packages, focused on time series analysis, and their functionality, the corresponding CRAN Task View: Time Series Analysis is IMHO the best place to start. Correspondingly, an excellent and one of the most comprehensive R-focused guides on the topic is the "Time Series Analysis with R" by MacLeod, Yu and Mahdi. If you're interested in forecasting in regard to your time series data, the following free and also R-based online textbook "Forecasting: Principles and practice" by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos could be very helpful: https://www.otexts.org/fpp . Bonus / Fun fact: The 2003 Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to professors Robert Engle and Clive Granger for their work on economic time series analysis (volatility and trends, correspondingly). Research paper, summarizing their work and implications can be found here .
