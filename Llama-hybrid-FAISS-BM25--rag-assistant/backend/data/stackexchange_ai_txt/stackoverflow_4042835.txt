Coding field navigation while creating paperless online versions of paper forms using WPF with C# and LinqToXml

Using WPF(with C# and LinqToXml), I am reproducing a paperless version of an existing paper form. The existing form includes some one-character-per-box text strings. I have already duplicated the appearance of the paper form using XAML. How can I add code to a one-character TextBox to automatically send control to the next TextBox once it has been filled(without requiring the user to tab to the next TextBox)? Also, these TextBox sequences facilitate the input of key field values. Once the last one-character TextBox receives a value from the keyboard, how could I code an event trigger to automatically retrieve the appropriate data record field values from the Xml data file? Will I need to include a button on the form, or can I code the form so that the retrieval automatically occurs when the last one-character TextBox has been filled?
