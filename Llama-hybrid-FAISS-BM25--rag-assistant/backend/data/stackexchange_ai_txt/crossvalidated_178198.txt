Regarding an alternative approach, would a zero-inflated model work? A zero-inflated model will account for the fact that there are excess zeros in your model. The punch line is that there are two processes at work: one that generates zeros and one that generates the remainder of your data. This is a contrived (and sort of silly) example, but say you are examining the rates of ovarian cancer and collect a random sample of 1,000 people where 500 of these people are male. Of course males cannot have ovarian cancer, so a response $Y_{cancer}$ will always equal 0 for men. This will bias any sort of estimates due to the overwhelming number of zeros and will render your model less meaningful and less accurate for the question you likely seek to answer. You want to be careful, however. You want to make sure that there is a pragmatic reason for including the zero-inflated piece. If the data generating process genuinely produces a large number of zeros, then a zero-inflated model is inappropriate. If there are ostensibly two processes at work such that one process will generate the majority of the zeros, then a ZIN model may address your concerns. Having a bit more background on the clinical trial and the question you seek to answer might help to clarify whether or not a ZIN model is appropriate.
