Time series analysis with binary outcome

I have two groups (e.g. male/ female) and employment status (yes/no) per individual for 12 months in a row. Status may change every month (e.g. January employed, February unemployed, March employed, April employed....) My intention is to find out whether both groups have a different pattern or not. Any suggestions what approach might be suitable (eventually recommend a R package please).
