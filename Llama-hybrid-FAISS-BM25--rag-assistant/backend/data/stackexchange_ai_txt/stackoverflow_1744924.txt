You need to also copy the controls, and referenced files to the machine running your code. Some controls and referenced files will already be on the machine, but without experience you generally will not know which files are already installed. You can look at the checked files in the Project|References and Projects|Components dialogs to see what is included in your project. You will need to scroll through the components dialog to find all referenced files, but in the references dialog all the references are organized at the top. Also, to confirm what file(s) a machine is missing you can look at the Events log. An error with the missing file will be logged. A drawback of this approach is that you will only get one missing file at a time as the Application quits on the first missing reference encountered. Also MarkJ and Konamiman are both correct in that the VB6 runtimes are required, although it is common for other VB6 programs to have already installed it. If you are not building in-house applications you do not want to take anything granted and should build a complete install for your application.
