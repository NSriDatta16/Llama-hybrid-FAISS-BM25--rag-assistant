A typical machine learning model contains thousands to millions of parameters, while statistical modelling is typically limited to a handful parameters. As a rule of thumb, the minimum an amount of samples you need is proportional to the amount of parameters you want to estimate. So for statistical modelling of a handful of parameters you might only need a hundred samples, while for machine learning with millions of parameters you may need millions of samples.
