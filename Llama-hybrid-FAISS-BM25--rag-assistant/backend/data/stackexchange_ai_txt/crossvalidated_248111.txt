handling metropolis hastings rejection during a Gibbs sweep

Suppose I have a MCMC involving a 2 step Gibbs sampler. The first part uses metropolis hastings to find the next parameter value. If during one sweep, the result for the first part is a rejections, should the process immediately try the first step again until acceptance or simply move down to the second step in the sweep?
