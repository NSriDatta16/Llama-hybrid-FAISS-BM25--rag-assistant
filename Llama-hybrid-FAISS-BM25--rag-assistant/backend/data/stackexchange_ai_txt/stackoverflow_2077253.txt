testing source application in qooxdoo

I began to use Qooxdoo the last month so i've got very little experience in its usage. I need to create a test application like the testrunner on the Qooxdoo website, but i need to do tests inside my application environment. I followed these steps: Created the application Compiled the source version with generate.py source Create the test with generate.py test In this test if i try to access my application it gives me an error because its undefined. Then reading the documentation on the website i've found that this type of tests must be done using generate.py test-source . But running the index-source.html in the test folder the result is the same: the application is not working. What is the right way to this? What did I do wrong?
