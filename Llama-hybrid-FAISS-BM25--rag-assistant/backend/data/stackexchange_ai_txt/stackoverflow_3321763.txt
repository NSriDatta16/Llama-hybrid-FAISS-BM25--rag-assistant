Rails inherited resources usage

I'm using Inherited Resources for my Rails 2.3 web service app. It's a great library which is part of Rails 3. I'm trying to figure out the best practice for outputting the result. class Api::ItemsController It works well when the request is successful. However, when there's any error, I get a "Template is missing" error. @error is basically a hash of message and status, e.g. {:message => "Not authorized", :status => 401} . It seems respond_with only calls to_xml or to_json with the particular model the controller is associated with. What is an elegant way to handle this? I want to avoid creating a template file for each action and each format (create.xml.erb and create.json.erb in this case) Basically I want: /create.json [POST] => {"name": "my name", "id":1} # when successful /create.json [POST] => {"message" => "Not authorized", "status" => 401} # when not authorized Thanks in advance.
