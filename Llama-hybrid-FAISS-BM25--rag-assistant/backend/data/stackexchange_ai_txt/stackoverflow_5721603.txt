Enumerable.Average and OverflowException

Perhaps a useless question: public static double Average ( this IEnumerable source, Func selector ) One of exceptions thrown by the above method is also OverflowException: The sum of the elements in the sequence is larger than Int64.MaxValue. I assume reason for this exception is that sum of the averaged values is computed using variable S of type long ? But since return value is of type double , why didn't designers choose to make S also of type double ? Thank you
