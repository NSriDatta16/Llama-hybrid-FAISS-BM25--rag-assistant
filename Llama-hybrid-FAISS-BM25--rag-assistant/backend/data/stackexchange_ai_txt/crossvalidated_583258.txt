Is this transition probability matrix correct?

A pensioner receives 2 (thousand dollars) at the beginning of each month. The amount of money he needs to spend during a month is independent of the amount he has and is equal to i with probability $P_i, i= 1,2,3,4,\sum_{i=1}^4 P_i =1.$ If the pensioner has more than 3 at the end of a month, he gives the amount greater than 3 to his son. If, after receiving his payment at the beginning of a month, the pensioner has a capital of 5, what is the probability that his capital is ever 1 or less at any time within the following four months? Solution: To find the desired probability, we consider a Markov chain with the state equal to the amount the pensioner has at the end of a month. Because the pensioner will give any end-of-month amount greater than 3 to his son, we need only consider the Markov chain with states 1, 2, 3 and transition probability matrix $Q=[Q_{i,j}]$ given by $$\begin{Vmatrix} P_2 & P_1 & 0 \\ P_3 + P_4 & P_2 & P_1 \\ P_4 & P_3 & P_1 + P_2\end{Vmatrix}$$ Is the above transition probability matrix computed by me correct? If wrong where and why it is wrong? Author's computed transition probability matrix is as follows: $$\begin{Vmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ P_3 + P_4 & P_2 & P_1 \\ P_4 & P_3 & P_1 + P_2 \end{Vmatrix}$$ Is the above transition probability matrix correct? Why did author show $Q_{(1,1)}= 1$ (absorbing state) and $Q_{(1,2)} , Q_{(1,3)}=0$ in the above matrix? Would any member of 'Cross Validated' answer my question with correct explanation?
