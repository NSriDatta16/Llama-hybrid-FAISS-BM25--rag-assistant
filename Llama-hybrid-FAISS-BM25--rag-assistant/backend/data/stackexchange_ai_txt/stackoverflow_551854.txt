This type of URL allows you to use a single template file that specifies common markup, with an included fragment that contains specific text. That included fragment could be an actual file on the filesystem, or it could be a CLOB in a database, with the "page" parameter giving the primary key. As other people have noted, passing an exact path is not at all secure -- don't do it. At best, it can be used to probe your website and retrieve non-public content. At worst, it can turn your website into an unwitting proxy for content that you don't want legally associated with you. Somewhere in between, it might provide a hacker the ability to physically insert new content into your site. A safer approach is to use the database table, or (for smaller sites), an in-memory page table. Here's the code that I use to access the page table for my personal website: $pageName = (array_key_exists("page", $_GET)) ? $_GET["page"] : null; $currentPage = (array_key_exists($pageName, $pagetab)) ? $pagetab[$pageName] : $pagetab["home"];
