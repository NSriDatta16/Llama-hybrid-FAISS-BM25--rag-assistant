What's more important - there's very few datapoints behind this curve. When you do decide how you're going to make the sensitivity/specificity tradeoff I'd strongly encourage you to bootstrap the curve and the resulting cutoff number. You may find that there's a lot of uncertainty in your estimated best cutoff.
