Generic Collections, Member Classes, Design Pattern question for VB.NET

I have a class called Person: Public Class Person Private PersonID as String Private Name as String Private Records as GenericCollection(Of PublicRecord) Public Sub New(ByVal ID as String) Me.PersonID = ID Me.Name = getPersonName(ID) End Sub 'Get/Sets End Class getPersonName is simply a function that does exactly as it is described. GenericCollection class is as follows: Public Class GenericCollection(Of ItemType) Inherits CollectionBase ' Purpose: Provides a generic collection class from which all other collections ' classes can be inherited if they wish to extend the functionality below. #Region "Public Methods" Public Function Add(ByVal NewObject As ItemType) As Integer Return MyBase.InnerList.Add(NewObject) End Function Public Sub New() MyBase.New() End Sub #End Region #Region "Public Properties" Default Public Property Item(ByVal Index As Integer) As ItemType Get Return CType(MyBase.InnerList(Index), ItemType) End Get Set(ByVal value As ItemType) MyBase.InnerList(Index) = value End Set End Property #End Region End Class PublicRecord class is: Public Class PublicRecord Private RecordID As String Private RecordDataOne As String Private RecordDataTwo As String Public Sub New() MyBase.New() End Sub 'Get/Sets End Class One of the requirements I've been told can be done is that I should be able to grab all Persons in a Collection of Persons, then since all of those Persons will have Collectinos of Records within them... grab a specific set of data from the Collection of Records. We'll say, I want to: getPersonsOverAge21() from the Collection of Records inside each Person inside the Collection of Persons. Is this even possible? If so, can someone explain how it would work?
