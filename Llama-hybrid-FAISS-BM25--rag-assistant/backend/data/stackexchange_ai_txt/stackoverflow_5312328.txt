The Extensible Storage Engine api is quite old. The docs for it have been retired, it think it was deprecated back in 2001. The header file is still available in the SDK only to support legacy code. I can get your code built with Visual Studio. If you really want to pursue this then you'd be wise to use an MSVC compiler and the MSFT version of the Windows SDK. You can download the C++ Express edition of Visual Studio for free, it should have everything you need to build this. Investing time into this isn't a very good idea.
