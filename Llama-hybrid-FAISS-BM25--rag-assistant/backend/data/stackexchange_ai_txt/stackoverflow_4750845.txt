How do you annotate a branch?

Is there any way to annotate a branch? It would be nice to be able to do something like: $ git notes add branch-name -m 'This branch is for whatever' but that of course is not terribly helpful, since the note applies to the current head of the branch rather than the branch itself. An easy workaround is to drop a README.branch-name in the repository, but that seems clumsy. Slightly more elegant is to have an orphaned branch containing nothing but README.branch-names. I'm looking for a way to record what the purpose of the branch is other than just putting it in the commit message for the "first" commit of the branch. I put "first" in quotes because it's not always clear what is meant by that, which is the reason it is inconvenient to put the discussion in a commit message. It's often difficult to find the commit in which such a message is recorded.
