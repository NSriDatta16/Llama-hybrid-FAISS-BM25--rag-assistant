SQLite3 object not understood?

Now I'm geting an error: 1>c:\development\document_manager\document_manager\storage_manager.h(7) : error C2079: 'storage_manager::db' uses undefined struct 'sqlite3' with #pragma once #include "sqlite3.h" class storage_manager { sqlite3 db; sqlite3** db_pp; public: void open() { sqlite3_open("data.db", db_pp); } }; Old Question: Hi everyone. I downloaded sqlite-amalgamation-3_6_13.zip from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html , but I'm not able to compile it in my project. I receive many errors like: c:\pathtoproject\sqlite3.c(11337) : error C2440: '=' : cannot convert from 'void *' to 'char *' Conversion from 'void*' to pointer to non-'void' requires an explicit cast c:\pathtoproject\sqlite3.c(12023) : error C2440: '=' : cannot convert from 'void *' to 'sqlite3_int64 *' Conversion from 'void*' to pointer to non-'void' requires an explicit cast What do I need to do to compile my project properly? Thanks! Edit: I don't want to compile the whole program as C, I just want to compile three files as c, is this possible? EDIT: FIXED! I created an new project.
