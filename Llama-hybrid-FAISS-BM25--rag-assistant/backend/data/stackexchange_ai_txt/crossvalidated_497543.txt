The number of clusters problem is generally difficult and depends (as the problem of selecting a suitable clustering method) on the meaning of the data and the aim of clustering. Some methods produce better separated clusters that are less homogeneous, some others produce more homogeneous clusters that are less separated, and you may also be interested in other characteristics of clusters such as their distributional shape. Regarding the number of clusters, it is generally very hard to compare very different numbers of clusters (such as 4 vs. 20); most criteria are not well calibrated to do this,and anyway in some applications a large number of clusters (say 25 or 100 or even more) may be useless whereas in some other applications it may be required and splitting up the data into 2-4 clusters would be much to rough. What to do depends on what requirements a cluster needs to fulfill in your specific situation. There are a number of criteria that can be optimised to find a good number of clusters such as the average silhouette width https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377042787901257 There are also a number of R-packages that have more such criteria, such as clValid, clusterCrit, and the cluster.stats function in fpc. Here several such criteria are listed: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clusterCrit/vignettes/clusterCrit.pdf As I wrote, which one to use depends on your specific situation. One possibility to explore and interpret the clusters once you have them is to look at the distribution of your variables within the clusters.
