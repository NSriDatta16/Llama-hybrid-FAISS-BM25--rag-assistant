Arg! We did that here for some code too. I hate that. Is there seriously any confusion there about who signs your paychecks? What happens when Company gets bought by OtherCorp , or the marketing department decides that Technology will henceforth be known as eTech ? How much code will have to be changed? Generally, I'm anti-use. But in situations like this, where the namespaces should probably never have been made in the first place and you are just saving yourself future code changes, I encourage the following line instead of sticking that huge wart in front of every reference: using Company::Technology; Namespaces should generally be created when you have several related classes and objects that you are tempted to stick the same name in their identifier. That way, instead of referring to them as foo_operation and foo_class you do foo::operation and foo::class .
