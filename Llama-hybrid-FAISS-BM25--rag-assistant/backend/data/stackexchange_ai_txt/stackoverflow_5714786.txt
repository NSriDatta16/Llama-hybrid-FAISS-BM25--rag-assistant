ASP.Net not populating Request.Files on receiving multipart data

I'm sending files from an android app to a asp.net webform using multipart/form-data as the content type. However the Request.files property does not get populated. Reading the Request object I get the following Request.Params("ALL_HTTP") "HTTP_CONNECTION:Keep-Alive HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH:8913 HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE:multipart/form-data;boundary= * ** * ** * ** * ** * ** * ** * **** HTTP_HOST:192.168.1.2 HTTP_USER_AGENT:Dalvik/1.2.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2; sdk Build/FRF91) " The HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH shows the correct length. I guess I will have to do a binary read and then parse the content and store the file contents. Has anyone done this before or is there a library/class available? Thanks
