You are right that looking at correlations on their own would be erroneous. This is because time series tend to demonstrate both autocorrelation and cross-correlation over time. e.g. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 and the height of a 5-year old child back in 2010 have both since increased - but the two have no theoretical connection to each other. Instead, you want to test whether such correlations actually have theoretical relevance. One way of doing this is the two-step Engle-Granger cointegration test. The null hypothesis of this test is no cointegration. You could implement this test using Python: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.stattools.coint.html As an example, let's consider monthly data for the Euribor benchmark rates obtained from: https://datahub.io/core/euribor Here is a snippet of the data: >>> coin_result = ts.coint(rate1, rate2) >>> coin_result (-2.8260965381927488, 0.15752245371775692, array([-3.94714772, -3.36417226, -3.06387292])) Here, the p-value is 0.15 , which implies that no cointegration is present at the 5% level of significance. -2.82 is the cointegration score, while -3.94 , -3.36 , -3.06 are the respective scores at the 5%, 10%, and 15% levels of significance.
