This is not lazy loading , it's deferred execution . When you define your initial enumerable, you're defining a query , not a collection . You're correct that it's performing a requery; every time you iterate over favAgents , it will execute the query that you defined. If you want to create a list based off of that query that doesn't change, add ToList() . var favAgents = (from agt in builtAgents where agt.DefaultNr == 1 select agt).ToList(); Doing this will create a list in memory and cache the results of the query at that point in time.
