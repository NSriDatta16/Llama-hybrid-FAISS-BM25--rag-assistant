A good book is the one by Fahrmeir et al https://www.amazon.com/Multivariate-Statistical-Modelling-Generalized-Statistics/dp/0387951873/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1506715879&sr=1-1 "Multivariate Statistical Modelling Based on Generalized Linear Models (second edition)", maybe not for a first treatment, but for various extensions of the basic model and coverage of computational algorithms. As the title says, multivariate extensions, semiparametric approaches (splines) and extensions to time series, and more.
