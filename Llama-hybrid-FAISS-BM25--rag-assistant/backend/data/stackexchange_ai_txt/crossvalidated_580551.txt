Stationarity - Model vs Time-series

What is the difference, if there are any, between checking for stationarity in a time series and then in a model (for example an AR model), which is built on that data. I recently encountered that problem reading some literature, where they double checked it, which was quite confusing for me. Can a model be stationary if the time series is not and vice versa? Or does the stationarity of the model imply such for the time-series?
