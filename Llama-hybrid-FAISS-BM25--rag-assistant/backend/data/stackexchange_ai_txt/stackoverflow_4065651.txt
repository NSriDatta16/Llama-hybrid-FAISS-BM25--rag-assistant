typedef longUnderstandableName sn; Then you can define the methods as void sn::MethodA() {} void sn::MethodB() {} and use them as sn::MethodA(); sn::MethodB(); This only works if longUnderstandableName is the name of a class. It works even if the class is deeply embedded in some other namespace. If longUnderstandableName is the name of a namespace, then in the namespace (or source file) where you want to use the methods, you can write using namespace longUnderstandableName; and then call methods like MethodA(); MethodB(); You should be careful not to use a using namespace foo; in header files, because then it pollutes every .cpp file that we #include the header file into, however using a using namespace foo; at the top of a .cpp file is definitely allowed and encouraged.
