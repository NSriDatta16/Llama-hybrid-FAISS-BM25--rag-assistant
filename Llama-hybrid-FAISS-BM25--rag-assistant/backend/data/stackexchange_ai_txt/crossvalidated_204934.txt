You don't have to use the cases where customers spent nothing on a particular service. Depending on what program you use, you can filter to only include cases where customers spent more than 0 Â£/$/etc on a service and run your analysis on the filtered data set. If you want to account for the differences in use between services, you could calculate average spend per (paying) customer for each service and then weight it, for example by percentage of customers using this service. But if you wanted to examine how profitable a service is, you will also need to include costs and you will have to consider which part of these costs is fixed and which will change dependent on the number of customers using it.
