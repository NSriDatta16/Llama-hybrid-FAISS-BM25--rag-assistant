Store users hashed PW in localstorage?

I'm writing a web app for 100 users where I work. It is accessible on the internet, not just our intranet. Many users are unskilled users, though most use Chrome as that's the browser that's default on their laptops. To auth with the web app this is a potential plan: User enters password Password is sent to server Password is hashed and compared with the stored hash If password is right, the browser stores the password in local storage If the users session cookie has expired, javascript posts the stored password on first view so the user doesn't have to reauthenticate Is this a good idea?
