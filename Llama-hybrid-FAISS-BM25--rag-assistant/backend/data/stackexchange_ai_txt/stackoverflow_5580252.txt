The article http://mysqldump.azundris.com/archives/60-Handling-character-sets.html discusses this at length and also shows what will happen. Please note that you are mixing up a CHARACTER SET (actually an encoding) with a COLLATION. A character set defines the physical representation of a string in bytes on disk. You can make this visible, using the HEX() function, for example SELECT HEX(str) FROM t WHERE id = 1 to see how MySQL stores the bytes of your string. What MySQL delivers to you may be different, depending on the character set of your connection, defined with SET NAMES .... . A collation is a sort order. It is dependent on the character set. For example, your data may be in the latin1 character set, but it may be ordered according to either of the two german sort orders latin1_german1_ci or latin1_german2_ci. Depending on your choice, Umlauts such as รถ will either sort as oe or as o. When you are changing a character set, the data in your table needs to be rewritten. MySQL will read all data and all indexes in the table, make a hidden copy of the table which temporarily takes up disk space, then moves the old table into a hidden location, moves the hidden table into place and then drops the old data, freeing up disk space. For some time inbetween, you will need two times the storage for that. When you are changing a collation, the sort order of the data changes but not the data itself. If the column you are changing is not part of an index, nothing needs to be done besides rewriting the frm file, and sufficiently recent versions of MySQL should not do more. When you are changing a collation of a column that is part of an index, the index needs to be rewritten, as an index is a sorted excerpt of a table. This will again trigger the ALTER TABLE table copy logic outlined above. MySQL tries to preserve data doing this: As long as the data you have can be represented in the target character set, the conversion will not be lossy. Warnings will be printed if there is data truncation going on, and data which cannot be represented in the target character set will be replaced by ?
