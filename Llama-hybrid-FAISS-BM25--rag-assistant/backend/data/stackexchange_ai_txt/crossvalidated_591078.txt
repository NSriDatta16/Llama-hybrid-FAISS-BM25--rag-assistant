I can answer my own question thanks to the great clear help from Wolfgang Viechtbauer over on the r meta-analysis forum where I also asked this question. Answer in-depth here: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-meta-analysis/2022-October/004236.html The issue came down to two things, transposed from Wolfgang's answer above: My data is paired and so the RoM needs to account for the correlated nature of the data. Use of ROMC as the effect measure solves this, and requires a correlation parameter ri . Detailed here - Lajeunesse 2011 as referenced on escalc page Because the effect calculation now accounts for the correlation, the precision is much greater, i.e. the confidence intervals are much tighter. This now means my issues with variance calculation being too precise are no longer an issue. Wolfgang provided the answer there too, with one I had also tried but discarded thinking it wasn't right. Turns out it was: effect = yi = log(Mean of Ratios) = $log(mean_{LSI})$ variance = vi = $\frac{SD_{LSI}^2}{(n \times mean_{LSI}^2)}$ Thanks to Wolfgang!
