Bayesian MLPs using the MCMC methods - any tricks of the trade?

Having used the NETLAB library for MATLAB to implement Bayesian Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using MacKay's evidence framework, I am now experimenting with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods using metrop() and hmc(). Does anyone have any advice for successful modelling using this approach (preferably using NETLAB), e.g. how to set the parameters to get good mixing and acceptably low rejection ratios etc? Has anybody used the Metrpolois-Hastings or HMC samplers for applications of MLP neural networks? I'm beginning to think that perhaps everybody just uses the evidence framework!
