Make sure you followed Step 1 and Step 2 of http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Atomikos (assuming you are using Atomikos 3.3 and onwards). Then, for the Step 3 , pay a special attention to this note: as the NonXADataSourceBean uses only the class name and url of a java.sql.Driver , you can use it with any database providing a JDBC driver. So your current setup contains too much things but, more important, the driver class name looks wrong, it should be org.postgresql.Driver . But the PostgreSQL JDBC driver does support XADatasource (with the org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource implementation) so I'd rather configure a AtomikosDataSourceBean (the first option of Step 3 ). Something like that: jdbc/mydatasource 2 20 org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource databaseName testdb serverName localhost portNumber 5432 user test password p4ssw0rd /Call> mydatasource
