Data Mining/Retrieval Question

Our SQL Server 2005 database has nearly 100 different tables. We are going to provide a feature to search some information according to the user defined filters. Our filter configuration going to be quite complicated. A user can easily create a filter that joins over 20 tables with complicated conditions. In order to reduce the complexity of the joining, we are planning to create couple of SQL Server views. But that solution itself doesn't seems to be enough to simplify the SQL. We are going to generate the SQL according to the filter configuration. The SQL will be generated dynamically. (I am not sure how long that SQL would beâ€¦ Is there any maximum length for SqlCommand?) SP is another option... Have you come across a similar situation? Do you have any good advise/solution for me? Thank you!
