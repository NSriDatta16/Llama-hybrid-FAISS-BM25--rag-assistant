In addition to the STL container, it might be the libc itself doing so (the new/delete - malloc/free implementation). Userspace libraries are at liberty to retain memory for later reuse. Allocating / deallocating is an expensive operation (in terms of clock cycles), so many implementations try to avoid this.
