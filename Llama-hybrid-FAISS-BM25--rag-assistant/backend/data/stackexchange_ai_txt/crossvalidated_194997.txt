Hierarchical clustering will usually not compute a representative object? Because that costs time and is not needed for the algorithm. Even "centroid" linkage does not compute the position of the centroid. Thus. don't look for such a function - it does not exist. If you want a representative object. roll your own logic. For example, the object with the least average or least squared average distance to all others of the same cluster, or the arithmetic mean (if you have coordinates) could be of interest.
