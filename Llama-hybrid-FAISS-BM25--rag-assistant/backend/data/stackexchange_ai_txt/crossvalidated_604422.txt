The typical approach is to fit your model, but your problem is that you don't even have a model. So the question is more like a modelling problem than a statistics problem. This requires domain knowledge. Logistic regression seems valid, but having it reach 1 as time progresses is not desired. Fitting a logistic growth curve doesn't need to end up at a fixed final level of 1. A problem is that the motivation for logistic growth may not be not very strong. The model relates to a differential equation $$f^\prime \, = \, \frac{k}{a} f(a-f) \, = \, kf - \frac{k}{a} f^2 \, \underbrace{\approx \, k f}_{\text{if $f \ll a$}}$$ It can be seen as an exponential growth model where the growth rate is a second order polynomial instead of first order. For small values or large values the model will be approximately following an exponential curve. If there is no direct motivation then the models might still fit and predict well for short time scales because growth is more or less linear on a small time scale anyway. But does it matter in that case (a small order polynomial model fit) that we use a model for exponential growth? On the one hand no: Either the extrapolation to 0.5 will only be a short time and a linear model will be fine as well, or the extrapolation will be a long time away and the logistic model may not be accurate. The latter situation will be the case when the growth rate stagnates close to a 0.5 value. On the other hand yes: The potential use of the logistic curve can be to fit a model where the value stagnates around 0.5 or something close, and the question revolves around the question when the random fluctuations will first create a situation where there is a year that more women than men enter.
