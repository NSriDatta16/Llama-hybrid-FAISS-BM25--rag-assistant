@Perri Ma .Factor analysis won't work because it is predominantly a dimension reduction technique rather than predictive modelling. There are multiple ways to go about it 1) Statistics : Use logistic regression the glm package in R serves that. It is the most common method used for the type of problems that you asked. 2) Machine Learning methods : Basically what you want to do is predictive classification, i.e predicting accepted or terminated. The most common methods here are SVM( Support Vector Machine), Neural Networks,Decision Trees. I suggests you start with building logistic regression model first then read into the machine learning methods. Even though the concepts of ML methods are bit difficult at first but there lots of packages to implement and result interpretation is quite easy
