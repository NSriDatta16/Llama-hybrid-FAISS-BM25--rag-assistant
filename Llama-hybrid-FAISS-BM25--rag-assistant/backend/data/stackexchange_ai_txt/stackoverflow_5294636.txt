If you want to build a community driven website on Joomla, then Jomsocial is by far your best bet. Community builder is harder to use, not as intuitive for the user, and does not have near the feature set. It is a very good product, a great dev team, and large community. If you want to see how well it works, look no further than the official Joomla site - http://people.joomla.org/ . I have used it for several sites and I am very pleased with it. I wouldn't consider WP for any site other than a blog. While it can be extended, it is not really a framework designed as a platform for extensions. Joomla and Drupal are much more suited for that task. Once you go beyond a blog site, WP admin is not particularly elegant and can be unwieldy. The cost of Jomsocial is a small price to pay for a high quality product.
