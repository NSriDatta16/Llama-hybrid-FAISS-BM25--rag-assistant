Q1 : Is there a way to represent variable elements in a [database] table? I assume you mean something like this? from | to_1 | to_2 | to_3 | to_4 | to_5 | etc... 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | NULL | NULL | etc... This is not a good idea. It violates first normal form . Q2 : Is there any general way to represent the graph structure using database? For a directed graph you can use a table edges with two columns: nodeid_from nodeid_to 1 2 1 3 1 4 If there is any extra information about each node (such as a node name) this can be stored in another table nodes . If your graph is undirected you have two choices: store both directions (i.e. store 1->2 and 2->1) use a constraint that nodeid_from must be less than nodeid_to (i.e. store 1->2 but 2->1 is implied). The former requires twice the storage space but can make querying easier and faster.
