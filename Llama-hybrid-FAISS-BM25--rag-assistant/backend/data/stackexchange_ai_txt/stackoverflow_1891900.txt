It's probably because people are used to what it was built for, as described in the perl documentation , so it has become commonplace for many people to associate parsing of text files with Perl. Not to exclude Ruby or Python, it's just more of a household name IMHO. Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on that information. It's also a good language for many system management tasks. The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).
