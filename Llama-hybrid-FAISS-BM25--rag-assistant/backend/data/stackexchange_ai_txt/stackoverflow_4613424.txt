Write tests for the library such that all the lines of the code is covered(i.e 100% Coverage). Use TDD . Start from the higher level module and re-factor(Top to Bottom approach). Run the tests mentioned in step 1. and verify with the results of step 2. I understand that 100% coverage(as mentioned in step 1) does not necessarily mean that all the features have been covered at least we are making sure that whatever the o/p of the current system will be same as the o/p of new system.
