I am loading css file in Flex 3 AIR application. While reading the style name, I am lowercase version of it (i.e, .NewFontStyle is converted to .newfontstyle ) how to get name as mentioned in css file. my code: private var prefsCSS:StyleSheet = new StyleSheet(); private function ReadStylesCSS():void { fileStream.open(appStorageDirFile,FileMode.READ); prefsCSS.parseCSS(fileStream.readUTFBytes(fileStream.bytesAvailable)); fileStream.close(); } I get my style names in prefsCSS.styleNames by looping through it. for each (var item:String in prefsCSS.styleNames) { var stylename:String=item; } by this iam getting all styleNames in lower case only.. i need to get the name as mentioned in css file Thanks in advance
