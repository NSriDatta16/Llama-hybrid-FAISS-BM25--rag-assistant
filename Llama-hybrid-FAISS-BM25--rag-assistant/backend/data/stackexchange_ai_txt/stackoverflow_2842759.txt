My general approach is to put user configuration entries in to a database (centralised in our case, but equally applicable as a local store). However, there are exceptions to this and I store the following in a text-based file (app.config usually): Details of how to connect to the database (I prefer to have this in the config file, rather than use a convention). Any setting that could potentially stop the application from starting correctly. If there are settings that could 'break' the startup, the user should be able to access them without using the software -- at a text-based storage is best. In code, I write a single configuration class that 'knows' whether a configuration entry is stored in the text file, or in the database; this allows me to move a configuration from one to the other without breaking all references to it.
