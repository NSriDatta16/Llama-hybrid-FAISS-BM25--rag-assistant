Why is logistic regression called a machine learning algorithm?

If I understood correctly, in a machine learning algorithm, the model has to learn from its experience, i.e when the model gives the wrong prediction for the new cases, it must adapt to the new observations, and in time, the model becomes increasingly better. I don't see that the logistic regression has this characteristic. So why is it still regarded as a machine learning algorithm? What is the difference between logistic regression with the normal regression in term of "learning"? I have the same question for random forests! And what is the definition of "machine learning"?
