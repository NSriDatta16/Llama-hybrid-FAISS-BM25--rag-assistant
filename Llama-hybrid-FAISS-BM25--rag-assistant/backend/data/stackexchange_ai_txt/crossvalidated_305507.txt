These micro and macro averaging techniques are typically made for situations with more than 2 classes. With two classes you would only compute precision, recall, F1 or whatever you are interested in (you tell us! We cannot know) with regard to almost always your minority class (since it almost always is the one you're interested in). If these averaging techniques use arithmetic means (on the micro or macro level), the other non 0 value will make the average larger than 0 as in $(0 + 5)/2=2.5$. If they used geometric averages (which is very uncommon), then $\sqrt{0\times5}=0$
