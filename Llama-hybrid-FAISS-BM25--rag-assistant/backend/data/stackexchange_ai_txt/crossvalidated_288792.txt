Applications of HLM/mixed effect models in various setting/grouping methods?

I have read through most of the threads on this forum and several must-read materials on HLM/mixed effect models. Most empirical settings where people use this method focused on education (i.e. student-> class -> school) or natural grouping process as a result of social-economic segregation (i.e. residents -> county -> nation). What about cases where level-2 (organization) exerts considerable somewhat more coercive influence on level-1 outcomes (individual), i.e. facilities nested under/owned by parent firm or employees working for the same company? Can HLM/mixed effect be applied in the same way or are there any caveats in doing so, statistically? P.S. My data is cross-classified: each facility (level-1) is owned by a parent firm (level-2a) and resides in a geographical location (level-2b). My worry here is whether level-2a is at all reasonable statistically since it's a "ownership" relationship. My # of groups as well as variations on either level in the dataset are both quite large. Anyone could help? Leads on similar empirical evidence in prior research would also be extremely useful. Thank you!
