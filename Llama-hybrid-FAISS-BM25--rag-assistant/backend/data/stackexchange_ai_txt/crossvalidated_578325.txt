Sum of probabilities of all samples gives the total volume?

I am working on a churn problem (binary classification - whether a customer will churn or not). Now using logistic regression, I get the probability whether the customer will churn or not. Can I add up these probabilities (rows are distinct per user) to get the total volume of predicted churn? (expected value of the total number of users that will churn)? How would I prove this statistically? $$ E(X) = \sum_{x=1}^{n} x_i P(x_i)$$ $$ where \ X:churn\ volume, x_i = 1 \ (1 \ for \ every \ user), P(x_i):probability \ from \ the \ classification \ model $$ Does this look right? Or what might be the right working? Does the equations change when there is a class imbalance. Please correct me or point me in the right direction
