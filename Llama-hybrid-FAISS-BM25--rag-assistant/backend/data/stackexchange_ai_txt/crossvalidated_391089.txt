Since These are categories you should straight go for Chi-Sq test, i don't understand what duplicate values you are talking about. If you can make the Contingency table from this data this would be like this. The Values are as per your data. Please explain what duplicate values you are talking about and whats your hypothesis. UPDATE: First this is a sample data and second this only a contingency table not the chisq result. But one thing can be done if you take smoker to be a binary target variable and lazy to be independent variable and run a logistic regression and check the p-value of independent variable and then you can calculate odds, and also derive some relationship if exist.
