Maximum Value of Kernel Function in ABC

Are there cases where a kernel function, must have 1 as the maximum value ?? The definition of a Kernel can be found in the following link, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)#In_non-parametric_statistics For example, in Approximate Bayesian Computing (ABC), we approximate the true likelihood of the data with the following integral $$\int K_{h}(x_{true}-x)p(x|\theta)dx$$ where $x_{true}$ is our observed data, and $p(x|\theta)$ the model from which we sample. In this case, can we assume that $K_{h}(x_{true}-x)$ is a weight function, so the sum across all $x$ has to be 1, so we can assume that the maximum value of $K_{h}(x_{true}-x)$ is 1? Because it is known that a scaled kernel, in general, is no constrained to have a maximum value of 1. But in the case of the ABC approximation, should it have 1 as each maximum value?
