Visual Studio includes the MASM macro assembler. Smaller fragments of assembler code are often written in inline assembly in a C or C++ program. To integrate an assembler file in a Visual Studio project, create a regular C/C++ project (command line or GUI), and just add a file ending in .asm to the list of source files. To specify clear as the entry point, follow these instructions: Open the project's Property Pages dialog box. For details, see Setting Visual C++ Project Properties. Click the Linker folder. Click the Advanced property page. Modify the Entry Point property. (It was taken from the Visual Studio documentation .) I can confirm Hans Passant's instruction. In addition, according to this article , if you first add the "build customizations" masm checkbox, and then add the file, it will automatically be recognized as an assembler file. Furthermore, not specifying the entry point name in the END directive, but instead specifying it in the project settings also works for me.
