Setting (or Reading) value of Cursor/Caret in HTML TextArea

I am trying (and failing) to implement a drag&drop mechanism into an HTML textarea. Drag&Drop mechanism is relatively easy with jQuery or Scriptaculous (we use both), so I am willing to accept an answer that uses either of these two. Problem is, I cannot seem to find a way to read or set the insertion point. What I ultimately want to be able to do is determine the drop location, do some kind of mathematical calculation to determine where on the textarea that is exactly, then set the caret position (or insertion point), and place (insert) dropped text there. I can handle the calculations, I just need to know how the heck to read and set the caret position (which will ultimately be my insertion point for the dropped text). Is this even possible? Thanks -
