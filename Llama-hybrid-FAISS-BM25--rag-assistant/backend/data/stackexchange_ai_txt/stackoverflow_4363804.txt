Add a custom attribute with magento store

Hi I need to add a custom attribute with the store in magento. Now when we are adding a new store to website it just ask 1) Website 2) Name 3) Root Category. Along with these i need to add an extra info about the store for example description about the store etc.. ie I need to add zip code with the store to inform the store is actually placed in the particular region.So that i can query the stores in a particular region using the zip code. Thanks in advance.....
