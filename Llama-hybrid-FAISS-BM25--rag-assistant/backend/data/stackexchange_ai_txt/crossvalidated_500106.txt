Help with time series comparisons using periodograms

I have a dataset consisting of time series signals of different lengths obtained from different groups of patients. I am trying to understand the commonalities of the time series of each group. Firstly, I am confused if I am supposed to filter my signals to get rid of any frequencies above the sampling frequency/2, and if so, which filter to use for this (sampling frequency=32Hz) - note my time series is somewhat noisy. Secondly, I wanted to look at the periodogram and the average power spectral density at each frequency within a group - but I am not sure if I understand the periodogram very well - if I have different time series lengths then my periodogram length will vary too, so I am not sure how this comparison can be made. Being from Pure Math, I know Fourier analysis purely from the perspective of functions and using Fourier transforms to obtain the coefficients that describe the projection of these functions onto an orthonormal system. With periodograms however, I noticed that the x-axis represents sample frequencies. I am confused with the distinction between sampling frequencies vs. underlying frequencies of the generating function (say I have $sin(2\pi x)$ sampled at 10Hz, does the periodogram characterize the 1Hz underlying frequency of the function?) Any resources on understanding how to analyze and remove noisy components of time signals from a machine learning perspective would be much appreciated! Due to time constraints, I have shied away from long textbooks on digital signal processing. Thanks a lot.
