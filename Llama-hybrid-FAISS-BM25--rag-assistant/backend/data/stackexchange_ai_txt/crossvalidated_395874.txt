Detect stationary section in an overall non-stationary time series

I'm working with a time series data from neuron firing rate. This time series is usually overall non-stationary due to experimental noise. However, I want to extract stationary section in this overall non-stationary time series. People in the field usually just distinguish stationary section manually. However, I want to implement a program that can automatically extract stationary section from a time series. Can you suggest some statistics test or algorithms that can regconize stationary section in a time series? For example, in this graph, I want to extract the stationary section from 400 to 1200. Thank you very much!
