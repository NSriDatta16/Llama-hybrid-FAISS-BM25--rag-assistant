I like keeping most of my icons as background images and padding the text off from the left to adjust. When there's something that needs attention (such as a warning), you pretty much need a text-based method to convey that information for accessibility's sake, even if you find ways to hide it in the CSS. I'm against using spans or other elements because it's just not semantic and they aren't necessary. When I'm building sprites, I always make sure to keep all the icons on the right edge of the sprite so they never have the opportunity to expose rogue sprites (and for variable height issues, you either have to give them plenty of space to grow or put them bottom-right).
