Even for personal projects, if they become bigger than something you write a few hours, a version control system will be very beneficial. Here are a few good points: Many version control systems have good integration with IDEs. Branching will allow you to experiment without the fear of having to take a long time to revert the changes. The branch can later be merged to the main trunk if needed. Having a history of changes can be helpful, and tagging will allow setting milestones. More efficient storage than full backups using regular copying of files. Extra metadata (such as commit comments) can be attached. Many version control systems are free! I personally use a Subversion server running on my system which I access via the Subclipse plug-in in Eclipse, which I find to be very helpful in keeping track of my personal projects. If you're interested in Subversion, Version Control with Subversion is a very helpful source in learning about the concepts, and how to set up and get started with Subversion. Version control systems may be a little difficult at first, but it's definitely worth the effort to set up!
