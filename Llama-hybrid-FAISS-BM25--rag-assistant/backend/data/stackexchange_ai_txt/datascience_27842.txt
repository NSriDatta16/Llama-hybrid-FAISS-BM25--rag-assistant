Kernel with complex vectors

I have a question regarding my machine learning lecture where we had to decide whether $$K(x,y)=x_1y_1-x_2y_2$$ is a valid kernel (e.g. for a SVM). My intuition would say that it is a valid kernel since we can display it with: $$\Phi(x)=(x_1, ix_2)\implies K(x,y)=\Phi(x)\Phi(y)$$ with $i$ being the imaginary number. Is that right?
