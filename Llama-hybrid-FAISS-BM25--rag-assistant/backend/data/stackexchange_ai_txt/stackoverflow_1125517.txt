using wget against protected site with NTLM

Trying to mirror a local intranet site and have found previous questions using 'wget'. It works great with sites that are anonymous, but I have not been able to use it against a site that is expecting username\password (IIS with Integrated Windows Authentication). Here is what I pass in: wget -c --http-user='domain\user' --http-password=pwd http://local/site -dv Here is the debug output (note I replaced some with dummy values obviously): Setting --verbose (verbose) to 1 DEBUG output created by Wget 1.11.4 on Windows-MSVC. --2009-07-14 09:39:04-- http://local/site Host `local' has not issued a general basic challenge.
