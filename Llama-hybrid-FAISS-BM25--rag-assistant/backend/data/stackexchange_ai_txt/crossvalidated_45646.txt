You simply don't have enough information. According to the usual definitions, the $70\%$ accuracy rate of the classifier is not the average of the probabilities assigned to the correct class. It is the frequency with which the classifier predicts that the correct class has the highest probability. This can mean that the correct category is assigned a probability of $10\%$ while several other categories are assessed at $8\%$. You can mix your classifier with a clueless classifier, which assigns every category the same probability regardless of the inputs, and the mixture will have the same accuracy rate as the original, but it will make different probability estimates.
