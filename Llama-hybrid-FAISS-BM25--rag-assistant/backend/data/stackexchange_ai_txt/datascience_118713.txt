Does order matter in this causal language model?

Say you've implemented a causal language model like so: def get_causal_xy(data, max_len=8): xs=[] ys=[] index = 0 for i in range(len(data) - max_len): xs.append(data[index: min(len(data), index + max_len)]) ys.append(data[index+1: min(len(data), index + max_len + 1)]) index = index + 1 return xs, ys would then order matter. Say you have A,B,C,D words and youre trying to find P(y) would P(y | A, B, C, D) be the same as P(y | C , B , A , D)? My hunch is yes, because you still have access to the same words, and casual language model like this simple one doesnt use positional encoding
