(Note: I don't know VHDL, I'm just going by what I found in the Qualis VHDL Quick Reference Card .) Line 33 appears to be here: module2_1: a_n_d port map( x(1) => x(0), y(0) => x(1), f => sigand1 after 3 ns); It appears that the after clause can only appear in statements with , not => . The error you're getting essentially means that the compiler didn't expect to see after at that point, and instead showed you what it was expecting (which usually isn't terribly helpful).
