Windows Phone 7 States

I know about tombstoning stuff any how to save the states of your application but my question is this regarding states. Let's say I have a page that have 5 buttons. Whenever I click a button the button can be either visible or hidden. How do I save the current state or the saved state of my page? Let's say if I exit my application and loaded the 5 buttons again one button should be hidden. I tried saving a variable state value in an IsolatedStorageFile and retrieve it when the Page is loaded in loaded event but I figured out that it's too tedious for the processor to do a lot of things just for saving a state. Another solution I thought of is when the Loaded event is fired, I will statically declare an if else statements and manually declare the Visibility of the button. Is there any other way?
