You can't assume anything about the order of the bytes that represent Bar. If the file goes across system or that program is compiled with different flags then you'll be reading and writing in different orders. I've seen a way around this, but it may only work for very simple types. and I quote from a raknet tutorial: #pragma pack(push, 1) struct structName { unsigned char typeId; // Your type here // Your data here }; #pragma pack(pop) Noticed the #pragma pack(push,1) and #pragma pack(pop) ? These force your compiler (in this case VC++), to pack the structure as byte-aligned. Check your compiler documentation to learn more. You want serialization.
