This functionality is build into org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.JavaEditor of org.eclipse.jdt.ui As you see it's an internal class. However you can ignore that and subclass it. The org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.ToggleMarkOccurrencesAction will work for all open JavaEditors (try opening the same class twice with the standard CompilationUnitEditor and you will see two "mark occurences" markings). This is because a central property PreferenceConstants.EDITOR_MARK_OCCURRENCES is set in the PreferenceStore of the JavaPlugin. In order to show the ToggleMarkOccurrencesAction Button you will need to provide a IEditorActionBarContributor (Take a look at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.CompilationUnitEditorActionContributor)
