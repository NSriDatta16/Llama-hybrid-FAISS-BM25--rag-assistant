Is a draw from the posterior always the same as a draw from the prior?

I'm reading Bayesian data analysis . On page 155, the authors state: Each of the [...] parameters were assigned independent Beta(2, 2) prior distributions. ... If the model were true, we would expect any single simulation draw of the vector of [parameters] to look like independent draws from the Beta(2, 2) distribution. I assume "simulation draw" here means a draw from the posterior distribution. To me this seems to imply that a draw from the posterior is the same as a draw from the prior, which already seems strange to me. In the derivation as to why this is true, the authors use only very general arguments that do not rely on any specifics of the example or the Beta(2, 2) distribution. Since this reasoning is so general it would apply to any Bayesian analysis. So, to me, it looks like the authors are stating here: "the posterior distribution is always the same as the prior". Which cannot be true! But where did I miss something? Is a simulation draw not a draw from the posterior? (The wording of this book is always extremely vague or imprecise.) What else am I missing? Or is it the book that is wrong? (Unlikely.)
