Linker library for OpenMP for Snow Leopard?

Currently, I am trying out OpenMP on XCode 3.2.2 on Snow Leopard: #include #include #include int main (int argc, char * const argv[]) { #pragma omp parallel printf("Hello from thread %d, nthreads %d\n", omp_get_thread_num(), omp_get_num_threads()); return 0; } I didn't include any linking libraries yet, so the linker complains: "_omp_get_thread_num", referenced from: _main in main.o "_omp_get_num_threads", referenced from: _main in main.o OK, fine, no problem, I take a look in the existing framework, looking for keywords such as openmp or omp... here comes the problem, where is the linking library? Or should I say, what is the name of the linking library for openMP? Is it dylib, framework or what? Or do I need to get it from somewhere first?
