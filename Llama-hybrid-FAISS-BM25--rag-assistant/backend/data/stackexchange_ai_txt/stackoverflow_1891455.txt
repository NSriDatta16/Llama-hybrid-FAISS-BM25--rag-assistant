While converting an older MFC-application I ran into similar problems with the feature pack. I didn't have the time to solve it correctly, but I used following workaround: take your dialog resource and put it in a CDialogBar class. now derive a class from CDockablePane in the OnCreate-method of the pane, create your dialogbar. 2 more things: void CInputPane::OnSize(UINT nType, int cx, int cy) { CDockablePane::OnSize(nType, cx, cy); m_pInputBar->SetWindowPos(NULL,0,0,cx,cy,SWP_NOACTIVATE | SWP_NOZORDER); } BOOL CInputPane::OnBeforeFloat(CRect& /*rectFloat*/,AFX_DOCK_METHOD /*dockMethod*/) { return FALSE; } This assures proper sizing of the dialog and preventing the user from dragging the bar around. HTH, it worked for me.
