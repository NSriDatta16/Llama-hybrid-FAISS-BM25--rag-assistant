PCA is really designed for (approximately multinormal) data. When data are not multinormal, it could be helpful to try projection pursuit --- searching for "interesting" projections. In a sense PCA is a projection pursuit method, searching for linear combinations (projections) with maximal variance, as this is an proper thing to do for multinormal data. When using projection pursuit proper, one is searching for information which a PCA cannot find, such as non-normality. One first does a "sphere transform", transforming the data linearly to have covariance matrix equal to the identity matrix. Then one can for instance try to find the "least normal" projection. Â¿How define that? One idea is to observe that the normal distribution, among all distributions with zero mean and unit variance, maximizes the entropy, so one common idea is to minimize the entropy. If the projection minimizing entropy really looks normal (look at its histogram!), the data probably are multinormal. If not, that histogram could be interesting. Remove this projection from the data, repeat, ...
