Firstly, you can use a Object Style Approach, Methods over Functions Example var User = { loggedin : false, name : "Robert PItt", id : 45 } And you can create a System Item within js file like so if(typeof System == undefined) { System = new Object(); } System.Globals = { //Some Global Settings,uri's etc in here } System.Gui = { Init : function() { if(User.loggedin == true) { this.RemoveItem("#userlogin"); } }, RemoveItem: function(form) { $(form).remove(); } } System.Gui.init(); //Within head maybe/ As you can see you can create several "containers" to hold your methods within, containers can be helpful to organise your code and separate it at the same time, you can create along side the GUI things such as Ajax,Tools,Security,Callbacks and so on.
