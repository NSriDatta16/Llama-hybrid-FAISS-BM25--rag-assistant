learning is a brute force process. I wouldn't say its bad. In trying to do something that way you may notice a pattern. I think as long as you are thinking about something and trying to find solutions you will learn. There are few people who just jump to the most elegant or efficient solutions. It would be hard to convince me that people that are trying to learn could ever be called bad. Except maybe an evil scientist :P good luck.
