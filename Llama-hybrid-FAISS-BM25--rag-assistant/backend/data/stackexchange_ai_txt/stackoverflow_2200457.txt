It depends on how your organization use branches. Here's what ours does: For development branches - how I believe you're using branches in your question - I agree with Pete's answer here (and +1 to him). Don't try to merge both ways throughout your project. Throughout your project, keep the branch updated with merges from the trunk to the branch. Once your project is done, merge your branch down to the trunk (after testing!!!), and be done with the branch. For release branches , we use merges a couple of ways: Trunk -> branch : Initial integration - create the release branch. And generally, this is the only time we merge in this direction with release branches. Branch -> trunk : If bugs are found in production, we fix on the branch and then merge back to the trunk. This happens until the next release branch is cut . What's important is that your organization have a policy and adhere to it. Don't do things ad-hoc. HTH, -aj
