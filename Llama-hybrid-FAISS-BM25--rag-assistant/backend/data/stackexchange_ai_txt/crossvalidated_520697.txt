How to interpret categorical covariates for Cox regression

I am using Cox regression to model the deterioration of bridges using covariates such as salt (tons/mile), average daily traffic (ADT), average daily truck traffic (ADTT), span length, snow day per year, and some categorical covariate like superstructure type, district, or region. When I built my model, the continuous covariates were statistically significant and the categorical covariate of district or region in two separate models which do not have any defined or exact attribute except that it divides the states spatially are also statistically significant in the presence of the continuous covariates. My question is when interpreting the categorical covariates, for example, district 1 hazard is 50% more than district 3. Is the increased hazard due to the continuous covariates already in the model, which itself has to be interpreted for each unit of increase in the covariate or the 50% increased hazard from the district is from some other factors not captured by the continuous covariate in the model?
