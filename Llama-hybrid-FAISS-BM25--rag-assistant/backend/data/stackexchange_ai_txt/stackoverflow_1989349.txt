A very typical pattern for moving by click-and-drag for ui objects at runtime, and which will work when the control is on a form, or in a container like a Panel : private bool pb_mouseIsDown; private int oX; private int oY; private void pictureBox1_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { pb_mouseIsDown = true; oX = e.X; oY = e.Y; } private void pictureBox1_MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { pb_mouseIsDown = false; } private void pictureBox1_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (pb_mouseIsDown) { pictureBox1.Left += e.X - oX; pictureBox1.Top += e.Y - oY; } } Note : ...at Design Time : if you define the event handlers for MouseUp, MouseDown, and MouseMove while the control is "on" a Form (the parent of the control is the Form), and then cut and paste it into a container, like a Panel : you'll have re-establish the binding/linkage between the control and the MouseDown, MouseUp, and MouseMove events in the IDE for it to work.
