How to use ACTION_DEVICE_STORAGE_LOW to avoid OutOfMemoryError?

I found in one post regarding OutOfMemoryError(mainly due to BITMAP) that it can be Notified with Broadcastreceiver (ACTION_DEVICE_STORAGE_LOW) when Heap is going to full. Can any one tell how to implement this broadcast Receiver and avoid OutOfMemoryError?
