Example code for a minimal paint program (MS Paint style)

I want to write a paint program in the style of MS Paint. On a most basic level, I have to draw a dot on the screen whenever the user drags the mouse. def onMouseMove(): if mouse.button.down: draw circle at (mouse.position.x, mouse.position.y) Unfortunately, I'm having trouble with my GUI framework (see previous question ), I'm not getting mouse move messages frequently enough. I'm using the GUI framework wxWidgets and the programming language Haskell. Question: Could you give me some example code that implements such a minimal paint procedure? Preferably, your code should be use wxWidgets , but I also accept GTK+ or Cocoa. I don't mind any programming language , as long as I can install it easily on MacOS X. Please include the whole project , makefiles and all, since I probably don't have much experience with compiling your language. Basically, I would like to have a small example that shows me how to do it right in wxWidgets or another GUI framework, so I can figure out why my combination of Haskell and wxWidgets doesn't give a decent frequency of mouse move events.
