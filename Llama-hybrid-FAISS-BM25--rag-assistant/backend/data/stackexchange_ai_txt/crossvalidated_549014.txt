As dimitriy states, there isn't a singular textbook yet (or at least that I am aware of). However, there are a few textbook materials you can piece together to cover the topics you mentioned. Targeted Learning in Data Science covers super learner (which is a generalized stacking algorithm you would almost always want to use in practice), and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (with a bunch of variations of it). I think this one will be preferred over the other targeted learning book since the one linked above covers the machine learning parts a bit better Chapter 18 of Hernan and Robins covers double machine learning. Unfortunately, I don't have a recommendation for causal trees
