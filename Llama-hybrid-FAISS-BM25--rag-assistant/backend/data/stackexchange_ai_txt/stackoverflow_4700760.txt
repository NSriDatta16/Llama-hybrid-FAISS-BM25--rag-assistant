I would advise you against multiple forms, and go with something that's more usable, like a single form with segmented panels or other containers for sections. Multiple forms have too many usability issues, like not appearing in the task bar, overlapping, etc. I know this is not the answer you want, but I'm encouraging you to think in different directions. Usability is crucial with complex data and multiple views.
