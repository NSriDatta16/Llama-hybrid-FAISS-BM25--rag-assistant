LSTM / GRU weights during test time

I am working on a historic time series dataset and using RNN, LSTM, GRU models, and I didn't find an answer if in test time, the h (or h, c) weights should be zeors for each batch? If the weights should be zero, what they should be? the last updated weights from the training? Thanks
