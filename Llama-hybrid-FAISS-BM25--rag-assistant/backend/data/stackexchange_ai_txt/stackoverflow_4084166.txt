I would try with the new google tools. -first you need to get the api id for the google-storage, which is where you are going to store and manipulate the data you are going to analyze. -Then you need to get the api id for google-prediction-api (http://code.google.com/apis/predict/docs/getting-started.html), which for what I saw it is a fantastic outsourced data mining processor. The Prediction API allows you to get more from your data and makes its patterns more accessible. Besides using traditional numeric and nominal data you can also use text data that thanks to this api can be utilized for exampled to categorize emails by language. -Finally you can use bigQuery that will allow you to perform Ad-hoc analysis, Standardized reporting, Data exploration App prototyping (http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/)
