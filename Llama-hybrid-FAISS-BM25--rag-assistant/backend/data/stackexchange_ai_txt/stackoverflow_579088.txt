i'm going to take a guess here and say.. you don't need a static directory. I think what you need is to get the 'base directory' programatically. NSString *docsDirectory = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]; NSString *path = [docsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"fileName.txt"]; you should be saving your user files there (or somewhere similar) or alternatively something like NSBundle* bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle]; NSString* path = [bundle executablePath] //or NSString* path = [bundle resourcePath]; and then append your own paths onto that. hope that helps. NEW INFO: If you are saving information, (a log, stats etc..) you can retrieve the files saved in the NSDocumentDirectory above using the Xcode organiser. select your device got the summary tab find you application in 'Applications' section. expand the entry and it should have an 'Applcation data' entry. press the down arrow on the right to save your files.
