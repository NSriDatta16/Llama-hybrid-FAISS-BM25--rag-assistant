Yes. Be scared. GetHashCode cannot possibly offer a guarantee of no-collision on any type larger than 32bits. Given that in some cases the implementation of GetHashCode might be less than perfect (i.e. some classes implement their own ill-distributed version), the risk might be higher in some cases. Regardless, this is a bad approach and needs a rethink. I'd suggest a bit of reading on how hash tables work so that you better understand the purpose of a hash code. It's really only a heuristic measure for speedy storage.
