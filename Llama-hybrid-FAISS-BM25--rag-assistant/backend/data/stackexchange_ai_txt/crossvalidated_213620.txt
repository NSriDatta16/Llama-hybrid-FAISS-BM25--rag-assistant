The strict traditional definition of "contrasts" requiring row sums of 0 (e.g., in Wikipedia ) seems to have been relaxed in practice. See, for example this page on contrast coding in R (note that R displays your contrast rows as columns), or this Cross Validated page on sum versus treatment contrasts . In dummy or treatment coding, the default for the lm() function in R, "contrast" coefficients can sum to 1, not 0, for individual predictor variables, and they can have higher sums when interactions are considered . This makes it easier to identify individual treatment effects in output summaries, although I suppose it doesn't meet the strict definition of a "contrast" and it does lead to non-orthogonality. For testing your hypothesis $H_0:\beta_5=\beta_6=0$, you can simply compare the full model against the model that omits both $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$, and avoid the definition of "contrasts" completely. In R, that could be provided by anova(fullModel,reducedModel) , which works on logistic regressions (or other generalized linear models) produced by glm() as well as on standard linear models.
