With OSGI how does one pass parameters from a host to a embedded bundle

In the end i will perhaps provide a helper so that the activator can import and export services and other types of meta data about the system. By parameters i mean objects in general, perhaps via a map. it would be great if one bundle when installing another had a mechanism to send parameters to the starting bundle. I suppose i could include a service on the later bundle and use it as a configuration service but that seems a bit unelegant.
