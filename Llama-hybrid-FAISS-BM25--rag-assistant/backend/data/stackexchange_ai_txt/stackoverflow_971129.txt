I don't think it's too many levels of abstraction. Your solution looks quite elegant to me because you are simply testing that the Table class calls the right ComandRunner functions. You are testing how the Table class deals with the CommandRunner, and you have removed all the complications of the CommandRunner implementations including the IComObject. This is what Mocking is all about.
