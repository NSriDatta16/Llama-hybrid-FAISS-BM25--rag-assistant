To my knowledge, there is no convenient tool like NCoverExplorer that can transform a PartCover results .xml file into a .html report, but there are some .xsl files that can be used to transform PartCover's results to .html in CruiseControl.NET: Using CruiseControl.NET with PartCover . You could take those .xsl files from CruiseControl.NET and convert your PartCover results.xml using something like Sandcastle 's XslTransform.exe. By the way, if this happens to be related to TeamCity, the upcoming 5.0 release will include support for .NET coverage using PartCover or NCover. See the documentation for more informations. Otherwise ignore this paragraph ;-)
