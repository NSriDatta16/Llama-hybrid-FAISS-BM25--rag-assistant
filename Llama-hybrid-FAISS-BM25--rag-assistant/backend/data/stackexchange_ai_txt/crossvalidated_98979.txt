Should I analyze variables separately or together?

I have one categorical variable ( on a diet : yes or no) and two numerical variables (patients heart rate and blood pressure ). Do I use a multiple logistic regression? Or should I look at each numerical variable separate with regards whether they are on a diet? That way I would only look at simple logistic regression.
