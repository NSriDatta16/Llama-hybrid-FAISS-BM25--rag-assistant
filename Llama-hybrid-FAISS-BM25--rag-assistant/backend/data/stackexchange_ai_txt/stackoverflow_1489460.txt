I would not create your own framework. There are many already written that follow a common pattern and can likely accomodate your needs elegantly. The xUnit framework in all incarnations I have seen allows you to add new test cases without having to edit the code that runs the tests. For example, CppUnit provides a macro that when added to a test case will auto-register the test case with a global registry (through static initialization I assume). This allows you to add new test cases without cracking open and editing the thing that runs them. And don't let the "unit" in xUnit and CppUnit make you think it is inappropriate. I've used the xUnit framework for all different kinds of testing.
