Your iPhone version indicates keep-alive but doesn't specify a length. Not sure that's enough to cause trouble. Also, is it possible your server is checking for user-agent strings it recognizes (say, for backward-compatibility mode)? I'd also compare the two in a text editor that shows CR/LF characters to make sure you're getting proper line endings. Another thing you could try is create a simple web-page that does a multipart POST and run it from the iPhone browser (instead of the Mac one) then check the headers that go across the wire. Or you could snag a toolkit like ASIHTTPRequest and see what kind of output it generates for multi-part posts (or just use the toolkit instead of trying to write your own). Good luck
