Why logit transformed binomial proportion is approximately normal?

What is the argument to prove asymptotic normality of logit transformed of binomial proportion which follows Beta distribution? $\theta$ has beta prior and model $y|\theta$ follows $Binom(\theta,n)$ . Then posterior $p(\theta|y)$ follows beta distribution. The following is asserted in Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd Ed, Sec 24, page 35 right before "conjugate prior distributions". "For the binomial parameter θ, the normal distribution is a more accurate approximation in practice if we transform θ to the logit scale; that is, performing inference for log(θ/(1 − θ)) instead of θ itself, thus expanding the probability space from [0, 1] to (−∞,∞), which is more fitting for a normal approximation."
