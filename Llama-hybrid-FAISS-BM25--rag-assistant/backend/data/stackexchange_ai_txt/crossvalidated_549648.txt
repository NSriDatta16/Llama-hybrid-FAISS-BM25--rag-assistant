The data points are, after PCA transformation, distributed on the plane of the principal component axes. That is an interpretation for which you can plot the density (ie. the density of the probability for a point to have a certain score on the principal components). There are quite some examples with a search on the internet https://www.google.ch/search?q=pca+density+plot&source=lnms&tbm=isch And in relation to your example with the iris dataset https://www.google.ch/search?q=pca+density+iris&source=lnms&tbm=isch I am linking to examples on Google because currently I have no R available to make a graph (maybe I will make an example myselve later). Below is an example from Fisher's article on the Iris data set. It is not PCA but LDA, and also it is not density lines but histograms/distributions. The principle in the sense that it is a projection onto a space of lower dimensions (in this case 1 dimension) and a display of the density distribution on that projected space. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" Annals of Eugenics , Vol VII, Pt. II, op. 179-188, 136 Marginal distribution When you have multivariate data, where the multiple variables are distributed according to some joint distribution, then you can still think of the distribution of a single variable. This is also called a marginal distribution . It is not different for PCA and a distribution for the principal component. You can view this as the shadow of a multidimensional joint distribution being projected onto the lower dimensional space. The distribution of the data in this lower dimensional space is like a marginal distribution. See below an example of this projecting. The data is distributed in 3 dimensions (according to some density) but you can project the points into a lower space and following that think about the density in that lower space.
