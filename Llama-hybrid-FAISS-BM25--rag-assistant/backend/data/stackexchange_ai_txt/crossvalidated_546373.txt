Question on interpreting a logistic regression with information from the confusion matrix

So I have a logistic regression and the I have the following information as outputs: The probability of the y variable being either one or zero a normalized confusion matrix as follows: T zero False One = B False Zero T One = A So if Probability of 1 for a given set of inputs is X, the probability a true 1 is A and probability of a false 1 is B, then the true probability of 1 in this instance is: $P(1) =X* \frac{(A)}{(A+B)}$ Am I correct in my understanding? *edit: to clarify what I mean by normalize is that each number is converted to a percentage. See example at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Normalized-Confusion-Matrix-A-row-represents-an-instance-of-the-actual-class-ie-an_fig1_308074430
