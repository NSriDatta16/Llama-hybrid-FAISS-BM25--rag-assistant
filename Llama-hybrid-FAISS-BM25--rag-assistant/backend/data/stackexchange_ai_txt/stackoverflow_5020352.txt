I think there is only one resonable answer: usually autorelease is not an performance issue. It is good to keep in mind that it could be problematic in tight loops, but unless a performance meter like Instruments shows a memory spike you have to get rid of, I would use it if you like. Premature optimization is a great way of spending time for nothing. Maybe in the end you know that your solution is elegant, but it could be that the easier solution performs just as fine.
