Bidirectionality in html

Using Sphinx, I'm editing pylearn documentation content at https://bitbucket.org/omidraha/pylearn/ . All paragraphs are Right-to-Left (because of Persian language) and code samples between text, rendered incorrectly. Generally I'm looking for a way to apply bi-directionality algorithms of unicode or microsoft on a web page. Is there a way to set css style of codes, to be LTR inside of a RTL paragraph? if not, how could I modify sphinx source to do seperate code samples, for example in a frame or something like that?
