In most cases, switching between test frameworks is just a case of search/replace. If the csproj doesn't load, just create a new project file and drag the code files in and fix them afterwards (along with the references). TestDriven.NET, for example (or NUnit console) are perfectly happy with just a dll/exe as the test project. Maybe a pain, but not necessarily a huge problem. If you want to use NUnit with MVC, there are brief instructions here and here - I don't know (haven't tested) whether they apply to Standard.
