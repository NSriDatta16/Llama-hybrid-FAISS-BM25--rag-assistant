This is a known issue, and a number of blog posts document some solutions. Try Ash's solution first, failing that you need to alter Magento's code per Richard's post . Make sure that you follow his instructions to move the code into your /app/code/local to prevent future upgrade issues. The problem occurs because of the way that Firefox handles cookies from localhost, and Magento's code is not very forgiving of that. HTH, JD
