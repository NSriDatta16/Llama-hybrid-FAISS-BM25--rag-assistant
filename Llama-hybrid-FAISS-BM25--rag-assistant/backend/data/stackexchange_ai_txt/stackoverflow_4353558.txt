Encryption on Android devices

1) I am wondering if the Android SDK has already predefined encryption functions or if one would have to write this all from scratch? 2) Suppose you have classes for encryption, either written by yourself or provided by the SDK, how to make sure, that the content of the RAM (that contains the key in plaintext) is never written to the permanent storage of the android device? I guess if too much RAM is used, there's some kind of swapping, besides that there are techniques like HTC's fastboot that write the whole content to the storage if I am not wrong? Any chance to prevent the RAM content for your software being saved on a permanent storage? Or is there maybe some kind of event before the RAM content is written to the permanenent storage, so one could wipe the key before that? Thanks you very much for any hint!
