Why does the sim function in Gelman's arm package simulate sigma from inverse chi square?

In getMethod(arm::sim, "lm") , the source code shows that $\sigma$ is simulated from inverse chi square: for (s in 1:n.sims) { sigma[s] This makes sense if one is doing Bayesian linear regression with the default uniform prior for $(\beta, \log \sigma)$. But if I'm running frequentist MLE regression, isn't it wrong to use arm::sim to do simulation? Indeed, for MLE, the asymptotic variance of $\sigma^2$ is normal instead.
