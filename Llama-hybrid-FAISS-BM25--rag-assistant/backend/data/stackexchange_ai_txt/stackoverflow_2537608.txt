The jQuery UI dialog does pretty much all that you are asking. Also, I haven't noticed that it takes very much time to display. You don't even need to have the DOM element existing to use it. One nice thing about the UI widgets is that you only need to load those components that you need plus the core. They're also widely available via CDN networks, so it's possible that the user's client already has the JS downloaded for it. $(function() { $(' Put whatever you want in here ') .dialog({ autoOpen: true, modal: true, open: function(event,ui) { ... }, close: function(event,ui) { ... $(this).dialog('destroy'); } draggable: false, resizable: false, ... }) });
