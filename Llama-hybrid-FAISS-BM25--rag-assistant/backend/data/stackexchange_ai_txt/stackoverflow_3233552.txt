Yes, they're pretty much the same. You can test it by plotting both ellipsoids in the same axes, i.e. after you plotted the first ellipsoid, you run [x, y, z] = ellipsoid(0,0,0,2.0,4.0,sqrt(2),20); sh = surfl(x, y, z); %# capture the handle, i.e. the unique identifier, of the surface %# set color to gray, make mostly transparent set(sh,'FaceColor',[0.5,0.5,0.5],'FaceAlpha',0.5) Now you can rotate the plot (click on the button with the circlular arrow, then drag the plot) and you'll see that the two ellipsoids coincide very well. If the second one was bigger than the first one, you'd see a space between the two; if the second one was smaller than the first one, you would only see the first, opaque one.
