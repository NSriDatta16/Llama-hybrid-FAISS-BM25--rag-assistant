Forecasting at individual versus grouped level

I have monthly usage data (spanning 3 years) for a customer base of around 200K, and I need to generate 1-month ahead forecasts for each of them. There are a couple of exogenous variables that would need to be included too. One way to go about is to build an "Arima with exogenous variables" model for each customer. In which case, I would be looking to manage 200K models. I'm wondering if there is an alternate approach to solving this --- Assuming we are able to segment the customer base into groups that are "homogeneous" in terms of usage, then would it make sense to create one model for each group? Would it be a good approximation to have the usage data time series for each group correspond to the mean values across the customers in that group? Any pointers to literature related to this problem is appreciated. Additionally, I'm looking to use R, so pointers to specific packages will be of help as well.
