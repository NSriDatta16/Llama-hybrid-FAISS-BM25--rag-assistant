User Controls not showing up in the toolbox

I have some UserControls that I created in ProjectA. I have ProjectB that has a windows form that I want to put the controls on. Both of these projects are in a single solution. There's a reference to ProjectA from ProjectB so it can "see" the UserControls. However, the UserControls do not show up in the toolbox for me to drag to the windows form. I've tried rebuilding. I've also deleted the 'bin' directory to force a rebuild-all. How do I get VS2008 to populate the toolbox with my UserControls?
