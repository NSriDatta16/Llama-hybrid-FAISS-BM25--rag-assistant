I wasn't aware of this distinction before, so I looked through my usual references and found a more clear discussion on this point in Pedersen et al. (2019): It is important to note that “similar wiggliness” and “similar shape” are two distinct concepts; functions can have very similar wiggliness but very different shapes. Wiggliness measures how quickly a function changes across its range, and it is easy to construct two functions that differ in shape but have the same wiggliness . For this paper, we consider two functions to have similar shape if the average squared distance between the functions is small (assuming the functions have been scaled to have a mean value of zero across their ranges). This definition is somewhat restricted; for instance, a cyclic function would not be considered to have the same shape as a phase-shifted version of the same function, nor would two normal distributions with the same mean but different standard deviations. The benefit of this definition of shape, however, is that it is straightforward to translate into penalties akin to those described in the section “A Review of Generalized Additive Models.” Figure 4, model S illustrates the case where models have different shapes. Similarly, two curves could have very similar overall shape, but differ in their wiggliness. As best as I can tell from this description, a wiggly smooth simply oscillates more, while it's shape is simply where the smooth is fit. For example, an S-shaped smooth and a U-shaped smooth can have very similar wiggliness, while two S-shaped smooths can have radically different wiggliness. To illustrate, here I fit the same data with two functions, one is parsimonious (fits a single bend in the curve) whereas the second is very wiggly because it is allowed to oscillate a lot between the data points. We can see that the shape is similar (some kind of U-shaped smooth here), but the wiggliness is not. The below two plots are different in that their shape is different (one looks like a straight line while the other is curved), but their wiggliness is the same (both have a large number of knots, $k = 30$ , with a very low smoothing parameter of $\lambda = .001$ ): References Pedersen, E.
