How to find the Javascript that is not contained in a function?

I have a really, really nasty bit of JS code that I've inherited. The code is quite long, and quite obtrusive. The functions defined are all about a thousand or so lines each... Anyway, since there isn't a call to anything as elegant as onload, I am trying to figure out how what is on the screen gets on the screen. Thus I need a way to separate the fly crap from the pepper as it were... I need to be able to find the code that is not contained in functions and is just called "out in the wild" so I can find out where this silly program begins...does anybody know a good way to do this?
