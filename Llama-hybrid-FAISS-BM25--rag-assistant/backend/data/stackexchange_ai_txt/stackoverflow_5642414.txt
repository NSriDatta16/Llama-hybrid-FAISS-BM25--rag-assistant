Code to find strings in source code over many urls

I want to enter a very long list of urls and search for specific strings within the source code, outputting a list of urls that contain the string. Sounds simple enough right? I have come up with the bellow code, the input being a html form. You can try it at pelican-cement.com/findfrog. It seems to work half the time, but is thrown off by multiple urls/urls in different orders. Searching for 'adsense' it correctly ids politics1.com out of cnn.com politics1.com however, if reversed the output is blank. How can I get reliable, consistent results? preferably something I could input thousands of urls into? 0) { echo $urls[$counter]; echo " "; curl_close($ch); } } //$FileNameSQL = "/googleresearch" . abs(rand(0,1000000000000000)) . ".csv"; //$query = "SELECT * FROM happyturtle INTO OUTFILE '$FileNameSQL' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','"; //$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error()); //exit; echo '$FileNameSQL'; ?>
