You have a number of options; as you say, Isolated Storage is one of them. You could also use the User Settings framework feature and save the data as a blob of data, or as XML. You could also take a look at SqlCompact for a very lightweight in-process database. You can then save all user contacts in a single database which could live e.g. in the same directory as the application; you could easily use something like EF4 for your DAL. That might be a bit more effort though, as it sounds like you are 99% of the way there with your current architecture.
