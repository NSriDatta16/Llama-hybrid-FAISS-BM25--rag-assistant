Google Analytics cookies vs subdomain for static content

I have a website on www.example.com and use Google Analytics. I've also set up static.example.com which serves all static content. The problem is that the default behavior of GA is to issue cookies on ".example.com" but I don't want the static content traffic to be carrying the weight the GA cookies. I tried pageTracker._setDomainName("none"); and it worked well for the cookies problem but it completely messed up the "Avg. Time on Site" report (from 5 mins average it went to 40 mins until the day I reverted the _setDomainName call). Any idea why this is happening and how could I fix it?
