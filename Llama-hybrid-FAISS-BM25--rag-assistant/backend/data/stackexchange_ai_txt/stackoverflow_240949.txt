Expanding a message template

I have a set of templates for emails that my app sends out. The templates have codes embedded in them that correspond to properties of my business object. Is there a more elegant way than calling string.Replace("{!MyProperty!}", item.MyProperty.ToString()) a zillion times? Maybe XMLTransform, regular expressions, or some other magic? I'm using C# 3.5 .
