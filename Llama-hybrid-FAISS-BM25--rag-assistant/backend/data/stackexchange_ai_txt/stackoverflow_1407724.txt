Also as replacement for the Gang of Four book. I can recommend: The Design Patterns Smalltalk Companion In general learning Smalltalk will help you to be a better OOP Developer on any language. From the Amazon reviews: Easier to understand than the original GoF, February 4, 2000 By Nicolas Weidmann This book gives you a better understanding of the patterns than in its original version (the GoF one). I am not a SmallTalk programmer but a 9 years C++ one. At work I had to use the GoF book and never liked reading it. In contrast to this, the SmallTalk companion is easy to read and you can understand the patterns within the first few lines of their description. Take the Bridge pattern and compare their discussions in the two books. If you really like the Gof one then buy it. But according to me, it would be a big mistake buying the GoF in favour of the SmallTalk companion. Trust a C++ programmer :-)
