Organizing member join dates/member growth data into graphable chunks

I'm dabbling with pChart and would like to start with a simple line graph showing the growth in membership over time. Y-axis would be # of members X-axis would be time For each time datapoint, I need a corresponding total members datapoint. My user table is structured as: [user_id] [join_date] The approach I came up with on the bus to work this morning is: $Q = " SELECT MONTH(join_date), DAY(join_date), COUNT(user_id)" . " FROM user_basic_data GROUP BY join_date"; $R = mysql_query($Q); $dateS = ''; $totalS = ''; $c = 0; // total members counter while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($R)) { $dateS .= $row[0].'-'.$row[1].','; // month-day,month-day,month-day $c = $row[2] + $c; // new total for new date $totalS .= $c.','; // total1,total2,total3 } // trim trailing commas $dateS = substr($dateS, 0, -1); $totalS = substr($totalS, 0, -1); echo " $dateS "; // Ex: 8-10,8-15,8-20 echo " $totalS "; // Ex: 12,17,23 Those string formats are how pChart likes the data, and I know the current query would need a year value as well for real use, so please don't get hung up on those points. I'd like to know if there's a better way to go about getting the changing total members over time. I'm guessing handling it within MySQL would be faster, but I can't think of a way to do that. Thank you for your time.
