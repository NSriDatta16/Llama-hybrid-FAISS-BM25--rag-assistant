Differences between Breusch-Pagan test and Levene's test

I am trying to check homoscedasticity of Residuals to use an ANOVA in R with data with one variable and three groups. I have been checking options to do it, and I would like to know when to use a Breusch-Pagan test or a Levene's test? As I understand Breusch-Pagan test is used when a regression is fitted and Levene's test on raw data. But I am not sure. If this is the case, are they equivalent? Thanks!
