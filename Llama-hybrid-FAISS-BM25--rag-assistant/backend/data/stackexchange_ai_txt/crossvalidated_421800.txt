Intercept in a Bayesian model with categorical predictors (with brms)

I have a Bayesian logistic model fitted in R with brms . The predicted variable is binomial, the predictors are categorical. The model uses bernoulli family and a logit link, and an uninformative Student-t prior. This is my model: isTrue ~ Type * Language + (Type | participant) + (1 | item) Basically every participant gets items in a certain language, every item has a certain word type in it. Type is a 3-way factor (1/2/3), language is 5-way (DE/EN/ES/FR/IT). This is my model output: Population-Level Effects: Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Eff.Sample Rhat intercept -3.46 0.40 -4.28 -2.73 1966 1.00 Type2 2.23 0.44 1.39 3.11 2120 1.00 Type3 0.38 0.53 -0.69 1.42 2294 1.00 LanguageEN 0.29 0.51 -0.71 1.29 2864 1.00 LanguageES 4.03 0.42 3.25 4.89 1999 1.00 LanguageFR 2.34 0.43 1.54 3.20 2093 1.00 LanguageIT -2.58 1.27 -5.64 -0.69 1557 1.00 Type2:LanguageEN -0.19 0.57 -1.33 0.90 3108 1.00 Type3:LanguageEN -0.48 0.68 -1.79 0.87 3422 1.00 Type2:LanguageES -1.15 0.49 -2.14 -0.20 2394 1.00 Type3:LanguageES 0.95 0.60 -0.21 2.12 2464 1.00 Type2:LanguageFR -0.86 0.50 -1.85 0.10 2561 1.00 Type3:LanguageFR -0.07 0.59 -1.24 1.07 2482 1.00 Type2:LanguageIT 6.32 1.32 4.28 9.42 1631 1.00 Type3:LanguageIT 7.96 1.36 5.84 11.13 1608 1.00 With this kind of output, I'm comparing everything to an intercept that does not make much sence (Type1:LanguageDE). Nor would another, e.g. Type3:LanguageEN make any more sense. This may be an ignorant question but I haven't come across this before: is there a way to have no default intercept and all features in the population-level effects, with an intercept that does not represent any real feature but maybe an average across features, or something like that? This intercept I'm imagining would say "across types and languages, this is how True x is". Is this theoretically sound and if so, how can this be done? I tried defining the model with isTrue ~ 0 + ... but the output is virtually identical, plus I'm not sure this is what the syntax means. Using isTrue ~ 0 + factor(Type) * factor(Language) I get no intercept and all Types in the output, but still no DE in the language; and to do this I have to remove grouping factors. Thanks!
