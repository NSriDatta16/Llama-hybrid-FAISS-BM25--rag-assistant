Document summarization with Log-likelihood ratio

I am trying to implement a text summary using Log-Likelihood Ratio. As explained in https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad/nlp16/nenkova-mckeown.pdf under section 2.1 I do not understand what do they really mean by background and foreground corpus. In case of having just one document does the foreground corpus mean the sentence for which I am computing LLR and background corpus mean the rest of document?
