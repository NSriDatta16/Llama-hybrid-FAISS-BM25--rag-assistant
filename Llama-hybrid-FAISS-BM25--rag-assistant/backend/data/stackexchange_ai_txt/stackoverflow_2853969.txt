Clojure: Equivalent to Common Lisp READ function?

When I want to read in an S-expression stored in a file into a running Common Lisp program, I do the following: (defun load-file (filename) "Loads data corresponding to a s-expression in file with name FILENAME." (with-open-file (stream filename) (read stream))) If, for example, I have a file named foo.txt that contains the S-expression (1 2 3) , the above function will return that S-expression if called as follows: (load-file "foo.txt") . I've been searching and searching and have not found an equally elegant solution in Clojure. Any ideas? Thanks!
