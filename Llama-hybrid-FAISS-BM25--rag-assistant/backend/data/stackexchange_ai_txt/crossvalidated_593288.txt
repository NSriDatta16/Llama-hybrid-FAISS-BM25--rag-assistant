Let us clear a few definitions first, before we dive into your answer. You often say cycle instead fo season. A cycle is something different than a season. A season is an effect clearly recurring within a year. Everything that goes beyond a year and may suddenly change its behavior strongly, is a cycle. You can describe it as a self strengthening season that suddenly drops. For example, you have a rising population of some animals in summer, due to the fact that there are more, they reproduce next year also but on a much higher level. They do this until they do not find enough to eat or get eaten, then their cycle drops and the rising of the population starts a new. So there is no fixed frequency. See a good example in Rob Hyndmans Book: Forecasting: Principles and Practice , Example in Book Regarding ACF and PACF. Look at my picture I have drawn for you, and it borrows from that video: ritvikmath The ACF is the Correlation of two time series, where one time series, is, for example, shifted by two days. To get this effect, you take a direct (green) and indirect route (pink). Both effects together form the ACF or the correlation of these both series. The PACF only looks at the direct route effect. For this we 'get rid' of the indirect route, because the high correlation or good values of an ACF may only be because of that indirect route. We want a clear sight on the PACF to be sure, there is a time lagged effect, and not something that piled up over time. Now looking at YOUR PACF plot compared to ACF you no longer find the effects, you found in the ACF. That clearly means, that you thought you had a high correlation, but that was just a piled up effect. Just looking at the PACF, we can see now which factors would be good in a model because they would help us for predicting the views. And in your case all coefficients that are out of the bounds. And with this you would get a good AR model. Maybe you now wonder, why draw an ACF Plot at all, if PACF is so much better? Well PACF is good for identfying the autoregressive part (AR). If you want to forecast views with views from the past then an AR model is good. The ACF is good when looking at the MA part the Moving Average of your Model. Or so to speak you do not look at the values of past views, but on the errors of your past forecast for views. And you correct your forecast by the error. That your ACF goes up again, may be a sign of, that your time series is not stationary: See also: ACF Plot normally degrades to 0
