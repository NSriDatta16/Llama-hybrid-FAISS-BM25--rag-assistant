Why does SAS Enterprise Miner keep all dummy variables for a coded categorical variable in stepwise logistic regression?

SAS Enterprise Miner nicely creates coded dummy variables for any categorical variables used in a logistic regression model. When it performs a variable selection using stepwise sequential selection in the Regression node, however, if one of the dummy variables is included in the regression model, all of the other dummy variables are then also automatically included, even if they are not found to be predictive of the target. Here's a snippet of the node Results output after the stepwise selection showing that the dummy variables for some of the levels of the Industry variable are significant in the model, but others are not. Parameter DF Estimate Error Chi-Square Pr > ChiSq Intercept 1 -9.2383 1.9222 23.10 So, for example, the Industry-Agriculture variable seems predictive of the target, but the Industry-IT variables does not. All seven dummy variables for the seven levels of the Industry variable are included in the final model, however. It seems to me that in the stepwise selection the dummy variables should be treated as individual variables rather than as a group. Does anyone know why SAS Enterprise Miner does it differently?
