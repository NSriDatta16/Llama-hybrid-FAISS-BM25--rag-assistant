I had 2 catches.... here's what they were. 1. I didn't clear the table I was adding to before re-creating the controls. apparently my attention to detail was off yesterday, i'm pretty sure the ctlXX frontrunner of the control was some different number upon postback due to how I was recreating the controls. 2. I was assigning the same list to all the dropdownlist controls. once I called the lookup upon each creation a dropdownlist control, all works well. anyway for what it's worth....
