Depending on what you are trying to do, one of these might do the trick: List parentLineList1 = (from t in content.ChildControls.OfType () from p in t.ChildControls.OfType () from pl in p.ChildControls.OfType () select pl).ToList(); List parentLineList2 = (from TabSection t in content.ChildControls from Paragraph p in t.ChildControls from Line pl in p.ChildControls select pl).ToList(); Note that one uses OfType (), which you were using. This will filter the results and return only the items of the specified type. The second query implicitly uses Cast (), which casts the results into the specified type. If any item cannot be cast, an exception is thrown. As mentioned by Turbulent Intellect, you should refrain from calling ToList() as long as possible, or try to avoid it altogether.
