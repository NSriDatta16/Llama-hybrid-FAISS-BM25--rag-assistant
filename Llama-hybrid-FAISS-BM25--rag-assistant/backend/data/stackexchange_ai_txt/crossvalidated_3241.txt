Clustering time series is done fairly commonly by population dynamacists, particularily those that study insects to understand trends in outbreak and collapse. Look for work on Gypsy moth, Spruce budoworm, mountain pine beetle and larch budmoth. For the actual clustering you can choose whatever distance metric you like, each probably has it's own strengths and weeknesses relative to the kind of data being clustered, Kaufmann and Rousseeuw 1990. Finding groups in data. An introduction to cluster analysis is a good place to start. Remember, the clustering method doesn't 'care' that you're using a time series, it only looks at the values measured at the same point of time. If your two time series are not in enough synch over their lifespan they the won't (and perhaps shouldn't) cluster. Where you will have problems is determining the number of clusters (families) to use after you've clusterd the time series. There are various ways of selecting a cut-off of informative clusters, but here the literature isn't that good.
