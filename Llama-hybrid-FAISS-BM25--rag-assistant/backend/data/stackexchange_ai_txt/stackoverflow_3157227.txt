This is not so much of a problem. Basically, you have to set the right wmode when embedding the SWF , for the browser to be able to render above the FlashPlayer. I'm not a pro on that, so either someone else can tell you, or you'll have to try. As far as I know, this can have quite a hit on performance though. The video format doesn't matter at all, as long as it's an FLV-codec . So to basically answer your question: yes, this can be done using flash and it is quite straight forward . You can either find a playback component, that suits your needs, or start from scratch using flash.media::Video . Using flash.external::ExternalInterface you could also create an interface, so that you can implement any controls you want in JavaScript. greetz back2dos
