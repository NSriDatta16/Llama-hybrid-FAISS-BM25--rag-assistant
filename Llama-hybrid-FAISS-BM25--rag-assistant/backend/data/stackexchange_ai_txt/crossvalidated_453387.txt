Flaws in Frequentist Inference

I have problem to understanding the following example. (1) After the next day that the glitch discovered what can tell about the observation? $X_i\nsim N(\mu,1)$ or just $X_i\sim N(\mu_2,1)$ . Some observation are from $N(\mu,1)$ and others not. What can we tell about all observation. Am I wrong somthing? Why not using Truncated normal? (2) What did exactly bayesian inference do in this situation? I think ,by considering $\mu$ to be random variable, it control (model) the glitch, but it considering $X\sim N(\mu , 1)$ that I am doubting to accept this. (3) At All, is the conversation "3.3) Flaws in frequentist inference" valid? Is this fair? and with out exaggeration ? source:Computer Age Statistical Inference, by Bradley Efron and Trevor Hastie, Page 31.
