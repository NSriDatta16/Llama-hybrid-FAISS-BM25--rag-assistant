I was able to set the namespace using the SoapType attribute. [Serializable] [System.Runtime.Remoting.Metadata.SoapType(XmlNamespace = "MY_NAMESPACE")] public class Person { public string FirstName; public string LastName; public string _Address; public string _ZIPCode; } This generated the following serialized XML: John Doe otneat.net Street, Zaragoza, Spain 50007 However, I wasn't able to verify the deserialization on the other side of the remoting channel. Hopefully, that helps you.
