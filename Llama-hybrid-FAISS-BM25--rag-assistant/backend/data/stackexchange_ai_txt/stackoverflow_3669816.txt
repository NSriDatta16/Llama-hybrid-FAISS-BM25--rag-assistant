Use of static finals in Android Activity

Why is the use of static final variables encouraged to declare constants over just final variables? The use of static sounds logical when there will be many instances of a class but is this argument correct when used for a Android activity. In fact, since the Class instance will be around even after the activity finishes and is eventually garbage collected, it seems like all these constants will still be in memory until the class loader is around. Also, does the compiler inline non-static final variables(ints and String) just like it does for static final variables?
