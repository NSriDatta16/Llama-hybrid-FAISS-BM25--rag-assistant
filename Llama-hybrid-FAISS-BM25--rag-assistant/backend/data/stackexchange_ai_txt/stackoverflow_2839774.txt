Yes, now is the time for HTML5. Browser support is good and growing very quickly. The power of the average computer is such that creating web applications that implement the more resource intensive HTML5 features is perfectly reasonable. Also, as a point of correctness, you can't use the smoothness of one company's HTML5 experiment as a way of validating whether HTML5 is ready for wider use. I could create a C program that would repeatedly print out "Hello World", and do it so badly that after 5 mins your entire system grinds to a halt. Does that mean C isn't ready yet? You also have to remember that when new technologies first come in, there are no widely established "best practices" or cunning tricks to squeeze every last bit of performance out of the new features. Even if computers / browser weren't ready for HTML5 yet (which I think they are), it needs to be released, adopted, and it's use refined so that those best practice patterns can emerge.
