I think the issue is most likely in Firefox or with the Acrobat plugin. Whenever something works sometimes but not others, you have to pay real close attention to the differences. The issue is always in the differences. In your case, you may never know why, because the differences may be in the browser or the plugin. Your header looks like it is supposed to look. It works in all other browsers. Based on your header, this is the way it is supposed to work in this browser, too. I would pose this to Mozilla and see what they have to say. As a potential workaround, You could try changing your Content-Disposition to 'attachment' when your user's browser is FF. This would cause the "Open or Save" dialog box to appear. Then your user can still click "open" to view it in the page. Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=stuff.pdf
