How to sample from a distribution approximated by a Neural Network?

There are a few models already that approximate distributions with a neural network i.e.: energy models define a density function $f(x)= e^{S(x,w)}/Z$ where $S$ is a neural network and $Z$ is a normalizing constant. For simplicity lets assume I have trained an nn-function that approximates the cumulative density instead $F(x)= S(x,w)$ How can I go about sampling from the distribution?
