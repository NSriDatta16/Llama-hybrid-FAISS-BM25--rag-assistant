I haven't checked the whole of your code but there is a glaring error in that .attr("[name]" should be .attr("name" You also need to remove the .children() from the line $(this).children().find(":input") and make it $(this).find(":input") This is because this refers to the div element that contains the inputs. By running .children() on that it returns the input elements, and by doing find() on that it returns nothing, because find looks inside the selected elements, not-including the elements it runs on. updated jsfiddle at http://jsfiddle.net/gaby/TpmdP/
