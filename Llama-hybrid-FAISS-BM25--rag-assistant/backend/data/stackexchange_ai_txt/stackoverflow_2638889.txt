So if I have an image thats 300px wide in the mdpi folder, how is it going to look the same size on all 3 different screen sizes (mainly 320x480 vs the other 2)? How the image looks, physically, is driven by screen density, not screen size. Your -mdpi folder is not tied to screen size -- it is tied to screen density.
