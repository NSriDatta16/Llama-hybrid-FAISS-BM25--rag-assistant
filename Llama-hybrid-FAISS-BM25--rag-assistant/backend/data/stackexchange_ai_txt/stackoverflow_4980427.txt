How to organize URLs?

Suppose I have a web application with several modules that exist on both the server and the client side. Each module has some server URL paths to access/manipulate data for that module. For the sake of argument, suppose we have 'blogs' in our application. For instance, the server URL path to get a blog might be /blogs/getBlog , and to save a blog might be /blogs/saveBlog . For the client-side, I can see two options: Store the URLs in a single URL manager class. For instance, it would contain a property called getBlogUrl and saveBlogUrl , and more (similar) properties for the rest of the modules. Store the URLs in each individual module. For instance, the Blog class might have the previously mentioned URLs as properties of itself. When architecting your systems, which of these would you choose and why? Are there other options you might use to organize your URLs?
