Yahoo! OAuth login screen for mobile devices

This is a kind of re-post of my question on Yahoo! forums. It is just that I refer to StackOverflow more frequently... My problem is as following: while Yahoo! OAuth http://developer.yahoo.com/oauth/ is described as ready for use with mobile phones out-of-the-box it does not appear as such. I have tried to implement sample application and use Yahoo! PHP SDK to connect with Yahoo! Using web browser it is all nice and easy. But while visiting Yahoo! request_auth page ( http://developer.yahoo.com/oauth/guide/oauth-userauth.html ) on my test mobile phone (Nokia 6300) it renders unacceptable: I am not able to see login box, cannot read information why my login would be required and all. I just see a page border and some text fragments ("Yahoo!", "Hel" (like in help...) et. al.). Is there some parameter to force Yahoo! displaying mobile phone optimised page? I do redirect user to this address at the moment: https://api.login.yahoo.com/oauth/v2/request_auth BTW: if I use Opera Mini - it renders page nicely, although ommiting information about my site (which is requesting log-in). Just that I cannot force all users to use Opera, or something. Thanks in advance for any help.
