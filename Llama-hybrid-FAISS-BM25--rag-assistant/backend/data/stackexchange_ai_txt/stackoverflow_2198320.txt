What's an elegant way to retrieve all times of the day (1 hour resolution) in DB2 without a backing table?

I'm querying some data from a table in DB2/z which holds hourly data but occasionally skips some hours (if the clients don't send up details for that hour). Since I'm feeding the data straight into a charting tool which needs a query to get the axis data, it sometimes has missing values from the time axis and looks ugly: 23.00 |=== 22.00 |===== 14.00 |============ 01.00 |== 00.00 |= +-------------------- We've been verboten from adding any helper tables like a 24-row table holding all the hours so I need a query in DB2 that will return all the hours of the day without a reliable backing table. I've been using the monstrous: select '00.00' from sysibm.sysdummy1 union all select '01.00' from sysibm.sysdummy1 union all select '02.00' from sysibm.sysdummy1 union all select '03.00' from sysibm.sysdummy1 : : : union all select '23.00' from sysibm.sysdummy1 order by 1 which is about as kludgy a solution I've ever seen, so I'd rather have something a little cleaner. I've posted my own solution below but I'm open to anything simpler or more elegant.
