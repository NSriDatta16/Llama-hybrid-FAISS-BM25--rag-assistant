Session Hijacking Protection in ASP.NET

I'd like to find out what session ID hijacking protection is built into the current version of ASP.NET. I recently saw this very informative article that explains how session security can be enhanced by implementing an additional layer that encodes the IP address and user agent header into the session id. These details are then verified on each subsequent request. It seems that this article was written for ASP.NET 1.1 so I'd like to know if anything similar is now built into ASP.NET. Is it still of any benefit to implement such an additional layer? Thanks.
