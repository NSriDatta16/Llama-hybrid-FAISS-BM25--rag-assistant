unix join separator char

Sorry for the maybe trivial question. I fought a bit with the unix join command, trying to get tabs instead of whitespaces as the default separators. -t is the argument, but these don't work (ubuntu 9.10 64 bit 2.6.31-14, GNU coreutils version 7.4) join file1 file2 -t"\t" join file1 file2 -t="\t" join file1 file2 -t="\\t" join file1 file2 -t $"\t" Et cetera. Of course, I can always use some inelegant solution like join file1 file2 > output sed "s/ /\t/g" output But I wanted to look smart :-) Moreover, if there's a -t argument, it must work.
