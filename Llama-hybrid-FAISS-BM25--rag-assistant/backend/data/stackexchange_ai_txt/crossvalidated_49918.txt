Whether to average two groups and analyse calculations from averages or should all analyses include all baseline data from each individual?

I have followed two groups and measured a number of variables. Some of the variables can be used to calculate new measures. Is it ok to average the two groups and analyse calculations from the averages (ie each group acting as a single entity to provide a new measurement) with separate tests or should all the analyses include all the baseline data from each individual?
