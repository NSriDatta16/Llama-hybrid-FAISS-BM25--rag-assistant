WCF Timeout Returning Five-Dimensional Array of String

I wrote a WCF service that returns a string[][][][][] (necessary for legacy reasons). Then I noticed an important fact: if the service manipulates N objects the answer is returned immediately (in localhost) but if it tries to manipulate N+1 objects a timeout occurs (I set it to 30sec). The problem occurs if the string[20][20][20][5][20] becomes a string[20][20][20][6][20]. Why it takes so much if I add 1 object? The code of the service is not useful so I'll not include it. Thanks, Alberto
