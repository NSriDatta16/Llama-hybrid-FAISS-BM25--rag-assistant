What you propose is one possible, very trivial way to perform object detection. However, there are far more advanced methods based on convolutional networks for image classification. I recommend having look at these (some of which have nice open-source implementations for many deep learning frameworks): Faster R-CNN Article , Python code Single Shot multibox Detector Article , Python code YOLO Article , Python code All of them are based on some convolutional network for image classification, usually adding a few special layers to perform the object detection. For some explanation on how SSD works, have also look at this answer
