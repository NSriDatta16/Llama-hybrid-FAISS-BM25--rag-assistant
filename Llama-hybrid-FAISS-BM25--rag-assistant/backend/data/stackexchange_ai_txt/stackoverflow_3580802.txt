How to use git (git config --global)?

The Pragmatic Guide to GIT has the following "Git uses both to calculate the commit ID—a SHA-111 hash—that identifies each commit." in page 21. And in page 22, I can use the following command to 'Configure Git to know who you are'. git config --global smcho "Your Name" When I ran it, I got the following error message. error: key does not contain a section: smcho What's wrong with this? I guess it has something to do with SHA-111 hash, but I don't know how to get it to be used with git. ADDED I thought user.name is to be replaced my name, not a section/parameter structured name. After changing that it works OK. git config --global user.name "Your Name"
