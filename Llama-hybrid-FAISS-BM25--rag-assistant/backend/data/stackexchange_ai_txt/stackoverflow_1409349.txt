Your join syntax is discouraged by Oracle for outer joins. You can do a left outer join and exclude the unjoined columns; this should be the most efficient approach. Something like this: SELECT a1.account_no FROM TEMP a1 LEFT JOIN bmf a2 ON a1.account_no = a2.account_no WHERE (a2.tracking_id between 72422912 and 72424283) AND a2.account_no IS NULL
