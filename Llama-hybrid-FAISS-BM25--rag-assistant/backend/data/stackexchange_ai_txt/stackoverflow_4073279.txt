Hmm.. I don't think creating a contingency table is what Cameron was looking for. If I understood him correctly, I think he wanted to create a data frame with two variables in it, where s1 and s2 seems to be vectors of the same size. (length(s1)==length(s2)). In this case, he would simply need to create a "table" (I think he meant data.frame) using: df = data.frame(s1=s1, s2=s2); And then plot the 2 series in the same plot. So as for the second question of plotting these things, I'd use matplot. For example: matplot(1:10, data.frame(a=rnorm(10), b=rnorm(10)), type="l", lty=1, lwd=1, col=c("blue","red")) Given that he has his data of 2 vectors organized in a single data.frame named "df", he can just do something like: matplot(df, type="l", lty=1, lwd=1, col=c("blue","red")) Hope this helps.
