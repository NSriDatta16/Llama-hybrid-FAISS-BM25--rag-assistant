Drag wpf window with thumb: can it be transparent?

I've been testing Blu and I noticed that I could drag the window. This window is transparent. I tried to do the same with a Thumb, but I don't know how to make it transparent. The rest of the window is transparent, but the thumb is not. Is there any way to make the thumb transparent, or should I use another technique? I use this event: private void DragThumb_DragDelta(object sender, System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.DragDeltaEventArgs e) { Canvas.SetLeft(this, Canvas.GetLeft(this) + e.HorizontalChange); Canvas.SetTop(this, Canvas.GetTop(this) + e.VerticalChange); } Thank you
