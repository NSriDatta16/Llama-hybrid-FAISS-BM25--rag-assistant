I ended up doing the following. Inelegant, but it works: if (_system.date().char[1..2] >= 01 and _system.date().char[4..5] >= 01 and _system.date().char[7..10] >= 2010) then alert("Your license has expired. Please contact the Company to renew your license.") _player.quit() end if It does the trick, but I would still be interested in alternative methods of doing this.
