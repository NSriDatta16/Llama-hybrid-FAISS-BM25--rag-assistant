You can have a quick browse at virt-manager , just as an aside as to whats also there.. you never know, you might even like it..I think having such a tool can give you a bigger kick in performance and less disk defrag issues. You would have to go for a steep learning curve and the conversion time to make it all work perhaps. If updates is your main time spender, try WSUS , nothing related to VMs itself, but it helps with deploying windows updates. Lastly, check Hanselman's blog on Invirtus , Virtual Machine Optimization at its best.
