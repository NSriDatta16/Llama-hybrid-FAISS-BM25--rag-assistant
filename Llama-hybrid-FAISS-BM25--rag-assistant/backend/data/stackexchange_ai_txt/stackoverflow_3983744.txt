Something like this should help: var threshhold1 = 30.5; var threshhold2 = 70.5; var randomNumber = random() * 100; if (randomNumber This will execute func1() with 30.5% probability, func2() with 40%, and func3() with 29.5%. You could probably do it more elegantly using a dictionary of threshholds to function pointers, and a loop that finds the first dictionary entry with a threshhold greater than randomNumber .
