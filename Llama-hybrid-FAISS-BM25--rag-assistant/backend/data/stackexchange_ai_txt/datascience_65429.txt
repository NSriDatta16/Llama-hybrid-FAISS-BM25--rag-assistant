When you dont want to remove outlier then you can either use logistic regression if it is classification task as we know log reg is robust to outliers because of sigmoidal function. Otherwise for general you can use local reachability factor value to check whether you datapoint is having this factor value significantly different from other datapoints. Local reachability factor and remove these higher value datapoints from the dataset.
