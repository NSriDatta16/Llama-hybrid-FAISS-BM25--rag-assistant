How do I know which feature leads to class 1 and class 0? The length of the bar tells you how much influence the feature has on the prediction. Does it mean high values of each feature leads to class 1? No, to see this use summary plot And low values of each feature lead to class 0? Same as previous answer. When my output probability range is 0 to 1, why does the SHAP plot return something like 0 to 0.20` etc What it is showing you is by how much each feature contributes to the prediction on average. And I suspect that the reason sum of contributions doesn't add up to 1 is that you have an unbalanced dataset. What does mean SHAP value mean? SHAP first computes scores per observation, but to get contributions of each feature overall it averages the values across observations.
