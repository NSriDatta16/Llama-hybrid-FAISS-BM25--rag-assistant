If trend can be modeled, why difference a time series at all? That is a good question! The answer is, you do not difference the series in such instances. You only difference series that contain stochastic time trends, i.e. series that are cumulative sums of stationary processes (I we restrict ourselves to processes with a single unit root). You do not difference a time series that does not have a unit root, e.g. a time series with a deterministic time trend. Such series are called trend stationary. Differencing such a series creates a unit-root MA(1) component which, if neglected, messes up estimates of the other parameters in the model. This problem is called over-differencing .
