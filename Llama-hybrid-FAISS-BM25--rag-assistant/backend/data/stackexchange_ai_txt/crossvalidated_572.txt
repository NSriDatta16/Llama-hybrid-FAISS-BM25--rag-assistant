I think Graham's second paragraph gets at the heart of the matter. I suspect it's not so much technical than historical, probably due to the influence of " Statistical Methods for Research Workers ", and the ease of teaching/applying the tool for non-statisticans in experimental analysis involving discrete factors, rather than delving into model building and associated tools. In statistics, ANOVA is usually taught as a special case of regression. (I think this is similar to why biostatistics is filled with a myriad of eponymous "tests" rather than emphasizing model building.)
