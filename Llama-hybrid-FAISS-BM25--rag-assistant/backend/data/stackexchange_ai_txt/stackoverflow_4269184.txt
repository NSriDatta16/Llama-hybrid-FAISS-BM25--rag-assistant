Question about Jquery UI Sortable, Option Handle

I want to use Jquery UI Sortable to implement drag-drop and sortable display. In addition, I want just use a specific area(header) to drag-drop. Example: $( ".selector" ).sortable({ handle: 'h2' }); The 'handle' option restricts sort start click to the specified element. Code example here, http://jsfiddle.net/dodoflying/9BkJ5/ The problem is, when I moved on 'h2', I want to see a little 'hand' to show this can drag and drop, I guess it could implement directly use Jquery. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!
