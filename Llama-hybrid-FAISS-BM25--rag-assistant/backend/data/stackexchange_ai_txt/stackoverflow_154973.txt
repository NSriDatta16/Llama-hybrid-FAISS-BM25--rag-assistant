A good practice is to design the core of the site within about 750 pixels, so that the 5%-15% of our audience who still have 800px monitors can read it without scrolling. You can then put less-crucial information (advertising, non-mission-critical features) in an additional 250px column to the right that will be visible to visitors with 1024px or more. Also as jimharries99 suggests, internet-wide statistics for screens (or browsers, or whatever) may not match your audience profile, so you should use analytics to get a handle on your specific audience. For example, some of the sites we build get most of their traffic within a certain government agency that standardizes on IE6 (other browsers forbidden) and has a lot of 800x600 displays. Wired Magazine's audience, on the other hand, probably has bigger screens and more modern browsers than average.
