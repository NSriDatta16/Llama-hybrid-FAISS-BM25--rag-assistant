Batch size specify the number of observations used to adjust the parameters for each iteration. If it is 1, the result from this observation will be used. If it is more than 1, average performance will be used. Ideally you should consider batch size as a hyperparameter. Which means that you should determine the optimal batch size for your problem. You may use a simple for loop or grid/random search with other hyperparameters.
