Accessing POST Data from WSGI

I can't seem to figure out how to access POST data using WSGI. I tried the example on the wsgi.org website and it didn't work. I'm using Python 3.0 right now. Please don't recommend a WSGI framework as that is not what I'm looking for. I would like to figure out how to get it into a fieldstorage object.
