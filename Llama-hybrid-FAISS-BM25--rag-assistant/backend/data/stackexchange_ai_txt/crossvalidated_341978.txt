neural network for regression - actual data vs predicted data

I'm building a neural network (for regression) in R using the nnet() package. My dependent variable's between -0.454 and 1.000, so I squared the variable to get a 0-1 range for my model, and then I took the square root to restore the original scale. When I plot the actual data and the output of my model using the predict() function, I find the predicted data points to be of a single value (0.560). It's my first time building a NN (previously I've stuck to linear regression models), so I'm not sure what's going on. Is this single value some kind of averaged output, or do I need to look into the structure/size of my network? Thanks! nnet.fit
