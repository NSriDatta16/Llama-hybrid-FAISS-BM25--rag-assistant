Is there any time series model which handles data at variable frequencies.?

Goal: Predict the yellow points.(yellow events appear at varying frequencies) But I'm struggling to find a good model to fit this use case. Most of the time series algorithms are handling data which are at same frequencies(like per day/every 10 secs). I tried a lot of stuff but may be completely on the wrong approach. Thanks a lot for any hint!!!
