recognizing letter in image OCR

i searched with no result. If i copy other topic, please delete, not making mess. I have question about image recognition OCR using C# I am working on image which shows the scrabble. First i converted image to grayscale, thresholded to find out only black letters and then I used median to avoid the walls around letters. Now, how to start to get at the end function which will recognize letter? Should i somehow now separate 'foreach' letters :-) or just start recognizing ? On what problem should i take attention before start recognizing? Any sources will be welcome. :-) Any idea will be also very helpful.
