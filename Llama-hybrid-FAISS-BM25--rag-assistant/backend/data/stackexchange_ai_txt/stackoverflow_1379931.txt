Geez man, have some fun with it. Pick something that you'd like to make and then start making it. If a book helps you to make it faster/easier/whatever then get the book. If the project is at work, then learn the necessary skills needed to do the project and get it done. I'd say I've learned the most by reading some blogs, and doing my own projects because they are fun. Who the hell goes and sits down and reads a 500 page book on tech crap? You could, and you could have no life. Or you could be pragmatic and use parts of the book to get real world things working and learn more about the process of completing something than just coding. Course, you'd learn coding along the way.
