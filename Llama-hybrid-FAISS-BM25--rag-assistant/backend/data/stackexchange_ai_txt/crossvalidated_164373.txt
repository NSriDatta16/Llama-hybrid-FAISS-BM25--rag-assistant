If your sole need is to express your relative uncertainty in the probability of a declined transaction each day, it would seem you could fit a simple beta-binomial model. In this model, each of $n$ total transactions has the same probability $p$ of success, and there are $k$ total successes. If you took the cookie-cutter Bayesian approach and assumed this value was equally likely to be any value between $0$ and $1$ at the start of each day, then the uncertain estimate you're looking for could be expressed as a $Beta(n + 1, k + 1)$ distribution. You could then use summary statistics, say the 95% highest-density interval, to express this uncertainty. For your data, these distributions would produce plots like this (Python code to produce them below): from matplotlib import pylab as plt from scipy.stats import beta x = np.linspace(0,1,100) y1 = beta.pdf(x, 80, 51) y2 = beta.pdf(x, 12, 8) plt.plot(x, y1) plt.plot(x, y2)
