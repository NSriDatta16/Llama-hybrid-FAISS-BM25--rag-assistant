Time series model in production - Re-train on the fly as as batch process?

Let's say I've a time series of phone calls per day over the last three years. I could train a model using exponential smoothing (e.g. HoltWinters) for predicting the future amount of phone calls per day. I want to use this model in an interactive dashboard, that visualize the phone data of the past as well as the prediction for the next 10 days. Of course the data set grows with every day, because every day new phone calls are received. My first approach was to train the model on the fly, therefore every time the dashboard is opened. This doesn't seem to be a good option because the data set is pretty large. In other ML projects I used batch processing and re-trained the model periodically. Is this also an option for time series, even if the time series has already changed after one day? If yes, at what intervals should the forecast model of the time series be retrained?
