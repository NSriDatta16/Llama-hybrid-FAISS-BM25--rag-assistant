How can $E(X)$be factored out of integration?

Recently, I posted a question on this forum here . In the answer to the question, it was posted suggesting that $$\int_x (x - E(X)) E(Y|X) f_xdx = \int_x x E(Y|X) f_x dx - E(X) \int_x E(Y|X) f_x dx .$$ Note : I have taken the liberty of interchanging LHS and RHS of the equation to make myself clear. I am lost as to how $E(X)$ can be factored out of integration, since it is not a constant, but still a function of $X$ . P.S: The answer to the original post did seem to have answer that question, but I got confused regarding this later.
