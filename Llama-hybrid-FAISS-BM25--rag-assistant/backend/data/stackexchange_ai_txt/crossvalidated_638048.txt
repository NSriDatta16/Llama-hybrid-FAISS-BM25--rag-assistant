What's the interpretation of the intercept of a linear mixed effect model with only one group

I'm trying to understand the meaning of the intercept term in a linear mixed model. The caveat here is that the dataset the LME will be built upon will only consist of subjects from a single class (group). All subjects will have technical replicates, some more than others. Thus, the formula is as follows: $y = B0 + (1|\text{subject})$ The subject is the random effect (to account for intra subject variance), y is the response variable and B0 is the intercept. My understanding when doing some prior searching is that this could be intepreted as a "mean model", with the "mean" being the B0. However that is in the context of a linear model, not a linear mixed effect model. Thus I was wondering if someone could help shed some light on to what the B0 means in this case (especially given the fact that the dataset consists of subjects from one class (group) only), and if it is a valid method in getting a "group representative value". For example I run the above LME on two separate groups (group $A$ and group $B$ ) such that I now have $B_{0_A} $ and $B_{0_B} $ Would it be a valid to then run a statistical test using the above group representative values given that they were not quantified from the classical method of averaging? To clarify, I will also have the standard error of B0_A and B0_B from the algorithm used (fitlme in MATLAB)
