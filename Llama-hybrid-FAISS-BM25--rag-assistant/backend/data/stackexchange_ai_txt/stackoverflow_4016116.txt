Query Active Directory from ASP.NET and bind result to List View

I managed to do ASP.NET authentication work wih AD. Now, I want to query an OU in AD and display the result either ListView or GridView in ASP.NET page. Here's the Domain Controller: dc.itlab.edu The OU: UsersStudents In the organizational unit (OU) UsersStudents there are following columns: First Name, Last Name, Pre-Windows 2000 Logon Name, Name , Type I want to query column First Name, Last Name, Pre-Windows 2000 Logon Name in OU UsersStudents and bind the result to ListView or GridView. Thank you for suggestion either in C# or VB.NET.
