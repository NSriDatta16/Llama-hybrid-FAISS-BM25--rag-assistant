Your question isn't quite clear to me. Do you wonder which part of your application takes the time? Or do you want to observe the time a certain part of your code takes. In the first case use a proper file. VisualVM and YourKit are both fine profilers, I've used them before and found them very helpfull. In the latter case, I would try a tool like Perf4J which allows you to annotate a method and observe its average runtime, its standard deviation and other thing in realtime or afterwards.
