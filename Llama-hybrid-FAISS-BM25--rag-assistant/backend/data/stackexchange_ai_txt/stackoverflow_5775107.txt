as said in soe of the answers above, I'm pretty sure j query's draggable/droppable plugin will do the job for you if you just need a basic drag and drop dress me up type of game. Basic premise is this: in the default example, your avatar to wear the clothes would be a div with a png/gif.jpg background image of a girl/boy whatever(instead of an orange drop here background) the clothes will be the "drag me to my target" objects in the example. you can create them as divs or even image tags that have the draggable class in them so you can drag them around and drop them in the orange boxes/avatars. you can save the data using ajax, which is also covered in the examples there(or other tutorials in the net, it's easy) ??? PROFIT Just try it out and see for yourself. If you need any help you can just ask here again, but I do think that the jquery UI answers are valid answers to your problem. I don't have an example site to show you, but I'm pretty sure given some images and stuff I can whip out something...if I had the time lol.
