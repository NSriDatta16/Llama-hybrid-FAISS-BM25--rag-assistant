JavaScript is a prototype-based programming language (probably prototype-based scripting language is more correct definition). It employs cloning and not inheritance. A prototype-based programming language is a style of object-oriented programming without classes. While object-oriented programming languages encourages development focus on taxonomy and relationships, prototype-based programming languages encourages to focus on behavior first and then later classify. The term “object-oriented” was coined by Alan Kay in 1967, who explains it in 2003 to mean only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. (source) In object-oriented programming, each object is capable of receiving messages, processing data, and sending messages to other objects. For a language to be object-oriented in may include features as encapsulation, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance, but it is not a requirement. Object-oriented programming languages that make use of classes are often referred to as classed-based programming languages, but it is by no means a must to make use of classes to be object-oriented. JavaScript uses prototypes to define object properties, including methods and inheritance. Conclusion: JavaScript IS object-oriented.
