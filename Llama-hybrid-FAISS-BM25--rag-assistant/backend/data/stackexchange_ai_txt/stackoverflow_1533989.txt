Is there a breaking point when a database transaction will get corrupted?

I'm interested in how database transactions "commonly" are implemented in a database system, like for instance MySQL. Assuming the actual writing of data to the physical database storage isn't an atomic operation (speaking in terms of clockcycles now), shouldn't I be able to corrupt a transaction by for instance ripping the power cable at some carefully chosen moment?
