iPhone - how to track touches and allow button taps at the same time?

I'm wondering how to track touches anywhere on the iPhone screen and still have UIButtons respond to taps. I subclassed a UIView, made it full screen and the highest view in the hierarchy, and overrode its pointInside:withEvent method. If I return YES, I'm able to track touches anywhere on the screen but the buttons don't respond (likely because the view is instructed to handle and terminate the touch). If I return NO, the touch passes through the view and the buttons respond, but I'm not able to track touches. Do I need to subclass UIButton or is this possible through the responder chain? What am I doing wrong? - (BOOL)pointInside:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ return NO; } //only works if pointInside:withEvent: returns YES. -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSLog(@"began"); [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } //only works if pointInside:withEvent: returns YES. -(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSLog(@"end"); [self.nextResponder touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; }
