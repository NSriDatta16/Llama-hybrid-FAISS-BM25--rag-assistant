XSLT Assignment of element value to variable: Works with Altova XML Spy, but fails in .NET app

I want to tightly grasp the hair on the back of a Microsoft employee's head, using it as leverage to pound his head forcefully and repeatedly against a hard surface! That would make me feel nearly as good as solving this problem right now. I've got a simple XML message that looks like this: 1 A web service on the device I'm working with returns several such messages and I'm converting them to a different format. For the above message the new format would look like the following: instrumentStatus Running There is a mapping for status_id integer values in the XML as follows: status-id Meaning ========= ======= 0 Ready 1 Running 2 NotReady 3 PoweringUp 4 PoweringDown 5 PoweredUp 6 PoweredDown 7 Tuning 8 Error My XSLT is working correctly and giving me the correct output when I use Altova XMLSpy, but when I run my .NET application, I'm getting a failure at the point where the mapping for the status_id integer is converted to one of the allowable enumerated strings. Instead of getting the enumerated value, the MS XSLT processor returns an empty string and I get an empty element in the output XML. The following is my XSLT code with some sections removed to reduce the amount of space: apiInfo instrumentStatus Ready Running NotReady PoweringUp PoweringDown PoweredUp PoweredDown Tuning Error Is there XSLT 1.0 code that will behave the same in both Altova XMLSpy and the MS XSLT processor? Thanks, AlarmTripper
