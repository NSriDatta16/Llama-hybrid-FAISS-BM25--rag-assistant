Do you know any technique for checking if a machine learning regression model gives different performance for different values of features?

Letâ€™s say I have fitted a regression model on a large dataset, and I obtain an estimation performance metrics (R-squared, RMSE) for the whole dataset, via cross validation or via a test set. However, this estimation is relative to the whole dataset, with no difference in different parts of the feature space. It would be possible that the model perform well for certain values of the features, and bad for certain other values. How can I detect that? Is there any technique? The only thing I can imagine is to build several test sets containing data with different feature values. But that is gonna be very complicated and arbitrary if I have a large number of features. Do you have any idea? Thanks a lot in advance, All the best Davide
