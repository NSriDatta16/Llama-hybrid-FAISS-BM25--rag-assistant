If you don't have a valid instrument, then the bias can actually be worse using TSLS/IV as compared to the standard linear model. If you have a valid instrument, then your bias will be 0 on average, but your standard errors will be larger. For some information on these cases, see Bound, John, David A. Jaeger, and Regina M. Baker. 1995 "Problems with Instrumental Variables Estimation When the Correlation Between the Instruments and the Endogeneous Explanatory Variable is Weak." Journal of the American Statistical Association . 90(430): 443--450. [ jstor ]
