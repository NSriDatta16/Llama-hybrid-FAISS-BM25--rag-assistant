If I know specific pair of characters that model confuses in OCR task how can I fixe it?

I train OCR model to recognize cyrillic handwritten text. I know, for example, that it confuses very often 'Ð‘' with '6'. How can I use this information to fine tune the model ? Just in case, my architecture is resnet50 + transformer UPD: train data is crops with one or two words (sequence of characters). Overall my model is able to predict 82 characters.
