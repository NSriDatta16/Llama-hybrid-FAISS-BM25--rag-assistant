this should work when the hosts on your network react to ICMP packages (ping) (>JDK 5): public void checkHosts(String subnet){ int timeout=1000; for (int i=1;i invoke the method for a subnet (192.168.0.1-254) like this: checkHosts("192.168.0"); didnt test it but should work kinda like this. Obviously this only checks the 254 hosts in the last byte of the ip address... check: http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html#isReachable%28int%29 http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/how-to-do-icmp-ping-in-java-jdk-15-and-above/ hope that helped
