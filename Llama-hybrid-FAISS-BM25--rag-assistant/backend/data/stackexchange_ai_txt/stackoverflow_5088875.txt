Use Expression Web with ASP.Net MVC

First of all my question is what's the best tool, for create a asp.net mvc style. I believe that it's possible to create an asp.net style (css) with Expression Web, but my doubt is, for example, how to create a table's style (and also dynamic or style create with markup ), if the data are not visible. There're methods to allow that? thanks so much for replies Alberto
