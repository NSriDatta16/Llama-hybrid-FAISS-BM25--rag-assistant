I think the overlap is a visual artifact of reducing a high-dimensional space to a 2D space. I guess you used some PCA or multidimensional scaling technique to produce your plot? If I interpret your figure correctly, your "Dim1" captures only 15.9% of the variation so I would say that two dimensions are not very good at representing the whole dataset. After cutting a tree produced by hierarchical clustering, a data point should belong to only one cluster. Perhaps you should be concerned about whether 6 clusters are not too many, but that depends on what you want to do with the clusters and how much separation you can reasonably expect.
