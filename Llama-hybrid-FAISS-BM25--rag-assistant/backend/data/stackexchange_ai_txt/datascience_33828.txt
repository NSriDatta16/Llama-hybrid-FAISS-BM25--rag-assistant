I think the difference between the gradient boosting and the Xgboost is in xgboost the algorithm focuses on the computational power, by parallelizing the tree formation which one can see in this blog . Gradient boosting only focuses on the variance but not the trade off between bias where as the xg boost can also focus on the regularization factor.
