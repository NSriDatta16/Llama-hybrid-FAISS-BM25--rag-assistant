In keeping with pragmatical spirit of Perl, I would only add base class if it was valuable by itself. Adding a collection of empty functions is not much fun. On the other hand, the base class can be useful as a place to keep your POD. And to define some constants... Do you have Foo::Type.pm? If you do, and discuss generate_foo there, then there is no need for Generator.pm... Yes, it's a judgment call.
