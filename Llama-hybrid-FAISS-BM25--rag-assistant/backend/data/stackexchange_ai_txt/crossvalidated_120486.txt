Modelling interaction

How does adding interaction term in the model adjust for it or why do we need to add interaction? I am working on logistic regression model with treatment and race as predictors. I have added interaction of treatment and race in the model. Are we accounting for variability caused by the interaction term here? I will be grateful to intuitive explanation.
