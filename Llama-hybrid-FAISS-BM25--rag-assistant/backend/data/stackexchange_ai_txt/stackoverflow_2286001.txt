advanced search with configurable product in Magento

I have a clothing e-commerce website. I created color and size attributes and used them with configurable products. The configurable products have at least two associated products and those associated products have color and size options. When I use advanced search to search items with a specified size attribute, nothing shows up on the result page. I guess it is because associated products' visibility is set to "Nowhere". How do fix this?
