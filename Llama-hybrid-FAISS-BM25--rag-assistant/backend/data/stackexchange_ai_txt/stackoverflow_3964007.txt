It really is a matter of taste and use. For pascal like programmers, it's very clear if you're reading or writing a value, so I think the code is more readable if you do not use getters and setters in the java-like way where you write GetXXX or SetXXX in every sentence of your program. For me, and I assume for the majority of pascal programmers, the code is more readable if you just put the name of the property you're reading/writing, and we all know a Getter or Setter method will be called (if necessary). Also, I think it is a huge benefit (and elegance) from the delphi property model that you can get/set the property value directly from a field To have a lot of Get/Set methods with just a line of code where the value is assigned or read from a field is a total waste of effort/time.
