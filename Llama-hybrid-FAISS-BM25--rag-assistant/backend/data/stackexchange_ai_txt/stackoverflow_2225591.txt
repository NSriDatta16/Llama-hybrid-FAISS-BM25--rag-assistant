You can check the $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] variable which will contain the URL the person has navigated from. I'm not sure what happens if they choose a bookmark or enter the URL manually, though I suspect that this variable would be blank. Though, as it says in the manual : The address of the page (if any) which referred the user agent to the current page. This is set by the user agent. Not all user agents will set this, and some provide the ability to modify HTTP_REFERER as a feature. In short, it cannot really be trusted.
