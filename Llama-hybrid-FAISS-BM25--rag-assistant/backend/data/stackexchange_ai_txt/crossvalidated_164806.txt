How to determine efficiency of something?

What data I have? Number of causes for events, number of events, monetary value of each event, grouped by some trait. Ex. 10,000 visits, 50 purchases, each purchase €5-20, grouped by stores. What I want to do? I want to take data available to me and extract some kind of measure to determine how efficient is each X (store). Considering the example, there could, be three cases: A store has 100 visits, 10 sales, each €5; B store has 50 visits, 40 sales, each €20; C store has 5000 visits, 40 sales, each €20; clearly, B is more efficient - while having less visits, it clearly made the most revenues. What is the goal? I would like to have some sort of metric which I can store and evaluate against progression of time (B was more effective last week, than it is today). What is the question? Given these metrics, how can I calculate one something that can be stored and compared over time and against other groupings? For example, can I have a magic number of sorts derived from these metrics that I can later just compare against between two stores and between the same store in time series? How? EDIT 1: one something that I can do is calculate, for example, sum of sales per 1000 visits and then compare that - like some kind of CPM metric. I guess that could do? EDIT 2: So far I went for (sum of sales / (number of visits / 1000)) which gives me a sort of "value per mille" measure that is comparable between the time-series of same group; is comparable between time-series of different groups; gives an insight of the actual throughput performance - higher value per mille = better; Not a perfect solution that accounts for ratio of sales against visits, but good enough. Can this be improved to account for that? Sidenote: I am fairly confident that 99% of the stuff in the CV, beyond Pearson's and chi-squared, is Voodoo and black magic. Dumb it down, if you can.
