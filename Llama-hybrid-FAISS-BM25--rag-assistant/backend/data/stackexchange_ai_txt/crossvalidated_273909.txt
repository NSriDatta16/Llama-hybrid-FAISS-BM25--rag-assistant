How to train an SVR model?

I'm trying to figure out how SVR works, as I need to use it to model some time series. For this purpose, before starting with this model, I've tried to create a toy-model from a sinusoidal function, with two different approaches: Randomly splitting the data between train and test Using the first 70% for training and the rest por test Are this two approaches valid? The first one generates a model with a high accuracy, but the second isn't predicting even the training data. Just for helping to spot the mistake, here is the code of both approaches, using R and e1071 library (I've tried also with kernlab library, with similar results). In mt first attemp I did this: require(e1071) n With this result: Here is the code for the second one: require(e1071) x But the result is clearly wrong: Do you have any clue about what I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance!
