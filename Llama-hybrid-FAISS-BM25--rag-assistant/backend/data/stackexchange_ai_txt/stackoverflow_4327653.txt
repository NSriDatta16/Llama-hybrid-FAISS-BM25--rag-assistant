SSIS Transform Component: Large Scale Data Storage

I'm developing an SSIS Transform component that will need to store the contents of the incoming data stream and then output the data at a later point in time. This could be a large number of records with many fields (of any data type). For example, this type of storage would be needed if you were developing a 'Sort' component, where you cannot output a single record until all records have been input. My question is - what is the recommended practice for storing this temporary data? The Microsoft and Codeplex examples I've seen are somewhat trivial in that they use in-memory structures. I would like to avoid this, as this would seem to be a very bad idea when working with large data sets. Is there a mechanism in the SSIS library to do this? [okay, it looks like there is not] I'm considering a few options: Store the data on disk in a stream, keeping the record offsets into this stream in memory. During the output phase, I'll use these offsets to locate the desired record. Store the data in an ADO or OLEDB data source of the user's choosing. Other suggestions?
