Can a neural network be used to optimize an objective cost function?

I have been reading into Neural Networks with the aim of using them to optimize a multi objective cost function (aka finding Pareto fronts) which takes a long time to call. The inputs are constrained to within a certain range of real numbers. Is the ONLY way a NN can help with this task is to come up with a computationally faster function to call to find an optimal solution or is there something more clever that I can do? For example, can I teach the system using reverse data such that the objective function's output is my NN input and vice versa and try values of object output for a maxima/minima?
