Are Box-Cox and differencing redundant or complementary?

I was always under the impression that differencing and Box-Cox were two ways to achieve the same goal: Making a time series stationary so that it can be modeled using an ARMA process. However, looking at the code for auto.arima(), I notice that there is an option to include a Box-Cox transformation, which if my idea about redundancy is correct, doesn't make sense. Now I am questioning whether that was correct to start with: Is it correct that Box-Cox and differencing are two means to the same end? If not, what does Box-Cox do exactly, since it seems that differencing already makes the time series stationary? Does the combination of ARMA + Box-Cox still count as ARIMA (based on the inclusion of Box-Cox in the auto.arima() function) - since the "I" is no longer necessary? Or does it count as an ARIMA-like approach, but not ARIMA strictly speaking?
