Use usort() and a custom comparison function: function date_compare($a, $b) { $t1 = strtotime($a['datetime']); $t2 = strtotime($b['datetime']); return $t1 - $t2; } usort($array, 'date_compare'); EDIT : Your data is organized in an array of arrays. To better distinguish those, let's call the inner arrays (data) records, so that your data really is an array of records. usort will pass two of these records to the given comparison function date_compare() at a a time. date_compare then extracts the "datetime" field of each record as a UNIX timestamp (an integer), and returns the difference, so that the result will be 0 if both dates are equal, a positive number if the first one ( $a ) is larger or a negative value if the second argument ( $b ) is larger. usort() uses this information to sort the array.
