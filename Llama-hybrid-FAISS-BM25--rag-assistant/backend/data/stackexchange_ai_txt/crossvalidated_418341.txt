model between a categorical variable and numerical variable over time

I have a dataset which has 4 fields as below: Day Category #people #Rank 2011-01-01 A 100 10 2011-01-01 B 120 12 2011-01-02 A 50 13 2011-01-02 C 122 42 2011-01-02 D 20 20 ... ... ... .... In the category filed I have 10 category then I want to model the relationship between the Category and number of people. I have used Multiple linear regression on the category filed but the R2 is so small after I remove the variables using backward elimination technique. Could you please suggest me what is a best approach? Shall I consider the time series?
