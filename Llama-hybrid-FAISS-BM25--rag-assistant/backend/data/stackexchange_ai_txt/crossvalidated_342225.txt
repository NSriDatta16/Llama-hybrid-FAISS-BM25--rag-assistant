Optimization in Bayesian Settings

I am curious to know of instances when optimization is used in Bayesian settings (not to be confused with Bayesian optimization). The obvious contenders are MAP estimation Optimization as part of variational Bayes for making inference for Bayesian models. Finding posterior mode(s) for implementing MCMC (similar in flavor to MAP estimation) This seems like not an exhaustive list, and I feel I may be missing some interesting problems. My motivation is to identify areas in Bayesian analysis where an expert in optimization might be able to contribute research in.
