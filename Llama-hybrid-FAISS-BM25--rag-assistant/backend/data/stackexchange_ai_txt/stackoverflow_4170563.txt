Search and replace in MySQL database?

I have an unusual problem (this is linked to Browser displays � instead of ´ ) I had mismatched character encoding settings on my server (UTF-8) and application (ISO-8859-1), so a third person tasked with entering Spanish translations, entered the words properly at his end, but they weren't saved correctly in the database. I have subsequently fixed the problem and the server is now ISO-8859-1 as well. [I set default_charset = "iso-8859-1" in php.ini] I do see a pattern in what is in the system, for example the following appears on the system: Nombre de la organizaciÃ³n* This needs to be: Nombre de la organización* ie, I need to search and replace 'Ã³' with 'ó'. How can I do so for an entire table (all fields)? (there will be other such corrections as well)
