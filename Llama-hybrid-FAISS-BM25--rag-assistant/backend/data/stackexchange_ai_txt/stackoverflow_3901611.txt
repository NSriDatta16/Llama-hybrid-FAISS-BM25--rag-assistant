Google Maps API V3: limit map bounds

I'm trying to set bounds where you can drag the map using Google Maps API V3 Here is the solution for V2 http://econym.org.uk/gmap/example_range.htm that works pretty well. However with API V3 it isn't so good: when you use the same checkbounds() function, the map is twitching when you reach the bound while map.setCenter() changes the center of the map. How to fix it? What is the solution for API V3?
