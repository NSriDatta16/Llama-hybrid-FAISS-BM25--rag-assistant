Use Awk to Print every character as its own column?

I am in need of reorganizing a large CSV file. The first column, which is currently a 6 digit number needs to be split up, using commas as the field separator. For example, I need this: 022250,10:50 AM,274,22,50 022255,11:55 AM,275,22,55 turned into this: 0,2,2,2,5,0,10:50 AM,274,22,50 0,2,2,2,5,5,11:55 AM,275,22,55 Let me know what you think! Thanks!
