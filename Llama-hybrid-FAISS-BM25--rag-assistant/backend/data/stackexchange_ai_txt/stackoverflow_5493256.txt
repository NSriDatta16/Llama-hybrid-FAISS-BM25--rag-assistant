How to fill browser window with rotating background Image?

I'm trying to figure out how to fill a browser window with a background image and have the image scale if the user adjusts the browser window screen. Additionally I'd like to have the background image rotate among 3 to 5 different images. An example of what I'm after can be seen here: http://elegantthemes.com/preview/InStyle/
