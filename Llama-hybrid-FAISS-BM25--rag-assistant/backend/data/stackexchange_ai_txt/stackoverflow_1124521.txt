what if you modeled each key/value pair as first class objects? e.g. : class MyKeyValue { static mapping={ id generator:'assigned' } String id String value //i guess this could be an object of some sort, as long as it is a valid property (like Date) def getKey = { return id; } } class User { //...other properties //you'd put this property where the hashmap was originally. List MyKeyValue } The generate-all command will create a rather plain UI for this, but its usable, and is a starting point for customization. You could then write your own constraints, and leverage the GORM's built in validation etc. However, its a bit hacky imo - and the performance won't be great, but if you only have a few, i dont think thats gonna matter.
