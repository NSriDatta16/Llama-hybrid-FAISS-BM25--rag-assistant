Adjust for one factor in time series analysis

I would like to analyze whether blood pressure is higher in winter than in summer through time series analysis: in particular, I would like to use repeated/pooled cross-sectional time series analysis in my sample. I want to know: I suspect that blood pressure could increase together with aging in my sample, so, how can I take into account it? For example, to address the issue that blood pressure could be seasonal only because age is. (I use R)
