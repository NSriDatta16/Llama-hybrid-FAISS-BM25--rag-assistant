Help with Power Curve MCMC

I'm trying to analyze some $D$ non-logistic cumulative data in a time series, bounded below by 0 and unbounded above. Splitting data into $W$ time windows of $d$ days, I know each window can be described by one of these four different growths: exponential linear logarithmic constant Example of data: require(RcppRoll) rawData I thought to use a very simple power curve (Freundlich) $y = \alpha \cdot x ^ \beta$ where $x = [1 ... d]$ that can describe all wanted growth types: $\beta = 0$ , constant $0 , logarithmic $\beta = 1$ , linear $\beta > 1$ , exponential Using scipy module curve_fit in python it correctly works but I want to do it bayesian with a Markov chain Monte Carlo in R to obtain $\beta$ params HDIs. So I thought to use JAGS and: split $D$ data into $W$ time windows of $d$ days (I chose $d=14$ ), where each window starts from $t_0 \in \{D_0, D_1, D_2 ... D_{n-d}\}$ let each window first element be 1 (subtracting the first window element to the vector and adding 1) calculate $\mathbb{E}[y]$ expected with the chosen power equation distribute observed $y$ in each time window as Normal with $\tau$ precision distribute $\alpha$ and $\beta$ params priors as Uniform within an expected range distribute $\tau$ as uninformative Gamma model { for ( s in 1:Stot ) { alpha[s] ~ dunif( 0 , 2 ) beta[s] ~ dunif( -1 , 10 ) tau[s] ~ dgamma( 0.001 , 0.001 ) sigma[s] Running JAGS with n.chains=4 , adapt=100 , burnin=500 , sample=1000 , thin=1 , Even if $\beta$ params Means are correctly estimated, many windows show autocorrelation and/or very bad traces. Results of $\beta$ param: Example of very bad traces: Example of "not too bad" (but maybe not optimal) traces: What am I missing? Any suggestions on how to fix/improve the MCMC? Thank you!
