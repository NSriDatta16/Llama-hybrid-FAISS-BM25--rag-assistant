Why not make use of date/time field to include test time? It is best to format dates, assuming that b5 is a date type: testDate = Format(Range("b5").Value,"yyyy/mm/dd") You will end up with text, but this is not important. stSQL1 = "INSERT INTO [Friction Tests] ([Runway Number], [Runway Test Side], " _ & "[Test Date], [Test Time], [1/3], [2/3], [3/3], [Average]) " _ & "VALUES ( " & rwyNumber & ",#" & testDate & "#,#" & testTime _ & "#," & rwySide1 & "," & firstThird1 _ & "," & secondThird1 & "," & thirdThird1 _ & "," & averageFriction1 & ")" If any of the fields are text, the value will have to be surrounded by single quotes or two double quotes, in a similar way to date and time. I strongly recommend getting rid of spaces in field (column) and table names.
