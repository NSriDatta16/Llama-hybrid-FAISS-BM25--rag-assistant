I'd go with @feverentcoder on the CI arguments. CI is your friend, let him help you! As for the Branch/Trunk point- everyone should always work on the trunk , branch es are for spikes and POCs, tag all releases When it comes to processes, it's usually beneficial to find practices that are are relevant to you and then build micro-processes around them. Also, use only those practices/processes that you feel enhance productivity. Lastly, be courageous- try a practice for a week or two to see if it works with you; if it doesn't, throw it away. You just learned one more way not to make a light bulb!
