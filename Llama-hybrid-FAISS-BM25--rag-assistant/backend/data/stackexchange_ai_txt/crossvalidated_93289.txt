A new piece of clue for document classification?

I am working on a document classification problem. I am using the typical vector space model to represent a document as doc-term vector. If document has some term, the vector entry for that term is 1. But with the training data, I can get a piece of information which I think may be useful. It is the term popularity within each category respectively. It is defined as below: $$ \text{Popularity} (\text{term}\ T, \text{category}\ X) = \frac{\text{documents belonging to}\ X\ \text{containing}\ T}{\text{total documents belonging to}\ X} $$ This is calculated with the training set. I believe this value can be interpreted as the representability of a term for a certain category, which in other words, is the term's popularity within a certain category. I have a feeling that it could somehow influence the vector weight for a term. But I haven't figured out a reasonable way to use it. If I want to use this popularity value for a new document to be classified, I need to know its category first (or do I?). This is kind of a dilemma. Could anyone shed some light? Could this clue be helpful in the classification? ADD 1 Here is my first attempt to use this Popularity value. For each doc to be classified, I make an assumption about its category, and multiply the BIT vector with the term-popularity values for that assumed category. And then, I use some machine learning algorithm to calculate the probability for this doc belong to that assumed category with the new vector. I did this assume-predict for each category. And finally I get a list of probabilities for each category. Then I choose the category with maximum probability as the final prediction. BUT, the result turns out not as good as I expected. It seems even worse than BIT (I am not 100% sure about this.)
