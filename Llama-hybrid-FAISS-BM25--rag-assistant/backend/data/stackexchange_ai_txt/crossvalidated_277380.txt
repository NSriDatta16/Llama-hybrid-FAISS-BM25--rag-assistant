How can we be sure that the difference in the average ratings of the two groups are really due to difference in the average likeability of the two products, and not merely to differences in the preferences of the people who happened to have been (randomly) assigned to the two respective groups? At the population level, this is, in fact, impossible. That's the value of random assignment. When subjects are randomly assigned to conditions, then the conditions must be drawing on the same population, because the assignment to conditions is guaranteed to be independent of any features of the subjects. Any population difference in outcomes must be causal effects of the conditions themselves, and nothing prior to that. It's possible that you happen to be unlucky such that, in your sample (as opposed to the population), the conditions are highly imbalanced with respect to some pre-intervention characteristic. But this is a kind of sampling error that standard statistical methods, like hypothesis tests, are supposed to help you with.
