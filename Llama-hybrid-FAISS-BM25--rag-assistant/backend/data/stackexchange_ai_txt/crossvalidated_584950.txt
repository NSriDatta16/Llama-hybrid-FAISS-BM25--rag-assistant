dealing with zero inflation in the regression model

I have a longitudinal data, with different follow-up number for individuals. I have considered measurements for each individual as a curve which I already smoothed them, then calculated the area under curve and divided by the interval length to find the average of the curve over a year. My aim is to see if the area is different among individuals with and without cancer. I am doing a mixed model regression using lmer() from lme4 package in R. Note: individuals with Area = 0 are those that have only one follow-up, so that is why there is no curve and area is zero. But I do not want to remove them as they can contribute to the margin. Problems: My outcome distribution is as shown in the picture below is not normal. My outcome is not count otherwise I could do zero-inflated Poisson model. My model is using lmer is as below: Libraray(lme4) lmer.model = lmer(Area ~ cancer+age+gender+education+(1 | sibling id), data = dat, REML = FALSE) I got a suggestion to try: library(gamlss) library(gamlss.inf) gamlss.model The problem is that the gamlssZadj() dose not account for dependency in my moded which comes from the siblings. Is there any suggestion.
