Time series statistical model evaluation: weighted average across different forecast horizons

I want to use an ARIMA based or Prophet-based model to train on my data. I have split my data into train and test, and the model is trained on train only and forecasts for test. The further the forecasts in the test, the worse the error, since it has been trained on train and further down the line from the train, the model might err more. In that case when evaluating the test data forecasts for the error metrics, shouldn't we take a weighted average considering the proximity of the forecasts to the end of train data as the weight since they would be more accurate? Would love your thoughts on this, thanks for the help in advance :)
