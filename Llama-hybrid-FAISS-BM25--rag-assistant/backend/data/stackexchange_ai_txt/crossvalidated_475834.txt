Non authorized actions with Policy gradient algorithm

I am using Reinforce algorithm to learn the optimal policy in problem where the action space is dynamic. It depends on the state, in each state, the agent is allowed to choose among a subset of the general action space. At each state, the policy network outputs a probability distribution over the actions, however some actions are not allowed and get a chance to be sampled. What I tried is to modify the output of the policy network and assign a zero probability to the non authorized actions. I want to know if there is another approach to solve this issue without hard-coding the probabilities because this lead to a sub-optimal behavior.
