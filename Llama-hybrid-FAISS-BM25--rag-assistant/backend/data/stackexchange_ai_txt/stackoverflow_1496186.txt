From http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data : Every HTML element may have any number of custom data attributes specified, with any value. That which is used to parse/process these data-* attribute values will have limitations. Turns out the data-attributes and values are placed in a DOMStringMap object. This has no inherent limits. From http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#domstringmap : Note: The DOMStringMap interface definition here is only intended for JavaScript environments. Other language bindings will need to define how DOMStringMap is to be implemented for those languages DOMStringMap is an interface with a getter, setter, greator and deleter. The setter has two parameters of type DOMString, name and value. The value is of type DOMString that is is mapped directly to a JavaScript String. From https://bytes.com/topic/javascript/answers/92088-max-allowed-length-javascript-string : The maximum length of a JavaScript String is implementation specific.
