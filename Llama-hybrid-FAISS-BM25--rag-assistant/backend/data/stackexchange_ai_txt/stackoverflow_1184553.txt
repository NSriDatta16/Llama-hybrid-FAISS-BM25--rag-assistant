It actually told you. That code is generated by the designer. The designer needs it to be the way it left it. Do not change that code, unless you want the designer to do unpleasant things with it. There's a sort of equilibrium between what you see in a visual designer and the code that it has generated. You start with an empty design surface, so there's no generated code You drag something onto the design surface. The designer generates the code necessary to create it. You set properties of that object, and the designer generates the code that sets the properties as you have specified. You Save and close You reopen the document in the designer. The designer has to figure out what to display on the design surface. It reads the code that it generated, and since it knows the code was generated by itself, it knows what that code means in terms of the design surface. Next time there's a change or save, it will regenerate the code. Now, let's say you make some modification to the generated code. Unless you make that change in exactly the same way the designer would have done, it will not recognize the change. Your change will not show on the design surface. Next time there's a change or save, the designer will regenerate the code without your changes . So, if you don't want to lose your changes to generated code, then don't make any changes to generated code.
