Google App Engine Datastore reference or not?

I am filling up a Big Table with text items from different countries. My question is: should I use a referencePropery to link to languages in another table (that's the way I would do it in a normal MySQL relational database) or just go redundant and specify the language for each text in the table? What's better: redundancy & increase in storage use or more queries & more CPU usage When my database is finished I need to query the database to get different lists with text items from each country.
