If you can use a parametric test for one of these questions, you can use parametric tests for the others, and if not, not. Given that you say the data are ordinal, I would say that the t-test is not appropriate and you should use a test of the median for all three questions; it should probably be the same test for all three questions. A different approach (and the one I would use) is to use ordinal logistic regression with score as the dependent variable.
