Classification or Clustering Approach for Time Series Data of Flow

I have a dataset which contains time-series data of water flow over time. I have a flow meter connected to a kitchen faucet, and I am trying to cluster or classify specific water usage events. The data is collected every second, and in each row I am given a value for the amount of gallons which are flowing through my flow meter. For example, I am trying to classify someone washing their hands, filling a teapot, cleaning dishes, etc... If I run some experiments, I can classify each event and turn it into a supervised learning problem. But at the moment, none of the water events are classified, so it is unsupervised right now. Is there a way that I could create clusters of events based on the duration/volume of the flow? A very abridged version of my dataset looks like the following:
