Graham (2017) (free version here ) describes a model of link formation in networks that allows for homophily and unobservable node heterogeneity. His model might be applicable to your problem. A simpler approach would be to estimate a probit/logit model as you suggested. However, you would need to adjust your estimates' standard errors to correct for the fact that your observations of dyads with common nodes are not independent. (For example, mean sales by companies A and B and not independent of mean sales by companies B and C.) Fafchamps and Gubert (2007) (free version here ) demonstrate how to perform this correction using OLS.
