we count the number of animal captures per day in each category in each site. If you are analyzing count data, then use a model appropriate for count data like a Poisson generalized linear model. You model the actual capture numbers, including the site as a categorical predictor variable in the model along with the other predictors. Then the coefficient for site in the model will be related to the difference in capture numbers between siteA and siteB (with a log link to capture numbers under a standard Poisson model). You could include interactions of site with the predictors, and include an offset term if there is something like site area that would necessarily be associated with capture numbers. It sounds like you are using your study to impute missing values for A -type captures in a large data set with B values. If so, pay attention to the issues in Stef van Buuren's Flexible Imputation of Missing Data . You will probably be best off using your current study to help impute several versions of the larger data set for future analysis.
