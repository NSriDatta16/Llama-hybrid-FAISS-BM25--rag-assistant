How to make Google Chrome extension to run jQuery Script

I have this jquery script: $('[id^=changesetList] tr').each(function () { var sid = $(this).attr('sid'); $(this).find('td span.changesetDescription').append(' ' + sid + ' ').css('color','#777'); }); I want to run this when I visit kilnhg.com. I put in in a kiln_hash.user.js file and installed it into Chrome but it doesn't do anything. I think this might be because it requires jQuery. I have read a few tutorials and it looks like I might need to create a manifest.json file and put that and the .user.js file into a zip file with a .crx extension. I still do not know what I would need to put in the manifest file. How can I get this to work? Update I created a manifest.json file: { "name": "Kiln Hash", "version": "1.0.1", "description": "Show hash in changeset list in Kiln", "content_scripts": [ { "matches": ["https://*.kilnhg.com/*"], "js": ["jquery.js"] } ], "background_page": "bg.html" } I include jquery.js file (version 1.4.2) and the bg.html file: $(document).ready(function(){ $(hash_link).click(function(){ addHash(); return false; }); }); function addHash() { $('[id^=changesetList] tr').each(function () { var sid = $(this).attr('sid'); $(this).find('td span.changesetDescription').append(' ' + sid + ' ').css('color','#777'); }); } Untitled Document Add Hash I packaged this in a zip with .crx extension and when I drag the file into Chrome it asks me if I want to install I say yes. It then tells me "bad magic number" So I go to the Chrome developer dashboard and upload the zip, it accepts it, It makes my pay $5 to upload and then it installs. but it still does nothing.
