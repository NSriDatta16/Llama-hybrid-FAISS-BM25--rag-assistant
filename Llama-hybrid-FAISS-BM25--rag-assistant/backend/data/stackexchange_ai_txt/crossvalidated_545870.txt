Computing logistic regression on variables of different years?

I am very new to R and statistics in general, so it is likely I am adopting the wrong approach. I have a large dataframe made of binary, character and numeric variables with n observations per year. As an example: df My objective is to check whether some variables (for example "Revenue" e "Performance award") in Year T are associated with the dependent variable (e.g., "CEO duality") in Year T+1. Therefore, i realized the logistic regression is the model used to do it. But first, as far as I understood, to lag the dependent variable I first need to make my dataframe a timeseries (right?). I read in other questions that timeseries include one only observation per year... So, how should I approach my problem? Thanks
