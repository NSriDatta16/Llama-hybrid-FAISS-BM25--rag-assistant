I'm pretty sure it's not possible. If I were you I would swallow my grief and create that edit template. The only alternative I can see is to work with the data in your viewmodel and create a separate class that holds the 37 properties that need no changing. Then you make a separate entity for the 3 that need special attention. This way you could have two data forms, one autogenerated and one custom. Hopefully you can then work with styling them so they look like one form. A lot of work, I know, but it might be even more work to create the full edit template.
