At the front side of the famous statistician's office: $$ \mathfrak{ \text{"Let's make the crowd a population" }\\ \text{Thus spoke the Lord and created the statistician.}} $$ At the front side of the pharmacy near the statistics department: $ \qquad \qquad \small \mathcal {\text{Take poisson only on very rare events!}}$ And in the window: $ \qquad \qquad \small \mathcal {\text{Eating average dose of vitamins makes you a robust estimator!"}} $ This one has some double or threefold logic and might be a bit too complicated but I love it especially: $ \qquad \qquad \mathcal {\text{Statistics without hypotheses }\\ \qquad \qquad \text{is like walking in the jungle} \\ \qquad \qquad \text{without map"}}$ (Well, sounds like a good advice - but really: what does help you a map in the jungle, where you've no wide sight and required horizon to relate the map to your position...) These all came from a collection of jokes invented after a nice party.. Here are some more "pearls of wisdom". With a bit of political flair: $ \qquad \qquad $ "The metric of black and white is not ordinal but only nominal" $ \qquad \qquad $$ \qquad \qquad $ (perhaps a bit of too serious matter to serve as a joke...) $ \qquad \qquad $ "Without a bit of deviation poor Government had to divide us by zero" $ \qquad \qquad \qquad $ or even this small one which takes stance $ \qquad \qquad \qquad $ against tendency of conformism, just stating the obvious $ \qquad \qquad $ "A bit of variance cannot be negative!" An advice which the teacher could give any freshman in statistics: $ \qquad \qquad $ If you can't inference -reference! Only small playing with words of factoranalysis: $ \qquad \qquad \mathcal {\text{If you don't like that data have some error,} \\ \qquad \qquad \text{why not rotate him into the article?}}$ and a final one: $ \qquad \qquad \mathcal { \text{Two independent thoughts in mind.} \\ \qquad \qquad \text{Enough to call me 'simple structured'...}}$
