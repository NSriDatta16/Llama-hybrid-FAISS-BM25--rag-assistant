Magento and configurable product attributes

I have an issue with displaying product custom attributes. I've read every resources through google but still no success. The problem is that I have to show size attribute of configurable product on category grid and list view. Every solution on google suggested something like $_product->getAttributeText('size') but I ended up at just a single string - "S" or "M" instead of an array. How can I fetch all possible sizes of all simple products which belongs to particular configurable product without much hassle? UPDATE After using solution proposed by Joseph Mastey I encountered another problem. I managed to show all possible options for given attribute, but now I need to show only these options which are available to buy. For example if t-shirt size L is out of stock or is disabled, L option should not be shown. How can I solve this issue?
