You can calculate the OOB error from the random forest confusion matrix. What you need to do is just to divide the number of correctly classified observations in the confusion matrix by the number of total observations and substract it from 1. In your case: (401 + 196)/(401 + 38 + 74 + 196) = 0.842; 1 - 0.842 = 0.158, which is the same as 15.8%. You can get this number by using diag() and sum() functions: conf $confusion[,-ncol(dt_rf$ confusion)] oob
