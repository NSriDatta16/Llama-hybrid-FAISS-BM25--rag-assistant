Introductory data trend analysis with R

I am new to the data analysis world and am struggling to find relevant articles / examples related to what I'm trying to do. I have a data set that is like this, for example how many apples are sold at the store each day (where T0 is closing) (stored in a CSV): Day,T0,T-1,T-2,T-3,...,T-10 2015-04-18,500,400,300,200,...,0 2014-04-17,800,700,200,100,...,0 ... So far I have been able to read the file in and plot a simple line graph for a single day. Now I want to do more, Plot all days on a single line graph against each other Trend analysis (e.g., whats the average sale count in the last hour) Prediction work (e.g., based on morning sales, whats expected in the last few hours) I am not looking for specific help with this specific example, but rather examples or case studies online to help guide me to the functionality I need in R.
