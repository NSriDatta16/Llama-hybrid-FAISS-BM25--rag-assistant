Ranking observations based

I have observations categorized into one of 5 categorical variables, and each observation also has a probability of occurrence, as computed through logistic regression. Here's how the distribution of each categorical variable and probabilities look like. $`NA` Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA's NA NA NA NaN NA NA 518695 $`0` Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.4718 0.7192 0.8365 0.8044 0.9089 0.9626 $`1` Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.4718 0.7588 0.8488 0.8253 0.9089 0.9534 $`2` Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.4718 0.8998 0.9344 0.9193 0.9573 0.9847 $`3` Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.4718 0.9279 0.9406 0.9333 0.9658 0.9878 $`4` Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.4718 0.9109 0.9344 0.9207 0.9611 0.9878 Currently, I have assigned each categorical variable a number equal to x*100 , where x is a variable. So, the range is from 0 to 400. Similarly, I have divided probabilities into deciles, and multiplied ( decile -1 )by 10. This leads to overall range from 0 to 490. Is this a good way to categorize observations? Are there any other better ways to rank observations when we have multiple criteria? I'd appreciate any thoughts. I searched on StackExchange and found a lot of questions on this topic, but I couldn't find any answer.
