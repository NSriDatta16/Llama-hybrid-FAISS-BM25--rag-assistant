Best practice is definitely to have a build script that automates the building, testing and deployment process so all you have to do is run a batch file or command to run the whole thing. We do that very successfully here using NAnt to build, test, check code coverage and deploy to test environment and production environment. It saves an incredible amount of time not having to remember what files need copied, where they go and what configuration changes need made once deployed.
