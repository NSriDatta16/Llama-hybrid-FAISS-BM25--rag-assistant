If the test set is obtained by randomly splitting off part of the available data (equivalent to stopping a $k$ -fold CV after the first fold), then cross validation is better. Single tess sets become worth while (with smallish sample sizes) when they test aspects of model validity/possible confounding factors that cross validation cannot test, such as the performance on data obtained later on to include possible seasonal or longer term drift, a test set obtained at other geographic locations, a test set obtained from industrial production lines when the model was set up with lab-prepared calibration samples, and so on. It sometimes also makes sense to use a single test set when for this test set independence can be more easily ensured by organizational measures.
