TLDR: Yes Let us consider a random walk in discrete time: At every timestep $t = n\Delta t$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the process goes one step forward or one step back with equal probability. Leading: $P(\Delta x_i = 1) = 1/2$ $P(\Delta x_i = -1) = 1/2$ (where $i$ denotes the timesteps) The process is at $t = n\Delta t$ is $X_t = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{\Delta x_i}$. Taking the average $\mathbb{E}X_t = \mathbb{E}(\sum_{i=0}^{n}{\Delta x_i}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{\mathbb{E}(\Delta x_i)} = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{(\frac{1}{2}(1)+\frac{1}{2}(-1))} = 0$. This is clearly not dependent on time.
