HTML5 offline storage. File storage? Directories and filesystem API

For storing data offline WebApp can use: session storage, "advanced version of cookies" key/value based Web Storage (AKA local/global/offline/DOM storage) sql-based Web SQL Database (deprecated) and Indexed Database API FileReader and FileWriter API (requires user to select files each time the application loads) But apparently there is no File Storage. Of course, there is a manifest-based caching , but it's just a cache and is not supposed to be used as a user data storage. Does it mean that the user of WebApp is forced to use some sort of a cloud file storage? Is there any way to save large files on user's local machine? Or maybe some way to select a local folder web application can use to store user data? Edit . Security. HTML5 already has the ability to write big portions of data to user's local machine. I don't see any security issues if a browser will provide another, file-based abstraction to store data. It can be some virtual machine, virtual filesystem, whatever. Hm, I think, it is possible to write JS filesystem and store it as a blob in SQL... Similar questions . Update : Hm... recently I've found this and this . Maybe it is what I'm looking for... Yes, it is! See the answer below.
