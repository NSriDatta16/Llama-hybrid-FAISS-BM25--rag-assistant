Whenever I hear timer job, I can't help but think that this should be separated from a Java EE app server. You can use something like Quartz, or an operating system scheduled task, or a batch manager like AutoSys, but embedding it into a servlet seems like a misuse of servlets to me. Java EE 5 containers have a TimerService that's an EJB. Perhaps this will help you sort it out.
