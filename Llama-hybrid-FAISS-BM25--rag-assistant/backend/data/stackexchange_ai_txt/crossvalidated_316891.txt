Interpreting two-way continuous x continuous negative interaction (OLS)

Context: I'm testing a hypothesis for a paper I have to write. I suspect that higher trait authoritarianism (sca) will positively predict greater support for US Supreme Court Justice Roberts (data gathered post affordable care act ruling) on its own, but will increase the negative effects of conspiratorial ideation (CI) in an sca x CI interaction. I tested the interaction in the model below and it was significantly negative. I'm not sure though whether the results suggest that sca buffers/offsets the negative effects of CI or intensifies them. Can someone take a look and explain to me how to interpret it?
