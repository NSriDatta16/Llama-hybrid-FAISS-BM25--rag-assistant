Do you allow users to do this? No, but admins on some sites. (Though none built with MVC or jQuery.) How do you store the heirarchy? In a table, with a parent-field. How do you programmatically display the menu? I iterate throught the table and output HTML. How do you make it easy for users to create heirarchies - some sort of jQuery drag/drop? Make menu-editing page, where you output the menu in the content-area of your page, and then use something like jQuery sortable plugin to move things around, and custom code to delete and insert new items.
