While this could end up being more trouble than it is worth, it is PROBABLY possible to leverage the Java or .NET platform and still run your Django application in Jython or IronPython (with some minor adjustments I'm sure) and also be able to leverage Ruby's HAML gem via jRuby or IronRuby. I'm sure there will be some quirks in getting this to work, but I'm sure it would be possible. Again, this is probably a lot more trouble than it's worth (considering that you'd have to move your application to a completely new platform), but it would be a pretty fun project to work on.
