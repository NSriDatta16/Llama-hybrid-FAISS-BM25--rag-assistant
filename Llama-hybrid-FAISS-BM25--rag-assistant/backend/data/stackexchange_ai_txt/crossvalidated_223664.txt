Confidence interval for the p-value estimate when doing Monte Carlo testing

The second paragraph of the Monte Carlo testing section of the Wikipedia article on resampling statistics, the values of a confidence interval for a p-value from a MC sampling is given: After $N$ random permutations, it is possible to obtain a confidence interval for the p-value based on the Binomial distribution. For example, if after $N = 10000$ random permutations the p-value is estimated to be $\hat{p}=0.05$, then a 99% confidence interval for the true $p$ (the one that would result from trying all possible permutations) is $[0.044, 0.056]$. What's the formula to calculate it?
