Question: Have I written formulas that convey the correct mathematical representation for my three-level model? Is my written interpretation of the coefficients in the equations correct? Unfortunately, no. The model you are fitting: lmer(value ~ A + B + C + (1|ID/stimulus_num), data = data) has the following features: A global intercept (fixed effect) Fixed effects for A, B and C, which vary at the participant level, $i$ , so these will generate 3 fixed effects estimates Random intercepts for ID and the ID:stimulus_num interaction, which means that stimulus_num is nested in ID , so this will generate 2 random intercepts estimates Therefore we expect the model to produce 7 estimates (4 fixed effects, 2 random interecps and 1 unit-level residual). When writing out the mathematics of a specific model it is always good to know how many, and what kind of, estimates are expected It looks like your equations are on the right track, but note that, for level 2 and 3 you only need the first equation - the others would be needed only if you were fitting random slopes. So the level 2 and 3 equations are only random intercepts. Also, your index notation is not quite right because, with the usual convention, the first index should refer to the lowest level, not the highest. Perhaps you were confused because commonly $i$ , $j$ and $k$ refer to levels 1, 2 and 3, whereas you are using $t$ , $k$ and $i$ Also, you have the fixed effects indexed by $ikt$ which, apart from being in the wrong order is incorect because they only vary at the the individual ( $i$ ) level. Thus to write the mutilevel model equations we will adopt standard notation (for instance in the book by Snijders and Bosker), using subscripts ordered from level 1 to level 3. For example $Y_{tki}$ refers to time point $t$ in stimulus $k$ in participant $i$ . Thus, for level 1 we can write: $$ Y_{tki} = \beta_{0ki} + \beta_{1}A_{i} + \beta_{2}B_{i} + \beta_{3}C_{i} + e_{tki} $$ where $\beta_{0ki}$ is the intercept in level-2 unit (stimulus) $k$ within level-3 unit (participant) $i$ . For this we have the level 2 model: $$ \beta_{0ki} = \gamma_{00i} + u_{0ki} $$ where $\gamma_{00i}$ is the average intercept in level-3 unit (participant) $i$ . For this average intercept we have the level-3 model: $$ \gamma_{00i} = \pi_{000} + r_{00i} $$ Putting it all together we have: $$ Y_{tki} = \pi_{000} + r_{00i} + u_{0ki} + \beta_{1}A_{i} + \beta_{2}B_{i} + \beta_{3}C_{i} + e_{tki} $$ and this would result in 7 estimates from the model, as expected - 4 fixed effects: $\pi_{000}$ , $\beta_1$ , $\beta_2$ , and $\beta_3$ ; and 3 random effects: $r_{00i}$ , $u_{0ki}$ , and $e_{tki}$ Regarding interpretation: $\pi_{000}$ is the global intercept: it is the mean of the time series' when the fixed effects, A, B and C are all at zero. $\beta_1$ , represent the expected difference in the time series' for a 1 unit change in A, with the other fixed effects held constant. Sinmilarly for $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ $r_{00i}$ is the random intercept for individuals and the software will estimate a variance for this $u_{0ki}$ is the random intercept for stimulus and the software will estimate a variance for this $e_{tki}$ is the unit-level (time series level) residual and the software will estimate a variance for this.
