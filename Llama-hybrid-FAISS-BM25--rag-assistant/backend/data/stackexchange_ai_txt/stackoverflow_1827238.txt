Create a 3rd column (ColumnC) and put this formula in it: =Text(A2,0) Drag that column down to complete your column. This will format the value as text. Next, use SUMIF as DocMax explained, except with different columns: =SUMIF(C1:C3,"*BB*",B1:B3) The reason you do this is because you need to be reading a Text value, not a Number value when using the *BB* comparison of SUMIF . Great question.
