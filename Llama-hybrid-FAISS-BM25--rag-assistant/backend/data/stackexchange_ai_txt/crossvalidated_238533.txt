Can I trust the result of AIC to test distribution

I'm trying to figure out which distribution is appropriate for my data. I use descdist() which is the package fitdistrplus in r. And here is my question. fit.weibull the data 'dermat' moving average data with window=7 (week) cause, data has 7(=week) seasonality. plot(fit.weibull) fit.weibull$aic 13837.41 I run this code, and got a results above. And then, I test the same data without moving average. fit.weibull plot(fit.weibull) fit.weibull$aic 12695.74 I know that the smallest AIC is the best, However, all of plots in these pictures, I think, the moving average data fits better... but, the AIC says not. Can I trust AIC over here? thanks, this is my first time to upload the question in English which is not my mother language..
