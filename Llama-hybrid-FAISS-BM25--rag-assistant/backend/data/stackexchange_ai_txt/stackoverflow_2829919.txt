urllib and proxies

I need in using Tor+Privoxy with my python-script. proxies = { 'http' : '127.0.0.1:8118', 'ssl' : '127.0.0.1:8118', 'socks' : '127.0.0.1:9050' } The first question: is the ' socks ' name right? Maybe there should be something like ' socks5 '? The next step is that I should pass user-agent string with this proxies to the urllib and save information from loaded site into .html file. I don't know how to pass headers information with proxies.
