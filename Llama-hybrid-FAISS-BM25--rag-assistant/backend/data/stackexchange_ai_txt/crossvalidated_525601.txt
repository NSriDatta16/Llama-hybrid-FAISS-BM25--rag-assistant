I know this is an old topic, but it's happened to me recently and I have found a solution that seems to work. I guess is due the internals of prcomp and eigen as pointed out in a previous comment, but if you want eigen to produce the same eigenvectors as prcomp it seems using the flag symmetric = FALSE does the trick: > d = iris[,1:2] > pca = prcomp(d) > r = eigen(cov(d), symmetric = FALSE) > r $vectors [,1] [,2] [1,] 0.99640834 0.08467831 [2,] -0.08467831 0.99640834 > pca$ rotation PC1 PC2 Sepal.Length 0.99640834 0.08467831 Sepal.Width -0.08467831 0.99640834 > I hope this is useful for someone else.
