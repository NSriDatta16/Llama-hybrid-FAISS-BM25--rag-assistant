if the files need to be text files: This is very problematic with varying line lengths. Your first two lines are 80 characters each, how do you overwrite that with a 100 character line? If the new line should replace the first line , this would result in an file insert, which is a very expensive operation (basically, the entire remainder of the file needs to be read and written). You really don't want to do that for all but minimal amounts of data. If this is for logging purpose, use rollng log files - e.g. one a day (as suggested by lassevek). I made it even simpler: when file size exceeds a limit, the old file is renamed to .bak (old .bak is deleted), and start anew. With an 1MB limit, this preserves e.g. the last 1 MB, while never occupying more than 2 MB. You could employ a similar mechanism with two or more files. Basically, move the "rollover" to files, rather than to lines. if the file may be in a proprietary format: Use a basic DB engine (like SQLite as suggested), or another structured storage mechanism.
