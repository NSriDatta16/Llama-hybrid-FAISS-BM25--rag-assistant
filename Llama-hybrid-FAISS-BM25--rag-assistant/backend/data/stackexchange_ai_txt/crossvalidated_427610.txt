Shouldn't there be a rung four on the the Ladder of Causation?

Referencing this question and its smart answer: I'm still confused and the confusion has been in part fueled by "recent" Pearl/Hernán tweets ( tweet , tweet and tweet ). Pearl's Ladder of causation and my rephrasing of the third W'question. Association - What is? Intervention - What if? Counterfactuals - What would be if? Wouldn't interventions that are (perfect) randomized experiments, where two or more groups are treated, each group emulating counter-to-fact causes, not be squarely placed on rung 3.) - all along the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework!? Isn't the potential outcomes framework and a framework for counterfactual outcomes conceptually identical? Pearl says: Interventions change but do not contradict the observed world, because the world before and after the intervention entails time-distinct variables. I can understand that interventions of the sort "If we take aspirin, will our headaches be cured" are rung 2.); but then they are not experiments, are they? (Perfect) randomized experiments are set up to compare a factual cause to a contrafactual one. What would be if I'd taken aspirin in comparison to not have taken any - or counterfactual: I've taken aspirin and others have been randomized to not to, so what is the difference in headache averages? A part of the rung 2.) / rung 3.) "problem" can perhaps be traced back to different taxonomy. The "Harvard group" defines causal inference as: Causal inference has a central role in public health; the determination that an association is causal indicates the possibility for intervention . (Glass, Goodman, Hernán, & Samet, 2013) So in their eyes (Hernán's trichotomy: description, prediction (probably rung 1. on Pearl's ladder) and counterfactual prediction=(randomized, perfect) intervention=causal inference ( Hernán, Hsu, & Healy, 2019 ) ) they would most probably see interventions on rung 3.) (as "counterfactual interventions" perhaps?). Which brings me to an interesting very recent intervention by Imbens ( Imbens, 2019 ) : I would have liked to have seen a fourth rung of the ladder, dealing with “why,” or reverse causality questions. Wouldn't that then call for a reformulation of the Ladder of causation ? Association - What is? Intervention - What if? Counterfactual prediction/intervention (experimental or observational, if we could perfectly de-confound) - What would be if? Counterfactual explanation - Why?; by this I mean all that the other nice things we can do with counterfactuals (Chapter 8 -> The Book of Why ; attribution, mediation, generalizability, etc., etc.) Cheers
