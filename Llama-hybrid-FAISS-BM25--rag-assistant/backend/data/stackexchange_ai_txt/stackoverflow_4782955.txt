MySQL: Why InnoDB?

Possible Duplicate: MySql: MyISAM vs. Inno DB! Hi, I have a read through about MyISAM and InnoDB on http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-engines.html MyISAM manages nontransactional tables. It provides high-speed storage and retrieval, as well as fulltext searching capabilities. MyISAM is supported in all MySQL configurations, and is the default storage engine unless you have configured MySQL to use a different one by default. while, The InnoDB and BDB storage engines provide transaction-safe tables. To maintain data integrity, InnoDB also supports FOREIGN KEY referential-integrity constraints. But I still don't understand - Why MyISAM or InnoDB. InnoDB seems to be interesting but what kind of websites we should go for InnoDB? What is it actually for? foreign key support - what is foreign key for? I always have all my tables set with MyISAM for my website which have a CMS, Blog, Emailing, Newsletter sign up, searching purposes, etc. Thanks. EDIT: I just read the answers from the other thread, MYISAM doesnt support any database transactions, INNODB will provide transactions MYISAM provides a table level locking, INNODB provides a row level locking But I still don't get it - database transactions - what does it mean? when do we actually use them? a table level locking - what is it? a row level locking - again, what is it? what is it for? I am not asking about the difference between InnoDB and MYISAM - I wonder what kind of websites we should go for InnoDB? transaction websites? then what is a transaction website?? thanks.
