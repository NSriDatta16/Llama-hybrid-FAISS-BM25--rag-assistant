In causal inference, this is the question of conditional treatment effects "Regression" simply describes the procedure of fitting predictions from a set of features to a target value. MLM is no less regression than OLS, so there is no dichotomy. MLM proposes to use dummy variables for group memberships that can be used for group-specific intercepts or in interaction terms with other variables. These variables are predictors as much as any other, and how they should be included in causal inference depends on the directed acyclic graph assumed to describe the data generating process. OLS. Assume a student's effort $X$ causes their test performance $Y$ , but is confounded by the classroom $C$ they are in. One could use $C$ as a control variable such that $Y_i \sim \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 C_i$ . MLM . Alternatively, one could use a MLM approach. Let $Y_{ij}$ be student $i$ in class $j$ . We can then model student performances as $Y_{ij} \sim \beta_{j} X_{ij}$ where $\beta_j$ is the slope for classroom $j$ . In this case, instead of assuming that classroom $C$ confounds a universal causal relationship, the MLM approach models a classroom-specific slope. The underlying causal model is that the classroom variable $C$ interacts with the causal effect of student effort $X$ on performances $Y$ . In causal inference: CATE vs. ATE The idea that a causal effect may be heterogeneous across different groups is well known in the causal inference literature. The primary estimand used to capture this concept is the "conditional average treatment effect" (CATE), which contrasts with the "average treatment effect" (ATE) that is the standard estimand for causal effects. Estimating the CATE is very similar to MLM. The idea is to estimate a causal effect conditional on other features, which can be understood as estimating the slope within subgroups in a linear model. Thus, what MLM is to OLS in statistical inference, CATE is to ATE in causal inference. Note that estimating the CATE poses a lot of additional difficulties compared to estimating the ATE, which complicates its application.
