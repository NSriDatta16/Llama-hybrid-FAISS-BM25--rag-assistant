Problem with jquery-droppable in Chrome

I have a simple application that users jquery-ui's draggable and droppable. In Firefox, it works perfectly. In Chrome, however, I'm having problems. This is the code: $(".cell").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { var originalTarget = event.originalTarget; ... } }); In Chrome the 'event' object is of type 'Object' (using Chrome Dev Kit), and event.originalTarget is 'undefined'. What am I doing wrong?
