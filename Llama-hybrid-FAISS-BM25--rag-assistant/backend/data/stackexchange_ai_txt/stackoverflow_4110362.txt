Org Chart Control/Plug-In for VB.NET WPF multitouch application

I have been working on a UI app (written in VB.NET and using WPF) which creates charts using the Microsoft Chart Control for Windows Forms. The application retrieves data periodically from a remote database, parses and formats the data to create series, and then creates a chart based off the series which is then hosted in a WindowsFormsHost control. So far this process has been working well. I have now been tasked with adding an organizational chart. The requirements state that it should have "drill-down" and touch functionality. I have not been able to find an org control like the chart controls I have been using. The closest one I found was the tree view control that comes with .NET Studio. I have looked at the WPF: Org Chart TreeView Conditional Formatting SO question, and also read the recommended Josh Smith CodeProject articles , but my boss does not want me to pursue developing my own org control at this time. Is there a good third-party solution/plug-in already available? It would need: ...to be capable of being integrated into the WPF as a control (like the Chart Control mentioned above), ...to generate org charts dynamically by connecting to a remote Oracle Database to retrieve the data based on either predefined views or specific select statements (or read a flat file to generate an XML file containing all the relationships and branches), ...to have a hierarchy that was navigable by touch, i.e. touching a node would show the branches beneath that node--touching the node again would hide the branches. Any suggestions/help are greatly appreciated. I haven't been able to find any third-party options that fit all these requirements.
