Optional Prompt in Cognos 8.3

I'm new to Cognos report studio. I have data organized in query items per business date. The Cognos report shows a data filter by business date. For business date there is a separate table join. This is always one column, one row table with current business date. The Cognos report is scheduled to run everyday after data is populated in the data source. This part works just fine. However, I want to have ability to run this same report on demand and when I run this report on demand it should prompt me for a date instead of picking it from the database table. I know how to add a prompt but when I add a prompt, my scheduled reports doesn't work! I can't provide any default as it has to be dynamically picking it from the table. Any pointers would be helpful!
