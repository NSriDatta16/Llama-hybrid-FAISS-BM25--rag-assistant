This will not work as in the code #define ISR(x) #pragma isr=x The "#" in a macro definition is Stringification operator. That is if # is preceded to an argument it will stringify it else # operator will be ignored. So in summary to answer your question you can't do this. If your compiler implements C99 you can use _Pragma instead like this #define ISR(X) _Pragma(isr=x) More reference on _Pragma here
