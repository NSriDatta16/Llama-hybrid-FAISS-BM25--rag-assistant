I think the closest standard NLP task would be relationship extraction . In general it's a quite complex task which involves NER, syntactic analysis and semantic role labeling. Note that there are various works using the term "event extraction" (for example this ), but as far as I know there is no clear definition of the task. It's often related to putting events on a timeline, this would be quite different from your goal but possibly related. A basic approach would be to treat the problem as a sequence labeling task like NER: given some annotated "events" in a training corpus, the model might be able to learn the patterns and detect any new "event" in a text.
