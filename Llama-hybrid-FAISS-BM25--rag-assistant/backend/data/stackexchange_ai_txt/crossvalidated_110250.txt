To complement the answer given by @Marc Claesen. You don't need it for decision trees. To train a decision tree, e.g. by the ID-3 algorithm, you are interested in relative entropies with and without different variables. For categorical variabels, e.g. type=[brown, yellow, red] , the tree branches out for each category, you do not need to index the colours. The distance problem with the SVMs or logistic regression or k-NN, is not a problem for decision trees.
