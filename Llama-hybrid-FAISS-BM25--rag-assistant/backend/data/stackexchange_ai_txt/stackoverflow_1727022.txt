Mini web servers and strange twitter clients seem to be the rage. And, as you know, writing a blogging platform is the new "Hello, World" I like to dive in to precision when I'm picking up a new language, for instance, what do I have to learn about the language in order to handle unicode? How can I handle localization? What does IPC look like ... how do I manage threads? Usually helps me write more serious things faster.
