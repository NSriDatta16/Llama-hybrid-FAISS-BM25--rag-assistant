Is it possible to export/import product categories in Magento?

I saw one other question on how to do a mass import of products, categories, and all that, but all I want to be able to do is import my categories from one store to another. When you export products I see that there is still a category ID attribute that it gives the products, but I don't see any options for exporting product categories. I assume the simplest way would be to just copy over the tables with SQL, but when I export/import through phpMyAdmin it never works.... Any ideas? Thanks, Chris
