First, you need to make a model to predict the crisis. Second, you need to output be a probability of crisis instead of zero and one. There are two kinds of algorithms (dependent on the kind of output it creates): Class output : Algorithms like SVM and KNN create a class output. For instance, in a binary classification problem, the outputs will be either 0 or 1. However, today we have algorithms which can convert these class outputs to probability. But these algorithms are not well accepted by the statistics community. Probability output : Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost etc. give probability outputs. Converting probability outputs to class output is just a matter of creating a threshold probability. So, choose an appropriate algorithm, and then the shape of output can be related to your policy. If you want a realistic, it should be linear so don't transform it. But if you want to be careful then use exponential transform. Another way to be more precise is using the cost of a crisis and investigating in modeling. In this way just use 0,1 to decide to investigate or act as normal. I suggest you use a combinational model.
