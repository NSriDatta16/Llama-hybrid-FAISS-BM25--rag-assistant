Include formula field in cross tab

Hi i have a long formula field which I would like to include as the cross tab report summary field. However after I define the formula field I don't see it in my crosstab screen. How to include it ? Here is my formula field WhilePrintingRecords; numberVar rt; numberVar layMdp; numberVar totMdp; rt=Round(({Command.GENGNPIAMT}/{Command.TOTALGNP})*100,2); layMdp:={Command.GENPREMMDP}; totMdp:=(layMdp)*Truncate((rt/100),4); Also if I place this formula field inside details section, it shows a zero. Why is it not calculating anything ? I like it to calculate values as per each cross-tab column.
