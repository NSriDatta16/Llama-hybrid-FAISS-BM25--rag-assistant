Why does my Visual C++ .exe project build create .lib and .exp files?

I have a solution consisting of 3 projects. One is a static library, and two are console-based .exe files that depend on and link against this library. Their settings seem to be identical. I build one of them: 1>------ Build started: Project: masksample, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------ 1>Compiling... 1>stdafx.cpp 1>Compiling... 1>masksample.cpp 1>Compiling manifest to resources... 1>Linking... 1>LINK : C:\Users\DarekSz\Praca\cci\Debug\masksample.exe not found or not built by the last incremental link; performing full link 1>Embedding manifest... 1>masksample - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) ========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 1 up-to-date, 0 skipped ========== Then I go on to building the other: 1>------ Build started: Project: calibsample, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------ 1>Compiling... 1>stdafx.cpp 1>Compiling... 1>calibsample.cpp 1>Compiling manifest to resources... 1>Linking... 1>LINK : C:\Users\DarekSz\Praca\cci\Debug\calibsample.exe not found or not built by the last incremental link; performing full link 1> Creating library C:\Users\DarekSz\Praca\cci\Debug\calibsample.lib and object C:\Users\DarekSz\Praca\cci\Debug\calibsample.exp 1>Embedding manifest... 1>calibsample - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) ========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 1 up-to-date, 0 skipped ========== Why does the linker create the .lib and .exp files this time? Is there some option to turn this on and off that I activated without knowing about it?
