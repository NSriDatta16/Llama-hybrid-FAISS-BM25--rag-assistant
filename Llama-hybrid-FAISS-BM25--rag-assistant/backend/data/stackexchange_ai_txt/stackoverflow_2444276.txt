I never wrote a lot of tests with the build in testing framework, but jumped right in to use Cucumber with factory girl and RSpec and am VERY happy with it. I find it very easy to describe features I want to work on in Cucumber first. I always had trouble getting myself to write Unit tests first. So from my personal experience, I can encourage you to jump right into the fun stuff!
