Does resizing the image size, reduce the quality of the images in CNN?

I am doing a project for cancer recognition. My data set has hunderds of images but not of equal size. I wanna resize them to the size of the smallest image. But I am wondering do you think using the cv2.resize will effect the quality of images and so the result of my work? If yes what I should do. If no please let me know.
