Do you mean your sub-classed implementation is not called when touchesBegan, touchesMoved and touchesEnded are called? It sounds like a problem with how you've created an instance of the object. More details are required I think. (taken form comments) Header File #import @interface MyWebView : UIWebView { } @end Implementation File #import "MyWebView.h" @implementation MyWebView - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { if (self = [super initWithFrame:frame]) { } return self; } - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect { NSLog(@"MyWebView is loaded"); } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touches began"); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Touches ended"); } - (void)dealloc { [super dealloc]; } @end
