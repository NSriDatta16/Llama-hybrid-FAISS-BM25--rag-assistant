I was a hardcore vim user, but I switched over to Eclipse. There are two vi plugins/keybindings for it. One is free, the other is commercial. I preferred the commercial one: seems to work better for certain things. Eclipse can do a lot of things that gvim can't do (or make them easier). Compiling/debugging/running. Setting up build environment. Javadocs, code completion, etc. Refactoring, source control pluins, code organizing. Project setup, etc. It's easy to share a project with other developers. Lots of FOSS java projects have eclipse files for easy setup. Just to name a few.
