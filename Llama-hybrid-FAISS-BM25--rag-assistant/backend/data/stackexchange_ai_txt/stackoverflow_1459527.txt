If you have a avg or other aggreagate functions you need to say how the other fields are combined. ie over what rows the average is calculated. This is done by the group by command. This says take these fields and do the summary over the rows having the same value in these fields. (Sybase document says 'group by is typically used in conjunction with aggregates to specify how to group the unaggregated columns of a select query.') Thus here we need group by tbrm_Article.ArticleID, tbrm_Article.CountryID, tbrm_Article.CategoryID, tbrm_Article.Title, tbrm_Article.ArticleDetail, tbrm_Article.Source, tbrm_Article.ArticleDateTimeAdded, tbrm_Article.ViewCount, tbrm_Article.CommentCount, tbrm_CountryList.CountryName tbrm_CountryList.CountryImage tbrm_CategoryList.CategoryName tbrm_CategoryList.CategoryImage aspnet_Users.UserName AS UserName
