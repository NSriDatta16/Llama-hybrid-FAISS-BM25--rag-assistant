Sounds like the streams you are interested in could be modelled as inhomogeneous Poisson processes. Not surprising that the time between items is not normal --- I'm guessing it is closer to exponential. You may be interested in this white paper , which discusses a simple stat for detecting a change in rate of this type of data. It might provide a data-based way to select the buckets for each stream. In any case, you might want to look into change-point detection in general (e.g., https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/change-point ) I could envision monitoring each stream for a few days, using the stat in the above paper (or some other change point algorithm) to find where the rate changes occur. Then you can model each stream within that bucket as a Poisson process with the average rate seen over those few days. Since you'd have a model for the data in each bucket, you could then get a probability that a stream is unusually active or tranquil at any particular time.
