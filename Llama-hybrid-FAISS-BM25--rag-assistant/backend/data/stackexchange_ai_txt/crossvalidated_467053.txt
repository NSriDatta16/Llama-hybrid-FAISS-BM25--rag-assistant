Estimating users z-score given avg, min, max for various tests

Given a series of tests, where we are given one users score, the overall minimum, the overall maximum, and the overall average, how would I estimate the user's z-score on total score (ie. sum of all of the users tests scores compared to the average sum of all test taker's test scores)? We cannot assume that the lowest scoring person from one test was the lowest scoring in the next test, but I think it is fair to assume that people generally stay within some score bands (although if this can be done without that assumption, that would be better). We can also assume that the group of test takers is the same from test to test. My intuition tells me that this seems to be some sort of application of Monte Carlo methods, but I can't seem to figure out how to actually do this. Some example data: +-----------+------------+------------+------------+------------+--------+ | test_name | usr_score | high | avg | low | weight | +-----------+------------+------------+------------+------------+--------+ | Test_1 | 0.94615385 | 1 | 0.92307692 | 0.65384615 | 26 | | Test_2 | 0.71621622 | 0.95945946 | 0.79459459 | 0.74074074 | 37 | | Test_3 | 1 | 1 | 0.92222222 | 0.7037037 | 27 | | Test_4 | 0.85135135 | 0.97297297 | 0.85675676 | 0.66756757 | 37 | | Test_5 | 0.83333333 | 1 | 0.76666667 | 0 | 6 | | Test_6 | 1 | 1 | 0.92857143 | 0.66666667 | 21 | +-----------+------------+------------+------------+------------+--------+ Given this data, we know the user's total score is 135.6 (usr_score $*$ weight). Similarly, the average score is 134.1 , the maximum score one test-taker may have is 151.6 , and the minimum score one test-taker may have is 102.1 , although it is unlikely that one person has either the minimum or maximum score as one person probably didn't always score the best/worst. I'd like to calculate the z-score of the 134.1 , but am unsure as to how to do that without the standard deviation.
