System.Nullable was introduced in .Net 2.0 and is available to VB as a generic type . You just cannot use the nullable syntax. So in VS 2005 you can do: Dim x as Nullable(of Integer) I don't know if null equivalence and boxing works for nullables in VB 2005, but I would suspect that the answer is yes since the .Net team made a change to the 2.0 CLR to accomplish boxing with nullables. I would imagine VB leverages this. In 2008, you can obviously just do: Dim x as Integer?
