Extracting Statistics from CausalImpact Summary

Say I have a CausalImpact Summary like this: > summary(impact) Posterior inference {CausalImpact} Average Cumulative Actual 3 65 Prediction (s.d.) 2.7 (0.46) 60.4 (10.21) 95% CI [1.8, 3.6] [40.4, 79.6] Absolute effect (s.d.) 0.21 (0.46) 4.56 (10.21) 95% CI [-0.66, 1.1] [-14.63, 24.6] Relative effect (s.d.) 7.5% (17%) 7.5% (17%) 95% CI [-24%, 41%] [-24%, 41%] Posterior tail-area probability p: 0.32852 Posterior prob. of a causal effect: 67% For more details, type: summary(impact, "report") How would I extract the Actual Average of 3? How would I extract the Posterior tail-area probability p ? I've tried summarizing numbers from the impact$series dataframe, but the average of the actual values after the date of intervention doesn't equal 3, so I'm stumped. Thanks!
