Based on my totally unscientific analysis of the four methods here, it looks like there's not a lot of speed difference among them. I ran each on a page containing a series of unordered lists of varying length and timed them using the Firebug profiler. $("li").slice(1).addClass("something"); Average Time: 5.322ms $("li:gt(0)").addClass("something"); Average Time: 5.590ms $("li:not(:first-child)").addClass("something"); Average Time: 6.084ms $("ul li+li").addClass("something"); Average Time: 7.831ms
