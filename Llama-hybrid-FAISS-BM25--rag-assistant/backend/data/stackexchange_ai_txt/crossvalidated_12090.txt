Inner correlation of occurrences (burstiness?) in R

I want to measure the inner correlation of the occurrences of events i.e. I want to distinguish between the two (drawn) and say "in the second sample events occur more conglomerate compared to the first": Isn't this different from burstiness (i.e. easier to compute as it doesn't invole traffic-values)? I have drawn a possible representation of the expected result (for S2) in the image below the samples (just as it is in my mind now), but don't hesitate to suggest different proposals. I looked out and tried different build-in functions and googled/ searched CrossValidated for R and burstiness or "inner correlation", but I didn't make progress. Maybe I am looking for the wrong search terms. If I wanted to really measure burstiness, it seemed to me (by reading papers about burstiness) that there would be no common known measure (but many different one). I we would pick one it would be cool to justify why choosing this specific one. This is how the time series is represented in R, currently: (written by dput in file) c(3.256861, 3.377142, 3.941173, 4.304236, 4.485358, 4.606512, 4.707296, 5.473004, 5.714746, 5.815394, 5.835405, 5.936067, 5.957008, 6.964611, 7.045158, 7.065171, 7.165824, 7.669618, 8.17324, 8.273692, 9.503988, 9.604991, 9.624853, 9.725522, 10.237766, 10.954529, 11.378399, 12.687714, 13.291919, 13.41258, 13.67527, 14.380529, 14.743638, 15.247138, 15.851832, 15.952875, 15.972497, 16.456259, 16.476052, 17.201506, 17.463708, 18.068535, 18.309645, 18.390292, 18.410299, 18.430323, 18.531736, 18.652921, 18.793662, 19.297076, 19.639692, 19.760698, 20.768096, 20.868441, 20.990499, 21.494412, 21.856368, 22.199341, 22.219143, 22.440472, 22.481118, 23.327013, 23.447678, 23.811188, 23.843, 24.113302)
