Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory will give you a File corresponding to the SDCARD. Then you'll just have to use File methods. That should be something like that : File sdCardRoot = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File yourDir = new File(sdCardRoot, "yourpath"); for (File f : yourDir.listFiles()) { if (f.isFile()) String name = f.getName(); // make something with the name } A little note of advice : from KitKat and above, this requires the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.
