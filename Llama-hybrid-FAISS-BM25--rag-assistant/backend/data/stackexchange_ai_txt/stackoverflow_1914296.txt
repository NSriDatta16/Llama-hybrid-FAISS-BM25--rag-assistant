How to debug windows service which fails in Init() method

I have a windows service which fails in Init() method and throws some exception , so only way for me to check what the error is by looking at the event log. I want to debug the windows service, but the problem is that i can attach debugger only when service is rnning, in my case it fails in Init() method only. Any idea ?
