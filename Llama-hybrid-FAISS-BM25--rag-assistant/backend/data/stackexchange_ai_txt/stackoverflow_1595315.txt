Most people would not bother making a bubble sort elegant. In general , though, I find that doing this: for (int i = 0; i is both more elegant and more maintainable than doing this: Item item; int i; for (i = 0; i In other words, declare your variables within the smallest applicable scope . Otherwise you might find yourself doing something with i or item at some other point in the code and then using them again where you shouldn't be.
