Is it safe to call BeginSaveChanges(null, null) to perform a Fire and Forget Async DataContext call?

I noticed when performing many database transactions using BeginSaveChanges(null, null) the last query is sometimes unsuccessful. Is it because the instance of my DataContext died too quickly for the query to be performed? When I changed my code to use the normal SaveChanges all the queries are successful. Specifically, I'm performing queries against the Azure Table Storage using a TableServiceContext. Edit - If the Disposing of my DataContex is the real problem. What alternatives do I have? Should I wrap making an instance of my datacontext and executing my query in a Task?
