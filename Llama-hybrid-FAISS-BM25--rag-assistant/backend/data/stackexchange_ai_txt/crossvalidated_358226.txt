ordered logistic regression marginal probabilities hit ceiling

I'm running an ordered logistic regression with 3 classes, and I am able to predict the probability of each observation belonging to each class. For some reason one class' probabilities (top40) never rise above a certain threshold. I am using the polr method from the R package MASS. I also have balanced the data set for each class. Does anyone know what this says about my data? Is it useful to balance one's data set? Edit: I have modified my data set so that it is no longer a balanced subsample. The plot has also been updated, and the ceiling behaviour is still present in the class top40.
