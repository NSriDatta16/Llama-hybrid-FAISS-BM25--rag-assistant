Special characters not displaying, sifr r436

I followed the explanation on the sIFR wiki, but can't seem to get accented characters to display in my Flash movie. I opened up the Character Embedding palette, pasted "ÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõöøùúûüýþÿ" into the "Include these characters" field after the ampersand, hit "OK", then re-exported the .SWF. The characters still don't render in my sIFR file--any suggestions? I'm running r436.
