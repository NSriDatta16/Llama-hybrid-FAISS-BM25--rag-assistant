For time series clustering you have basically two different approaches: Use of opportune metrics . Basically you compare with some kind of metrics each time series, and you cluster them. A low metric value means two time series are "close". See this for example: Dinamic Time Warping (high computation weight). Use of features extraction . A second approach might be to extract some features from each time series, and use that as a vector of information, and feed it to a cluster algorithm. More precisely: First you start with k time series, each with length n. For each TS, you extract m features (mean, variance, number of "jumps" over a threshold, and whatever feature you might find appropriate) You form a feature matrix of dimension k x m, M (basically you've preformed dimensionality reduction on the k TS) Now you can use any of the clustering methods (k-means, hierarchical clustering, SOM, ecc...) on this matrix M. Here a couple of example on this approach (a LOT less computationally expensive): Example 1 Example 2
