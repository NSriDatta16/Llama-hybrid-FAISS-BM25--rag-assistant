Advise resources on un-supervised learning

I have seen that people coming into data science will rush into scikit-learn or other libraries without trying to learn the knowledge behind. Its good to follow a top-down approach but most of times people don't go into depth, even if they do its in supervised-learning area. That't why I think un-supervised is neglected (or is it heavy influence of statistical inference). I would like to learn the un-supervised learning in-depth I tried some books so far ( Sugiyama, Masashi - Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning-Morgan Kaufmann (2016) book ) was better among others to build intuition around concepts. If anyone have gone through same path and know other good reads or video tutorials kindly share in this thread.
