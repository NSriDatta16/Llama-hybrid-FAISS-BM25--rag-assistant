How can I filter the events using Throttle

I'm trying reactive-framework in a win-form. IObservable > mouseMoves = Observable.FromEvent (this, "MouseMove"); IObservable > mouseDowns = Observable.FromEvent (this, "MouseDown"); IObservable > mouseUps = Observable.FromEvent (this, "MouseUp"); var pointChanges = mouseMoves.Zip(mouseMoves.Skip(1), (prev, post) => new { Prev = prev, Post = post }); var mouseDrags = from d in mouseDowns from p in pointChanges.TakeUntil(mouseUps) select p; I want to filter the mouseDrags, only those MouseUps more than 1 second after MouseDowns are needed. How?
