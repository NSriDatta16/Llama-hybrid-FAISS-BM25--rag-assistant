I might consider Contemporary Bayesian Econometrics and Statistics by John Geweke. It is relatively brief. The first three chapters cover the sort of foundational stuff you find in any Bayesian analysis book. The next chapter is the linear model with a tad of non-linear regression, followed by latent variables and missing data, then time-series and closed with model comparison and evaluation. There's not very much on panel data or semi/nonparametric estimation.
