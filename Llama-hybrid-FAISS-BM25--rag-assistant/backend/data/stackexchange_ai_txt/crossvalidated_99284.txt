Expected value of q given y is weighted average of mean q and and y

It is assumed that: 1) $y=q+u$ Where $q$ is productivity and $y$ a testscore that measures true productivity. $u$ is a normally distributed error term, independent of $q$, with zero mean and constant variance; $q$ is also assumed to be normally distributed with a mean equal to $\alpha$ and with a constant variance. The outcome of this is: 2) $E(q | y) = (1-\gamma)\alpha + \gamma y$ where $\gamma=Var(q)/(Var(q)+Var(u))$ How do you get equation 2? The equation can be expressed as a group effect and a individual effect. [This is a model of statistical discrimination, see: Dennis J. Aigner and Glen G. Cain.
