@Keith: We are leveraging CC.NET to both run a CI build, as well as being able to use the Force Build feature to do a Build + Deploy. That is why we want hands off the dashboard. I found this morning that I was able to place CCNET in a virtual directory within another web app, This allowed me to setup Forms Authentication, and let the root app manage that. Problem solved.
