Unicode characters in regular expressions is a tricky business . Here is a paragraph from the documentation of Pattern : Unicode support This class follows Unicode Technical Report #18: Unicode Regular Expression Guidelines, implementing its second level of support though with a slightly different concrete syntax. Unicode escape sequences such as \u2014 in Java source code are processed as described in ?3.3 of the Java Language Specification. Such escape sequences are also implemented directly by the regular-expression parser so that Unicode escapes can be used in expressions that are read from files or from the keyboard. Thus the strings "\u2014" and "\\u2014" , while not equal, compile into the same pattern , which matches the character with hexadecimal value 0x2014. Thus, since we know: ベ = \u3049 ス = \u30B9 パ = \u30D1 the proper way to write the pattern you're after is: String regex = "(?:\\P{L}|\\W|^)(\\u30d9\\u30B9\\u30D1)(?:\\b|$)"; Further reading : Unicode Technical Report #18: Unicode Regular Expression Guidelines Unicode Regular Expressions
