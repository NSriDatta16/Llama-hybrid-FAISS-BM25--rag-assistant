Replacing the Grid is usually not fun... You could try: Telerik DevExpress Infragistics SyncFusion ComponentArt ObjectListView ( nuget ) But first - evaluate your needs, see why the GridView is not giving you the desired results & then do a through technical analysis on these commercial products before making any changes to your code. Also as a side-note: don't directly use the vendor code & namespaces into your code, perhaps DI would be a better mechanism to abstract via a IGridView interface... HTH.
