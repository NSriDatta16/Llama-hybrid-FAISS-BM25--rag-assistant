As your solution was edited, you simply need to add cufft.lib to your additional dependencies. Since you're compiling with Visual studio, you might prefer to use the pragma: #pragma comment ( lib, "cufft.lib" ) You can then control this with other things like #if USE_CUDA_FFT && (defined(WIN32) || defined(WIN64)) #pragma comment ( lib, "cufft.lib" ) #endif I use similar switches like this to support compiling conditionally in Linux (with gcc) as well as in Windows (VS '05 / '08 / '10) using the same source files.
