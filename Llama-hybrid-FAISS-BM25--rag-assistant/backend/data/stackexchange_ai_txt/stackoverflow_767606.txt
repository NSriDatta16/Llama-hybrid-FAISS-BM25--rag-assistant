I think the solution depends on database you are using. For example, we are using MS SQL and using next query select COUNT(Table.Column) OVER() as TotalRowsCount, Table.Column, Table.Column2 from Table ... That part of query can be changed with database specified SQL. Also we set the query max result we are expecting to see, e.g. query.setMaxResults(pageNumber * itemsPerPage) And gets the ScrollableResults instance as result of query execution: ScrollableResults result = null; try { result = query.scroll(); int totalRowsNumber = result.getInteger(0); int from = // calculate the index of row to get for the expected page if any /* * Reading data form page and using Transformers.ALIAS_TO_ENTITY_MAP * to make life easier. */ } finally { if (result != null) result.close() }
