Do I need separate rows for each patient for different covariates in a regression model?

patient outcome_var covar1 covar2 covar3 1 y 1 0 0 1 y 0 0 1 1 y 1 0 0 2 n 1 0 0 2 n 0 1 0 2 n 0 0 0 Do I need to use the table above as such in a logistic regression or for each patient bring a single observation for each covariate for example, make the above table look like this patient outcome_var covar1 covar2 covar3 1 y 1 0 1 2 n 1 1 0 i.e, to just bring a single observation for each covariate and get a single for each patient with a single 1/0 value for each covariate to use in a logistic regression model. Thanks
