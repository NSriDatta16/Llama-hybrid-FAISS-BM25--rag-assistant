To answer a non-pointed question, my answer would be "probably NUnit just stays out of your face." Disclaimer : I've no actual experience with MS version of xUnit, however I hear problems like 'You need to install the gigantic idea just to run your tests on a separate machine' - which is a complete No-No. Other than that MS has this way of contorting the right path for a newbie via some kind of IDE bell/whistle that runs counter to the whole idea. Like generating tests from classes was one I remember from a year or so back.. that defeats the whole point of test-driving - your design is supposed to emerge from tiny steps of RGR: writing a test-make it pass-refactor. If you use that tool - it robs you of the entire experience. I'll stop with my sermon.. now :)
