Margin of error

From where comes the values https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error 1.29 0.98 0.82 related to the margins of error for CIs : 99%, 95%, 90%? These are found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error#Calculations_assuming_random_sampling at paragraph "Different confidence levels"? According to the formula, the standard error should be the sample standard deviation divided by the root of the sample size. It seems that these values represent a fixed standard deviation, but is there a general form when we do not know the standard deviation and thus estimate it from the sample? I conducted a simulation study. Results of an artificial survey of voter preference for 2 candidates was generated. I get about 3% margin of error. My confidence level was set at 95% and the sample size was 1,000 participants. The preference for candidate B was set between 45-55%. However, when the preference favors candidate B at 90%, the margin of error is much lower, maybe 2%. Intuitively, it makes sense as there is less variability in the sample proportion. I do not know how the numbers 1.29, 0.98, and 0.82 apply to margins of error and how to use them for continuous or binary outcomes.
