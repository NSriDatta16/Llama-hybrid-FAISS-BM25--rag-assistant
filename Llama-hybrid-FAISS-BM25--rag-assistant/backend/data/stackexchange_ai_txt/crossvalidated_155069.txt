hmm variable number states

I have looked around for a while but cant seem to find any literature on this but can't seem to find a treatment. I have a set A of observations at time $t_n$ $A = \{A_1... A_n\}$ Further I know that these observations have a bayesian probability (that I will treat as emission probabilities) given unknown hidden states defined at each of these times $S = \{S_1...S_n \}$ The trouble (potentially) is that there are a different number of potential hidden states at each time period, and consequently there are $n$ different transition matrices. I think viterbi breaks down here, as there might be a strong solution up to $t_{n-1}$ that becomes non optimal as there is only a transition permitted to a highly prohibited final hidden state. Is there a nice way to solve this problem other than an exhaustive search?
