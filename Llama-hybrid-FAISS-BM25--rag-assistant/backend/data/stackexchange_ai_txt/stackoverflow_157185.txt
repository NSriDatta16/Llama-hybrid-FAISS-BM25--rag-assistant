If you're using .NET 3.0 or later I would encourage you to consider implementing your service using WCF. The learning curve is steeper, but you'll benefit from the flexibility and features that WCF offers . With WCF you can make your service compatible with ASMX services (regular .NET web services) so other applications and other languages can consume the service as though it was a regular .NET web service. There are lots of resources to help you get started. Try MSDN , Learning WCF and Programming WCF Services .
