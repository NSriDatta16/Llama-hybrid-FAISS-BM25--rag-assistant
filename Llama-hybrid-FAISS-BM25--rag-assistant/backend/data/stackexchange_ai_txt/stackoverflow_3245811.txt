Writing EXIF metadata to images in Android

I want to store some metadata in images. My camera application gives me a bitmap, which I store in the storage (MediaStore) device. In addition to this, I want to add a few tags to the picture in its metadata. I think EXIF is a good way of doing this. But I couldn't find good references on how to do this. If there are some tools to achieve this task in Android programming, please let me know. Thanks
