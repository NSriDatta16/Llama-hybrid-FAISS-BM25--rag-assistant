How to Zoom In/Out Photo on double Tap in the iPhone WWDC 2010 - 104 PhotoScroller

I am going through the Sample code of iPhone WWDC 2010 - 104 PhotoScroller App. It's working great with my project related images (PDF Page Images) but I am struggling detect touches in the PhotoScroller App. The Zooming using multiple touches is handled by the ScrollVoiew. Now I want to Zoom In/out the photo on double Tap. The Touchesbegan method is being called in TilingView Class. Then I used [super touchesbegan: withevent:] and now the touches are in the ImageScrollView Class. How to get these touch events in PhotoViewController. How to achieve the zoom in and zoom out on touch ? Can anyone help in this Regard ?
