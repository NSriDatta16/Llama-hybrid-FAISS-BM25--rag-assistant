Creating a Pooled Data Set From Multiple Imputation Output in SPSS

I have SPSS 26. I have 3 datasets of survey responses, each representing different years' responses. As usual with survey data, there was a lot of missing data that I had to deal with before doing any analysis on. I used the built-in Multiple Imputation script and made 10 imputed datasets for each year that I've been able to perform all of my regression analysis just fine on, since the GLM process runs on all the individual imputed sets as well as a pooled set that contains the imputed sets. I essentially ran the same GLM model on the three different years to see if the selected independent variables consistently affect my dependent variable in the same manner over the three years selected. However, I now want to analyze the changes in my dependent variable BETWEEN the years. To do that, I need to generate a single dataset that contains the pooled imputed survey data for each year. Is there any way to access and export the pooled dataset SPSS creates and uses when analyzing imputed data? If not, is there any way to create a dataset that pools the different imputed responses? Relatedly, does anyone know what method SPSS uses to pool the datasets? (i.e. if they just take the averages of the values assigned to each case, I could write a script that does that, but I'm unsure if this is what's going on in the background)
