Besides those already mentioned here, I also found the following necessary: Announcer - very flexible notification scheme AutocompleteUsers - handy while typing (existent) user name AutoLinks - automatically make words not conforming to wiki naming rule but matches existent page name a link CustomFieldAdmin - make manage custom fields easier Redirect - handy if you constantly need to make short-hand name wiki pages (like HTML redirects to HyperText .....) TicketDelete - make deleting, if at all needed, easier WikiRename - must-have for wiki refactoring Below are good-to-have: S5 - directly render wiki pages as slideshow in S5 format, could be really useful for using Trac as the source for presentation FullBlog - add blogging support to Trac Vote - cool add-on feature for big team TracWikiToPdf - transform wiki page to pdf dynamically (however the effect might be all that satisfying) TimingAndEstimation - neat for tracking time and/or estimation
