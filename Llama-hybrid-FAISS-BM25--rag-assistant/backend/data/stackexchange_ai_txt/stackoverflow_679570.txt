Automatic selection of -text rendered in browser

who would know of a possibility to automatically select Paragaph text as it gets rendered in a browser, preferably using JavaScript? In my case I have an amount of text in tags and would like the page to appear with the text fully selected, just as if someone had done it manually with the mouse. Many thanks for your suggestions!
