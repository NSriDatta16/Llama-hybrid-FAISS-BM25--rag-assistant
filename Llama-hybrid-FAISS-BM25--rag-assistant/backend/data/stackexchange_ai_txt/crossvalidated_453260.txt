The logarithm is a non-linear function, and only linear transformations, that is ones that can be written $f(x) = ax + b$ , will preserve the mean. As you observed for log the large values aren't as far above the middle as the lower values are below it. Speaking roughly, this is what is meant by log being a concave function . Like all concave functions, the average of the logs will always be lower than the log of the average. The log function is monotonic however (only every increasing), which means that while the mean is not preserved, the median will be preserved. This means you have to simple options; Transform the data first, then normalise it to be centred on zero. This directly answers your question of how to get the mean of the logs to be zero. You don't explain why you want this property, so I can't comment if this is a good idea.It is worth noting that demeaning logged data is equivalent to dividing all the original data by a constant, rather than shifting the original data. This may or may not be sensible. Work with the median of the data instead of the mean, then you set the median to 1 before the transform and it will be zero after the transform. A more sophisticated approach would be to not transform your data but simply model the log of the mean $$\log_2(E[Y|X]) = \beta X$$ This would be a Generalized Linear Model and can be found in most statistical packages. This is usually better than transforming the data, but a little more involved to use. Centering Log Transformed Data One of the suggestions I make above, is simply take logs, then centre the data. It is worth noting that is equivalent to diving the original data by the geometric mean. $$\log(X_i) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_k{\log(X_k)} = \log(X_i)-\log\left(\prod_k{X_k^{1/N}}\right)$$ $$=\log\left(\frac{X_i}{\prod_k{X_k^{1/N}}}\right)$$ Thinking about whether this concept seems sane and meaningful migth guide whether or not this is a sensible transformation to make.
