I'm not a master in this, and everything I'll say here is based on my understanding of Tabularize. Tabularize always splits things in fields, described by the regex. For example: abc,d,e a,b,cde :Tab /, Causes it to divide each line like the following: |abc|,|d|,|e| |a|,|b|,|cde| Then each field is padded with spaces so the delimiter field align â€” and everything receives and extra-space by default (except for the last field, I think). |abc |, |d |, |e | |a |, |b |, |cde| Resulting in: abc , d , e a , b , cde By adding flags, you can control alignment and padding for each field. If you provide less flags than needed, they are reused. So, to make everything align the same way, say left with padding 0 you can use a single flag that will be repeated for every field. So: abc,d,e a,b,cde Tab /,/l0 The conclusion I have I my mind is that there isn't much sense in having a zero width field (like :Tab /,\zs ), probably causing it to get the first character after the pattern and messing up, cutting it. Now, for me :Tab /[^,]\+, didn't worked properly, generating doubled spaces: john, betty, wally, beth walter, george, thomas, john herbert, bob, petty, mick` ^^ ^^ I think that's because there is no intermediate field. This pattern, makes a field delimiter reside side by side with another one, like this: |john,||betty,||wally,||beth| Then the zero with field generated (between delimiters) is also padded with the extra 1 space by default. |john, | |betty, | |wally, ||beth| How to solve it? I'd open space for a delimiter, that doesn't cause a delimiter to be near others. How? Simply adding a space after the comma. john,betty,wally,beth walter,george,thomas,john herbert,bob,petty,mick` :%s/,/, /g john, betty, wally, beth walter, george, thomas, john herbert, bob, petty, mick` Now you can align everything on spaces and zero padding: john, betty, wally, beth walter, george, thomas, john herbert, bob, petty, mick` :Tab / /l0 john, betty, wally, beth walter, george, thomas, john herbert, bob, petty, mick` I hope that helps understanding Tabularize!
