If you have the cursor over the variable in question, you can press * and it will search for the next occurrence or # will search for the previous one. This is equivalent to typing: /\ ( \ matches on the start of a word and \> matches on the end of word). The only difference (for reasons I'm not sure of) is that * and # don't pay attention to the 'smartcase' option. See: :help * :help /\
