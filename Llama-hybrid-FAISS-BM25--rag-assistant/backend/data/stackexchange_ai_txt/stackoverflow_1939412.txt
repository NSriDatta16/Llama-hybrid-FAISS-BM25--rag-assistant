There is an interesting information in the second comment of this blog-post : Upload Progress Meter - Common issues and some answers : (quoting) : The main difference is: this extension uses the filesystem as temporary storage, APC uses shared memory . And if you'd like to use another Bytecodecache than APC or do not want to install APC for any reason, this one provides that functionality, too. (Both the blog-post and that comment are from Christian Stocker, one of the two authors of the pecl::uploadprogress extension ; so I guess he knows what he's talking about ^^ )
