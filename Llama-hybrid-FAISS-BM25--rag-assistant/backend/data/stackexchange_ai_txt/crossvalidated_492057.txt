There is no need to output embeddings nor one-hot vectors. After all, a tokenizer should work with any words, not only those you have in a vocabulary for the one-hot encoding. Tokenization is usually formualate as a sequence-labeling problem. The input is a character sequence and you label you label each character by assigning one of following classes: Token boundary with space before ( T ); Token boundary with a space before ( B ); No boundary ( N ). An example of an input-output pair can be the following: The cat sleeps on a mat. BNNNTNNNTNNNNNNTNNTNTNNB
