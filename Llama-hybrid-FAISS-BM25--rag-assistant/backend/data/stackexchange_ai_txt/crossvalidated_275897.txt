I think your professor is more correct. Typically, multiple items (variables, whatever) are measured on each member of a population. If we only measure height then you might make an argument that the population is one of heights. But these have no meaning without the individual people. There are some rough edges when it comes to population. Some are as follows. We often refer to "the population of X on April 1, 2017." Of course, some people died and some were born that very day, as on every day. We have to say what to do with them. Some people can't be measured, eg, those in hospitals, nursing homes, or prisons and jails. Some people are incompetent to be interviewed, eg, with dementia. Others do not speak the languages that are interviewed in. The most common survey languages are English and Spanish. People who only speak Navajo are not included. People who have no fixed address are often excluded, even if they are rich people who reside permanently in a hotel. What is the height of someone who has had both legs amputated? You have to decide whether or not to include them and how to measure them. Any measurement you make is probably an estimate of their biological height. "The population of the US in 1920" is even more unclear because of the time interval. Our full definition of population must take these into account. The notion of a well-defined population is not easily definable. We just live with it. Population is a term we like to throw off. It deserves more respect and attention. While I think your professor is more right than you, I think there are many more important issues.
