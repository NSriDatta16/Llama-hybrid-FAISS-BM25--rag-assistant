Consider using a regression model with a test of slope parameter instead While a T-test should serve adequately for testing for a mean difference between two groups, I would counsel against the method you are using here. In particular, there is a substantial loss of information caused by converting the inflation rate into a simple up/down binary. A secondary problem with this method is that your up/down conversion is taken relative to the previous 12-month average, which then induces a dependency in this binary variable on the previous inflation rates. The resulting comparison does not appear to me to capture your initial research hypothesis of interest. If you want to know how the monthly total return of US Treasury bond index depends on the magnitude of the US inflation readings, I recommend modelling these variables directly against each other without categorising them. This analysis can be done with a regression model and estimation of the relationship can be done using a standard test on the slope of the regression line. Your question does not specify which particular measures you have downloaded as your data, so I will show an example of the analysis using some data I have chosen instead. In the example below I have measured CPI with the CPALTT01USM661S (Consumer Price Index: All Items: Total for United States, Index 2015=100, Monthly, Seasonally Adjusted) and I have measured treasury yield with DGS10 (Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis, Percent, Monthly, Not Seasonally Adjusted), with both variables available on a monthly basis from the start of 1962 up to late 2023 (741 months available). I have converted the measurements to "force of interest" using logarithmic changes and used a simple linear regression model to relate these variables. #Load the data DATA $BondRate BondYield/100) DATA $Inflation Inflation[2:n] $Inflation, 100*DATA$ BondRate, xlab = 'Inflation Rate (%)', ylab = '3-Month T-Bill Rate (%)') abline(a = 100*MODEL $coefficients[1], b = MODEL$ coefficients[2], lty = 3) We can test whether there is a relationship between the variables by looking at the estimated slope coefficient in the model. In the summary below we see that there is strong evidence of a non-zero slope coefficient, which means that there is strong evidence of a relationship between the variables. #Show model summary summary(MODEL) Call: lm(formula = BondRate ~ Inflation, data = DATA) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.062104 -0.016747 -0.000591 0.013270 0.086906 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
