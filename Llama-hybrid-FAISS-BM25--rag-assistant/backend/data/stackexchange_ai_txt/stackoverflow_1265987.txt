After a bit of research I managed to find the solution to the problem. A big shout out to Jesse Liberty for this post Basically the toolkit style control templates do not contain the necessary visual state groups for the SL 3.0 validation to work. To fix this I copied the required visual state groups and required template markup from the standard control templates to the toolkit control templates. ie below are the visual state group for the checkbox control. Visible Visible True Below is the style for the ValidationErrorElement for a checkbox. true You also need to place the control template for Validation tool tip in either a control or application reasource. ie I hope this helps someone out there. Cheers Adam
