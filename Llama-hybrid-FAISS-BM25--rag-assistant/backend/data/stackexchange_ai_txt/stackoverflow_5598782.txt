Building shared library with Eclipse CDT directly

I would like to move the building of my C++ project completely to Eclipse CDT, however I am facing some configuration problems. Here is my old g++ compiler call: g++ -I/home/lib/tinyxml -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include -L/usr/local/lib -L/home/konrad/tinyxml -lboost_system -lboost_thread -lboost_regex -fPIC -shared -o libagent.so agent.cpp AgentSocket.cpp ThreadInfo.cpp /home/lib/tinyxml/tinyxml.cpp /home/lib/tinyxml/tinyxmlerror.cpp /home/lib/tinyxml/tinyxmlparser.cpp /home/lib/tinyxml/tinystr.cpp When creating the project I choose Shared Library > Emtpy Project Here are my problems: The Eclipse CDT generates the makefile in a way, it first compiles every .cpp file and then recompile it to the shared library. This let's me face one or more issues. I would like to jump this step and run it in the same way I did in the console. I cannot configure -L and -l options into the C++ building configuration, as Eclipse CDT offers these option only for the C++ linking part, but not for the C++ compiler part, but I need them already there, as the project doesn't compile without errors.
