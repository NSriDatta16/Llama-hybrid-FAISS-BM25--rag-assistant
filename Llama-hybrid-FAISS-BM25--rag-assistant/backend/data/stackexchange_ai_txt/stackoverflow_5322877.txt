Be attention, what you currently call modules actually are namespaces . The reason why controller_name returns only the class name (and not the fully qualified name) is because Rails explicitly strips the namespaces. You can get them by calling the Ruby #name method on the controller class. class SoapTest::DashboardController "dashboard_controller" puts self.class.name # => "SoapTest::DashboardController" end end There are several String inflection methods you can call on the #name to get the formatted version. However, I strongly encourage you to use a namespaced main controller. Instead of using class SoapTest::DashboardController you can extend a SoapTest::ApplicationController class SoapTest::ApplicationController
