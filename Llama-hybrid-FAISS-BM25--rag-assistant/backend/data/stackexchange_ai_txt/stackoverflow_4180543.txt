Greetings. As i previously recommended in comments to your question. I strongly recommend you to set up local installations of other open source database driven forums in your machine, in order for you to have a strong idea and base of what other developers did when they develop such forum applications, not just looking at the database tables but also to the code, organization and design of the forum. I think it proof it self very useful to open your eyes to possibilities for your own forum application A few examples of database driven forums: phpBB Simple Machines Forum XMB Forum I usually say the best way to learn is trial and error but let me also point out. Even this forum application your creating, its just for small and private use for your websites. You should consider that your forum application one day may become popular and you might desire to turn it public like these previous ones mentioned, or you just want to add some new features. In this case i suggest you plan your Code and Database Architecture very well, planning ahead for future upgrades. Also you should take MikeAinOz advice very seriously in his answer and start by Conceptual ER Diagram of your base entities, forums, threads, replies,members, keywords, categories etc. and express the relationships first.Then get into logical design mode and define the tables needed to implement the functionality Thats the best answer to this kind of question i ever seen. Regards & Good Luck.
