List of UserAgent String Values

I am trying to determine what kind of interface to show to a user. If a user is visiting my site with a touch screen phone, I want to show them one interface, otherwise, I want to show them another. Does anyone know of a list of UserAgent string values so I can do this check? I know I can check for the iPhone using the following code in ASP.NET: Request.UserAgent.IndexOf("iPhone", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) However, I would really like to find a list for other similar phones like Palm Pre Blackberry Thunder etc.
