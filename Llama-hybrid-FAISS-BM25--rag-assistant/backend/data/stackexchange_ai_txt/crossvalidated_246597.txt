In image processing, computer vision and related fields, an image moment is a certain particular weighted average (moment) of the image pixels' intensities, or a function of such moments, usually chosen to have some attractive property or interpretation. Local and global characteristics. Example, suppose we want to smooth a noisy image. We could smooth the entire image based upon the noise or some other characteristic of the whole image, i.e., globally, or we could smooth the image based upon the noise and/or rate of change of events in sub-regions of that image, multiple local processing of the image. An example of local, or region by region, image proccessing is the Pixon method . Energy of image. This only appears in the context of entropy for image processing; it is the information content approach to understanding images. Answered elsewhere . Color temperature has more to do with the black body temperature illumination of an image than intrinsic color, see link .
