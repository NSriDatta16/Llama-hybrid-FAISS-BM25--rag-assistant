How to work with join data in codeigniter?

I am having a play around with codeigniter and trying to get my head around the active record system and such like. I have set up a couple of tables and am attempting to run a join on them, as such: function GetOrganisationsAndBuildingDetails() { $this->db->select('organisations.organisation_name, organisations.organisation_id, buildings.building_name, buildings.address1'); $this->db->from('organisations')->join('buildings', 'buildings.organisation_id = organisations.organisation_id'); $query = $this->db->get(); return $query->result(); } In my database i have one organisation with two related buildings. The above query returns two objects (one for each building) - however, the organisation is duplicated. stdClass Object ( [organisation_name] => This is an example org [organisation_id] => 1 [building_name] => test building [address1] => 123456 ) stdClass Object ( [organisation_name] => This is an example org [organisation_id] => 1 [building_name] => teeeest building [address1] => 123456 ) I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of one return object with a series of nested objects for related buildings. Is this possible? If not, is their a recommend way of arranging the return data so I can easily loop through it in the view? (foreach org, foreach building etc etc). Apologies if I'm being a little dense here. Im coming from .net and (linq to SQL in particular) where this stuff is a little different)
