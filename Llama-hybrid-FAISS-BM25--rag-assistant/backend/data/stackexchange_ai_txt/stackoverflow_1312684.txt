If is safe to delete it (as long as data integrity is concerned and the index is not UNIQUE ). When you delete a CLUSTERED index, the table becomes heap organized (i. e. the table rows are not a part of a B-Tree anymore), and all other indexes are rebuilt to refer to RID s instead of the index value + uniquifier . Note that the table is not "ordered" initially. When you issue this query: SELECT * FROM mytable , the rows are not guaranteed to come in the index order unless you use ORDER BY clause.
