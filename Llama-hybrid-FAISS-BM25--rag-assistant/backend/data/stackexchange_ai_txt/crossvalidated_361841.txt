If you have some estimates you have several options: Re-run your meta-analysis using a range of plausible reliability estimates based on the range of the ones you do have. If your results are substantively similar over that range then you can be happy. Choose a typical reliability value to represent the ones you have. The median would seem a reasonable choice but you could average them (after first using Fisher's transformation and then back-transforming).
