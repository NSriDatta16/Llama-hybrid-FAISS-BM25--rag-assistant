Workflow Foundation for Scheduled Process

Is Workflow Foundation a good option for creating a scheduled process for a customer rebilling solution? The process needs to run daily and interact with a data layer as well as a web service. In the past, I have defaulted to using SSIS and either a Scheduled Task or SQL Server Agent job to handle the scheduling. Any input is appreciated.
