Cannot start TFS Build service: Error 1227

When I try to start the TFS 2008 Build service on the port 9191 I get the following error message: Windows could not start the Visual Studio Team Foundation Build service on Local Computer. Error 1227: The network transport endpoint already has an address associated with it. If I use another port it works, but I need it to be the default, 9191. I will appreciate any help! Update: I have tried by removing every binding to the port 9191 that the following command shows: netsh http show uracl To remove the bindings I used the following command: netsh http delete urlacl url=https://xxxx:9191/Build/v2.0/AgentService.asmx/ Once I removed the bindings, the service was able to start, but the BS web service were not available from the outside, this is because of the removed bindings. I ran the following command to reserve the endpoint again: wcfhttpconfig.exe reserve Domain\ServiceAccount https://xxxx:9191/Build/v2.0/AgentService.asmx/ But then, the service is unable to start again. The same error message is displayed as before. The log trace of TFSBuildService contains the following message: TF224000: The Visual Studio Team Foundation Build service failed to start because another application is already using the address http://xxxx:9191/Build/v2.0/AgentService.asmx. Exception Message: HTTP could not register URL http://+:9191/Build/v2.0/AgentService.asmx/. Another application has already registered this URL with HTTP.SYS. (type AddressAlreadyInUseException)
