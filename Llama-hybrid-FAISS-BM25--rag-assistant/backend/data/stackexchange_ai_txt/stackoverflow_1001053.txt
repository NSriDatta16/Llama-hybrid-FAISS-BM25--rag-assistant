By looking for the following header fields you should some proxys. VIA FORWARDED USERAGENT_VIA X_FORWARDED_FOR PROXY_CONNECTION XPROXY_CONNECTION HTTP_PC_REMOTE_ADDR HTTP_CLIENT_IP As for blocking TOR you are best of blocking the TOR exit nodes with iptables. And if you really must be sure you could try some "semi-malicious" things like embedding some flash or java in your page which sends you back the real client ip. But that has only limited scope as you might just get the local ip if he is in e.g. a LAN you get something like 192.168.1.x
