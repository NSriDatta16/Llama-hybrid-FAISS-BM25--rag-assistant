Recommended approach for presenting formatted text in Android?

I am developing an application that will provide instructions to making a product. The text will have bullets and/or numbered steps as well regular text paragraphs. I may have headings for various sections. The text will be placed into a scrollable TexView. I was originally planning on loading the text from a resource text file and then applying formatting via xml. However, I just learned about WebView and the ability to load local html files. I could easily format the text in html and load it into a WebView for the various activities. My question is, is there a performance issue with using WebView vs. TextView? Are there other ways to easily format text for a TextView? Thanks,
