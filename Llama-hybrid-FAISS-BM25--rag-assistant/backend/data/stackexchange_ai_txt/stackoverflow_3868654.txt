The intent of using a domain name is that it helps ensure uniqueness using something that pretty much any organization will already have. That means that no one really needs to be 'responsible' for doling out uniques IDs for package names (or that something ugly like the GUIDs used by COM don't need to be used). So even if your domain name is obscure, by all means use it - it's still unique.
