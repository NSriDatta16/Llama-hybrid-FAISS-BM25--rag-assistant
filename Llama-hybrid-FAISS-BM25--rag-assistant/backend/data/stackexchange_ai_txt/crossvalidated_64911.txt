Does the Holt-Winters algorithm for exponential smoothing in time series modelling require the normality assumption in residuals?

I'm working on a project to compare different approaches to time series modeling. In the model selection process, we perform residual analysis for the fitted models. For regression, we need to check the normality assumption in the residuals by performing Shapiro-Walk's test, or plotting QQ-plot, etc. Do we also need to check whether the residuals are normally distributed after fitting a model using HW algorithm?
