Firstly, as pointed out in the answer by @AdamO Bayesian updating results in the same answer, if you add new data in multiple steps or all at once - if they are for the same parameter. Secondly, I'd wonder whether your observations should be treated as indepdent binary events. Are these not some of the same people, are there not perhaps correlations from day-to-day? Ideally, you'd do a hierarchical model account for e.g. days and whether records refer to the same people. I love a good Bayesian model, but with enough data there might be no difference how you analyze it. If you want be Bayesian, then e.g. R has the great rstanarm package that would let you do this easily, but Python has no excact equivalent, I think, so you could go for a frequentist version in pymer4 (a lot like lme4 in R, apparently). But you may not know what records are from the same people and may not be able to do that. However, in that case be aware that your evidence might be somewhat overstated and that it might be hard to know by how much.
