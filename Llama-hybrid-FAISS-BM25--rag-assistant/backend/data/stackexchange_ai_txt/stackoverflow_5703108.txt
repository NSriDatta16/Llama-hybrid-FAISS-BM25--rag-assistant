Visual Studio Load Testing framework vs Console App - strange results

I've been using the Visual Studio Load Testing framework to load test a web service. If I keep my test simple and use a constant load pattern of 1 user from my local machine, I am able to generate 'x' requests per second. Alternatively, if I use console app that runs the same test, making synchronous calls to the web service, the console app is generating twice the load that I get using the Visual Studio Load Testing framework. The same is true if I try to scale my load tests to use multiple test agents (8 cores) - the VS framework does not generate near the amount of load as a console app running multiple instances. These are the two different unit tests I am using to generate load: //Unit test used for load testing [TestMethod] public void HappyReturnCase_Test() { HttpWebRequest req = WebRequest.Create("http://myurl") as HttpWebRequest; req.Method = "GET"; req.GetResponse().Close(); } //Console app version private static void Main(string[] args) { for (int i = 0; i Can any explain to me why I might be seeing this kind of behaviour? Thanks in advance. Kevin
