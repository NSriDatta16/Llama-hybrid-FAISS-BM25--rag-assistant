Module variables may (or may not) persist between requests (the same app instance may or may not stay alive between requests), but you can explicitly clear them ( del , or set to None , say) at the start of your handling a request, or when you know you're done with one. At worst (if your code is peculiarly organized) you need to set some function to always execute at every request start, or at every request end.
