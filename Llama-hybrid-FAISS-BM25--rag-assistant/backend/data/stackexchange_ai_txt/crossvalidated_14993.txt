You might consider constructing what is known as an ARMAX Model or a Transfer Function Model in general. Do not assume any differencing or lag structure in your known causals or output series unless you are in solid theoretical grounds. Do perform Intervention Detection to control for unobservable or perhaps simply unkmown deterministic structure. Do allow for parameters to change over tome and do allow for variance changes to be detected and incorporated. Do allow for ARIMA structure to control for unknown ir unspecified stochastic input series. You might review some of the questions/answers , both mine and a few others, to previous time series questions for more enlightenment and support.
