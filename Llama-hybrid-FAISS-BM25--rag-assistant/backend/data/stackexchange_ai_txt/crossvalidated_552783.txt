Practical consequences of wrong interpretation of confidence intervals

Can you give me a simple (but preferably common) example (or R/Python simulation) of what are practical consequences of wrong interpretation of frequentist confidence intervals? Especially when they are interpreted as Bayesian credible intervals (an interval within which an unobserved parameter value falls with a particular probability)?
