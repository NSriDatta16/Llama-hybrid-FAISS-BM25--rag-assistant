Not everything can be predicted, if this were the case I'd stick a random forest on the stock market and retire :) Might I suggest you try feature engineering? For example, if you have names like Mrs Jones, Mr Smith, Miss Johnson... try using delimiters to create a new variable for the title of their names, then rerun the models.
