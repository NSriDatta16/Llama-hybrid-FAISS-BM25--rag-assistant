There is no built in way to do this. The way I've done it in the past is to keep a list of coordinates, add to that in touchesBegan, update those based on the the closest touch in proximity to the points in that list in touchesMoved, and remove based on the nearest proximity in touchesEnded and Cancelled. All in all its not too bad, you can also attach state information to these updates to give you a system to poll and get a list of all current touches and their current state.
