How do I determine if a packet is RTP/RTCP?

I am using SharpPCap which is built on WinPCap to capture UDP traffic. My end goal is to capture the audio data from H.323 and save those phone conversations as WAV files. But first thing is first - I need to figure out what my UDP packets are crossing the NIC. SharpPCap provides a UdpPacket class that gives me access to the PayloadData of the message. But I am unsure what do with this data. It's a Byte[] array and I don't know how to go about determining if it's an RTP or RTCP packet. I've Googled this topic but there isn't much out there. Any help is appreciated.
