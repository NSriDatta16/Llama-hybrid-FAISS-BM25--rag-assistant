What is the BroadcastReceiver "actually" doing? cant wrap my head around the code implementation here. after reading many questions here and elsewhere about this getting fragment of clarification I think the method is: - an apk file which contains a Service an activity and a BroadcastReceiver Class. - action.BOOT_COMPLETED will start only my Service, not the Activity. The user can from Main Launcher start Activity for "in app settings" and I Bind to Service and Unbind when done Yea will try this tomorrow after work.
