The model $Y \sim \operatorname{Binomial} θ$ isn't sufficient for this problem because it postulates a probability of survival $θ$ that's the same for every passenger, and you want to examine how survival relates to per-passenger features, namely gender and class. The standard approach to this sort of problem, whether you prefer frequentist or Bayesian methods, is logistic regression. With a regression model, you could have gender and class as main effects and a gender-by-class interaction. So look into Bayesian inference on regression models, or just regression models in general if you're not already familiar with them.
