This is a very common problem of organizing code in your web applications. Here are some pointers to help you attend to your problem. If using a single project and it being ASP.net website project, put your .cs files in the app_code folder. Use namespaces wisely and keep track of what is in which namespace. If u have something like Resharper it saves this task. Ideally you should have only page related and util classes in your web project. Create libraries using C# express for other functions. Test these libraries using NUnit/MbUnit or the likes. If you have doubts if something runs on Cassini but not in IIS. A dev or local IIS is the only solution. Hope that helps!
