UPDATE: Sycorax posted the following link in the comments: Can a random forest be used for feature selection in multiple linear regression? deals with this problem and describes why this might not work too well. Similar explanation: your data/model might suffer from the Curse of dimensionality , as logistic regression is prone to fall to this curse . Several points: (might be comments with enough reputation) pipe.fit(X_train, y_train) Where did you define the training data? Have you tried class_weight="balanced" for logistic regression? This might produce a different rate of misclassification. What were the results without the RFE step?
