Recursive Security Settings

I would like to apply a folder's Security Settings to all descendants in C#. Essentially, I would like to do the same thing as 'Replace all existing inheritable permissions on all descendants with inheritable permissions from this object' within 'Advanced Security Settings for [Folder]'. Are there any elegant ways to approach this?
