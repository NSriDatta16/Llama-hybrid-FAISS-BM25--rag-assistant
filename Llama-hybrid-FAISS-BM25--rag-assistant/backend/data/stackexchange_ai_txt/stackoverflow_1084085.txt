Not the most elegant solution, but you could create a directory, insert a .htaccess and a small php file and try to open it with curl/ file_get_contents() from your actual code: .htaccess RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^(.*?)$ index.php?myparam=$1 index.php Although this might be acceptable during an installation, for performance reasons this shouldn't be used for every request on your site! Save the information somewhere (sqlite/textfile). Update Apache specific, but apache_get_modules() / phpinfo() in combination with array_search/strpos is maybe helpful to you.
