Compare average roc auc scores using T-Test

I am using xgbclassifier to do feature selection by removing variables based on feature importance. I checked the roc_auc_score through 10 cv, and got an average value of 0.785 when 5 features were removed and 0.786 when 12 features were removed. However, the simple average is not clear whether the model with 12 variables removed is better than the model with 5 variables removed. I found it difficult to judge. So, I'm trying to use T-Test as a solution to this, but I'm wondering if it's an appropriate method.
