You can select which tab is "opened" by using the .tabs("select", index) method. For instance: $("#myTabs").tabs("select",1); would select the second tab. At that point it is simply a matter of storing the index of the previously selected tab somewhere accessible (the best location for that information is up to you and your particular problem). You can trigger this storage attaching an event handler for the select event, which will get called every time a user changes the tab being shown. $("#myTabs").bind( "tabsselect", function(event, ui) { alert("Tab index selected: " + ui.index); }); If you are having trouble with this method make sure you are triggering the select command in the proper location (i.e. after the tabs have been correctly initialized) and make sure you are storing the last selected tab in a good location that doesn't go away when the modal closes.
