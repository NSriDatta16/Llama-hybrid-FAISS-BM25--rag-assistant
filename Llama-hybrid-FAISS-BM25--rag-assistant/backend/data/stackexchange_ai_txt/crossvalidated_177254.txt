Woaw, this is a really interesting problem. Based on what you write below it does not seem like you want a generative algorithm, but instead a discriminative algorithm (see this post ). A generative algorithm would think "given a magnitude of 35km and an angle of 34˚, the temperature was likely 20˚C". I want the algorithm to develop a model that thinks "at a point with an ocean surface temperature of 20˚C, an animal will travel along a vector with a magnitude of 35km and an angle of 34˚". If you think it would make sense to just model the relationship between temperature and direction (perhaps with magnitude) then you could use all sorts of regression methods. However, this doesn't take into account the current location, the path that the animal has moved for the last days etc. In general, I think you should really consider how you pose the problem. Instead of having two different representations (a list of paths and a map of surface temperature), I would try to have a single representation. Similarly, be clear about the wanted output from the model. Training deep neural networks for regression is difficult - especially if you want to output two continuous variables (angle + magnitude). Instead you could make the map into a grid and then model the choice of going in any of the 8 directions on the grid. This could be modeled it using a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a variant of this called a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. These networks are fed lists of variable size to predict an outcome (see 'many-to-one classification' here ). As input you would have a list of observations, where each observation contains e.g. the following info: (time, map_location, ocean temperature) . To generate a path given a temperature map and a starting position you would in an iterative manner input the current path and temperature to the RNN, output the next move and then do it again. Something very similar is already done to generate text using RNN and LSTM.
