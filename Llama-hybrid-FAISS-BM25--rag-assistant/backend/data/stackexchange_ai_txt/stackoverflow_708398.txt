I often had the same problem, and wish I had the same tools 10 years ago that I do now. If you need to read existing XML into normal Java classes, I personally believe that apache digester is much more elegant and easier to use than dom4j, since you just specify the mapping. Then, use Hibernate to write the materials down to the database.
