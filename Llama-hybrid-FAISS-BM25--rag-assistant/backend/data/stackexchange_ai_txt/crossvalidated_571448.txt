Does StatsModels' power.tt_ind_solve_power assume a single standard deviation despite two different means?

Does StatsModels' power.tt_ind_solve_power ( link ) assume a single standard deviation despite two different means? I think so. Why is this a reasonable assumption? I come from a primarily Bayesian background, so if I wanted to pool variances, I'd probably draw $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ from the same prior distribution. I don't follow the logic that the means would be the different but the variances would be the same. There is a ratio parameter (what % is population 1?) Perhaps this is used to decouple the variances?
