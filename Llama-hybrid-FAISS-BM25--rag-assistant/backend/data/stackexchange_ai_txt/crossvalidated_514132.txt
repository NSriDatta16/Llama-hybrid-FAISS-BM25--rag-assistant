Using cross-validation for model selection and model comparison

Let us suppose that we have two classifiers: SVM and CART. For each one of them, a set of hyperparameters is considered (C=0.001,0.01,... for SVM cp=... for CART). The question is, can I use k-fold cross-val to perform model selection and model comparison using the same folds? That is, first select the hyperparameters that have the greatest average and then use the paired t-test to compare SVM and CART with the best hyperparameters calculated in the previous step. I reckon that this is what Caret does, but I do not know if it is correct.
