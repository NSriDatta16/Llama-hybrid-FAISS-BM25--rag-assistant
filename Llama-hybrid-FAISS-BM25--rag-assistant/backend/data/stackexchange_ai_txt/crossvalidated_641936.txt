robust linear regression with interaction

I am looking how epigenetic age associated with toxic element exposure in four different road buffer zone (1000m, 2000m, 3000m, &4000m) using robust linear regression. I can run robust linear regression without interaction term, but could you please help me how to run robust linear regression with interaction term (Hg*buffer zone). I have tried below to run robust regression with interaction term but I am not getting 1000m buffer zone interaction with Hg and also I am not getting Pvalue. I want to use Age, sex, and smoking status as covariates. > summary(rr.huber library(emmeans) > EMM EMM Hg buffer.zone emmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL 0.876 1000m 0.0311 0.1602 NA -0.283 0.3452 0.876 2000m -0.0911 0.2949 NA -0.669 0.4868 0.876 3000m -0.1644 0.0774 NA -0.316 -0.0127 0.876 4000m -0.0909 0.1572 NA -0.399 0.2173 Results are averaged over the levels of: Sex Confidence level used: 0.95 Some elements are having huge variation between 1st and 3rd quantile or even o value; do you think this datasets need some cleaning before running robust linear regression or regression model can handle this? > summary(x) As Cd Al Ba Min. : 0.00001 Min. :0.00001 Min. :0.00001 Min. : 0.00 1st Qu.: 3.80000 1st Qu.:0.23381 1st Qu.:1.56500 1st Qu.: 83.12 Median : 6.20000 Median :0.28333 Median :1.97000 Median :105.00 Mean : 6.37249 Mean :0.31966 Mean :2.18731 Mean :109.46 3rd Qu.: 8.12222 3rd Qu.:0.36368 3rd Qu.:2.54100 3rd Qu.:130.33 Max. :35.10000 Max. :2.46500 Max. :5.97333 Max. :446.67
