Operational Transformation library?

I'm looking for a library that would allow me to synchronize text in real-time between multiple users (ala Google Docs). I've stumbled upon Operational Transformation, which seems to fit my needs. Having said that, I understand the gist of OT, but not the math nor implementation of OT. Thus, I was wondering if there was a drag'n'drop Javascript library that would hook into a text area, generate the transforms, then allow me to apply those transformations onto another client? (I've gotten the Etherpad source, but I can't make head or tails out of it. If anyone could point out how to leverage on Etherpad's OT implementation, that'll be great too!)
