Safely find files matching pattern and literals

Given a filename like 'prefix.extension', I would like to find all files of the pattern prefix\.\d\d\.extension . Given that 'prefix' or 'extension' could contain literal strings like .* , \n and the like, the only way I can think of finding this properly is to escape all characters in 'prefix' and 'extension', placing them before and after \.\d\d\. , and egrep -ing it. Is there a more elegant way of doing this and/or some simple way to escape all special characters for egrep in a Bash script? Note that putting a backslash in front of every character will change the semantics of some, like \w .
