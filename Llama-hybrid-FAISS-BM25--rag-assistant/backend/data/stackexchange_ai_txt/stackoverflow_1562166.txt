I'll be darned. I learned something new about Access this month. I never realized you could change the recordset of a form like that. I've never use an On Error Resume Next as you might be, likely are, hiding an error message on a line previous to the line which crashes. Stupid question. Is strRecId a numeric or string field in the query? Are the quotes valid? strRecoID and cnn are not Dimmed in your code. I see strID is dimmed so that's likely the field you meant to use. Please add Option Explicit as the top or second line of your module. Then go into every module and add those lines. Then do a compile and see how many other errors happen. Also go into the VBA Editor then Tools >> Options >> and ensure the Require Variable Declaration box is checked. Also to you and all lurkers. Please send in the crash information to Microsoft. While they, of course, don't like getting crash information, they do treat crashes as a very high priority when it comes to Service Packs.
