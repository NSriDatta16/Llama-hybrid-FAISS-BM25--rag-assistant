I'am not sure I understand your question but maybe I do. You say: "simple = high entropy" from some point of view "simple = low entropy" from some other point of view It's just not the entropy of the same thing. A "simple" model $p_\theta(x)$ has a high entropy as the entropy of the distribution $p_\theta$ : the average surprisal about $x$ when you will simulate many $x$. A "simple" model has a low entropy (actually the real name is quantity of information or surprisal here, entropy standing for its average) as the surprisal of the event "choosing it among other distributions ": the surprisal about $p_\theta$ itself. A simple distribution is thus: something that will simulate observations with average high surprise something you are not much surprised to choose
