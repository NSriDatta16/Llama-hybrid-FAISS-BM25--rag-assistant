You might not have to compile to .class to achieve your goal, you can compile the xsl once per run and re-use the compiled instance for all transformations. To do so you create a Templates object, like: TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); factory.setErrorListener(new ErrorListener( ... )); xslTemplate = factory.newTemplates(new StreamSource( ... )); and use the template to get a transformer to do the work: Transformer transformer = xslTemplate.newTransformer(); Depending on the XSL library you use your mileage may vary.
