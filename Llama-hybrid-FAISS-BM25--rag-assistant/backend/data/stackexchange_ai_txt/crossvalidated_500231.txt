Is there a method that seeks synergies among sports players?

I am going to gather data on the performance of individual lineups in NBA matches. I wanted the data to include the average statistics of the players depending on who was with him on the pitch and the statistics of a given lineup. I am looking for a method that allowed me to find synergy effects between players. You can take for example the average of points for DeAndre Jordan when Chris Paul was on the pitch and when he was not there and probably DeAndre threw more on average with Chris Paul on the pitch. But it only takes one variable into account, and it may come out that someone actually threw more points but the other stats dropped a lot. You can calculate the PER factor that takes into account most of the statistics and again count the two ratios with and without a given player on the field and compare but this is just some basic methods. I'm looking for some more complex method. Maybe some kind of correaltion? Can anyone help?
