Reduced network traffic -- SP are generally worse then Dynamic SQL. Because people don't create a new SP for every select, if you need just one column you are told use the SP that has the columns they need and ignore the rest. Get an extra column and any less network usage you had just went away. Also you tend to have a lot of client filtering when SP are used. caching -- MS-SQL does not treat them any differently, not since MS-SQL 2000 may of been 7 but I don't remember. permissions -- Not a problem since almost everything I do is web or have some middle application tier that does all the database access. The only software I work with that have direct client to database access are 3rd party products that are designed for users to have direct access and are based around giving users permissions. And yes MS-SQL permission security model SUCKS!!! (have not spent time on 2008 yet) As a final part to this would like to see a survey of how many people are still doing direct client/server programming vs web and middle application server programming; and if they are doing large projects why no ORM. Separation -- people would question why you are putting business logic outside of middle tier. Also if you are looking to separate data handling code there are ways of doing that without putting it in the database. Ability to edit -- What you have no testing and version control you have to worry about? Also only a problem with client/server, in the web world not problem. Find the table -- Only if you can identify the SP that use it, will stick with the tools of the version control system, agent ransack or visual studio to find. Optimization -- Your DBA should be using the tools of the database to find the queries that need optimization. Database can tell the DBA what statements are talking up the most time and resources and they can fix from there. For complex SQL statements the programmers should be told to talk to the DBA if simple selects don't worry about it. SQL injection attacks -- SP offer no better protection. The only thing they get the nod is that most of them teach using parameters vs dynamic SQL most examples ignore parameters.
