Simple methods applied to your aggregate, like ets() and auto.arima() in the forecast package for R should definitely be your first try. They run automatically with a few lines of code and represent the gold standard in forecasting. See Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman . Since your percentages are apparently far away from 0% and 100%, you don't need to worry about special methods for compositional-data . Beyond that, you could of course also look at customer-level forecasts as to whether this customer will participate next year or not. Run a logistic regression on all of your customers, including the past year's explanatory variables. If you want to get fancy, do a GLMM with a random intercept per customer to model each customer's general propensity to participate. (That will only help you if you don't have a lot of churn, though.) Then predict this out and aggregate the predicted probabilities. Actually, at this point you have a hierarchical model, with the model on the top given by the time series model and millions of bottom level probabilistic forecasts. So you can use hierarchical reconciliation to put the two together. Take a look at the hierarchical forecasting chapter in the textbook linked above. However, for your logistical models you will need to include in some way how the monthly aspect comes in. Do people enroll for a full year, and you need to predict whether a given customer will renew, or enroll for the first time, or re-enroll after their participation has lapsed for one month, two months, three months...? If so, you will likely need different models for all these cases and in the prediction step use the one that is appropriate for the specific customer. Overall, these bottom level models and forecasts will be far more complex to set up and tune (and note that tuning them will lead to some overfitting, so you may be overoptimistic about your models' performance on unseen data) than the time series models. Plus, you say that the aggregate predictors don't change much over time. In this case I suspect that any improvement over the top level aggregate time series model will be modest at best.
