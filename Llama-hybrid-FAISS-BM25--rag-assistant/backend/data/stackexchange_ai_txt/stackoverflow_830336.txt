Jquery, drag and drop and save to mysql database?

I have been searching all over the web, i could only found the inettuts-with-cookies, which teach how to use Jquery to perform drag and drop and then save in cookies. Can anyone please show me how to save to database (php and mysql)? I need it badly.. EDIT: First, I am not php beginner, but a AJAX beginner. Those tutorials are only for 1 column. Does any one have drag and drop and save to database for 2 or 3 columns? PLEASE>>>
