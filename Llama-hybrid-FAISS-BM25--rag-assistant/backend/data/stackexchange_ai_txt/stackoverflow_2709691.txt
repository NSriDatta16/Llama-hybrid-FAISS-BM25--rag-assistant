From a programmers perspective, can a we consider a neural network a more advanced "data structure"?

I've witnessed a debate on this topic, I wanted to know your opinion ? From a programmers perspective, can a we consider a neural network a more advanced "data structure" ? Is a neural network actually more than a data-structure ?
