I don't know of a standard API for creating a node pragmatically. But this is what I've gleaned from building a module that does what you're trying to do. Make sure the important fields are set: uid, name, type, language, title, body, filter (see node_add() and node_form() ) Pass the node through node_object_prepare() so other modules can add to the $node object.
