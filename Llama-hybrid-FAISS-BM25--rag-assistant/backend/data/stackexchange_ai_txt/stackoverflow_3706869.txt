MbUnit's row attribute in NUnit?

While reading an Asp.Net MVC code sample that used MbUnit as it's testing framework, I saw that it was possible to run a single test against multiple input possibilities by using a Row attribute, like so: [Test] [Row("test@test_test.com")] [Row("sdfdf dsfsdf")] [Row("sdfdf@.com")] public void Invalid_Emails_Should_Return_False(string invalidEmail) { ... } Please I'd like to know if there is an NUnit equivalent of MbUnit's Row attribute , or otherwise an elegant way to achieve this in NUnit. Thanks.
