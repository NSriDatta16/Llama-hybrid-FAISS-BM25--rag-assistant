What's so called "Frames" in visual studio?

In the Call Stack window of visual studio, it reports: [Frames below may be incorrect and/or missing, no symbols loaded for IPCamera.ax] What does it mean by Frames , and why missing symbols may cause it incorrect?AFAIK,symbols are just for debugging info,missing symbols will only make the source invisible .
