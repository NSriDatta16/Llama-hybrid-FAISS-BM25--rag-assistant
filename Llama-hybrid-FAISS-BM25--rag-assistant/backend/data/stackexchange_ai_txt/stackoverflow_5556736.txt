How to save Sift feature vector for classification using Neural network

Matlab implementation of SIFT features were found from http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/ . with the help of stackoverflow. I want to save features to a .mat file. Features are roundness, color, no of white pixel count in the binary image and sift features. For the sift features I took descriptors in above code { [siftImage, descriptors, locs] = sift(filteredImg) } So my feature vector now is FeaturesTest = [roundness, nWhite, color, descriptors, outputs]; When saving this to .mat file using save('features.mat','Features'); it gives an error. Error is like this. ??? Error using ==> horzcat CAT arguments dimensions are not consistent. Error in ==> user_interface>extract_features at 336 FeaturesTest = [roundness, nWhite, color, descriptors, outputs]; As I can understand, I think the issue is descriptor feature vector size. It is . 14 rows are for this feature, where as for others only one row is in .mat file. How can I save this feature vector to the .mat file with my other features? Awaiting for the reply. Thanks in advance.
