The intercept is the predicted value of y when the month is March and the year is 2005. But this looks like a poor model. You should look into time series methods. This is so because time series data are not independent; e.g. the value for April 2005 is related to that for March 2005. Treating both month and year as factors ignores the temporality. Although I am no expert on time series, I would start by plotting the data over time; perhaps a line plot with each year as a line, and then month on the x-axis and the DV on the y-axis.
