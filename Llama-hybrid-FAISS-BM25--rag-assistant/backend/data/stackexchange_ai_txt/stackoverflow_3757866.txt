The first article linked to by Andre seems (maybe I skimmed to fast) to use the "old" pre-D2010 style RTTI (Run-Time Type Information), which is dependent on properties having published visibility in order to be able to enumerate them. As of D2010 Delphi has a completely new extended RTTI (built on top of the old one) which does not require published visibility and does a lot more than enumerate properties. DeHL, as described in the second article linked to be Andre, does use the new RTTI, and if you are looking for a library, I would also recommend this library. If you prefer to build your own, you could have a look at an article on XML-serialization using the new RTTI by Robert Love: http://robstechcorner.blogspot.com/2009/10/xml-serialization-basic-usage.html Robert Love also has a nice overview of RTTI articles: http://robstechcorner.blogspot.com/2009/09/so-what-is-rtti-rtti-is-acronym-for-run.html And for some more ideas on what can be done with the new style RTTI, have a look at Practical usage for Delphi's new RTTI - Attributes,Values and Why should I care about RTTI in Delphi?
