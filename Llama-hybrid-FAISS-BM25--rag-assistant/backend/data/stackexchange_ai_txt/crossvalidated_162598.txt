A model for non-negative data with many zeros: pros and cons of Tweedie GLM

I analyze technical measurement data with the aim of developing a forecasting model. The data is given as a non-negative time series (data per hour). The data looks quite wild and contain many zeros. I expect these zeros to be the result of measuring quantities that are not zero but too small. It is ok to treat those zeros as zero. Just transforming (Box-Cox e.g.) these data with exact zeros does not seem right. So I thought about a classical glm first. But these do not allow for mass at zero and a continuous distribution above zero. So I stumbled upon Tweedie glms eg here . It must be quite a standard problem in the task to predict measurements. What are the pros and cons of working with Tweedie? PS: The number of zeros decreases with the years ... I have to ask the data collector why this could be ...
