The MSE is an average and hence the central limit theorem applies. So testing whether two MSEs are the same is the same as testing whether two means are equal. A difficulty compared to a standard test comparing two means is that your samples are correlated -- both come from the same events. But a difference in MSE is the same as a mean of differenced squared errors (means are linear). This suggests calculating a one-sample t-test as follows: For each x compute a error e for procedure 1 and 2. Compute differences of squared errors (e2^2-e1^2) . Compute the mean of the differences. Compute the standard deviation of the differences. Compute a t-statistic as mean/(sd/sqrt(n)) . Compare your t-statistic to a critical value or compute a p-value. For instance, reject equality at 5% confidence level if |t|>1.96 . The RMSE is a monotonic transformation of MSE so this test shouldn't give substantively different results. But be careful not to assume that MRSE is RMSE. A bigger concern should be overfitting. Make sure to compute all your MSE statistics using data that you did not use to estimate your model.
