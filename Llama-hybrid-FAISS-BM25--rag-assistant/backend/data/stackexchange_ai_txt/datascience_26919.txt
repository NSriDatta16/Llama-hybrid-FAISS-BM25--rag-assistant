ARIMA models are linear and LSTM models are nonlinear. Some other parametric nonlinear time series models that statisticians have studied are Threshold Autoregressive Models (TAR) and Smooth Transition Autoregressive Models (STAR). The R package tsDyn implements these models. I wonder how STAR models do vs. LSTM.
