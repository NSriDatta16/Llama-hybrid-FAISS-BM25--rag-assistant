Test logistic regression model using residual deviance and degrees of freedom

I was reading this page on Princeton.edu . They are performing a logistic regression (with R). At some point they calculate the probability of getting a residual deviance higher than the one they got on a $\chi^2$ distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the degrees of freedom of the model. Copying-pasting from their website... > glm( cbind(using,notUsing) ~ age + hiEduc + noMore, family=binomial) Call: glm(formula = cbind(using, notUsing) ~ age + hiEduc + noMore, family = binomial) Coefficients: (Intercept) age25-29 age30-39 age40-49 hiEduc noMore -1.9662 0.3894 0.9086 1.1892 0.3250 0.8330 Degrees of Freedom: 15 Total (i.e. Null); 10 Residual Null Deviance: 165.8 Residual Deviance: 29.92 AIC: 113.4 The residual deviance of 29.92 on 10 d.f. is highly significant: > 1-pchisq(29.92,10) [1] 0.0008828339 so we need a better model Why does it make sense to compute 1-pchisq(29.92,10) and why does a low probability indicate that something is going wrong with their model?
