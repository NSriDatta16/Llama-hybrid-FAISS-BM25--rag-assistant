You could use ANY classifier. Including Linear Discriminants, multinomial logit as Bill pointed out, Support Vector Machines, Neural Nets, CART, random forest, C5 trees, there are a world of different models that can help you predict $v.a$ using $v.b$ and $v.c$ . Here is an example using the R implementation of random forest: # packages library(randomForest) #variables v.a= c('cat','dog','dog','goat','cat','goat','dog','dog') v.b= c(1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2) v.c= c('blue', 'red', 'blue', 'red', 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'yellow') # model fit # note that you must turn the ordinal variables into factor or R wont use # them properly model # model confusion matrix model$confusion Clearly these variables don't show a strong relation.
