How can I determine why my ASP.NET application is recycling

I am running an ASP.NET application on an IIS7 server. It has been running fine for a long time, but over the past week or so it has been discarding all users' sessions several times a day. I enabled all of the application pool recycle logging options as described in http://blogs.iis.net/ganekar/archive/2008/12/12/iis-7-0-application-pool-recycles-log-a-event-in-windows-event-log.aspx , but I didn't get anything in my event log. There are no errors in the event log, and no visible symptoms except that all my users lose their sessions. Are there any other reasons that IIS would recycle my application pool? Is there any other type of logging that I can enable to find out what is happening?
