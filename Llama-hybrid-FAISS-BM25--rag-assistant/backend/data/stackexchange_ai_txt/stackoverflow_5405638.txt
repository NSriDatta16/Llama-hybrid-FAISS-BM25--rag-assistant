I am the head of mobile development for a government contractor that develops various systems for large government organizations, including Budget Management, Time Tracking, Radiological Monitoring and Assessment, and other much more intensive systems. We've been using jQuery Mobile with great success. Our clients have been universally satisfied with both the UI and UX afforded by JQM. We use ASP.NET's Razor engine for inline coding within the pages that drive JQM. Though not every possible feature is implemented in JQM by default, it's not that difficult to extend. I haven't yet run into any roadblocks I wasn't able to easily overcome. As far as cross-platforming goes, we've found that the best option is combining JQM and PhoneGap. Titanium is seriously hindered by the lack of a XML UI engine as you said, and MonoTouch just isn't robust enough to do everything we need.
