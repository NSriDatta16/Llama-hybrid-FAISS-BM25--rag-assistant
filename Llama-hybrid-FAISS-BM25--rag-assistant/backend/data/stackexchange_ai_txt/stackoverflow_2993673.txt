The following code will get you a char* view of all the float s in your input parameter. However, I'd very careful that this is actually what you want. The char* array is not endian robust, and I always try to avoid handing allocated pointers back to users. Anyone using this function will need to deallocate output with delete[] , but that is in no way obvious from the function name or signature, a recipe for fragile code. void foo(const std::vector > &input, char* &output ) { //this was likely an error, it is always an array of size 4 //char charBuf[sizeof(output)]; std::vector tmp_output; int counter = 0; // Why was this here? for(unsigned int i=0; i (tmp_output) ); for(unsigned int p=0; p (&(*tmp_output.begin())), reinterpret_cast (&(*tmp_output.end())), output ); }
