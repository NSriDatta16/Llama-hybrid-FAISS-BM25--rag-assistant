I've found the correlation between two non-stationary time series can be studied using Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis - DCCA (Horvatic et al., 2011; Zebende, 2011) even applying lags to the time series (Chenhua, 2015), being one refered to as signal (for example, an environmental variable) and the other as response (for example, a biotic community dynamics variable). Unfortunately, I couldn't find any R function that encodes this analysis. Therefore, I'm working on an algorithm (for R) based on Chenhua's work. As soon as I use the implemented DCCA algorithm for analyzing my data, I might share a R package containing a DCCA function. References: Horvatic et al., 2011.
