Comparing time series data between subjects

We are measuring the blood concentration of a drug (1) when subjects had a meal and (2) on an empty stomach. For this, we are drawing blood at 15 minute intervals. This gives us two time series of data for each subject. We want to show that the drug is absorbed slower when patients have eaten. Is there a statistical test to compare time series data between subjects that we could use?
