I agree with @drnexus. In addition, I might recommend a Morgan-Pitman test for the equality of variances of the two methods. This would tell you if one method has more variance than the other. This in itself might not be a bad thing because presumably the two tests have different bias-variance tradeoffs (for example, one test might always say 50% (biased, but no variance) while the other is unbiased but very noisy). Some domain knowledge might be helpful here in determining how much tradeoff you want of your method. Of course, as noted by others, having a 'gold standard' would be much preferred.
