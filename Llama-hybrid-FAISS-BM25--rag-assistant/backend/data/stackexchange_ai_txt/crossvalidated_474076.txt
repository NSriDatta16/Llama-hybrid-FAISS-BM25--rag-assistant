probability of pulling five aces in 10 pulls from deck of cards

In the book bayesian statistics the fun way, there are a number or exercises to complete and I am working my way through them One is: "what is the probability of pulling five aces in 10 pulls from a deck of cards (remember the card is shuffled back in the deck when it is pulled)?" It says "this is the same as B(5; 10, 1/13)" And the answer: "As expected, the probability of this is extremely low: about 1/32,000." But I cannot understand how this was arrived at. I took k = 5 and n = 10 and calculated that the coefficient is 252 I then multiplied this 252 * (1/13)^5 * (1-1/13)^10-5 But it does not come out to anything near 1/32,000 What am I missing?
