Being well mentored, having those people sit down with you when you have a problem and work it through with you. You gain an insight into how they are thinking of things in an OO way. Regular code reviews. Think I learnt most from a team code review conducted via PowerPoint in which some scorn was poured on my code. Concentrated my mind, it did. Helped of course that I learned OO with Smalltalk (everyone should be forced to do this IMHO). Language always encouraged the concept of ‘message sending’. That is, don’t inline the stuff here, write a new method and call it (ie send a message and get an answer**) result? Simplicity, low coupling, high cohesion. ** When I write my JavaDoc for an accessor method I still write ‘answer a [blah] that represents the [thing]’ People may think I’m strange, but no-ones called the cops so far....
