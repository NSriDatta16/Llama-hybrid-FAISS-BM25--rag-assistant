This is a pretty tough question to answer, because in my opinion there is a difference between what you "should" allow and what is considered allowable by the IETF . The maximum allowable email address is 256 characters which includes a slash at the beginning and end of the email address (therefore only 254 usable characters). You can find detailed information about it on this page by Dominic Sayers . But will any legitimate user actually have an email address that long? As for street addresses, I don't believe that is specified anywhere, however according to the world's longest website the longest street name is 72 characters. Therefore if you made the field 100 characters you would have more than enough room for the street address. You don't have to be really too concerned with getting everything 100% correct, you should be more concerned with the quality of the data which you decide to accept into the database (make sure it is valid/clean). Also provide clear rejection messages if someone does enter something which is simply too long -- and make sure there is an easy method for the owner of the website to be contacted if that does happen. One thing I'd like to note, NoSQL is all the rage right now, and it uses schema-less database engines, for example MongoDB and CouchDB . It is not the best solution for everything , however if you are very concerned about having the correct schema, possibly a schema-less database might be a good option.
