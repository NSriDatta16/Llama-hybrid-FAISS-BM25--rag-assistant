Removing monthly trend from time series

I have a time series of monthly temperature data for ~ 100 years. My aim is to turn it into a time series which has neither a trend nor autocorrelation. I want to make sure this is true for the whole time series as well as for the series of each of the months seperately (e.g. looking at a time series of August temperature from 1900-2000). How do I go about that? Especially taking into account that different months might have different trends?
