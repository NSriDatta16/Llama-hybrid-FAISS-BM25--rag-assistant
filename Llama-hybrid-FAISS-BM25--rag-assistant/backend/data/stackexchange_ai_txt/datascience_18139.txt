If you have a large enough sample size, you can indeed carry this out the way you propose. For five events, you have 120 ($^5P_5$) possible permutations of the order of events. This allows you to run a logistic regression with 120 dummy independent variables, each of which corresponds to a permutation of your order of events. The F-test of this regression will function as a significance test to see if there is any difference in frequency of your outcome between different orderings of events. This does require a large sample size, however. A good rule of thumb is at least 20 observations per independent variable in a General Linear Model, so if you have a few thousand samples, we'd expect this model to fit reasonably well. This does assume you have a relatively small number of events. Five seems manageable, but as your number of events increases, you quickly run into problems as your number of independent variables grows factorially.
