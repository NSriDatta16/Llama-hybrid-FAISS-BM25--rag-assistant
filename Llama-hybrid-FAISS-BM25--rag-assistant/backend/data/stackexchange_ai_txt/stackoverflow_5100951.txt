Split string with inner and outer delimeters in Javascript

In my Javascript code, I have a string that is something like this: "1943[15]43[67]12[32]" I want to return an array like this: ["1","9","4","3","15","4","3","67","1", 2","32"] That is, I want it to separate every character, except the numbers inside the brackets, which I want to preserve as one element. Is there an elegant way to do this?
