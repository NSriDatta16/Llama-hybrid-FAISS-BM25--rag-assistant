You can also cache dynamic pages, which can bring huge benefits to performance, but remember that you can't cache any pages with personalized data in them. E.g. say you had a news page updated every hour, you could cache it on the CDN with a TTL (Time-To-Live) of 10 minutes. This would speed up page times and reduce server load. But if you have any personalised data, for example "Welcome, username" in the banner, you can no longer cache the whole page as it will serve the wrong data to visitors. One technique to avoid this is to put personalized data in a separate page fragment in a different folder, and load them by AJAX, making sure that this folder is never cached.
