In general, I agree with @ttnphns' comment in that you have to have a certain minimal number of cases per variable, with other metrics include loadings and number of variables per factor. This is addressed in the literature (i.e., MacCallum, Widaman, Zhang & Hong, 1999). Having said that, this heuristic is not set in stone - people have different opinions on the topic and I ran across research that discusses conditions, when it is possible to obtain good results from factor analysis (FA) of small sample data sets ($N References Costello, A.
