Reinforcement Learning and the Markov Decision Process

In Sutton/Barto's book on Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, they introduced the idea of MDP and its advantages to Reinforcement Learning early on. My questions are: We still CAN do RL on a system that is non-MDP, right? What advantages can there be if a task can be described by MDP vs non MDP? How will I know if a task can be described by an MDP? Is there a statistical test to know this? I would like to ask your insights and intuition on this. Thanks
