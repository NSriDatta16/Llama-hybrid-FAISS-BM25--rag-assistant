It looks like there's something wrong with your installation. Either you're missing files from Magento's lib folder, you have damaged files in Magento's lib folder, or (longshot) your PHP include path is pointing in a different location. First thing I'd do is download a fresh install of your version of Magento, unzip it in a separate folder, and then run diff -r /homepages/45/d210005774/htdocs/websitename/ /path/to/fresh/magento This will give you a list of differences between the standard core files and your own. If you want to diagnose specific files, check lib/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Interface.php for the missing interface interface Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Interface { ... } And check lib/Zend/Locale for the missing method public static function disableCache($flag) { self::$_cacheDisabled = (boolean) $flag; } Finally, check you PHP include path to ensure there isn't an older copy of Magento and/or Zend being included.
