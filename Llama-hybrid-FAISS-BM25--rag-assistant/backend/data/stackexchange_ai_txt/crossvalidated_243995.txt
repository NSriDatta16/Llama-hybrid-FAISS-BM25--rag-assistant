What type of SVM should I use for datasets of less and more than 10000 samples?

I have 6 datatasets: Dataset1: 2548 samples Dataset2: 5167 samples Dataset3: 2490 samples Dataset4: 9113 samples Dataset5: 7332 samples Dataset6: 26650 samples Dataset6 is the combination of the other 5. I am using sklearn. What SVM should I use? a) svm.SVC : based on libsvm kernels:rbf (x defect), linear, poly, sigmoid, precomputed Cannot scale to dataset with more than 10000 samples b) svm.LinearSVC : similar to svm.SVC + linear kernel. But implemented in « liblinear ». Scales better to a large number of samples. I think that I can only use b). Because it scales to large datasets even though that means that I can only try 1 type of kernel.
