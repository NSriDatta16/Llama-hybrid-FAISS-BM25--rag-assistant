Connecting potential outcomes, SUTVA, and regression methods

I'm trying to articulate the differences between identification in regression models and assumptions with the potential outcomes framework. In particular what (if anything) does SUTVA add beyond an assumption like mean independence. This is how I've been thinking about it: For a regression, we have data $(Y_i,X_i)$ where $X_i$ is binary. In the model $Y_i = b_0 + b_1 X_i + u_i$ , we need $\mathbb{E}[u_i|x_i]=0$ for $\hat{b}_{1,OLS} \to b_1$ . In the potential outcomes world we invoke SUTVA ("no interference" and "no hidden versions of the treatment"â€”thanks for the formal definitions here ) and call $(Y_i(0),Y_i(1))$ the potential outcomes, where $Y_i = (1-X_i)Y_i(0) + X_iY_i(1)$ . If we assume independence ( $(Y_i(1),Y_i(0))\perp X_i$ ), then I believe $\bar{Y}_i X_i - \bar{Y}_i (1-X_i) \to b_1$ . Then how is $\mathbb{E}[u_i|x_i]=0$ related to the SUTVA assumption? At first blush, it seems like the independence assumption should be the one related to the mean independence assumption, which would mean SUTVA is buying us something else. Is it buying something more? or is independence of potential outcomes weaker than mean independence of errors (without SUTVA)? Or should I think of SUTVA as clarifying the interpretation of the target parameter more than identification? Imagine we prescribe medication to an (random) treatment group ( $X_i=1$ ) and control group ( $X_i=0$ ). If these groups share medicine, we would expect $\bar{Y}_i X_i = \bar{Y}_i(1-X_i)$ in essence because everyone is "treated" (albeit with a half dose). This is often given as an example for why we need SUTVA ( this was a helpful discussion for me ), but my intuition says that in the analogous regression model, if there is sharing we would expect $u_i$ (the unobserved determinants of the outcome) to be larger for $X_i=0$ group and smaller for $X_i=1$ group, violating $\mathbb{E}[u_i|x_i]=0$ (or stated another way, we have omitted variables: "I gave my medicine to my friends" and "I got medicine from my friends"). So yes, OLS is biased, but is it because the assumptions aren't strong enough or because they aren't met? (In either case there is also a little bit of semantics about whether $X$ is being assigned to receive the medicine or actually taking it... in an IV setting this seems like it would be an encouragement design with no first stage...) I've also tried connecting the dots by using the potential outcomes in the regression equation. $$ \begin{align*} b_0 + b_1 X_i + u_i &= Y_i \\ &= (1-X_i)Y_i(0) + X_iY_i(1) \\ &=Y_i(0) + b_i X_i \\ &=\mu_{Y0} + e_{i0} + (\mu_{b} + e_{i1}) X_i \\ &=\mu_{Y0} + \mu_b X_i + (e_{i0}+e_{i1} X_i) \end{align*} $$ where the $\mu$ s are population averages for and $e$ s are deviations from untreated outcomes and treatment effects. Looking at this makes me think that if SUTVA is true then independence of potential outcomes implies mean independence of the errors. But I'm still feeling confused about how to think about the relationship if STUVA isn't true.
