jQuery Drag from a List (without removing element) and Drop into another List

How can I have two lists (div or table elements) in which I can drag & drop items from one to the other (I think jQuery droppable does this), but without actually removing it from the source list? Example: List1 List2 AAA 111 BBB 555 CCC 999 DDD 777 Now I'm dragging BBB from the left to the right between "555" and "999". Result (see how BBB is now in both : List1 List2 AAA 111 BBB 555 CCC BBB DDD 999 777
