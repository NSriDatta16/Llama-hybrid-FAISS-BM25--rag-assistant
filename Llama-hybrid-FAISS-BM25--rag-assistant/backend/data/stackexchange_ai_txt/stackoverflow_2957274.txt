How to Identify the website's content language like English, Japanese, Chinese etc

(I am developing a website to crawl the other website content in ASP.NET . I am able to get the content correctly but how can I identify which language is used based on that content. For Ex. English, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese etc. I used following code. HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(TextBox1.Text ); request.UserAgent = "A .NET Web Crawler"; WebResponse response = request.GetResponse(); Stream stream = response.GetResponseStream(); StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream); string htmlText = reader.ReadToEnd();
