XAML , MXML all these stuff works as long as you are developing a simple UI with some average complexity . Once your UI gets complex and richer , the automatic data bindings will cause more trouble than their benefits . The purpose of XAML is not make programming easy , it is to seperate UI from logic so that tooling of UI can be easy .. No Data bindings , No Event handlers .. assume that you will never see your XAML again and write code .. XAML is presentation . Data binding is not presentation . its presentation logic. put all presentation logic in code behind (data binding and handlers). Developers own code behind , Designers own XAML . if you are a developer and if you are touching XAML , then move that part in to code behind . we can write WPF apps without XAML too .. Thanks Vinoth Kumar R (Had gone thru enough using Flex MXML data binding)
