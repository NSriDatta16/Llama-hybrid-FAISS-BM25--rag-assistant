How can I know whether the number of trees is not overfitting the data?

I want to optimize random forest hyperparameters. I am using random search. I have specified a range of 100 to 1000 as the number of trees. How can I know whether the given # of trees is overfitting the data? I mean lets say I am given 450 trees as an ideal value. But the truth is that with 156 is just enough. Thank you.
