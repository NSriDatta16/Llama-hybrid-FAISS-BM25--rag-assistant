Presuming that with the input set " > > " we want to match 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The problem is that you need to use zero-width look-ahead and zero-width look-behind, but there are three cases to match, ' ' and '', and one not to match '<>'. Also if you want to be able to extract the marked expressions so that you can assign the match to an array, you need to avoid marking things you don't need. So I ended up with the non-elegant use Data::Dumper; my $a = " > > "; my $brace_pair = qr/ ]+>/; my @matches = $a =~ /(?:(? ))|(?:$brace_pair(?!>))|(?:(? If you wanted to cram this into a single expression - you could.
