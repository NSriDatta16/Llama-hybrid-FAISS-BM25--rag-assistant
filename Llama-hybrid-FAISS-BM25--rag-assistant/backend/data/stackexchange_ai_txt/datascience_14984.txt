What is an inception layer?

I'am reading an article called "FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering". And there, they use something called "inception". I guess it's something about layers, but I can't find any information about it. Just found some code , which doesn't explain much. Can somebody give a clue, how can I search for this correctly, or maybe, kindly and briefly tell the concept idea?
