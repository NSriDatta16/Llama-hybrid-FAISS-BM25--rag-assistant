If you actually need the string value, then the answer is no. Comparing a string in the DB is less expensive than comparing an int, then looking up the string from the int. As for duplication of strings, the more duplication you have, then the less storage you would need if they were denormalized. It would still be slower though. If you're looking for performance over storage, then stick with the string,int PK.
