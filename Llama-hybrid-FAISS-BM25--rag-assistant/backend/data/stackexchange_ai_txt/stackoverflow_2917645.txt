Embedding Python in C: Having problems importing local modules

I need to run Python scripts within a C-based app. I am able to import standard modules from the Python libraries i.e.: PyRun_SimpleString("import sys") But when I try to import a local module can PyRun_SimpleString("import can") returns the error message: Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in ImportError: No module named can When I type the command import can in IPython, the system is able to find it. How can I link my app with can? I've tried setting PYTHONPATH to my working directory.
