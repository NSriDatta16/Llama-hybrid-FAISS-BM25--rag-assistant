"Average per-class error is usually not a good metric. For instance, it is not a continuous function of model parameters, so is difficult to optimize. There is also more statistical reasons, it is not a proper score function. Search this site for "proper score function": https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=proper+score+function For other reasons why it is not a good idea, see Logistic regression: maximum likelihood vs misclassification In most cases, it is more informative to see a problem with a binary variable response as risk (that is, probability) estimation, not as classification. For discussion see Logistic regression: maximum likelihood vs misclassification
