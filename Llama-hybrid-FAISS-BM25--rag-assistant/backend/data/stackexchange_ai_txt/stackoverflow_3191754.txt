Sure thing buddy (yes I'm talking to myself), In your custom annotation add: @property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate; This satisfies the requirement of implementing setCoordinate, as mentioned inhttp://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKAnnotationView_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/MKAnnotationView/draggable In your MapView delegate add: - (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView annotationView:(MKAnnotationView *)annotationView didChangeDragState:(MKAnnotationViewDragState)newState fromOldState:(MKAnnotationViewDragState)oldState { //..Whatever you want to happen when the dragging starts or stops } and in your AnnotationView set draggable to true, so for example: customAnnotationView.draggable = YES; I think that was everything that I did to get it working. Tell me if you have troubles.
