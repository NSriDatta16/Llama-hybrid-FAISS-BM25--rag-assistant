Where is this code? I noticed that it is an event handler and not necessarily a member of MainForm. So, when you reference this.Height , "this" might not be the MainForm (at least we can't tell from the code fragment you've included). In general, it's better to override OnPaint in your MainForm rather than attaching an event handler. Just be sure to call the base class's OnPaint before doing any painting of your own. For more information, see OnPaint at MSDN.
