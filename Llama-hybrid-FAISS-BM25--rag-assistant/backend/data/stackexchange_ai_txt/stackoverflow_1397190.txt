Visual C++ Precompiled Headers errors

Update: What are the effects of including stdafx.h in my header files? I started on a C++ project in Linux/Eclipse CDT and imported it into Visual C++/Windows. In Visual C++, I started using precompiled headers to speed up compilation and defined stdafx.cpp and stdafx.h. Here's my stdafx.h #pragma once #include #include #include ... and my stdafx.cpp #include "stdafx.h" In every .h and .cpp file, I have the following: #pragma once //if in a header file #include "stdafx.h" For both release and debug, I have "Create Precompiled Header (/Yc)". It compiled fine in debug mode, but in release mode it keeps reporting error LNK2005: ___@@_PchSym_@00@UfhvihUaszlaDUwlxfnvmghUnnlUhixUnnlPeDUnnlPeDUivovzhvUvmgrgbOlyq@ already defined in A.obj If I switch both to "Use precompiled header", I get in both Debug and Release fatal error C1854: cannot overwrite information formed during creation of the precompiled header in object file: Does anyone know what's going on?
