When we say that an interval has confidence 95% we mean that in repeated sampling we would find that intervals constructed in the same way would cover the true value of the parameter about 95% of the times: the confidence is the probability of coverage in repeated experimentation. Now, I do not think you can talk about "How confident are we to conclude that $p_1 " when no confidence interval is involved: $p_1 that will be either true or false. Perhaps from a Bayesian point of view you could talk about the posterior probability that $p_1 given that something happens, but that is an entirely different sort of statement than what goes under the name of confidence.
