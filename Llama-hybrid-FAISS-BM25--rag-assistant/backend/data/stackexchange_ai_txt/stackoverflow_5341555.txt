The "file being used by another process" exception is certainly down to trying concurrent access (and this could be from the current process). Process Explorer can help here: search for the name of the file to see what processes have handles to the file. With respect to the XML error: either XML is "Well Formed" or it isn't XML. And that means having exactly a single root element. Well formed: Stuff Not XML: Stuff More stuff There is limited capability within .NET for loading "XML Fragments" which can break the document rules, but this is really for insertion into a complete document, not as an alternative to the XML rules.
