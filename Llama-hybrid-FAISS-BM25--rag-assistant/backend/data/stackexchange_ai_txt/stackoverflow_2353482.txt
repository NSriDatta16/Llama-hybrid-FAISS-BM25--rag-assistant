The BackGroundWorker component may help you. It is available on the toolbox so you can drag to your form. This component exposes a set of events to execute tasks in a thread different than the UI thread. You don't have to worry about creating a thread. All the interaction between the code running on background and the UI controls must be done via the event handlers. For your scenario you can setup a timer to trigger the background worker at a specific interval. private void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e) { backgroundWorker.RunWorkerAsync(); } Then you implement the proper event handlers to actually collect data and update the UI private void backgroundWorker_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e) { // Collect performance data and update the UI }
