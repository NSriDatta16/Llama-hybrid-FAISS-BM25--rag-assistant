The answer from Neil is correct. However I think its important to point out that while the loss does not depend on the distribution between the incorrect classes (only the distribution between the correct class and the rest), the gradient of this loss function does effect the incorrect classes differently depending on how wrong they are. So when you use cross-ent in machine learning you will change weights differently for [0.1 0.5 0.1 0.1 0.2] and [0.1 0.6 0.1 0.1 0.1]. This is because the score of the correct class is normalized by the scores of all the other classes to turn it into a probability.
