How would you parse the integer out of this XML response in Obj C?

I am working with an API where I get a response back this this, and I want to parse the integer ID out of it: 328925 How would you parse this? I have some really fragile code I want to get rid of, and I'd appreciate some advice: if ([[response substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(0, 21)] isEqualToString: @" "]) { self.tripId = [response substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(28, response.length-35)]; } I don't think I need an XML parsing library for this task!
