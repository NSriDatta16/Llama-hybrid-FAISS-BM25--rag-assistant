If it is iGoogle you are looking for then get yourself an iGoogle like framework. iGoogle uses a standard API that its widgets implement, see open social . There are also a lot of other examples to pull from: check out nettuts Treat the client code like you would server side code. What I mean by this is the following: Keep it organized Break things down into smaller reusable functions Avoid dependence on global variables please Keep your traffic lightweight between client and server On the server side make things render quickly and take advantage of caching (nobody likes widgets that take 5 seconds to load or more)
