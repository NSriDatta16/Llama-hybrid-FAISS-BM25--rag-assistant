LINQ to SQL is pretty easy to work with. You can drag and drop your database tables into the designer and write pretty simple queries in a few minutes. NorthwindDataContext db = new NorthwindDataContext(); var products = from p in db.Products select p; Which would basically translate into SELECT * FROM Products A few other select samples: var products = from p in db.Products where p.Category.Name == "Beverages" select p; var products = from p in db.Products orderby p.Name select p;
