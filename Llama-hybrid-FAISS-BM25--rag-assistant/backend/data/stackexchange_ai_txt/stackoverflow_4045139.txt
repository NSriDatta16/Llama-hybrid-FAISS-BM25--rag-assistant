It's no wonder, you're trying to create a 22MB bytearray into your phone's RAM; most Android phones does not have that much RAM. What you want to do is to stream the file into SD card or internal storage: // untested final int BUFFER_SIZE = 23 * 1024; InputStream is = ucon.getInputStream(); BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(is, BUFFER_SIZE); FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file); byte[] baf = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE]; int actual = 0; while (actual != -1) { fos.write(baf, 0, actual) actual = bis.read(baf, 0, BUFFER_SIZE); } fos.close();
