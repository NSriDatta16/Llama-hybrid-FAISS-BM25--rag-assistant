First this is most basic problem in Marketing Analytics, may be some books on marketing analytics would help and your question is too vague and comprises of several questions in one but still i am trying please comment if i reach there. where many features regarding their history of buying behavior are recorded: who bought what, at which time, how often they entered the shop, at which points inside the shop the stood longest etc. To some customers I'm sending randomly ads at periodic time intervals, to others not. I have been using gains and lift chart for assessing what better you can get when you send targeted marketing campaigns or random. Here is an amazing link that might excite you. But in order to be able to define this target feature, I'd need to do some machine learning to assess if and what he had bought if there were no ads For this problem use Marketing Mix Model .
