This should work: var set2 = $('#set2'); $('#set1 > div').click(function(){ set2.find('.' + this.className).show(); }); We first cache #set2 for performance reasons, then attach a click event handler to each of the child div of #set1 , which when clicked, will cause the corresponding div with the same class in #set2 to appear. See http://www.jsfiddle.net/yijiang/xCEVH/1/ for a simple demo. However, class names starting with numbers are not valid in HTML. I've taken the liberty of correcting that mistake in the demo.
