Replace paragraph by tag in div with contenteditable

How to put only in div contenteditable while user is pressing ENTER key? I must manage the content of that div in XML after send, but some browsers translate new lines as , some (in example Google Chrome) as . The good solution will be force to make new lines the same in all browsers (only or only ) too. PS: I'm using jQuery and PHP.
