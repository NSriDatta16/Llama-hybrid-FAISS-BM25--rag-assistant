If you would like new users to load a history of the chat that occurred before they entered the room, a DB or other storage is required. Unless you are trying to create a chat for learning, there are too many out there to use for free to bother. http://tinychat.com is another simple chat site. AJAX works fine. I have created a simple page for one of my sites. But I find that chat doesn't get used as often as you would think. Sharing data gets a little more complicated and would be easier to accomplish by hosting an IRC server and allowing users to use IRC clients which have data exchange capability. Although nothing is stopping you from having one user upload to the site, then others download. Person to person would be difficult with using a web interface, because the users are not connected in any way with each other.
