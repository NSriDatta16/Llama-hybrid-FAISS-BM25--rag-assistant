In this case you probably want to use the tabular environment to generate the three columns (or as simon notes longtable if your report-thingy runs longer than one page). Something like: \framebox{ \centering \begin{tabular}{p{3cm}|p{\specialwidth}|p{5cm}} Ref 1-0-0 & 1.2345 & 1.2346 \\ Ref 1-0-1 & 2.3456 & 2.3454 \\ ... \end{tabular} } You'll note that I've used paragraph formatted columns (the p{ } formatting specifiers), and stuck a frame around it with \framebox . You can either compute \specialwidth by hand, or calculate it: \newlength{\specialwidth} \setlength{\specialwidth}{\textwidth} \addtolength{\specialwidth}{-10cm} % extra room for the seperators... I can't help you on the internationalization issue...
