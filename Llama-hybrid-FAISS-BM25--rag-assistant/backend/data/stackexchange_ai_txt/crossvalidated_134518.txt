There are $N$ users. Each user produces a value from a $X \sim \text{Bin}(k, \pi)$ random variable, where $\pi$ is the true success probability. You want to test $$ \text{H}_0: \pi = 0.5 \quad \text{VS} \quad \text{H}_1: \pi \neq 0.5 $$ $$ $$ A quick, pragmatic way to determine the power of that test is to fix values for $N$, $k$, and $\pi$, randomly draw many samples with those parameters, perform the hypothesis testing for each sample, compute the proportion of times $\text{H}_0$ is rejected (this is the power!), play with the parameters $N$, $K$, and $\pi$. edit I have Just realised that it is here assumed that the $k$ results are available for each user. If it is not the case, then the same idea applies using a Bernoulli distribution and $0.5^k$.
