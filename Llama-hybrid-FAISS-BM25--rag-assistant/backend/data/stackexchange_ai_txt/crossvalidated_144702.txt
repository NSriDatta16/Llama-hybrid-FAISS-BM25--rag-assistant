How to interpret this PCA biplot to determine which attributes to pick?

I'm running PCA on my dataset which can be found here . There are 6497 instances and 12 attributes with 13th column is the class (ranging from 3 - 9) for wine quality. I've read what PCA is supposed to do. It combines attributes and shows variance in the data. Finally leading to be able to select few dimensions from a high dimension data that have the most variance. I'm having trouble finding which attributes to pick after running PCA. How can I find out which attributes can I use and still not lose meaning of my data. I've created the following biplot from the ggbiplot package How can I interpret from this biplot which attributes to pick? I've also created a screeplot for variance. Looking at the variance screeplot I would say that 3 components would represent the data well. Is this a reasonable assessment to make? Question How can I decide which attributes to pick after running PCA While doing PCA should I leave out the class variable or keep it? Code to generate the plots wine
