Supporting Kanban inside TFS is feasible but it is not for the fainted heart. First, you will need expertise about how to edit TFS process template. And it is not because you will need to create a specific TFS process template for Kanban. If you are serious about Scrum and Kanban, I strongly suggest that you start (your process improvement) with the Visual Studio Scrum 1.0 template released by Microsoft in July 2010 and change it as you go. Be warned that you will need to manually edit and change the TFS process template as your process evolve (add or remove state). Second, you will need to find the right skin to turn TFS into a Kanban board. Today, tools like Urban Turtle provides web interface to turn TFS into Scrum (not Kanban). However, through configuration you can adapt our task board to support multiple states (and behave a little bit like a kanban board). As specified by Scrum, Urban Turtle task board contains only three columns (To do, In progress, Done). However, one column can host many state. For example, it is possible to drag a card from one state to another state while keeping the card inside the “In progress” column. As your process evolved, be warned that you will need to manually edit and change the Urban Turtle configuration file to map the new state with color. FYI, adding a specific Kanban board (which will not requires manual edits) is part of Urban Turtle roadmap. However, it is not rank high in our product backlog. Discloser: I work with the Urban Turtle team. So do not take my words. Instead, read what Brian Harry from Microsoft wrote in his blog a few days ago: "...awesome Scrum experience for TFS."
