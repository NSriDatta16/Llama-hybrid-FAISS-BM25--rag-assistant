I don't know of any method to do that in an exact way. A work-around could be to assume that you have gaussian noise and make the Neural Network predict a mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$. For the cost function you can use the NLPD ( negative log probability density ). For datapoint $(x_i,y_i)$ that will be $-\log N(y_i-\mu(x_i),\sigma(x_i))$. This will make your $\mu(x_i)$ try to predict your $y_i$ and your $\sigma(x_i)$ be smaller when you have more confidence and bigger when you have less. To check how good are your assumptions for the validation data you may want to look at $\frac{y_i-\mu(x_i)}{\sigma(x_i)}$ to see if they roughly follow a $N(0,1)$. On test data you again want to maximize the probability of your test data so you can use NLPD metric again.
