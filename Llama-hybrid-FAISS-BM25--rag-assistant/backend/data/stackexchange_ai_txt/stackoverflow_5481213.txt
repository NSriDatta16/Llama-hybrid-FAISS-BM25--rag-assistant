Well, the problem you are running into is there are no fragments to go back to. This is what you can do. 1: Check to see if the fragment exists in the backstack (by giving it a name) and then disable going back 2: When you first start you program, add a fragment to the backstack, like an initial state before its clicked. Even in this situation though, your still going to need to do a chck to see if there is anything left in the backstack to go back to.
