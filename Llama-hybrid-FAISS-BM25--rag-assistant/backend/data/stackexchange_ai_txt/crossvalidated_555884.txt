Should I scale my data before time series PCA?

I am doing PCA on 22 time series. All the series are log transformed and in their stationary form. The plot of all the input series is given below. My main aim is to forecast GDP. I noticed that performance drops when I scale them. I used python for PCA and it centers the data but doesn't scale. Based on the above summary statistics and based on the fact that the series are log transformed and in their stationary form, is it reasonable if I use covariance matrix (i.e. not scaling).
