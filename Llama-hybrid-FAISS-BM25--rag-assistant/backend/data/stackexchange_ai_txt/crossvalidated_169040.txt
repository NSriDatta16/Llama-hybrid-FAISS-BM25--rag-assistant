How should I test for autocorrelation in this time series context?

I have data sets in which different people estimate a certain quantity. They potentially can see the estimates of anyone who participated before them, but in practice they're only likely to look at the last few estimates that were made before them. For that reason I am expecting some autocorrelation. Here's an example in which 199 people (x-axis) made estimates mostly falling between 900 and 1300. There is little visual evidence of autocorrelation here, but autocorrelation does seem to be present in some of my other data sets. I'm interested to test for the level of autocorrelation and if it is high to examine the effects of reducing it, either by providing different instructions to the participants or by performing some statistical manipulation to the data. I'm familiar with testing for autocorrelation using the Durbin-Watson test in a regression context, but am not sure how to proceed here. Almost all google searches related to autocorrelation seem to relate to a regression context.
