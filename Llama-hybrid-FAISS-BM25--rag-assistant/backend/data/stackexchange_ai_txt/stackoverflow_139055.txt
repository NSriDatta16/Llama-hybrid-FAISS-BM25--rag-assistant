Subversive connectors not working with newest Ganymede update

I'm using Subversive plugin in Ganymede, but after today's update it stopped working - it just doesn't see any valid svn connectors (I've already been using 1.2.0 dev version of SVNKit, instead of a stable one, because Subversive / Ganymede could not handle it; now it can't handle even the dev one). Any ideas how to make it work? Are subversive guys releasing a new version of their plugin / connectors soon?
