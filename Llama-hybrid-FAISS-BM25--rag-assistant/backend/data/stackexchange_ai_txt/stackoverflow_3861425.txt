Differentiate table line from big letters

I'm doing some graphics processing and I have a logic where in I have a bitmap with edges and I disregard all table edges from the letters E.g. 0000000000 0111111110 0100000010 0102220010 0100200010 0100200010 0100000010 0111111110 0000000000 0 - background color 1 - ignored edges 2 - edges I need My logic is just simple, if a number of continuous pixels exceeds a certain threshold, e.g. 20pixels of continuous edges, it will consider it as a line and disregard it. My problem is that on big font size and letters such as H and T, it will definitely exceed the threshold. Please advise is there a better way or additional logic i need to implement in order to separate table lines from letters. [update] Additional consideration: Performance, this logic will be used during touch movement (dragging). It will be called a lot of times so it needs to be fast.
