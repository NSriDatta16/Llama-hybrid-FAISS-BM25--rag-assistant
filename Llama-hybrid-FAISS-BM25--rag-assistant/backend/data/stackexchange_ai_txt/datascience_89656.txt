Considerations to take into account when clustering

My idea is to use clustering to perform stock segmentation based on risk, building different risk levels that might adapt better to different kind of users. Hence I have computed different risk indicators as stock variance, VaR, loss probability and Sharpe Ratio. My final dataframe with SP&100 stocks looks like this: I am wondering if I do need to have some considerations regarding data preprocessing since this variables are highly correlated, all of them are computed by a formulae that uses variance or standar deviation and mean returns. I have been doing some research and found that I might need to perform data normalization and PCA analysis but I would like someone to explain me why in order to understand what I am doing and if I need to take any other considerations.
