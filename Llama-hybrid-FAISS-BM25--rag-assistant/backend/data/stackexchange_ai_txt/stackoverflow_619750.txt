The doc object might be of a type that implements members of IStorable explicitly, not adding them to the classes primary interface (i.e., they can only be called via the interface). Actually "casting" (using the (T) syntax) does not make any sense since C# handles upcasts (cast to parent type) automatically (unlike F# for instance).
