How to set max return result for many-to-one

I have a Product Class which has a one to many relationship to a Price class. So a product can have multiple prices. I need to query the db to get me 10 products which have Price.amount ICriteria criteria = session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Product)); criteria.SetFirstResult(pageNumber); criteria.SetMaxResults(numberOfItemInPage); criteria = criteria.CreateCriteria("PriceCollection"); criteria.Add(Restrictions.Le("Amount", new Decimal(2))); criteria.SetResultTransformer(CriteriaSpecification.DistinctRootEntity); Instead of getting 10 Product on the list, I'm getting less than that (i.e. 5). The reason being SetMaxResults(10) return me 10 Products but with duplicates. The duplicates are then removed by SetResultTransformer(DistinctRootEntity). Can anyone tell me any way for me to get 10 unique Products without increasing SetMaxResults()? I need to use pagenumber as some sort of indexing.
