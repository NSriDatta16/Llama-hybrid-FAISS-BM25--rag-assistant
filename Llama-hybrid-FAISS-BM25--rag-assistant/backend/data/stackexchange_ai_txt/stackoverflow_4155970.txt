Such a big subject. You could take a look at my iPad app, Thicket, or my Ripple software at morganpackard.com. In my experience, most of the academic approaches to dynamic music generation come up with stuff that sounds, well, academic. I think the more successful stuff is found on the fringes of the club/electronica world. Monolake is my hero in this respect. Very listenable stuff, very much computer-generated. My own music isn't bad either. Paul Lansky's "Alphabet Book" is a nice example of extremely listenable algorithmic music, especially considering that he's an academic guy.
