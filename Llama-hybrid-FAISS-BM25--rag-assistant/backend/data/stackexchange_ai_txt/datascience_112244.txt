How to avoid numerous Hyperparameter tuning in ML?

Suppose I have developed a dynamic system for forecasting the future of some specific stocks. As time passes, the train set will change dynamically. For a better understanding, consider this example: First Round: train set = [0 : 150] (The first 150 samples are in the training set) test set = [150 : 152] Second Round: train set = [1 : 151] test set = [151 : 153] Third Round: train set = [2 : 152] (152 is exclusive) test set = [152 : 154] and so on. For each round, I use a RandomSearchCV to tune hyperparameters of Random Forest to predict the returns of some stocks using specific features. I am focusing on tuning hyperparameters in this question. As I mentioned, I perform a Hyperparameter tuning in each round, which costs a lot of time! (specifically when the train set is enormous) So I'm seeking a way to avoid This hyperparameter tuning each round repeatedly. I'm interested to know, How scientists perform hyperparameter tuning (considering time-consuming process)? Shall I perform hyperparameter tuning just once and precisely before the first round?
