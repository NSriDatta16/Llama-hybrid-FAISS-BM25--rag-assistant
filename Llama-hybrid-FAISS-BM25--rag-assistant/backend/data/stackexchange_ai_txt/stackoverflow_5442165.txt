Also, if you want to know in real time if a change has taken place on one table, then i would suggest that you make a trigger on the master, and then you can insert data into a separate database that is replicated on its own. inside the trigger you can access another server even using a federated server. http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-federated-storage.html
