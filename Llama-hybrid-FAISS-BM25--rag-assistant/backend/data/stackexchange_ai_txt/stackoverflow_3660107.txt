The foreign key in a one-to-many relationship usually goes in the "many" table, pointing back to the "one" table. So it should be "approach 2". You don't say what the inverse relationships are. Can an application be owned by more than one customer? More than one organization? If yes, those are "many-to-many" relationships. In that case you have to add a join table between the two: CUSTOMER -------- CUSTOMER_APPLICATION ------------ APPLICATION (CUSTOMER_ID) (CUSTOMER_ID, APPLICATION_ID) (APPLICATION_ID)
