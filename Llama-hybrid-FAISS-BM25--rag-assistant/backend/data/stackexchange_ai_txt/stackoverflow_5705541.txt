forms/heredocs versus Ajax versus....? What are 'Best Practices' for interactive website development?

I am unsure about what to use to develop a site for the startup gang I'm working with. I'm tasked with getting the initial version of the site going. I am familiar with 2 ways to make a site interactive and responsive to asynchronous user interaction on the site: 1) Ajax 2) using heredoc and forms technique of calling back to the same PHP file to handle a user's interactions on a form, such as here: echo Enter stuff, okay go for it: _END; What is the most common-in-industry approach for dynamic website coding? Methinks that perhap neither Ajax nor the heredoc is still the #1 choice for site developers -- I need to make this code up-to-date because when we hire a paid developer to take over development we DON'T want the guy to tell us "you'd be better off if I re-write the site using 'X'. Right now I'm considering using Ajax and XAMPP. But I don't want the hotshot coder we eventually hire to say "Sure Ajax works, but this technique 'X' is the 'Best Practice' in the industry these days.' Trying to start our site's initial code base here with the current 'Best Practices' but I don't know what the best practices are...?
