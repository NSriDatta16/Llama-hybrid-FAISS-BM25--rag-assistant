Evaluating different methodologies for hypothesis testing

I have a campaign, with a target and holdout group, in which the target group is encouraged to make a purchase. I have the results from campaign - total revenue spent per member (for target & control) I want to be able to compare the average revenue per group and conclude if there is a statistically significant difference between the two Option 1 - Two sample t-test - to test if the two sample means are different (using green column) Option 2 - Per test group member, subtract 'avg control group revenue per member' (250+300+350)/3 ... test if the mean of resulting distribution (red column) is different from 0 (1 sample t-test with expected mean equal to 0) Are both methods comparable? If not, why so? EDIT Target 7200 Holdout 3600
