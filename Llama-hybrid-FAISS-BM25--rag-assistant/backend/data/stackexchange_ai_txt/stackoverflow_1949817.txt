I totally agree with GalacticJello, storing data outside of the regular sharepoint content database is at the moment (MOSS 2007) a complete and utter nightmare. MS provided a ExternalStorage provider baseclas for us to override, but there are major cons against using this: writing and using your own custom ExternalStorage provider implementation is doable, but very difficult ExternalStorage provider implementations only do just that, making sharepoint store stuff in a different location than the regular content db. This means that you would need to write your own code to keep the external storage and the list items in sync, and i'm not even mentioning workflows and versioning. last but not least (and IMHO the worst), creating and using a custom ExternalStorage provider is not web app or site collection targetable, it's usage is farm wide (and there are NO workarounds). So any site collection you create in that farm will have it's doc libs use the external storage provider.
