You are using the wrong model. You should not transform the x-variable, but log-transform the y-variable to fit an exponential model with lm . That's not possible within ggplot2. However, judging from your variable names, you have count data. A Poisson GLM seems a better choice then: library(ggplot2) mod I also see absolutely no good reason to make a barplot for this data. Points can depict the data much better. ggplot(data.df,aes(x=YR,y=count)) + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,75),breaks=c(10,20,30,40,50,60,70),expand=c(0,0)) + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1960,2018),breaks=c(1960,1965,1970, 1975,1980,1985,1990,1995, 2000,2005,2010,2015)) + geom_point() + geom_ribbon(data = pred.df, aes(ymin = countmin, ymax = countmax), alpha = 0.3) + geom_line(data = pred.df) + xlab(" ") + ylab("count") Note that you also have a time series and should check for autocorrelation of residuals (which appears to be rather pronounced) and use an appropriate model for time series instead. (Also check for over/underdispersion as part of the model diagnostics and change to a more appropriate GLM if necessary.). You should also study this answer .
