Should a bias neuron be connected to previous neurons?

I'm trying to add a bias neuron to my neural network that uses the backpropagation algorithm. I'm trying to figure out how I should go about this, should I treat the bias neuron as a regular neuron? which means it's connected to the neurons on the previous layer?
