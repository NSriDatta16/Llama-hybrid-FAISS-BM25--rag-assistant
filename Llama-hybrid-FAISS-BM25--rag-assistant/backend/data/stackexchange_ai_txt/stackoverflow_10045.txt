It's true that some of the talks out there are very rudimentary, unfortunately some times the bulk of your crowd may need that. I consider myself a novice in a lot of fields, but I've attend talks that I thought were beneath me and still people were asking very basic questions. Perhaps it would be worth having a bi-monthly user group, one week for entry level and one week for advanced. It doesn't necessarily have to mean twice the work if you can get someone to help you coordinate a lot of the work will overlap. On the other hand you might just need to feel out the members of the group and see what their average skill level is and play to that.
