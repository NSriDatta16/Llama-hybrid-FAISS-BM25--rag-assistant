Well, you could do inference with a small amount of data. We just have concepts like statistical power to tell us when our results would be reliable and when they would not be. In general, lots of data is needed in machine learning to overcome the variance in estimators/models. Trees, as an example, are incredibly high variance estimators. The only real way to combat that is to add more data since the variance shrinks proportional to $1/n$ .
