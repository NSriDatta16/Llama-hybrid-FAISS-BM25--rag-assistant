Number of nodes in hidden layers of neural network

I have a neural network with 3 hidden layers and I'm unsure about the number of hidden nodes for each layer. Should the number of hidden nodes stay constant between the hidden layers, e.g. 500 nodes for each layer, or should it decrease or decrease? Is there some rule about how to choose the number of nodes per hidden layer?
