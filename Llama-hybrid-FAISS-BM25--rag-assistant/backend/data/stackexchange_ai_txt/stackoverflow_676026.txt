The communication diagram can lack sequence and it behaves more like a mind map than an activity or sequence diagram. If communicating events is your goal a state chart does show interaction, but rather, well, state. A communication diagram has less on it than an activitystate diagram, though that is not bad either, similar in nature. You could just leverage UseCases and add keywords or label the uses edge/line. Not recommended if this will be maintained and be more than a pretty picture. (Image is slightly overloaded, you don't need the numbering and they don't have to be method calls) (source: agilemodeling.com ) http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/communicationDiagram.htm
