Web application on an iPhone - styling it to look like native iPhone app

I saw some web pages display diffrently on an iPod Touch (and iPhone) - they pretty much looked like the native iPhone apps. Think this can be done with styles and, optionally, rendering diffrent HTML on the server side, based on the user agent from request. So, how do I get this effect? And, also, is there any emulator of iPhone OS browser, so I could test my application before really launching it, to see if it even displays?
