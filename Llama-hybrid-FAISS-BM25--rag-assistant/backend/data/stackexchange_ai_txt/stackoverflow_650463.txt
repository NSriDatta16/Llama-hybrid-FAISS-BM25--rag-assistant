'Information Architect', like ' Architect ', has at least as many different meanings as there are organizations. In some organizations, it's a fancy-sounding title you may bestow on the intranet web master (and which might be justifiable if the intranet is seriously engineered for searching and navigating, with some nice ontologies and taxonomies thrown into the mix). In some organizations, an information architect might as well be called a data warehouse or business intelligence architect, being responsible for ensuring data quality and both usable and timely analysis of historical and current data. Star schemas , SQL databases, entity-relationship diagrams , business object modelling are among the artifacts that may be used and produced. In some organizations, information architects supplement the integration of inhouse and external systems by working towards uniform logical data models and integration schemas. XML schemas , business object modelling, data flow diagrams and business terminologies are among the artifacts dealt with. In some organizations, information architects work primarily or even exclusively with the business side of things, and ensure that everyone across the organization agrees on what we mean by things like 'customer', 'order', 'product', how we uniquely identify them, and what attributes they have and what taxonomical categorizations we may apply. Business object modelling and business terminologies are among the chief artifacts which may be processed. But most frequently, it's a mixture of all of these, and some more, depending on the individual. User interface design is just a small part of the whole scope of information architecture as practiced in many organizations.
