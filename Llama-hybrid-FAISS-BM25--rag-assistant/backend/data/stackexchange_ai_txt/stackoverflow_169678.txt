response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); No, No. No! The use of the pragma header to disabling client side caching is wrong, it's a request header and has zero effect on the response. http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/#PRAGMA http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.32 Also, setting Expires: 0 isn't correct, Expires should be a date, not a number of seconds, however this will work as an invalid http date is interpreted as "already expired" http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/#EXPIRES http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21
