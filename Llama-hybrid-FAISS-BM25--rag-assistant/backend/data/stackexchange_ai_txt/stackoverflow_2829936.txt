Can an input field have two labels?

Mary had a little form, and its fields where labeled just so. Whenever an error crept in, confusion it would sow. I've got a label for each input field... pretty standard affair. After validating the form, I'm displaying a helpful little paragraph at the top of the form detailing what information is missing or incorrect. Can I have two labels for the same input field? One in the form proper, and one in the validation reminder text? Is there any reason I shouldn't do this?
