The approach you are using assumes that the two input (supporting series the X's) have a purely contemporaneous effect. The general approach to forming a ARMAX MODEL (Transfer Function) is as follows. develop arima models for the predictors pre-whiten to identify the form of the TF Which test for lagged effect of one time series on another? 3) identify pulses,level shifts, seasonal pulses (the I's) and add to the model 4) identify any additional arima structure 5) identify any additional lag structures in X that may be needed. examine residuals to identify any additional structure.
