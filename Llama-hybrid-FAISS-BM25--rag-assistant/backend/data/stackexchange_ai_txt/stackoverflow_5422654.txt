Rails App with Multiple Namespaces

I'm getting started on a large Rails project that will consist of several independent areas including and admin area, front-end website, user area, and api. Would it be wise to create say, 3 namespaces for these sections (leaving the front-end website as the root)? There doesn't seem to be a general rule regarding namespaces and it seems like the right choice for organizational purposes since each area would require several controllers. In my past Rails projects I always namespace the admin, but in this case, are there any drawbacks to having multiple namespaces in the long run (in regards to routing / interacting with other namespaces)? Any advice would be much appreciated!
