Your thoughts on incorporating deterministic effects like hour-of-the-day ;day-of-the-week ; holidays (pre and post) etc are in the correct direction and is precisely what is needed . I would not separate the temperatures but rather use heating and cooling degree days as two predictors . One way I have seen this work is to approach it with a parent/child relationship i.e. daily/hourly. I just posted a response What is the frequency in my series and does it matter for my forecasting models (SARIMA)? that you might want to review as it focuses on multi-frequency analysis of time series data which is what you have.
