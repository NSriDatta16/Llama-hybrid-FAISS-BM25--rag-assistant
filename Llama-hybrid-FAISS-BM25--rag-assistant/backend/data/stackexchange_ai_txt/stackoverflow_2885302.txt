Getting a type for a template instantiation?

I have the following situation: I have a object of type MyClass , which has a method to cast itself to its base class. The class includes a typedef for its base class and a method to do the upcast. template class BaseClass; template class NoAccess; template class MyClass : public BaseClass > { private: typedef BaseClass > base; public: base &to_base(); }; I need to pass the result of a base call to a functor Operator : template class Operator { Operator(Y &x); }; Operator op(myobject.to_base()); Is there a easy way to fill the ??? provided that I do not want to use NoAccess?
