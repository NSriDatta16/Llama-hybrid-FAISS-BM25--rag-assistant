How to correctly transform seasonally (lagged) differenced long forecast?

I have problem to make proper inverse transformation of a seasonally differenced forecast. For example, I have the time series with the two periods period = c(19, 532) like this: set.seed(123) per This time series is obviously non-stationary (we need to do 2-times differentiation): ndiffs(diff(x_ts, lag = per)) [1] 1 Now, I want to make a forecast of length 532 (the larger period). I will do it by exponential smoothing from smooth package: library(smooth) es_x The forecast seems all right, isn't it? But, when I want to make inverse transformation of the whole long forecast, something goes bad... for_inv I am using the last two periods of original time series as initial values to inverse seasonal differentiation of level two. Please, what is wrong with my approach? I don't want to use ARIMA or other typical time series forecasting method, but some advanced regression methods like boosting. Differentiating the time series make sense with these methods. I read questions about inverse transformation of differenced ts, but no one issued long forecasts of seasonally differenced ts.
