If you mean for development/debugging purposes, then you might find the Windows Phone 7 Isolated Storage Explorer useful. If you mean at runtime, then no, you can't pre-deploy files to isolated storage as part of the installation, they would have to be part of the XAP or downloaded from a web service. If they're part of the XAP, then it really doesn't seem worth putting them into isolated storage, though :P
