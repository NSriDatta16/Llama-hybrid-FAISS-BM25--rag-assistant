There are actually several more methods and the choice often depends on whether you are most interested in looking for early differences, later differences or - as for the log-rank test & the Mantel-Haenszel test - give equal weight to all time points. To the question at hand. The log-rank test is in fact a form of the Mantel-Haenszel test applied to survival data. The Mantel-Haenszel test is usually used to test for independence in stratified contingency tables. If we try to apply the MH test to survival data, we can start by assuming that events at each failure time are independent. We then stratify by failure time. We use the MH methods for by making each failure time a strata. Not surprisingly they often give the same result. The exception occcurs when more than one event occurs simultaneously - multiple deaths at exactly the same time point. I can't remember how the treatment then differs. I think the log-rank test averages over the possible orderings of the tied failure times. So the log-rank test is the MH test for survival data and can deal with ties. I've never used the MH test for survival data.
