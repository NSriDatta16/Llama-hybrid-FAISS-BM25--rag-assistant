References for creating neuropsychological composite scores

I am a doctoral student in clinical neuropsychology, and am in the process of creating z-unit weighted composite scores based on a battery of ability tests (i.e., attention/executive functions composite = Z scores for Trails A&B, Stroop, Digit span, RBANS coding, Symbol search). The scores will be used in a regression model involving a sample of 48 individuals with dementia and 32 normal healthy controls. I am creating these scores using the recommendations on Jeromy Anglim's blog , but am looking for some additional solid references on the pros and cons of using composite scores. I would prefer to use factor analysis, however because I am working with a clinical sample (Alzheimer's disease) my sample size is too small. Can anyone recommend readings on the use and pros and cons of z weighted composite scores?
