How to estimate minimum sample size to achieve a certain confidence interval?

The title of this question is a bit general. Allow me to elaborate. Context I'm measuring a biological parameter ( BP ) of different subjects. For each subject, BP follows a normal distribution, with an unknown standard deviation The average and standard deviation is dependent on the subjects - some subjects might have larger or smaller variance. What I have I have a database from a previous study where I measured a couple hundred of subjects Each subject was measured at least 10 times Goal For a new study, I want to get a number of measurements N , required to achieve, at least, a 95 % confidence level that the real average of the subject is within the sample average $\bar{x} \pm \delta$ [units]. How can I achieve this? My thoughts: I could estimate one standard deviation value for each subject (based on 10+ measurements for each subject). Then, I could calculate the average of all the standard deviations $(\sigma_{avg})$ . I would use the average standard deviation to calculate N: $$ ( CI_{95\%} = \bar{x} \pm \delta \:, CI_{95\%} = \bar{x} \pm 1.96 \cdot {\sigma \over \sqrt{N}}) $$ $$ \implies \sqrt{N} = 1.96 \cdot {\sigma_{avg} \over \delta} $$ But I'm not sure about this logic, and specifically what is the validity and implications of averaging standard deviations.
