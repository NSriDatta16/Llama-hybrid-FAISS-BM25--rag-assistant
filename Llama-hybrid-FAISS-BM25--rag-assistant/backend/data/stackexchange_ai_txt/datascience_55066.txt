How to export PCA to use in another program

I'm trying to write a random forest classifier for a very large dataset, as such as part of the pre-processing i have applied PCA to reduce from 643 features to 5 PC's. Is it possible to export these settings so I can pca.transform(data) in another program. I have been able to do this to the the scaler using pickle but when i run the transfrom i get given the error: Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in pca.transform(data) TypeError: transform() missing 1 required positional argument: 'X'
