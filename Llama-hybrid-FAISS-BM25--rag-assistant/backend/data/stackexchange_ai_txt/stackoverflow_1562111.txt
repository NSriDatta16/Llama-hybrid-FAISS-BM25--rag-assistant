JNI Performance

Our main program is in java but the code that extracts our data from storage is written in C. I need to build an HDF5 file from extracted data. Would it be better to use JNI to call the C code to get the data and then build the HDF5 file from Java or to build the HDF5 from the C code? I have little experience with JNI or C. Also One of our main criteria is performance. How much of a performance hit is there when using JNI?
