Why does APA suggest to report the F statistic with an ANOVA result?

I probably view it too pragmatic but to me, the F statistic is merely a result of a calculation that is used to (magically) determine the value that I'm really interested in: the p. APA, though, wants the F reported along with the degrees of freedom (and the p). Why is knowing the F and the df relevant? Is this used as a short test whether my calculation was right? Or is there any information in the F value that I don't get?
