DevExpress XtraScheduler custom mapping

Is it possible to make some conversion while mapping? SchedulerStorage schedulerStorage = schedulerControl1.Storage; schedulerStorage.Appointments.Mappings.Start = "StartTime"; For example I want to add one hour to Appointment.Start, but I don't want to change "StartTime" property get{} of my business object.
