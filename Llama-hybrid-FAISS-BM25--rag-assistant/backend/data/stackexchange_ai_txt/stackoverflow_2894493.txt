I'll break the answer into two parts: for cases where you only organize code, you should use namespaces instead of classes -- if the inner class isn't an entity that is only worked with from inside the class (especially only constructed in the class), then inner classes are a good idea -- another example STL function objects. in C++ there is absolutely NO DIFFERENCE between structures and classes except that structures have public members by default. Hence there's no real difference when you have classes -- it's more a matter of style.
