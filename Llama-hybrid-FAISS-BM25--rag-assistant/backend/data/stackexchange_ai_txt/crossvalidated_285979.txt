Are 0-1 thresholds always equivalent to x-axis thresholds?

I am trying to understand a theoretical issue about the nature of thresholds in binary classification. In medical research, cut-off points are usually chosen along the possible values of the continuous output of a diagnostic test. In these cases, interpretation is quite straightforward; for each threshold, a point in the ROC plane can be plotted representing the associated sensitivity and (1-)specificity according to some gold standard. On the other hand, in machine learning research I often see these values as taken from a "score axis" that can either be unbounded or (more often), between 0 and 1 (which usually renders the probability of instance x to be of class 1). My question is: is it correct to say that each point of a ROC interpolated curve is associated with a "threshold input pattern" that, in turn, is associated with a threshold score? Would this be correct for any ML model for which drawing a ROC is appropriate (e.g., a SVM)?
