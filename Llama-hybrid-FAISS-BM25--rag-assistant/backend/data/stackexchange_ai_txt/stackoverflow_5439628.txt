You might want to compress revisions in delta form but you should still have the current revision in full for quick retrieval. However, older to newer deltas require lots of processing unless you have some non-delta to base on. Newer to older deltas require reprocessing every time something changes. So deltas usually do not get you many benefits but greater complexity. Last I checked, which is some years ago, MediaWiki , the software behind Wikipedia, stored full texts and provided some means to compress older revisions with gzip to save space and a dedicated table archive for deleted revisions / pages. Their website has an ER diagram of their database layout which you might find useful.
