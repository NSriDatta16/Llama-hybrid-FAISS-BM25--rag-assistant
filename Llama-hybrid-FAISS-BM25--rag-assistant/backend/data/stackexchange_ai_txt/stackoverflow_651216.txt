Using C# WinForms Designer on Panel instead of Form?

Warning: I'm new to GUI building in C# (come from a long history in Java with Swing and SWT.) Using VS2008, When I create a new class, and extend System.Windows.Forms.Form , the WinForms Designer works really nicely. However; when I create a new class and extend System.Windows.Forms.Panel , the designer does not work nearly as elegantly - it simply shows some kind of abstract, list-type view of the components contained in the Panel (as opposed to showing the actual layout of the Controls in the Panel.) Is there a way to get the Designer to work more nicely with a Panel? Or is there some workaround so that I can build a Form with the designer, and then use it as if it were only a Panel? What I'm really looking for is some UI 'element' I can build with the designer, and then dynamically (read: programmatically) add/remove that 'element' to a larger UI.
