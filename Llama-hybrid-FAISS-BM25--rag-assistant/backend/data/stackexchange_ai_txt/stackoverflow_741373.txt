The M-x compile command calls out to a shell (e.g. linux bash , windows cmd.exe , etc) to run the make command. On windows I think emacs defaults to the cmd.exe shell (through a special C:/Program Files/Emacs/emacs/bin/cmdproxy.exe executable). If you want your M-x compile to use a different shell (probably cygwin bash in your case) then you need to tell emacs through changing shell-file-name variable or using the SHELL environment variable. You will also need to make sure that the cygwin make is found by changing exec-path variable (or using PATH environment variable). To do this: (setq shell-file-name "C:/cygwin/bin/bash.exe") (setq exec-path (cons "C:/cygwin/bin" exec-path)) And you could also look at setup-cygwin.el to set this up and some other things for cygwin.
