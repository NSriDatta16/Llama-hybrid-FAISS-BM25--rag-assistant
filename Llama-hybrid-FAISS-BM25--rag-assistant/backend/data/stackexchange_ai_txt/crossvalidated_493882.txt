How to formulate a machine learning problem?

Virtually no books talk about how to formulate a ML problem, especially the process of creating the right label. Here I use an online hotel search portal as an example to explain my thought process and seek comments from readers. If we want to increase the overall click through rate(CTR) of the portal. Then we should try to build a model to accurately estimate the CTR for each hotel. Once we have the model, then we can sort hotels by predicted CTRs in a descending order. Since the hotels in the top positions of a search result will get more clicks, this approach in turn will increase the overall CTR of the portal.
