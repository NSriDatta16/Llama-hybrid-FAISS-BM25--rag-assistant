Usually it's most appropriate to leverage something that's already been written for this type of thing. e.g. FTP, SCP, rsync etc FTP supports resuming if the download broke, although not sure if it supports a resumed upload. Rsync is much better at this kind of thing. EDIT: It might be worth considering something that I'm not terribly familiar with but might be another option - bit-torrent? A further option is to roll your own client/server using a protocol library such as UDT which will give you better than TCP performance. See: http://udt.sourceforge.net/
