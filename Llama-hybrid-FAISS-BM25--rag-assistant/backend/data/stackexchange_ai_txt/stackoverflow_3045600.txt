Your memory limit is too low. Check your .htaccess file in the Magento directory and change the value of php_value memory_limit to bump it up a bit. If you don't see a line like this, add it to the bottom of the file. A value that's worked for me is: php_value memory_limit 128M Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
