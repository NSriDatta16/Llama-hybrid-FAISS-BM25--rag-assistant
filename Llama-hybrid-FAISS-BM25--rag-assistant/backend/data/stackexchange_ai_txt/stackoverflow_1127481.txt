NSInteger is simply a typedef for a primitive type ( int on 32-bit, long on 64-bit) â€” it is not an object, and can as such not be retained or copied. Class members are always pointers; you never pass the "real" objects around; as that would be, at best, unmanageable. Edit: To expand on the last paragraph: Objective-C class instances always exist on the heap, never on the stack; this is to facilitate things like reference counting and self-managed object life cycle. This also means that it's very hard to accidentally copy an object; but on the flip side it can be somewhat easier to accidentally dispose of an object you still need. Still, the latter is more readily debugged (as it causes a nice, big crash (at best, anyway)) than the last (which at worst causes a slow leak).
