How do autoencoders reconstruct images/color?

I am abit confused by how autoencoders are able to reconstruct colors in images. According to me a CNN has feature detectors that convert the image into a sequence of feature or activation maps. These activation map corrospond to the degree of presense of a structural feature. Then how is the color information preserved in autoencoders if it is not a structural feature? To me the color information gets lost very quickly but most visuals of autoencoders show they preserve color very well.
