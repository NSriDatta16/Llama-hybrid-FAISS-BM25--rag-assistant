Will there be a Log4J 2.0 release (and if so, when)?

It seems like v2 of Log4j has been in development for literally years. The Apache Log4J site no longer lists a roadmap, the dev mailing list seems almost entirely about 1.2 (which is appreciated!), use of v1.3 is discouraged, and the 2.0 branch is listed as "experimental". What's a believer to believe?
