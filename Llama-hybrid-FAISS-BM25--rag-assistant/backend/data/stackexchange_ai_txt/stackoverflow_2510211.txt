SNMP: ASN.1 MIB Definitions. Referencing a table within a table

Its's been a while since I've written ASN.1 so.. Our data model is comprised of several table definitions within a table. This is not workable in SNMP, so we need to flatten the definitions. The easiest way to do this would be to have the embedded table indexed by the same OID as the parent table. Thus someTableEntry ::= SEQUENCE { someTableIndex Integer32, someTableDomain Integer32, someTableFooTable SEQUENCE OF SomeTableFooTable } becomes someTableEntry ::= SEQUENCE { someTableIndex Integer32, someTableDomain Integer32, } someTableFooTable ::= SEQUENCE { someTableIndex Integer32, .... } The good thing is that in our application there will NEVER be any kind of SET, GET or GET NEXT so no need for SNMP walk (there are some very good reasons for this that supersede the need for network management elegance. All attributes will be reported via traps only. I think this is a valid SNMP MIB definitions but wanted to get some feedback. Thanks in advance.
