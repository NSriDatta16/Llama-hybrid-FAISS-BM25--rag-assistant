You don't state what you have server-side? Personally I favor option 2 for a couple of pragmatic reasons. Cross browser means supporting IE and IE only permits 2 outstanding requests to a server. I would avoid using both of them in this way it can lead to an apparent lock of the brower, not as severe as using synchronous requests but still quite bad. Often such requests are going to run serverside code which uses some kind of session, which in turn tends to limit the requests to processing in sequence anyway, hence the desired performance gains aren't realised. You need both results hence that requirement is creating a coupling between them, If you code one such that optionally chaining to another is part of its design with it knowing the specifically why that should be de-coupling enough.
