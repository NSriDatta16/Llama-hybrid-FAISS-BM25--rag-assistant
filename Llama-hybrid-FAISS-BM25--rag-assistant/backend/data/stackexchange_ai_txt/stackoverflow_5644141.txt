iPhone/Objective-C - Facebook Single Sign On

I have implemented single sign on functionality using Facebook's SDK in my iPhone application, however I'm just wondering how you go about detecting whether they've already authenticated and/or accepted permissions? I noticed that when checking for this the Facebook application always spawns and says you have already authenticated and you're always forced to click Okay, which is quite annoying every time they open the application. There's an iPhone application called Socialcam that only asks you once to accept the permissions and every time you open the application from that point onwards it knows that you've already been authenticated and never asks you again. I would like to do this as my application relies heavily on Facebook permissions. It uses their profile picture and checkin permissions (for example) throughout various different areas of my application. If I go about using the NSHTTPCookieStorage : NSLog(@"%@", [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookies]); It provides me this information. How would I go about using it to authenticate against the Facebook Graph API? ( " ", " ", " " ) Any help would be greatly appreciated.
