Vowpal Wabbit, a very fast machine learning program focused on online gradient descent learning, can be used with Hadoop: http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4198 Though, I've never used it this way. If I understand it correctly, it really only uses Hadoop for reliability and providing the data to the Vowpal Wabbit processes. It uses something like MPI's AllReduce to do most of the communication.
