SQL Server: String vs Binary?

I have a load of records to store in a SQL Server 2008 database. Each of the records has a SHA-1 hash. Obviously storing the SHA in String form will take up 80 bytes compared to 20 if stored as Bytes. When quering the database, which is SQL better at: Comparing Strings? Comparing Binary? I need help deciding how to store the hashes as it has a huge storage impact on the database. Thanks for any help.
