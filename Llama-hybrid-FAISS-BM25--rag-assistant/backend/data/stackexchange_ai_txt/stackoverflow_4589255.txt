How do I fix this alignment issue in jQuery & CSS?

The implementation is here: http://jsfiddle.net/JWaCY/1/ Look at the 'Forgot Pass?' link. When you press 'Register', it disappears and when you click 'Login' again, it comes back inline - which is where I want it to be. Right beside the 'Register' button. However, what's happening now is that because the button 'Send Reset Instructions' is right beside the 'Register' button with css display & visibility values of none and hidden respectively, on first load it is showing the space where this button would be. How do I allow it to be hidden fully, without the space being taken up and the 'Forgot Pass?' positioned right beside the 'Register' button on page load? I would rather a CSS solution. I know I can do this with jQuery by simply executing a $('#pass-reset').slideUp(); somewhere within my JS on the page load, but that shows the 'Forgot Pass?' literally moving from below the buttons to the right side - which is untidy. I would much rather a more elegant solution that just shows the Forgot Pass in the right place.
