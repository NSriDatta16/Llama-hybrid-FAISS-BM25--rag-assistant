You will learn about encapsulation of data and functions inside that class and also operator overloading ex : int i1 = 5 ; int i2 = 6 ; int i3 ; i3 = i1 + i2 ; //correct complex c1.setreal(3) ; //here you learn about member functions of the class complex c1.setimg(5) ; complex c2.setreal(6) ; complex c2.setimg(8) ; complex c3 ; c3 = c1 + c2 ;//wrong until you overload the operator +
