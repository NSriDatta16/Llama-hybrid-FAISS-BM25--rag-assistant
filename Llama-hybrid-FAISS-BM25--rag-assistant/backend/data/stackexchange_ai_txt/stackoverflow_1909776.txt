This is a pattern I use alot , works generally very well on all things relating to mousemove. The mouseup event is binded when the user clicks mousedown, this forces it to fire when the user lets go of the mouse button, no matter how much it's moved. $('#element').mousedown(function(e) { // You can record the starting position with var start_x = e.pageX; var start_y = e.pageY; $().mousemove(function(e) { // And you can get the distance moved by var offset_x = e.pageX - start_x; var offset_y = e.pageY - start_y; return false; }); $().one('mouseup', function() { alert("This will show after mousemove and mouse released."); $().unbind(); }); // Using return false prevents browser's default, // often unwanted mousemove actions (drag & drop) return false; });
