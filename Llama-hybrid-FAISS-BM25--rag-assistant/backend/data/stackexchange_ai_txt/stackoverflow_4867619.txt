When to use domain event vs double dispatch

I am confused with when to use domain events and when to use double dispatch. Udi encourages us to use domain events to maintain encapsulation of model and away from anemic design, but in my opinion domain events can only be used after the operation has been performed or ended abruptly, not at the time when the operation is in progress. For example: while solving some business logic I need to access the repository, and then based on the value, I can raise domain events. But the question is how the model can access repository at the time of solving business logic, here in my opinion we could use double dispatch . Please tell me, are the above statements are valid or not?
