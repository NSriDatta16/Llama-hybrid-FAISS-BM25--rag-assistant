You could use the undocumented Application.SaveAsText and Application.LoadFromText functions. SaveAsText works on modules, forms, and reports; and when you save a form or report as text, its module code will appear at the bottom of the resulting text file. You could write a routine that would save all of the non-data objects in your Access MDB (or ADP) as text, put it in a module, and just keep that module in a development version of your Access DB. Then you could run the routine and check in the dumped code in VSS. It's probably not as elegant as the Visual SourceSafe method described by Mitch Wheat, but that depends on what you want to do with the source code. I tend to hang onto multiple versions of MDB's, and use this method to compare source code between them using diff tools such as WinMerge. It's good for porting functionality between branches of development. It's also good for locating all references to fields or controls wherever they may be found. Viewing Access objects as textual definitions makes finding these references dead simple.
