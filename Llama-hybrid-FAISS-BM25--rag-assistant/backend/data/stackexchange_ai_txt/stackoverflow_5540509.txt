The only way I've been able to get this to work sofar is: Each report has 2 datasets. ReportData DataHeaders The "DataHeaders" need to have the proper name of the datafields in "ReportData". Be careful since SSRS replaces blanks and special characters with "_" Now, create a table (or matrix) and drag the DataHeaders as the Columns of your report. (This should be a grouped column). If you run it at this point, you'll see all your columns without any data. Now comes the magic: Create another report that takes a "DataField" parameter. Create another table or matrix within this report and set it's dataset property to be "ReportData". In the DATA cell for the table, set it to the expression =Fields(Parameters!DataField.Value).Value Now go back to your first report. Right click and insert a subreport. Right click on the subreport and select "Subreport Properties". Under general, select the second report you created to be used as the subreport. Under parameters, select the DataField parameter and set its value to something like =Fields!DataField.Value In my case I did some formatting in this expression to fix the above mentioned issue with spaces and special characters, since my stored procedure was initially used in ASP.NET and this was just a proof of concept. Also in my experience the performance isn't great. In fact it was kinda slow, though I haven't had a chance to switch it to use a shared dataset, which I suspect would help a bit. Please let me know if you find a better solution.
