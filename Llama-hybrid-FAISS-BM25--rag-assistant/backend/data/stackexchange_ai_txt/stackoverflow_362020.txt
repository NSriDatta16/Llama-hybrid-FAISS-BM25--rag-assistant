I think for defeating the kind of spam attack you mention, the important thing is not the learning method but rather what features you train on. I use Fidelis Assis's OSBF-Lua which is a very successful filter: it keeps winning contests for spam filters. It uses Bayesian learning but I think the real reason for its success is three principles: It trains not on single words but on sparse bigrams : a pair of words separated by 0 to 4 "don't care" words. The spammers have to put their message in somewhere and the sparse bigrams are very good at sussing them out. It even finds attachement spam! It does extra training on message headers, because these are hard for spammers to disguise. Example: a message that originates on your network and never passes through an off-network relay host is probably not spam. If the spam filter has low confidence about its classification, it requests input from a human. (In practice it adds a header field saying "please train me on this message"; the human can ignore the request.) This means that as the spammers evolve new techniques, your filter evolves to match. This combination of techniques is extremely effective. Disclaimer: I have worked with Fidelis on refactoring some of the software so that it can be used for other purposes such as classifying regular mail into groups or possibly one day trying to detect spam in blog comments and other places.
