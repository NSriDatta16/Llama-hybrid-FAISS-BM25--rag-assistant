I wouldn't think of this as a "small sample size" for PCA. The PCA example in Section 10.2.1 of An Introduction to Statistical Learning is for a data set with 50 items and only 3 continuous variables. The standard ways of performing PCA will have no inherent difficulty. The problem you face, as is typical of small data sets, is how well your results will generalize to new data samples. If you are only maintaining 1 to 3 components it seems unlikely that you will risk overfitting the data that you have from 50 cases, but there is always the risk that your particular data sample is itself unrepresentative.
