Sqlite is zero- configuration . Not zero-installation (whatever you think that should mean). on the sqlite homepage you can find many ways to bind from different languages I have had OK results with the cherry city driver, and the ODBC driver at http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/ is also good for classic asp integration. The users don't need to install the DLL, the serever urnning your ASP pages will however need to have it installed
