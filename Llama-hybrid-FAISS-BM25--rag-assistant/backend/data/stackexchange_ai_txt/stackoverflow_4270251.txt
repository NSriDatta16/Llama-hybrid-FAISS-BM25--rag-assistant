trigger a function to run when a carousel's page is changed in Sencha Touch

I'm not sure how many people on here have used the Sencha Touch js library, but I have a question that MUST be simple despite my many attempts and fails. Basically, I have a carousel which pages through results as you swipe, and I want to trigger a function each time a new page is shown. Anyone have any idea how to do this? I've tried adding a listener to it, and for some reason that doesn't work. Something like this: var apCarousel = new Ext.Carousel({ direction: 'horizontal', activeItem: 0, ui: 'dark', itemId : "apCarousel", items: pageItems, listeners : { click : { element : this, fn : function(){alert('yo!');} } } }); Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
