can jquery read the dom elements of external pages?

Is it possible to read and parse the dom elements of third party websites like cnn.com (for e.g) so that I can get the div, a, p tags and read the position and size information? jquery can parse and show information of the web page where your javascript code is running but if we provide an external web page to the .load command, can we parse the third party website page and read the DOM tree? Thank you
