Include jQuery document.ready() as an include file

Am I able to include as an include, an external jquery.dialog.js file that consists of the following? $(document).ready(function(){ $(function() { location.hash = 'PAGETOP'; }); $("#dialogou").dialog({ autoOpen: false, closeOnEscape: false, resizable: false, modal: true, draggable: true, position: ["center", 100], buttons: { 'Ok': function() { $(this).dialog("close"); closeReq(); } } }); }); and then pass this in using the script include notation: This doesn't seem to work for me.
