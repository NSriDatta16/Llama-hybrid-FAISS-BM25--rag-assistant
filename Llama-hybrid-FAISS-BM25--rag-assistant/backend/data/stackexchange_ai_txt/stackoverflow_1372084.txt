Follow your heart / Blink decisions. Asserts within a Setup method can document intent ; improver readability. So personally I'd back you up on this. It is different from a test calling other tests - which is bad. No test isolation. A test should not influence the outcome of another test. Although it is not a freq use-case, I sometimes use Asserts inside a Setup method so that I can know if test setup has not taken place as I intended it to; usually when I'm dealing with components that I didn't write myself. An Assertion failure which reads 'Setup failed!' in the errors tab - quickly helps me zone in on the setup code instead of having to look at a bunch of failed tests. A Setup failure usually should cause all tests in that fixture to fail - which is a smell that your nose should soon pickup. 'All tests failed usually implies Setup broke ' So assertions are not always needed. That said be pragmatic, look at your specific context and 'Add to taste.'
