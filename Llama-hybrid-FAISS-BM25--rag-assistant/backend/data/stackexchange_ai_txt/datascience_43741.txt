I had been in a similar situation. I started out with each and every algorithm here (and in great detail). However, I soon found out that the academia in machine/deep learning is moving real fast, and is always coming up with faster/state-of-the-art algorithms that go a long way to outdo traditional algorithms in many real-world applications. So, it is always preferable to be updated with the latest trends. I suggest (as I normally do myself) to grab a subscription of a good newsfeed (like Medium) or an amazing, cutting-edge research journal and follow it. Many times amazing algorithms come from research papers tackling a particular problem (probably similar to yours). The point is, to be a good data-scientist (or a ML engineer), you need a mix of both- depth and width. I personally find it useful to know a lot of algorithms on their surface (simply what they do, when are they used, pros and cons). I return to them when I feel ( only feel ) they might help me solve a particular problem. I read them in detail and see if they are a good fit. They might, or they might be not. But thinking about the details is essential to ensure you don't miss out on an amazing approach to your problem due to lack of insight into that approach. For instance, once I was working on something that required Object detection (very simple though). I read somewhere about R-CNN, Fast-CNN, YOLO. I immediately turned to them to see if they fit well. That day I knew them in more detail. Whether I should focus more on learning the intricacies of a few algorithms or should I use the approach of knowing a lot of them as and when and as much as required? Learning the intricacies is amazing. However, the world moves at a real fast pace. There might be a new algorithm that outdoes the one whom you learnt with great detail. It's time, hence, to flush out that use and see if the new one does you more good. Learn things when needed. And when needed, learn them in detail. You should be able to apply things if you feel they can probably work. And this insight comes from knowledge. Good luck.
