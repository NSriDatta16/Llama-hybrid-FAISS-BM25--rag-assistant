I think the following method needs to be changed: public static bool TryGetItemFromCache (this Cache cache, out T item) where T : class { item = cache.Get(typeof(T).Name) as T; return item != null; } If the item is not in the cache don't you want to put the item in the cache for later use or later retrieval. Thanks,
