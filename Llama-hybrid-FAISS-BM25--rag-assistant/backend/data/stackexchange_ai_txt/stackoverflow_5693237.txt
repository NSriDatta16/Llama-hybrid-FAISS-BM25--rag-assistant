php + mysql = selecting and displaying rows with different date

guys! I've never met with the selecting definite rows between dates and sorting them properly. Any help would be very useful to understand how should I organize the php + mysql script. I have a table that contains rows with date column in mktime() format. This table stores information of clicks to advertisement on my website. This is the structure of my clicks_log table: 1) ID - unique id of the row with auto increment. 2) DATE - date in mktime format when somebody clicked on the link. 3) IP - ip address of the visitor who clicked on the link. I want to select all information from the clicks_log table and display on the page like this: DATE: 15.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.1. DATE: 08:45, 15.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.2. DATE: 13:22, 15.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.3. DATE: 18:58, 15.04.2011 DATE: 16.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.1. DATE: 04:14, 16.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.2. DATE: 09:35, 16.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.3. DATE: 14:11, 16.04.2011 DATE: 17.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.1. DATE: 21:56, 17.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.2. DATE: 23:04, 17.04.2011 IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.3. DATE: 23:13, 17.04.2011
