I don't use R routinely and I have never used ggplot , but there is a simple story here, or so I guess. Time of day is manifestly a circular or periodic variable. In your data you have hours 0(1)23 which wrap around, so that 23 is followed by 0. However, ggplot does not know that, at least from the information you have given it. So far as it is concerned there could be values at -1, -2, etc. or at 24, 25, etc. and so some of the probability is presumably smoothed beyond the limits of the observed data, and indeed beyond the limits of the possible data. This will be happening for your main data too, but it is just not quite so noticeable. If you want kernel density estimates for such data, you need a routine smart enough to handle such periodic or circular variables properly. "Properly" means that the routine smooths on a circular space, recognising that 0 follows 23. In some ways the smoothing of such distributions is easier than the usual case, as there are no boundary problems (as there are no boundaries). Others should be able to advise on functions to use in R. This kind of data falls somewhere between periodic time series and circular statistics. The data presented have 99 observations. For that a histogram works quite well, although I can see that you might want to smooth it a little. (UPDATE) It's a matter of taste and judgement but I'd consider your smooth curve drastically oversmoothed. Here as a sample is a biweight density estimate. I used my own Stata program for circular data in degrees with the ad hoc conversion 15 * (hour + 0.5) but densities expressed per hour. This in contrast is a little undersmoothed, but you can tune your choices.
