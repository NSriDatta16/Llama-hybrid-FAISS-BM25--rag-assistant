This type of problem is not really suited to deep learning. Each node in the neural network expects numeric input, applies a linear transformation to it, followed by a non-linear transformation (the activation function), so your inputs need to be numeric. While your inputs are numbers, they are not being used numerically, as the inputs could be changed to letters or symbols. Also, your network looks like it is overfitting. It is very large for the number of inputs and so is probably just memorising the training data, which is why you appear to good results on your training data. Tensorflow has a tensorflow-datasets package (installed separately from the main TF package) which provides easy access to a range of datasets (see https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets for details). Maybe look here to find a suitable dataset to use.
