Looking for a testing pattern/approach capable of handling different platforms/versions

There is the 'code', it is being developed continuously. There is a testing server, this server uses 'test code' to test the 'code' in different platforms. My question involves the 'test code'. As I said, the server tests for different platforms. But for that to happen, the test code needs to be able to handle those different platforms. It is getting really hard to keep track of those little 'differences' that arise because of the usage of those different platforms. And it gets more complicated, because the platforms can have different versions and.. I have to test mixing of those interchangeably. Right now, I am doing something like: test1() if(platform == 'a' && version == '1.4') assert('bla',bla) else if(platform == 'a' && version == '1.5') assert('ble',bla) else if(version == '1.6') assert('blu',bla) ..... Now, imagine this but 100x more complicated, and you may see what I am dealing with right now. So I am asking if someone out there knows a pattern/approach to handle this more elegantly or robustly, even if it involves coding an architecture to support it. Thanks guys.
