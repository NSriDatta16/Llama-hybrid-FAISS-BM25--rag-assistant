SVM and concatenation of features

For example I train my SVM on 3 features set of different size: Training data size [rows cols]: features1 [nsamples 100] features2 [nsamples 50] features3 [nsamples 128] And for each feature set I get accuracy >0.5. I assume that combining features by concatenating them [nsamples 278] will give me better results then any of feature set separately. Is that assumption always true?
