The filter dimension replaces the channels in the convolutional layer: $3$ becomes $96$ it isn't lost. Each one of the pixels 96 in a specific location are computed as the weighted average of the $11\times11\times3$ pixels in the same region of the image. For more details on how exactly the convolution operation is computed I'd suggest reading this . It has numerical examples later on to see exactly what's computed.
