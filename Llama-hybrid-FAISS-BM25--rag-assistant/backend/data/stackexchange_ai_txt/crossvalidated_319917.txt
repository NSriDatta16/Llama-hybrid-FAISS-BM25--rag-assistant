Time series analysis using Stata: Twitter behaviour

Sorry, I'm quite new at Time series analysis. I'm trying to conduct a study on the Twitter behaviour of Donald Trump and how it affects his popularity rating. I have collected the data on his tweets, created dummy's for the themes of the tweets (e.g. Obama, China, tax reforms, immigrants, etc.), time of day, etc. My questions: Question 1. Does anyone know of a similar study done in Stata I can consult? Question 2. Using Stata, I have to do a regression analysis of this time series. However, I have some problems getting started. First of all with the selection of the model and which steps to do first. Would this be a valid order: A. Test for stationarity (unit root Test Dickey-Fuller) B. Test for cointegration, what test to use in Stata? (Johansen or Engle-Granger?) C. Choose model (any general step-by-step guide to choose one?) Question 3. The non uniformity of my data: the number of tweets vary each day. I thought of considering the different tweets like panel data. However, as some days have 7 tweets and some have only 1, it would look like I have a lot of observations missing. Can I give each observation (tweet) a code so Stata knows it is still from the same day? If these questions seem irrelevant or not well thought-through, it is because I'm really struggling to grasp what is important in order to conduct my study. I am lost in the abundance of theory on time series and Stata so any sense of direction would be much appreciated!
