Objective Bayesianism: Jeffreys priors vs reference priors vs principle of transformation groups

According to this answer , Jos√© Bernardo has produced an original theory of reference priors where he chooses the prior in order to maximise the information brought by the data by maximising the Kullback distance between prior and posterior. In the simplest cases with no nuisance parameters, the solution is Jeffreys' prior. In more complex problems, (a) a choice of the parameters of interest (or even a ranking of their order of interest) must be made; (b) the computation of the prior is fairly involved and requires a sequence of embedded compact sets to avoid improperness issues. My question is this: Is there a simple example where Bernardo's reference prior, the Jeffreys prior , and the principle of transformation groups (a generalization of the principle of indifference) all exist and all yield different results?
