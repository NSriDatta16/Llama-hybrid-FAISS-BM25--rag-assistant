In poisson distribution why does setting r = mean_value not output 50%?

If I want to find probability of 10 cars passing highway checkpoint in 60 seconds where on average 10 cars pass in 60 seconds. Assuming there is no rush hour I can use Poisson distribution So lambda = 10 and x = 10, outputting P(X=10) = 0.125 => 12.5% The answer is not intuitive since on average 10cars pass by in 60 seconds so shouldn't the formula output 50% when inputting x = 10? Am I missing something or doing something wrong?
