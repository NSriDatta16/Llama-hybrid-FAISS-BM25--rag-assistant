You can (and should) assess the quality of probabilistic predictions using a proper scoring rule . We have a scoring-rules tag, and there is a Wikipedia page . Note that most scoring rules are "negatively oriented", i.e., lower is better - but some people prefer the reverse orientation, by including (or removing) a minus sign. Apply a scoring rule, e.g., the logatithmic score, to both models' predictions, and average them. The model with the lower (or higher, see above) scoring rule does a better job.
