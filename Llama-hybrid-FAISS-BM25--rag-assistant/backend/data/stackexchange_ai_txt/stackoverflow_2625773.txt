Why not use development provisioning instead of ad hoc?

I was under the impression that when you use a development provisioning profile for a build of an app, only the specified developers can deploy that build to a phone. But I just deployed a build that uses a development profile to a phone using Xcode Organizer, even though I'm not one of the valid developers for that profile. One of my colleagues, who doesn't even have Xcode installed, did the same with his phone using iTunes. In that case, why not use a development provisioning profile for distributing your app to e.g. your QA team, instead of ad hoc distribution? EDIT: Please read the part in bold carefully before answering. I'm not asking a basic "how does this work" question. I've made a lot of development, ad hoc, and app store builds, and now I find that I seem to have made some wrong assumptions.
