I got this error when I finally upgraded things from 2.2.1 to the 4.0 SDK, and tried to use an existing project. I had to: Click on the project in XCode, then click on Info. Click 'Build' Pay attention to what 'Configuration' you are setting. Are you accidentally setting distribution when you are trying to debug? Set 'Base SDK' to the highest possible. Change 'Target Device Family' to whatever it is you are doing. Set 'iPhone OS Deployment Target' to your device's OS (you can check by going to Window > Organizer). My main time sink was setting my distribution settings when trying to debug and not realizing it.
