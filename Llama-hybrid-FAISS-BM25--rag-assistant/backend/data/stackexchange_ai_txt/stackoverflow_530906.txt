What are some economically important applications of machine learning?

Apologies in advance if this is too vague. My list so far: statistical arbitrage actuarial science manufacturing process control image processing (security, manufacturing, medical imaging) computational biology/drug design sabermetrics yield management operations research/logistics (I'll include business intelligence with this) marketing (preference prediction, survey design/analysis, online ad serving) computational linguistics (Google, information retrieval, ...) educational testing epidemiology criminology (fraud detection, counterterrorism, ...) consumer credit scoring spam detection bug finding, virus detection, computer security Are there any articles, books or journals that address this question? The only book I've seen is Supercrunchers, which focuses on consumer preferences an not much else.
