A Cox proportional hazards model with "exact" tie resolution, a.k.a a conditional logistic regression ... A standard logistic regression with one data point per subject-month, with time represented as a categorical variable A conditional logistic regression model and a standard binary regression model with the logistic function and with a categorical variable for time is the same thing. You end with a 36 different intercept terms, 1 intercept and 35 dummy coefficients or something similar depending on how you setup the dummy coding. It seems to me that I should expect these models all to output similar results. In general, when should I prefer one over the other? (Or are there other types of models that I'm missing?) It depends on what you want to achieve. If your goal is to say something about the proportional hazards between two observations or odds ratios then the dummy coding approach may be preferable as you make no assumptions about the intercept. You need though to check the assumption of the link function you use (e.g., is proportional hazard assumption justified in the Cox model). However, you cannot make prediction about the probability of survival in future periods in a model with 36 dummies as you have no model for the intercept in future periods. This is not the case with random effect model where you have a model for the intercept or parametric model for the intercept. Though, you need to justify your assumptions about the distribution of the random effects or the parametric model you have chosen. EDIT: I've preliminarily tried fitting some of them in R and have run into various random segfaults/stack-overflows ... You can also checkout the ddhazard function in my package dynamichazard . You can use it to fit a discrete time survival model with a random walk for the intercept and/or the coefficients.
