The fixed coefficients in GLMM are subject specific estimates, which mean the association between $X$ (the predictors) and $Y$ (the outcome, refer to the latent one in nonlinear models) holding constant the random effects, and it describes how an individual's mean of outcome depends on the predictors. You can find the clarification of subject specific and population average estimates here . The importance of fixed coefficients depends on your goal of analysis. The fixed effects are often the focus, unless you are interested in the individual trajectories (random effects) or the scale (variance) of the random effects. The significance here (mostly based on $z$-test) has the same meaning as that in other tests, which means that you can reject the null hypothesis that fixed coefficient $\beta=0$.
