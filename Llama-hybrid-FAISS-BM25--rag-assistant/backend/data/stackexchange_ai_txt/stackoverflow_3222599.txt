From unmanaged code? TBH, the best suggestion I have is either "use P/Invoke", or "figure out what it is meant to do, and re-implement it". Even if you can find something to port the unmanaged code, and even if it works - it isn't exactly going to leverage the framework. And it isn't exactly 1:1 between unmanaged and managed.
