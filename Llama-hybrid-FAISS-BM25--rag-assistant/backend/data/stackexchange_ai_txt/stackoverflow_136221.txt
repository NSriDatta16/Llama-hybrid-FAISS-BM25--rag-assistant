You could create some utility extension methods to make it more 'elegant' :) public static RichTextBox Set(this RichTextBox rtb, Font font, string text) { rtb.Text = text; rtb.SelectAll(); rtb.SelectionFont = font; rtb.SelectionIndent = 12; return rtb; } And call like this: someRtb.Set(yourFont, "The Text").AndThenYouCanAddMoreAndCHainThem(); Edit: I see now that you are not even displaying it. Hrm, interesting, sorry i wasnt of much help with providing a Non Rtb way.
