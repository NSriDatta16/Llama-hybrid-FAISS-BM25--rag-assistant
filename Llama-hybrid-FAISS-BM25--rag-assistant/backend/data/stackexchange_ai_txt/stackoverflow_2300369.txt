That jar apparently has lots of dependencies, make sure you have all of them on CLASSPATH when you start Clojure. Also make sure you aren't mixing versions. I skipped the download link for gdata-finance-2.0.jar that you have up there, and instead downloaded http://gdata-java-client.googlecode.com/files/gdata-src.java-1.26.0.java.zip from the project page you linked, which came with a ton of jar files in gdata/java/lib , one of which was the finance jar. So I unzipped everything and did this: $ java -cp /path/to/clojure.jar:gdata/java/lib/* clojure.main Clojure 1.2.0-master-SNAPSHOT user=> (import '(com.google.gdata.client.finance FinanceService)) com.google.gdata.client.finance.FinanceService This apparently worked. But now FinanceService$Versions doesn't exist. It doesn't exist in FinanceService.java either. It's probably a different version of the library than what you are using, would be my guess. If you're getting NoClassDefFound , be sure you're paying attention to what class it isn't finding. FinanceService might be missing, but it might also be complaining that one of its dependencies is missing.
