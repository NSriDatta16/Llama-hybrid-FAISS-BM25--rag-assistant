Is each of the PCA or PLS components just one of the original variables?

I am confused about what a component is in PCA and PLS. Are the components just the original variables but not necessarily in the same order? For example, in PCA, if I had 8 variables in my data, would PC1 correspond to one of the 8 variables? And in PLSR (PLS regression), if I were to use 4 components, does this mean that I will be using 4 out of 8 variables to build a model?
