How to test for Pearson correlation when one variable is arbitratily fixed for number of cases?

I have 4 groups of different respondents, each group surveyed on four different dates (points of time). All respondents have answered a psychological questionnaire related to their perception of death (Perception of Death Questionnaire, PDQ). I also have a sample of popular newspapers that have circulated on and before those four points of time. I built a death-presentation index (DPI) from the information gathered from the newspapers (text mining). This index was computed for each time the participants were surveyed, namely 4 times. Each participant had his own PDQ level. He also had one of 4 DPI index values that matched the day he took part in the experiment. I want to test whether PDQ and DPI are correlated with each-other. My current insight into the problem follows : One case = one date I can average all answers to PDQ given at each day, and get 4-cases sample with columns PDQ and DPI. AFAIK I can't use classical correlation significance even if I had more than 4 of days: effectively my sample will be time series, where cases are not mutually independent. Calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient will be OK, but for testing its significance I will need a different set of statistical tests (like VECM). One case = one participant I could treat the sample as it is - as a sample of respondents. Each respondent has day of participation, and so I can pair it with the associated value of DPI. Then I can calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient. Since I have the same number of respondents for each group, I believe that the correlation coefficient will have exactly the same value as in "One case = one date" case. But can I test for it significance?? My guts tell me, that from the same reasons as above, I cannot. But the more I think about it, the less I know why exactly. Please, help ;-)
