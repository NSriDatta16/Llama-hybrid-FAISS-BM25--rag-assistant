Neural Networks for Predictive typing

I don't have a background in neural networks. But, various studies has been proved that neural networks (feed forward / Recurrent) outperformed n-gram language modeling for predicting words in a sequence. But, in an application to text messaging or any text-based conversation, where the language which is most likely used will be more informal or colloquial. Can still a neural networks perform well than n-gram LM? Considering the data to be fed are the text messages (colloquial phrases). If so, please enlighten me, thanks.
