When you omit interactions, you are fitting the wrong model, you so should not expect the estimated coefficients to line up with the data they are meant to represent. The treatment coefficient is estimated assuming it is constant across groups. What you get is a weighted average of the group-specific coefficients, though, to my knowledge, it is not known how that weighted average is computed for nonlinear models. To reproduce the observed means, you would need to fully saturate the model by including the interactions between treatment and group. In a more complex scenario, you can either include interactions between treatment and all covariates or use another method of estimating marginal effects, like propensity score weighting, if you wanted to arrive at a single average treatment effect.
