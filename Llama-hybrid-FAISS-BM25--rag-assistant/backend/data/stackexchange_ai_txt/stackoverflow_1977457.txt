SQLite doesn't allow remote "connections" as far as I know, it only supports being invoked as an in-process library. However, you could try to use MySQL which, while heavier, supports remote connections and does have in-memory tables. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/memory-storage-engine.html
