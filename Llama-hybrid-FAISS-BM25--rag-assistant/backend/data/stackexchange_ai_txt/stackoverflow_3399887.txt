The only question I have: do you really need a set ? If the data is already sorted and you don't need to insert / delete elements after the creation, a deque would be better: you'll have the same big-O complexity using a binary search for retrieval you'll get less memory overhead... and better cache locality On binary_search : I suspect you need more than a ForwardIterator for a binary search, guess this site is off again :(
