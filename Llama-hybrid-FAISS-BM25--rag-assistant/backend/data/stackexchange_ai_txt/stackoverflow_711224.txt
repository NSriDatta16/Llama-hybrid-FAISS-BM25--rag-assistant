The execfile function is similar to the exec statement. If you look at the documentation for exec you'll see the following paragraph that explains the behavior. As a side effect, an implementation may insert additional keys into the dictionaries given besides those corresponding to variable names set by the executed code. For example, the current implementation may add a reference to the dictionary of the built-in module __builtin__ under the key __builtins__ (!). Edit: I now see that my answer applies to one possible interpretation of the question title. My answer does not apply to the actual question asked.
