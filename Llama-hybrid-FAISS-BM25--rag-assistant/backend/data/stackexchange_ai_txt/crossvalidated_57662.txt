spss 20 for mac: how to get probabilities after running a binary logistic regression

I have a binary variable that I'm investigating in SPSS, inclination_to_dance . I have another linear variable as well, no_of_beers . In SPSS, via the Analyze menu, I'm able to run a binary logistic regression against these two that gives me some kind of output that tells me whether the impact of drinking on dancing is significant, as well as its coefficient. What I really want to know, though, is what the effect of drinking one additional beer will have on the probability that one will dance. Is there a way to investigate that probability in SPSS?
