Darin's answer is right, but doesn't work in Firefox. If you want to steal focus back in Firefox too, you have to delay it until after the event: Or, better, assigned from JavaScript: var element= document.getElementById('foo'); element.focus(); element.onblur= function() { setTimeout(function() { element.focus(); }, 0); }; But, I would strongly advise you not to do this . Clicking outside a text box to remove focus from that text box is perfectly normal browser behaviour, which can be of legitimate use (eg. to set search point for ctrl-F, or start a drag-selection, etc). There's very unlikely to be a good reason to mess with this expected behaviour.
