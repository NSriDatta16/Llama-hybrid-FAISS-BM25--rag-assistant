How to characterize a problem of standardizing product descriptions

I'm looking for some advice for where to start on this problem. Let's say I have sales transaction data from a number of different retailers that all sell the same products. Even though they are selling the same products they all identify them a little bit differently. For example for one particular product one retailer calls it "Kellogs Corn Flakes 20oz." and another calls it "Kel CF, 20". And there are other representations for the 100's of other retailers. The problem to solve is how to map each of the different products to a standard set of product descriptions so that the data can be aggregated. Assume that I have some group of retailers already mapped manually. I've been going over in my head where to start with this. Is it a search problem where I consider the search query is the retailer's representation and the standard description is the "document" to find? Or is it a classification problem in that I'm trying to classify each description into a standard product description category? Or can named entity recognition play into it somehow. Any advice you could provide to get me started would be much appreciated. I've been looking at tools like Apache Lucene, Solr and OpenNLP but it's just not clear to me how to characterize the problem.
