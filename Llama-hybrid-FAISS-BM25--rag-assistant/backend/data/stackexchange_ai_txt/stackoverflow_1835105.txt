Font linking in the registry

A few years back, I created a WinForms application that has been successfully deployed. The next version of the application must support Chinese and Korean characters. For aesthetic reasons, my client wanted all the text in the application displayed with the Arial font family. However, Arial doesn't support Chinese and Korean characters. On most platforms, the Windows Uniscribe Font Fallback mechanism adequately chooses a font to display the East Asian characters. But on English Windows XP, the font it picks is terrible. I've been looking at resolving this problem with Font Linking . This would allow me to specify which font should be used when Arial can't display a character. This seems like a very elegant solution. The problem is that the article I linked to says that adding font links through the registry is not officially supported. Also, changing the font links in the registry would impact the whole computer and not just my application. Does anyone have experience with added font links? Did it work? What are the situations that are going to bit me later?
