Theoretical backing for VIF

I'm giving a lecture in machine learning class covering linear regression, and wanted to briefly touch up on the idea of multicollinearity since I come from a more traditional stats background. I was wondering if there are any papers providing a theoretical backing for the VIF ,rather than simply being a heuristic method.
