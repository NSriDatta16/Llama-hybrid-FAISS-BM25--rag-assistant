What is $\bar\mu_n$?

Am I right in thinking that it is the average of the sum of $n$ different populations means? Here it is used in the context that confused me. It's the Chebychev WLLN, apparently. "If $x_i, i = 1, . . ., n$ is a sample of $n$ observations such that $E[x_i] = \mu_i Is this saying that each sample of $i$, corresponds to it's own population of $i$ (from above, $E[x_i] = \mu_i$) and as the sample get bigger we have to average over populations? So if I were to draw the random variable 1 from a population of {1,2,3} and the random variable 4 from the population {4,5,6} then the population of my sample 1,4 is {1,2,3,4,5,6}?
