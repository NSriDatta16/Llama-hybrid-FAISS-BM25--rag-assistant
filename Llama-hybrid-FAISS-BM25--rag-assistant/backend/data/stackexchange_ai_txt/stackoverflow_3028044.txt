How about this one? i-net Clear Reports (used to be called i-net Crystal-Clear) has a powerful ad-hoc reporting component that is made to be an easy-to-use thing for non-technical users. Your users won't have to know anything about reporting at all. They simply select the kind of report, the data et voila there is a report suiting the needs. The data abstraction can be done easily by creating so called data-views which can be designed by e.g. your administration. There are various ways to access the ad hoc reporting GUI. We have a web GUI, a Java Applet or a standalone Java program. The end users will not need any training since the GUI is highly intuitive. The views can easily be build by drag and drop in addition to setting datatypes, formats and so on. All reports (depending on security settings) can be accessed via DAV our a report repository gui. The server supports different security settings on a per user or per group basis. The standalone report designer is free and fully functional. Disclosure: Yep. I work for the company who built this.
