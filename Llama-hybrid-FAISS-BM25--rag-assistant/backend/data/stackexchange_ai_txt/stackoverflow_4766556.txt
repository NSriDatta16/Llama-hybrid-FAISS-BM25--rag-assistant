Repeat Python function call on exception?

Hey everybody I'm working on a data scraping project and I'm looking for a clean way to repeat a function call if an exception is raised. Pseudo-code: try: myfunc(x) except myError: ###try to call myfunc(x) again Y number of times, until success(no exceptions raised) otherwise raise myError2 I realize this isn't best practice at all but I'm working through a number of different code/network layers that aren't reliable and I can't realistically debug them. Right now I'm accomplishing this with a huge set of try\except blocks and it's making my eyes bleed. Elegant ideas anyone?
