It is a common practice to report a correlation table of constructs with AVE (average variance extracted) on the diagonal. You should be able to directly get the information from your software package. It is not necessary to report means and SDs for constructs since, strictly speaking, you cannot directly observe them. If you want, you can report means and SDs for individual items.
