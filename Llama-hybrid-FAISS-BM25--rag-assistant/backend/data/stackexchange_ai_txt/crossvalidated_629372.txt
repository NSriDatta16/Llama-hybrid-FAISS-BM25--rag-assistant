Do predictors in logistic regression need to be stationary?

For linear regression with time series predictors, it is widely accepted that both dependent and independent variables must be stationary. The reason is that we need to assume that the errors are normal with constant variance so that we can make inference about the coefficients. That leads to $Y - a - bX$ being stationary, and therefore either $X$ and $Y$ are stationary or they are co-integrated. Now for logistic regression with time series predictors, there is no condition on the variance of the error (nor that it has to be normal). So the argument that is valid for linear regression is no longer applicable for logistic regression. Do we still need the independent variable(s) to be stationary (or co-integrated) in a logistic regression? And why?
