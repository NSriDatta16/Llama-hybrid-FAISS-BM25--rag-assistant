I ended up finding the answer here . Here's an excerpt from that page that answers my exact question: If you're using API Level 7 or lower, use getExternalStorageDirectory() , to open a File representing the root of the external storage. You should then write your data in the following directory: /Android/data/ /files/ The is your Java-style package name, such as " com.example.android.app ". If the user's device is running API Level 8 or greater and they uninstall your application, this directory and all its contents will be deleted.
