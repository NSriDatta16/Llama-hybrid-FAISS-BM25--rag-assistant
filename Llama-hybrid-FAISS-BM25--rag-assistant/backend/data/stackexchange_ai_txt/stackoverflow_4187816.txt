Move all sharepoint 2007 databases to a new Sql Server

In our organization we have a Microsoft Sharepoint 2007 installed and configured on a Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition (32 bit). The database had been installed and configured on a Sql Server 2000 (Windows 2000 Server 32 bit). Now we are in the process to move all the databases from the Sql Server 2000 to a new Windows 2008 Server R2 Enterprise (64bit). The new server has been already installed and doesn't have the same name of the Sql Server 2000. We would like to upgrade all the Sharepoint 2007 database to the RDBMS so that we can dismiss the old, slow Sql server 2000. Has anyone tried to do something similar?
