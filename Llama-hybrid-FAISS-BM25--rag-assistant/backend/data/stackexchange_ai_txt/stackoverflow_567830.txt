jQuery Flexigrid Resize columns in IE7 broken

In firefox, column resizing works fine. But in ie7, it's broken. Here's a thread about flexigrid broken from jquery 1.3, I've tried the suggested edits to the flexigrid code, didnt work. We're currently using jquery 1.3, although i've tried 1.3.1 & 1.3.2, neither fixed the problem. While inspecting the css in ie7, I noticed (the div that contains the styles for dragging columns) was way to the right of my grid. Has anyone experienced anything similar?
