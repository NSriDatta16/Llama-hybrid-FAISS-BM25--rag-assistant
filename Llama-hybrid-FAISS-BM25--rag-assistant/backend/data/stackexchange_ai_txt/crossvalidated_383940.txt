Yes. R uses treatment contrasts for categorical (factor) variables by default, which means that in this case the answer is the same as if used your numeric dummy variables in the first place. (In the model matrix $X$ R includes an intercept column [all ones], followed by one or more dummy variables for each level of the categorical variable after the first; in this case the dummy variable for Gender="female" the same as your original 0/1 variable.) If you look at the equation for the linear predictor ( $\eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1$ , where $\beta_0$ is the intercept and $x_1$ is your gender variable), you'll see that the value of $\eta$ (i.e., predicted log-odds of death) is $\beta_0$ for male ( $x_1=0$ ) individuals, i.e. the probability is $g^{-1}(-0.33)$ = 0.42 (this is the plogis() function in R). For female ( $x_1=1$ ) the predicted log-odds is $\beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot 1 = -0.56$ . If you add a numerical predictor for age your equation would be $\beta_0 + \beta_1 I(\textrm{Gender}=\textrm{female}) + \beta_2 \cdot \textrm{age}$ , so the intercept would now represent the log-odds of death for a male of age zero . (Since that value might be hard to interpret, it's often recommended that you center your age variable so that the predictor variable is zero when the age is equal to the mean age; this makes the intercept the log-odds of death for a male of average age ...)
