javascript and a DHTML affect

It's been a while since I worked with JavaScript - after my cert I began learning Perl and have worked with it ever since. I am just trying to get my hand back in and for a start with JS, I have written this what I would have said, was a simple, little script to change a border of a div quite simply. I cannot work out however, just where I'm going wrong. Appreciated of any advice/suggestion or ideas. TY in advance. Here's my script.. var i =0; var e = document.getElementById("text"); e.style.border = "solid black 5px"; e.style.padding = "5px"; var colors = ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green"]; function changeBorder() { e.border = colors[i]; i++; var timer = setTimeout("changeBorder()", 1000); } window.onload=function() { changeBorder(); } Hello world I am Mike!.
