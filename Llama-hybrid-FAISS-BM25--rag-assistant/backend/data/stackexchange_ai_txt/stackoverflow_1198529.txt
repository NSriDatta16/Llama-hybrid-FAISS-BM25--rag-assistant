There's a saying I once heard: "The trouble with getting a new hammer is, everything starts to look like a nail" This question appears to be asking for solutions, with little concern to what the problems actually are. Far too frequently people adopt favourite patterns, and apply them religously whether or not they are the best tool for the job. If you want to start on design patterns though, I'd suggest by reading one of the many books on the subject such as the classic Gang Of Four book "Design Patterns" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides , ISBN-13 978-0201633610 or for a more C# flavour, try "C# 3.0 Design Patterns" by Judith Bishop , ISBN-13 978-0596527730.
