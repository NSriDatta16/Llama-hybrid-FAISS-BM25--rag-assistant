I don't believe there's anything in-box to support this, but in C#, you can pass an array of objects directly to any method taking params -marked array parameters, such as String.Format() . Other than that, I don't believe there's some way for C# & the .NET Framework to know that string X was built from magic format string Y and undo the merge. Therefore, the only thing I can think of is that you could format your code thusly: object[] parts = {"strager", 2}; string s = String.Format(formatString, parts); // Later on use parts, converting each member .ToString() foreach (object p in parts) { Console.WriteLine(p.ToString()); } Not ideal, and probably not quite what you're looking for, but I think it's the only way.
