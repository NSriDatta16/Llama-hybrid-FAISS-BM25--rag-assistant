Sampling without replacement

In the context of statistical inference and machine learning, bootstrapping is used to indicate sampling with replacement (e.g. in the context of Random Forest or calculating population standard deviation etc.) Is there a word for sampling without replacement? Dropout is used specifically for neural networks for neurons, but is there a single word for the general procedure of taking samples without replacement?
