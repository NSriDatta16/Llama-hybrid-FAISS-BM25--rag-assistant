About organisation of an asp mvc application

I'm starting a new web application that will be made of multiple parts or modules. My client want to be able to redistribute the application with a subset of modules to some other clients. I read about Areas in mvc2 which seems to be what i'm looking at. I would also like to develop those modules in side projects and have the right one build according to clients specifications. Can someone with more experience than me with mvc can confirm that this is possible with areas. thanks mateo
