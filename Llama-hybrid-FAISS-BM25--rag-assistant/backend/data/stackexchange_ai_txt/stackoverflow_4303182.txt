You can assign form fields to an array, instead of numbering them, this will give you far more flexibility when accessing their values: i.e. Then simply do: print_r($_POST['meterage']); Or access the $_POST['meterage'] array as required (i.e. loop through for action on each value). If you then want to loop through the fieldsets, for related products/meterages, you could us: $number_of_products=count($_POST['prodcode']); for ( $i=0; $i "; }
