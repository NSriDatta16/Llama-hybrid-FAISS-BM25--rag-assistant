If you have a model for you measurement error (e.g. you can assume a distribution/family of distributions for $\nu$), you can build a fully Bayesian model, that will give you the exact answer - such models are now feasible for reasonably sized datasets (I think the limit is around $N StataStan interface in your case). Fully Bayesian in this context just means that you specify the full process that you think generates your data - if you can simulate your data, you can write a Stan model. As a bonus, you also get estimates for $x^*$. Take a look at the "Measurement error" section in the Stan manual for more guidance. The R package brms (built on top of Stan) supports normally distributed measurement error out of the box, for other types of error, you would have to write your own model (you can however use the code generated by brms as a start). If you want to stay in the classical statistics, you have to assume $\nu$ is normally distributed. This answer has some clues, and I think there are other ways, but cannot find them now.
