The dataset which was extracted from the database consists of more than 50 columns You can call them Features . Feature Set is something that you operate on. Obviously, I have to do dimension reduction on them. But since PCA like algorithms often does axis rotating to generate some new axises. I don't think I will PCA algorithm in dimensions reduction. I am not sure if you understand PCA completely. PCA does not generate new random axis, but an axis, that represents the MOST variance of your data. So, PCA will surely perform dimension reduction given that data has some values which don't add info to your model. You can call this Feature Extraction or Feature Filtering The reason I don't use PCA like algorithms is because I want to implement Neural Network classification, and I need the real parameters. What makes you think, post PCA you don't have ' real ' parameters. It's just a different view of the same data.(Imagine these axes as eyes, and your data as the object, you just have a different view of the same object.) The only problem I see is the axes on which the components are projected are orthogonal, which if you want to avoid, you can go ahead with ICA (Independent Component Analysis)
