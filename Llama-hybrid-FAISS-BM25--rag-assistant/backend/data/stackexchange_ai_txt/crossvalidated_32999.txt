Optimal Cluster Preserving Embedding of Nonmetric Proximity Data should fit your case. The paper shows how you can obtain a metric vector representation of your objects given only a matrix of pairwise dissimilarity function such that the cluster assignments will be preserved for a range of clustering algorithms, including $k$-means. In your case, what you basically need to do is: Have your dissimilarity matrix $D$ with zero self-dissimilarity. In case it is not symmetric already, symmetrize by averaging $D_{ij}$ and $D_{ji}$. center it (i.e. subtract row and column mean) to obtain $D^c$ Calculate $S^c = -\frac{1}{2}D^c$ Perform a spectral shift: Subtract the $S^c$'s smallest eigenvalue from $S^c$'s spectrum to ensure it becomes positive-semidefinite. Do this to obtain $\tilde S^c$. Calculate the eigenvector decomposition of $\tilde S^c = V \Lambda V^\top$. Restore a vector representation in a $n-1$-dimensional metric space of your data: $X = V\Lambda^{1/2}$. This assumes that $n$ is not too large. If it is, additionally doing PCAwill give you a more meaningful representation of the data. (The paper describes how to do this, too).
