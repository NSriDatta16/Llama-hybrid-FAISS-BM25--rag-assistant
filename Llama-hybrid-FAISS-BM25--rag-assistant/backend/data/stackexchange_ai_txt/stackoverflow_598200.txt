How do I fix Postgres so it will start after an abrupt shutdown?

Due to a sudden power outage, the Postgres server running on my local machine shut down abruptly. After rebooting, I tried to restart Postgres and I get this error: $ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data restart pg_ctl: PID file "/usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid" does not exist Is server running? starting server anyway server starting $:/usr/local/pgsql/data$ LOG: database system shutdown was interrupted at 2009-02-28 21:06:16 LOG: checkpoint record is at 2/8FD6F8D0 LOG: redo record is at 2/8FD6F8D0; undo record is at 0/0; shutdown FALSE LOG: next transaction ID: 0/1888104; next OID: 1711752 LOG: next MultiXactId: 2; next MultiXactOffset: 3 LOG: database system was not properly shut down; automatic recovery in progress LOG: redo starts at 2/8FD6F918 LOG: record with zero length at 2/8FFD94A8 LOG: redo done at 2/8FFD9480 LOG: could not fsync segment 0 of relation 1663/1707047/1707304: No such file or directory FATAL: storage sync failed on magnetic disk: No such file or directory LOG: startup process (PID 5465) exited with exit code 1 LOG: aborting startup due to startup process failure There is no postmaster.pid file in the data directory. What possibly could be the reason for this sort of behavior and of course what is the way out?
