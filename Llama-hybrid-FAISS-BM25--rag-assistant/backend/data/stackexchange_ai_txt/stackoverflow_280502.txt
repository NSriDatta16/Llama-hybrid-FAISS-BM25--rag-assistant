You could set the score to be the average of the player's best 10 games from the last 30 (or some other numbers - maybe just the last 10 would suit you). Players who haven't played 10 games yet could take the average of the games they have played, but then weight it towards 0, to compensate for the fact that the average of n Or work out what the global average score per game is (perhaps 0), and add (10-n) fake scores of that amount when calculating the score for a player with fewer than 10 games.
