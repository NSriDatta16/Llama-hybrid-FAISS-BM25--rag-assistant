Why to calculate $\mathbf{weighted}$ average of the leaf node impurities in decision trees? Why not to just add entropies up without weights?

In decision trees why do we calculate weighted average of entropies of each leaf when we calculate the entropy of target variable given some feature? The question is: "Why is it weighted average ? Why not to just add up entropies?" What bad could happen if we just added up all the entropies without multiplying them by weights? I know that it's done because of different sizes of leaves, but don't understand how that weighted average is supposed to help. Why would we want to use weights? When we use weights we implicitly make big leaves' entropies more important when deciding what feature to use. But why would we want such behavior?
