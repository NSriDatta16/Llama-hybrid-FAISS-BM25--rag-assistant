A confusion matrix can be drawn for a classification problem, where the Machine Learning Model (in your case LSTM) predicts the target variable into one of the N classes. Can you confirm that your problem is a Classification problem and not a Regression one? If in case you have a regression problem, then you might want to use a different evaluation metric.
