Android multi touch and double tap working together for an imageview

Hi I have two imageviews in a LinearLayout(Vertical orientation). I am setting setOnTouchListener for both the Imageviews. This way i am able to observe the Multi touch zoom as well as all the dragging of the ImageViews. The problem comes when i try to implement OnDoubletapListener. OnDoubleTapListener works only without the use of setOnTouchListener. However if i comment the setOnTouchListner then i am able to perform Double Tap.. Can't the two feartures work simultaneously????? If You want i can provide the source code as well.. Pl Help Ankit Verma
