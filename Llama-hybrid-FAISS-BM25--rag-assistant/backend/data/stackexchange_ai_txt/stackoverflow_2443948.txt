how to highlight text on hover

By highlight I mean the thing you do to text when you drag your mouse over it. If you use imgur.com then you know what I want. I can't find anything about this anywhere, it's frustrating. help? Edit: Okay, I thought I made this clear enough but I guess not. I don't mean I want to change the background color on hover. That's trivial. But you know when you have text on a page, and you click on the text and drag the mouse, or you hit ctrl+A, so that the background color changes and you can then Copy the text? You know, highlighting? Selecting? I don't want it to look like that's happening by changing the background-color, I want it to actually happen. Upload an image on imgur.com and you'll see what I mean. Notice how, when you hover on any of the links to your uploaded image, the text is selected - you're able to Copy it. This is why it was so hard to find anything about this. All I get are results for how to change the background color.
