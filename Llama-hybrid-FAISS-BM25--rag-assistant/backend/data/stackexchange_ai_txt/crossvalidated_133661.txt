LIBSVM: output of svm-predict is all 0 even though I'm using the test data which was used for training

I'm using libsvm to perform binary classification. I used easy.py for training which is included in libsvm library. After running easy.py, it showed the following in stdout. Cross validation... Best c=8192.0, g=8.0 CV rate=93.3155 Training... Output model: parameters.data.model The svm model file is generated, and the accuracy looks good. So I used svm-predict (executable file) to see if the generated SVM really classifies data. Here, the test data I used is exactly the same as the one I used for the training. However all test data is classified as label 0. and the accuracy shown is really low. The command I executed is something like following. python easy.py parameters.data # model and scale files are generated ./svm-predict parameters.data parameters.data.model svmpredict_output.log # svmpredict_output.log is all 0 Am I doing something wrong?
