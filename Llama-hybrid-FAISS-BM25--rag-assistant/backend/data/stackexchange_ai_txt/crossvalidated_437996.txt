Convolution layer convolves its inputs with kernels. In simple 2D case, each kernel has shape (kernel_width, kernel_height, n_inputs) , and convolution produces a feature map that represents how strongly the kernel responds to the inputs. For each kernel in the convolution layer one feature map gets generated. If you have 128 features in a hidden layer and you pass this into a convolution layer with 64 kernels, output will have 64 features. Usual architecture of convolutional autoencoders and image segmentation networks performs first encoding, where spatial resolution decreases and number of features increases—aggregating local information from pixels to global information about the whole image—followed by decoding where this process is reversed.
