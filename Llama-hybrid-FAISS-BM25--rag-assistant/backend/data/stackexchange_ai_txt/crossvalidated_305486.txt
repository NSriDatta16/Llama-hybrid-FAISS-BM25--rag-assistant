You probably want a sparse PCA. The SVD algorithm that underlies PCA is $O(N M^2)$, which means that, while the matrix for your problem will just about fit in the memory of a standard PC, performing an SVD on it will take a very long time -- at least hours, more likely days. Theoretically, you pretty much always want the "real" PCA, but for large problems time and space constraints will make that impractical. When it becomes impractical, you choose one of the sparse, online, or pseudo algorithms meant to approximate it.
