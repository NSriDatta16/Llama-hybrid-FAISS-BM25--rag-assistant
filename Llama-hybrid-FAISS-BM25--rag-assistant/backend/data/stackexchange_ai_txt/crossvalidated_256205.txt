There is no know derivation of the variance of $d_{av}$. In fact, this is not how one should compute the $d$ value for a within-subjects design (neither with $d_{rm}$ or the $d_{av}$). There are two approaches for computing a $d$ value for a within-subjects design. The first uses change score standardization and is given by $$d_c = \frac{M_d}{SD_d},$$ where $M_d$ is the mean change and $SD_d$ is the SD of the change scores (which is equal to $SD_d = \sqrt{SD_1^2 + SD_2^2 - 2 \times r \times SD_1SD_2}$). The large-sample variance of $d_c$ is $$Var[d_c] = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{d_c^2}{2 \times n}.$$ The second approach uses raw score standardization . Here, we standardize based on the SD of either the pre- or the post-test scores (typically, the SD of the pre-test scores is used). So, we compute $$d_r = \frac{M_d}{SD_1}.$$ The large-sample variance of $d_r$ is $$Var[d_r] = \frac{2(1-r)}{n} + \frac{d_r^2}{2 \times n}.$$ We do not take the average of $SD_1$ and $SD_2$ in the second approach (and if anything, we would compute $\sqrt{(SD_1^2 + SD_2^2)/2}$ but again we also do not do that). If you would do this, then it becomes nearly impossible to derive the variance, because $SD_1^2 + SD_2^2$ does not follow a (scaled) $\chi^2$ distribution, since the pre- and post-test scores are not independent. If you look at the answer given here (which is about the independent samples case), you will see that the derivation of the variance involves the non-central t-distribution, which is also involved in deriving the two variance equations above. However, to get that non-central t, you need (the square-root of) a (scaled) $\chi^2$ distribution in the denominator.
