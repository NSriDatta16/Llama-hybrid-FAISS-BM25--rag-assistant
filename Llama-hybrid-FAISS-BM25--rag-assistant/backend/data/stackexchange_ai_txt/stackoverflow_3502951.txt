you're going to have to do some reorganization of your resources and use namespacing where you can. if you have a method named saySomething defined twice, you would move one of them to an object (whichever suits your needs better). var myNS = new (function() { this.saySomething = function() { alert('hello!'); }; })(); and the other defintion can be moved into a different object or even left alone. function saySomething() { alert('derp!'); } you can now call the saySomething method like saySomething(); // derp! myNS.saySomething(); // hello! edit: since it was brought up in comments, this var myNS = { saySomething: function() { alert('hello!'); } }; is equivalent to the first code block, in simpler form (if i'm remembering correctly).
