The answer to this severely depends on what you mean by 'noisy' data. Are the labels noisy i.e. wrong? Or are the features noisy? Or both? If only the features are noisy, definitely use the noisy data and probably also the clean data. If only the labels, definitely do not use the noisy data. If both, is it possible to correct the labels? At the very least, can you get a reliable test set (representative with correct labels)? You could try training on both the noisy and clean data and see which gives better performance. Important methods to consider here would be regularization and early stopping. It also depends on what algorithm you are using. Linear regression, for example, is unlikely to over-fit, while neural networks are extremely sensitive to noise, and there are a variety of approaches in between those two extremes.
