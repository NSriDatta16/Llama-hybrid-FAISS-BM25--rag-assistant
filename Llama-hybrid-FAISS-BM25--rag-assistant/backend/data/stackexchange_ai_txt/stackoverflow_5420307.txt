I'm having issues with applying De Morgan's Law ... Feedback?

Every time one of these questions comes up in my assignments I get it wrong...can anyone help me understand? Or is the teacher's key off? (There is no way for me to know as I'm not given the correct answer, it only lets me know that mine is wrong.) Assume x = 7 and y = 5 . Applying De Morgan's Law, select the logical expression below that is equivalent to the following logical expression: !(x>5)||!(y>7) (a) !(x>5)&&!(y>7) (b) !((x>5)||(y>7)) (c) !(x>5)&&(y>7) (d) (x>5)||!(y>7) (e) None of the above I would select B as the answer, but since I have gotten them all wrong so far I'm afraid to continue without some help. The way I understand this it that you can consolidate the two ! into one by putting it in front of the whole statement, changing: !(a)||!(b) to !((a)||(b))
