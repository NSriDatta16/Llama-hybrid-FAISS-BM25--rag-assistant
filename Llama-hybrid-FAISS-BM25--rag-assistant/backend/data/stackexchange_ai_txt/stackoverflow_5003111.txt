i guess i would use the method scrollViewWillBeginDragging found in the UIScrollViewDelegate and inside i could control if user is going horizontally or not... scrollViewWillBeginDragging: Tells the delegate when the scroll view is about to start scrolling the content. - (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView Parameters scrollView The scroll-view object that is about to scroll the content view. Discussion The delegate might not receive this message until dragging has occurred over a small distance. Availability Available in iOS 2.0 and later.
