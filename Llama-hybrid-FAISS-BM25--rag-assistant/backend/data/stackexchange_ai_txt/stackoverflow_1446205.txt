A tip of the day is just a Windows Form and a simple list or database. You may store the tips in a SQL Server compact edition database, an Access database or whatever you like. It needs just one table, a tip per row. Then use a form with a textbox and provide controls to navigate through the rows of the table. That's all. You may, of course, configure it to display at random. Anyway, provide controls so the user may disable it if he likes. There are not any more hassle to do the tip of the day form, it is really easy to build and because this is that there aren't too much tip of the day components. It's easier to build it yourself, then you're on the control of functionality and appeareance, at your own taste. It maybe would take less than 20 minutes to do it, or maybe you already have do it while you were reading this paragraph. Regards.
