I'm not entirely what you intend to use this for, but the complete set of databases used by NCBI are at their FTP site: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/ If you're only interested in the database names, just look at the bit before the first . -- most of the databases are large enough to be segmented. In order to do a good chunk of the filtering (e.g by organism), they use alias files that restrict one or more of these larger databases by GI number.
