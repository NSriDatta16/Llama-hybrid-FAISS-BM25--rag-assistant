Scaling regression coefficients Take 2: Gelman (2008) approach

I am asking a follow-up question about interpreting regression coefficients that have been scaled following Gelman's (2008, 2009) recommendations. Original recommendation to divide continuous predictor by 2 SD. http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/standardizing7.pdf II) Updated recommendation (2009): divide continuous predictor by 1 SD AND re-code binary input values from (0,1) to (-1,+1)). Updated recommendation (1 SD, recode binary): http://andrewgelman.com/2009/06/09/standardization/ When comparing a dichotomous and a continuous predictor within a binary logistic regression, I am unclear on proper interpretation of the "SCALED" coefficients (1) Logit coefficient (2) Odds ratio (coefficients) Example of coefficients for a binary logistic regression model Binary IV: Logit=1.08, OR=2.96, p=0.002 Continuous IV: Logit=0.32, OR=1.37, p=0.008 Binary IV has been recoded to take -1, +1 Continuous IV has been rescaled by dividing the variable by 1 SD Binary DV has not been recoded QUESTION: What is the optimal format of the scaled regression coefficient (Logit, OR, probability?)? Could someone offer an appropriate interpretation of the above values? Is it acceptable to conclude that the binary predictor variable shows a "stronger" association with the DV than does the continuous variable?
