Coverage analysis for Functional Tests

In the project that I am working on, we have functional tests written over Selenium. The application undergoes functional changes with each feature release. Is there a tool / mechanism that we can keep track of the gaps in automated functional tests, so that at least the manual testers can keep an eye for these areas? Note: we are not doing FTDD, so the functional test coverage can be quite poor, even though we ensure high unit test coverage. We use NCover to check unit test coverage.
