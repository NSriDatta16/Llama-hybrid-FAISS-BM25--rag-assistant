Why over/under-sampling could not help my model fitting?

I fit random forest to my imbalanced dataset with minority class 1. I found that the AUC under the imbalanced data was better than that of re-sampled dataset (over/under sampling). Can someone help to put forward some theoretical explanation to justify this observation or please help to point out the underlying problem which caused this spurious output?
