TSQL Sweepstakes Script

I need to run a sweepstakes script to get X amount of winners from a customers table. Each customer has N participations. The table looks like this CUSTOMER-A 5 CUSTOMER-B 8 CUSTOMER-C 1 I can always script to have CUSTOMER-A,B and C inserted 5, 8 and 1 times respectively in a temp table and then select randomly using order by newid() but would like to know if there's a more elegant way to address this.
