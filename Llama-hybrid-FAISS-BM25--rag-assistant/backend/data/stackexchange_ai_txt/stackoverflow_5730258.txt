Your linker (part of the compiler) cannot find where ArrayIntStorage::sortOwn() is defined. This usually occurs either: The definition of ArrayIntStorage::sortOwn() is in another .c file which you forgot to tell the compiler about (and so wasn't compiled), ArrayIntStorage is a header only library (so there is no other .c file), in which case you probably have forgotten to implement the function sortOwn() , and have only declaired it. ArrayIntStorage is an external library which has not been linked. (as Tomalak Geretkal Notes, and is solved by following the steps set out by paxdiablo) If its neither of these, or you find these options confusing, please post the header file ArrayIntStorage.h and the corresponding .c file (should there be one).
