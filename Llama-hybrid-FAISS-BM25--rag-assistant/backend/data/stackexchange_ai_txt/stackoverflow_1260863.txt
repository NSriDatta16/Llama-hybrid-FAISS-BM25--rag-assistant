In general, session variables are going to be a lot more secure in the fact that the user cannot edit them locally on his/her machine. But the real question begs, what are you looking to store? With a bit more information we might be able to give you a better answer as to where you would want to store it :) Edit: If you are looking to store user actions, I might recommend building a UserActions table or something along those lines. A table that contains the following: id INT (generic ID for the record), timestamp TIMESTAMP/DATETIME (whatever your DB supports), userid INT (lookup to the user table), action VARCHAR (what action you want to record), etc etc (whatever else you want to store) Then when a user performs an action you want to record, just log it into the table itself, instead of making it travel along with the user in a session/cookie. Really the page itself doesn't need to know what actions the user has performed in the past, unless its a "multi-step wizard" type application. In that case, it probably would be best to pass them as a session variable. Then you are pushing the storage into a true storage component (being the database) instead of session/cookie as storage. I mean we still don't really have an idea of exactly what you are developing, but I hope it helps.
