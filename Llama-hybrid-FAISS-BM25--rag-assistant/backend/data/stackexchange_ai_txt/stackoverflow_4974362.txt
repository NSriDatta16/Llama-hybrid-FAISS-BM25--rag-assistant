we (@work) have started a research project with University of Padua (italy - course of Software Engineering) aimed to obtain a web page generator. It's a WYSIWYG and you can Drag and drop widgets from toolbar into canvas :) unfortunately, the UI is in Italian but the code is very good. It's an open source project and you can take a look @ the source. The technologies that have been used are: HTML5 ( to easily represent shapes and easily zoom-in/out) javascript/jQuery Php (backend script to save/load templates) references: http://sketchyoursite.sourceforge.net/ (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sketchyoursite/) Edit: another tool that could be helpful is https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/ About starting from scratch, I suggest you to use the following architecture/technologies: HTML+css obv for the basic layout (widget toolbar, canvas area...) Tons of JS to represent each different object. I.e. you could map a particular widget with a pure JS object that could have some properties. These props are rendered when you click the object inside the canvas area. When you want to drag an object inside the area, resize it etc you should use a js lib (personally, I prefer mootools , also coz it simplifies OO through the Class system). Server side scripts (Php, ruby, java...) to save (XML, Json..DB?) and load.
