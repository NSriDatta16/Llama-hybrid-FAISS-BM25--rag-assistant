Per the comment on the original post, here is the code I wrote to test the function. The fast version only takes a few seconds on my average workstation. It is fully sequential, and has no parallel code. It's moderately long, so I posted it on another site: http://pastebin.com/Rjj8EzCA I'm suspecting that the slowdown you are seeing is in the rendering code.
