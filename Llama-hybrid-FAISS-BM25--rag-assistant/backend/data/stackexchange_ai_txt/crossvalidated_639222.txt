What modeling approach should i use AR, MA, ARMA?

those are my ACF and PACF plots for my time series after two differentiating. I watched a couple of tutorials but I cannot figure out what method I am supposed to use. Also, an interpretation of the plots would be nice. Using diff() is the only approach not working out for me. I also used decompose(), and tslm(). I am not trying to obtain the best model but rather try many and compare them to each other while learning some stuff along the way. The data that I am using is located here https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CP0960PLM086NEST My training model from which the plots are is from 2010 up to 2020 Thank you for the help!
