InnoDB restore database is very slow

I have Mysql installed version 5.1.49-1ubuntu8.1 (with default InnoDB without any modification) When using InnoDB, the mysqldump and read performance is comparable to MyISAM, but restore database is very slow. When trying to install Drupal on blank database also take too long Other than default-storage-engine = innodb , Is there anything I need to do before use InnoDB?
