This depends on your classifier. Any method that assigns weights to each class and then use a decision rule could be modified to your method. For instance, a random forest typically uses majority voting. Say you have one with 1000 decision trees. You could modify the method so as to use majority vote only if one of your classes is predicted by at least, say, 600 decision trees, otherwise output "Unknown" if the vote counts are too close, i.e. both are between 400 and 600.
