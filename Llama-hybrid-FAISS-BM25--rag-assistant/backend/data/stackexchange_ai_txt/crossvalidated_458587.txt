Approximate the mean area of 2D Voronoi cell

Consider a random uniform distribution of $N$ points in $2D$ space bounded by $[0, 1]$ in both dimensions. Example: If I want to estimate the mean area of their Voronoi cells, I have to obtain the Voronoi diagram for this distribution, calculate the areas associated to each point, and finally obtain their mean. This is a time-consuming process. Given that this is a random uniform distribution of points, I thought I could just approximate this area with: $$\hat{A}\approx\frac{1}{N}$$ i.e., the total area of the $2D$ space ( $1*1=1$ ) divided by the number of points ( $N$ ). I wrote some code to test this approximation, the results are as shown: where the $y$ axis is the relative difference $100 * (\hat{A_{V}}-\hat{A})/\hat{A_{V}}$ ( $\hat{A_{V}}$ is the real area), and $N$ is the number of points. This shows that $\hat{A}$ underestimates the real value $\hat{A_{V}}$ by ~30% for small $N$ , and tends to zero as it grows. Is there a better approximation (particularly for mall $N$ values)? Add After whuber's comment I re-checked my code. I was using a somewhat convoluted method involving nearest neighbors to assign areas to unbounded points (close to the edges of the frame). I changed it to instead assign to these points the $1/N$ average area, and the results improved considerably (as expected). Here are the results: Now it shows that the $1/N$ approximated area underestimates the "true" mean area (which actually depends on the technique used to handle unbounded points) for small $N$ but quickly goes to zero as $N$ grows.
