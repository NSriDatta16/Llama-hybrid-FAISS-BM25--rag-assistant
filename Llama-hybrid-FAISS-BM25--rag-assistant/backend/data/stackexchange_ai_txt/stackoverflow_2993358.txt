If you want the result set to be ordered in a specific way, use ORDER BY . If you want the query to be accessed using a specific index, you may want to use an INDEX table hint , but they are strongly discouraged. In your particular example, accessing a very large accesslog table that is clustered by an IDENTITY to query all rows for a particular UserId is the last thing you want. You want to have an index by UserId and you want the query to use that index. As a side note, access log tables clustered by an IDENTITY are usually not a good choice, because the typical access is by time range (accesses between t1 and t2) or by other attribute (by userId, like in your example, or by machineId, or similar). None of these is ever satisfied by a clustered index on an IDENTITY column.
