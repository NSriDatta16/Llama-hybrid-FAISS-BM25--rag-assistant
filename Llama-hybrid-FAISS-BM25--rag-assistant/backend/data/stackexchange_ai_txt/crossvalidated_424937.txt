Linearity assumption of logistic regression

Do I have to check linearity assumption of logistic regression (Log odds of outcome with continuous variable) using graph of predicted logodds (by logistic regression) and continuous variable Or using graph with real logodds and continuous variable ? I think the latter is right In univariate setting, the first one should be perfect linear. Is it right?
