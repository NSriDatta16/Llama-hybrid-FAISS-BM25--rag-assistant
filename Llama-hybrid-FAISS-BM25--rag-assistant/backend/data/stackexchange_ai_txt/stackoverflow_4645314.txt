You can put the JAR in your local repository using the install-file goal of the maven-install-plugin and reference it as you normally would in your POM. The command would be: mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/jnlp-api-1.5.0.jar -DgroupId= -DartifactId= -Dversion=1.5.0 -Dpackaging= Place this command in a script and check it into your SCM. That way, you (and anyone else working on this project) can install it easily to the local repo.
