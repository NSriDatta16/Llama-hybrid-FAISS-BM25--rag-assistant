Multicolinearity ONLY raises the variance of the coefficient estimates?

A hypothetical conversation: Person A : I am building a forecasting model. It is a logistic regression. All coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level. I calculated the VIF for the set of predictors in the multiple regression model. I am concerned about multicollinearity. Person B : Because all your coefficients are statistically significant, multicollinearity is not a concern. The ONLY effect of multicollinearity is to raise the variances of the coefficient estimates, and thus lower the t-statistics, potentially leading to some coefficients not being statistically significant. So if your coefficients are statistically significant, you can totally ignore the VIF value and cross off multicollinearity as of no concern. Is Person B correct?
