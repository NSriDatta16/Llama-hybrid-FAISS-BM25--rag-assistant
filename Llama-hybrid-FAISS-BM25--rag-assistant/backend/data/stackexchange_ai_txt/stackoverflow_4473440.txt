Seems to me that the most difficult bit is to look for the proper words in the proper location in the line with regexps, so, although not elegant, could this be a more managable way to do it with minimum regexp? : Extract all the known words and their variations (road types, direction, numbers, ...) from the address line and, hopefuly, we would be left with the road name. Compose the address line back, but in the order we need (road name + road type + direction). Once you get rid of the position, the posible theoretical variations are still large but the predictable variations shouldn't be that large ?, even accounting for spelling mistakes: Avenue: Avenu, Avene, Aveniu, Avn, Av, Avn. Road: Rd, Roud, Roade, Roud?
