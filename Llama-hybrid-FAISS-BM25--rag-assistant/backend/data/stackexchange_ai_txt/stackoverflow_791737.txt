Why are secure programs so difficult to develop (for me)?

Community Wiki Question Every time I work on a project involving passwords or securing data I get mired down into obscenely complex APIs and issues. I have not had much formal training in developing secure applications but I have not had much formal training in database, GUI, and build processes either. Many other areas of programming feel more intuitive. Is security just a far more complex area than many others? I tend to think that it is not. Are security infterfaces and systems less mature than others? I would tend to think that there is a great deal of pressure for those systems to mature. On UNIX the 'trusted environment' was the norm until somewhere in the 90s. Is UNIX just suffering from its roots in this area? Technology changes fast. Since I have been in school the computing world has become far more distributed and critical. Has security been dragged along for the ride as an afterthough? Are any new technologies promising? Are you suffering the same way I am?
