I would like to become a moderator due to the fact that I'm very socially active as well as great patience. Working for a organisation that demands patience as a key skill, over the years I have become very good at listening to all parties arguments and deciding not the facts that are in front of me, I am not the type to be socially persuaded into a decision. I believe in myself that my listening skills are good in comparison to many other members of stack overflow members. Some details about myself: Name: Robert Pitt Age: 22 Some Skills: Programming, Networking, Infrastructure, Problem Solving, Team Management Interests: Computer Science, Programming, Latest Technologies, Sports, Pint in the pub, Enjoying Life, Socialising. A short Biography: I'm a young enthusiastic person who thrives on becoming great at anything I find interesting, I work for the Children's Services across the UK where I work with Information Communication Technology as a Manager for the Infrastructure and Innovations team. But under all that I'm actually a relaxed guy who likes to be with mates, going to the pub and talking about Music, Life, Women etc. Something you may notice about my profile is that i have several answers with 0 votes, several answers with minus votes, I would just like you to know that this is not down to poor answers (although sometimes when I'm tired I can make mistakes) but the fact that even though I'm incorrect I leave my answers up where others would delete them if they start getting down votes. The reason for this is that SO is not about reputation, Its not about being right all the time, its about providing the less knowledgeable with a set of answers that are marked accordingly to there correctness, so that the user knows what's correct as well as what's incorrect. On SO there is only need for little intervention when when it comes to moderation and knowing when that intervention should be is a key factor in keeping peace within the community. From the past sites that I have run as well as moderated I have learnt that moderators need to be considerate as well as vigilant, Within my life I have been known to be able to talk any single person and be able to read there character and personality and respond with the correct tone,manner and body language to be able to keep a certain level of respect. I believe that bringing some of these skills into the community I would be able to gain respect and order from the community. Finally I would just like to say that I'me not perfect, and if you expected the perfect moderator I would withdraw my proposal, I expect to make mistakes and I look forward to making mistakes as this is the only true way to gain experience and knowledge. Thanks for taking the time to review this post. Regards Robert Pitt
