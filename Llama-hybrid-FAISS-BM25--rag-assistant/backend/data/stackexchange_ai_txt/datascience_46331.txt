The only way to know if a classifier is suitable for your data set is to try it and test it. All classifiers you've mentioned have a way to give confidences of their predictions. Logistic regression and decision trees will give you the probability that a sample is the positive class. SVM's will give you the distance to the decision hyperplane which can be used as a confidence measure; with some additional computations, you can also get a probability with SVM's, but I won't detail that here. One concern for such a small data set is overfitting when the number of features is much larger than the number of samples. You should address that by using some form of regularization.
