application running slow after using large memory allocation

I am involved in cross platform software development over embedded Linux environment. I see that my application runs very slow once it starts using 30+ MB of memory. I have followed two different approach but both end up in same results. Approach 1 Allocate using valloc (requires aligned memory), I kept a count of memory allocated after reaching 30MB the application goes slow. Approach 2 Allocate large amount of memory 40MB at initialization. Further allocations are done from this partition (never freed though out the program execution). Again the application goes slow once 30+ MB is used. However anything less than 30 MB application runs good. PS : I could use this approach as uniform blocks of memory were allocated. Total available memory is 128MB. I am wondering why my application slows down upon accessing the memory, even though allocation was successful. # more /proc/meminfo MemTotal: 92468 kB MemFree: 50812 kB Buffers: 0 kB Cached: 22684 kB SwapCached: 0 kB Active: 4716 kB Inactive: 18540 kB HighTotal: 0 kB HighFree: 0 kB LowTotal: 92468 kB LowFree: 50812 kB SwapTotal: 0 kB SwapFree: 0 kB Dirty: 0 kB Writeback: 0 kB AnonPages: 600 kB Mapped: 952 kB Slab: 7256 kB PageTables: 108 kB NFS_Unstable: 0 kB Bounce: 0 kB CommitLimit: 46232 kB Committed_AS: 1736 kB VmallocTotal: 262136 kB VmallocUsed: 10928 kB VmallocChunk: 246812 kB
