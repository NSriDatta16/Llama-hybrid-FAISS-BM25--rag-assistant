Java Architecture - Question about Solution Design

This might seem a very stupid question but things are pretty complex for me ever since i start my new job. In my earlier carrier as jr. software developer, the applications that i have worked on mainly consisted of Hibernate, Spring and UI (JSF, YUI etc). The app i am working on now is huge, running on BeaWebLogic server. The design of earlier apps were like 2-3 projects separating the app into DAO , Service and UI layer, deployed at Tomcat and could be run from build in Eclipse. Easy to debug and all that. However, the current app is being deployed using Python Scripts, the BEAServer is running separately and from Eclipse i have to connect to Remote Java App using some arguments. My Question is "Why this design adopted here" - I will discuss this thing within the organization as well but i want to discuss it here before.
