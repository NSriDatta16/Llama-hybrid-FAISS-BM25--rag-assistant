How to move a python 2.6 project to UTF-8?

We are moving from latin1 to UTF-8 and have 100k lines of python code. Plus I'm new in python (ha-ha-ha!). I already know that str() function fails when receiving Unicode so we should use unicode() instead of it with almost the same effect. What are the other "dangerous" places of code? Are there any basic guidelines/algorithms for moving to UTF-8? Can it be written an automatic 'code transformer'?
