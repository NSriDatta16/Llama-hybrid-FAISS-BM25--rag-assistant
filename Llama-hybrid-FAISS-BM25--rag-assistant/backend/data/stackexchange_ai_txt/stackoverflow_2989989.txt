Well, you're not only choosing languages, but also choosing platforms here. AS3 means FlashPlayer, Processing means JVM. I don't think processing has to necessarily needs to turn out slower, or faster. In the case of pacman, this is all a matter of rendering speed. I don't know what Processing uses for rendering, but if it is jOGL, it is possible to outperform FlashPlayer (depending on the kind of graphics). I think, the core question is, where you want to be going with the game. If it is just a prototype, both flash and processing are good tools, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. If you really want this to be a long shot, then you also should consider several factors: Due to Flash's market penetration and a big gaming (and game developement) community: Flash probably is a better platform for both distribution. There's a number of flash game engines (also dealing with multiplayer etc.) out there, whereas I found similar engines to build on in Processing impossible to find. From what I can tell, AS3 is a more "serious" language, aiming for developement of applications, whereas Processing focuses on fast prototyping and image processing. Now another question is, what you don't like in both AS3 and Processing. Personally, I switched to Haxe , which proved to leverage the FlashPlayer better than AS3 does, and is a far more expressive and elegant language. However, since I don't know what your exact problem is, I cannot really give you advice.
