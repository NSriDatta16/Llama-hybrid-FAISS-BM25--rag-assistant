How to get started with Big Data Analysis

I've been a long time user of R and have recently started working with Python. Using conventional RDBMS systems for data warehousing, and R/Python for number-crunching, I feel the need now to get my hands dirty with Big Data Analysis. I'd like to know how to get started with Big Data crunching. - How to start simple with Map/Reduce and the use of Hadoop How can I leverage my skills in R and Python to get started with Big Data analysis. Using the Python Disco project for example. Using the RHIPE package and finding toy datasets and problem areas. Finding the right information to allow me to decide if I need to move to NoSQL from RDBMS type databases All in all, I'd like to know how to start small and gradually build up my skills and know-how in Big Data Analysis. Thank you for your suggestions and recommendations. I apologize for the generic nature of this query, but I'm looking to gain more perspective regarding this topic. Harsh
