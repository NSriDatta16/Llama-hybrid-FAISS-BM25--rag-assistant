This is actually a common issue w/ Magento installations, and the most common cause of it is actually the domain from which you access the site. If you are accessing the site locally, using the "site" http://localhost/ seems to cause this issue. Adding a host to your hosts file to map another domain to localhost ( http://localhost.local worked for me) may enable you to log in. To be sure, this is not a database issue, but an issue having to do with your webserver. Hope that helps. Thanks, Joe
