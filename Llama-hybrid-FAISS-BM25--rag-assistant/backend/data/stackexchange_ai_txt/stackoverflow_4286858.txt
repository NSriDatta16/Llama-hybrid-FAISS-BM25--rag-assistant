If you want to create a program that gives you a good description of an arbitrary website, you'll have to do nothing less than a full fledged KI, which would possibly even pass a Turing test. So short answer: You can't. If you are willing to pay a human intelligence to write a summary about a webpage for you, google for "Microjobs". You can create an automated Job description like "Write a two sentence summary about webpage XY" and put some cents of value behind it. Of course you could try to find the first paragraph of text and take the first N sentences out of it, but that will fail on a lot of websites.
