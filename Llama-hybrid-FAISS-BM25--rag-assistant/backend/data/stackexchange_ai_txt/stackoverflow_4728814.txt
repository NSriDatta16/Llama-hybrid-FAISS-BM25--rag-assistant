I figured it out, It has to do with a bug in wxwidgets 2.8.9 where dragging items within the treectrl will give an error when there is no images assigned to a treectrl (i.e. folder images). See: [http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/4390][1] I was using a quick fix suggested, to add a dummy image list treectrlModelTree->AssignImageList(new wxImageList(1, 1)); which suppressed the plus/minus buttons for the treectrl.
