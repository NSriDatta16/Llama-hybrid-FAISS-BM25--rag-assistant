TL;DR : You could specify a grid of alpha and n_iter (or max_iter ) and use parfit for hyper-optimization on SGDClassifier My colleague, Vinay Patlolla, wrote an excellent blog post on How to make SGD Classifier perform as well as Logistic Regression using parfit . Parfit is a hyper-parameter optimization package that he utilized to find the appropriate combination of parameters which served to optimize SGDClassifier to perform as well as Logistic Regression on his example data set in much less time. In summary, the two key parameters for SGDClassifier are alpha and n_iter . To quote Vinay directly: n_iter in sklearn is None by default. We are setting it here to a sufficiently large amount(1000). An alternative parameter to n_iter, which has been recently added, is max_iter. The same advice should apply for max_iter. The alpha hyper-parameter serves a dual purpose. It is both a regularisation parameter and the initial learning rate under the default schedule. This means that, in addition to regularising the Logistic Regression coefficients, the output of the model is dependent on an interaction between alpha and the number of epochs (n_iter) that the fitting routine performs. Specifically, as alpha becomes very small, n_iter must be increased to compensate for the slow learning rate. This is why it is safer (but slower) to specify n_iter sufficiently large, e.g. 1000, when searching over a wide range of alphas.
