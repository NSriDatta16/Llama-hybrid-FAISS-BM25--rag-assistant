I can't see that anybody has really expressed that TDD is not about testing. TDD-ing is about expressing the expected behaviour before doing the tiny behavioural-changing modification. This greatly improves design and enables focusing in a way I have never experienced before. You get tests that protects your future refactorings and 90% coverage for free. To learn it I would suggest (summarising what others have said and adding one of my own): visit the blogs and read the books mentioned above pair up with someone proficient in TDD practice I practiced the Bowling kata (exercise) on my own about 20 times (about 30 minutes apiece) before I started to see the light. Started out by analysing Uncle Bob's description of it here . There are a host of katas on the codingdojo.org site including solutions and discussions. Try them!
