Eacf table interpretation in R

I'm new to time series in R and have an assignment to identify the parameters for the AR and MA processes for a given time series, as well as to use eacf. Here are the results from the three functions: From the ACF function we can conclude that MA(1) is a possible candidate, from PACF we can say that AR(2) is possible, which tells us that the process could be ARMA(2, 1). But I don't understand how to interpret the results from the EACF table and how to get other candidate models from it. I can't seem to find any guidelines either. Thank you in advance.
