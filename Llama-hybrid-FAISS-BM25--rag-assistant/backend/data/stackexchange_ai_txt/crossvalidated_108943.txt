In hypothesis we always assume what you can think of as the uninteresting or default position than seek to find evidence against this suppositio (i.e. innocent until proven guilty; ps to better understand why we do this check out this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA4w2O61Xo&list=LL4aLT03KAOjLGpgETuW47dw&index=46 ) Our alternative hypothesis would just be our alternative belief about the situation. Now here we would assume the coin is fair (i.e. $H_{o}: \mu=0.5$, where $\mu$= average amount of heads in flips of coin) and seek to find evidence against this where our alternative hypothesis would be that it is biased towards heads so $H_{1}: \mu>0.5$ This alternative and null hypothesis can then be used to create the best test for this scenario
