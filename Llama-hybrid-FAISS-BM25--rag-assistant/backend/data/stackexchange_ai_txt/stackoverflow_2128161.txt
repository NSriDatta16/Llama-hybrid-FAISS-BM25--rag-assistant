Moonlight offers two codecs: (a) A fully licensed version that comes straight from Microsoft and requires no further negotiation with the MPEG-LA and other patent holders, or (b) an ffmpeg backend that requires you to negotiate with the patent stock holders if you plan on using. You could build a Silverlight-based application, the trick to get access to the local system is very simple: you run a local web server that exposes those services. You can still use C#/Sqlite or VistaDB as your storage system as part of your Silverlight application. You could host the silverlight app in http://localhost/App.xap and this app would gain local access to the machine by contacting a REST or SOAP web service on http://localhost/rest.ashx or http://localhost/soap.asmx For example, if you needed to read some values from a scanner connected to the machine, you would issue this request: http://localhost/scanner.ashx?operation=scan_badge Then your scanner.ashx HttpHandler will do the actual scanning (this one has full system rights) and return the value to the Silverlight application.
