The reason why it's important to identify minimal keys is to ensure that there is no redundancy in dependencies on those keys. Redundancy can cause anomalies and incorrect results. Minimality is essentially a semantic matter rather than purely a structural feature so it isn't necessarily required by the database implementation. For instance SQL allows you to create a "PRIMARY KEY" on any superkey, which may not be an irreducible superkey. Minimality has nothing to do with storage size because minimal means irreducible , it does not mean smallest.
