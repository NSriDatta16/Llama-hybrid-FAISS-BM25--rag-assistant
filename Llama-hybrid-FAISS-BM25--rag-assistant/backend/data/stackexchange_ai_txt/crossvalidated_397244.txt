Combine mutliple predictions

This question had been asked several times in here, but I think I have something new to add. I'm interested in predicting if some specific event will happen (binary classification). I have two distinct methods that generate a prediction about it. The first methods, an XGBoost model, gives a binary response and the probability of the event (as the probability of being in that class). The second method is an empirical model that has as output a binary classification, but with I can estimate the probability of event given the classification. Now, the question is, how to combine the two? My proposal, and here is where I think I didnÂ´t saw anything similar, is the following: if both classifiers agree on prediction, then that's the prediciton. When they disagree, I want to compute the weighted probability of event, where I will give more weights to extreme probabilities. The logic is that there is more information in a classifier that tells you there is a 90% or a 1% change of event compared to one that says 50%. To do that I compute the weight $w_i$ as $|\ln\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}|$ , with $p_i$ as the probability of event. What do you think
