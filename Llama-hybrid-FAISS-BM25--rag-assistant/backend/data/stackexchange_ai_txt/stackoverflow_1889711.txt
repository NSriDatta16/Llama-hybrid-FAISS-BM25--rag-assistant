I find file-system level reorganization much easier using TortoiseSVN. However, there's a catch: When moving files on the filesystem with TortoiseSVN: Right click on the file Drag it to its new destination Release the right mouse button Select "SVN Move" in the menu that is presented If you just move files as will without doing the above,TortoiseSVN gets very confused and reacts as you're describing.
