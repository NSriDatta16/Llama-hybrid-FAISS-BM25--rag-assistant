Change NSTimer speed with variable?

I have a timer that launches in viewDidLoad that looks like this [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.001f target:self selector:@selector(Dragon:) userInfo:nil repeats:YES]; I want to be able to change my Interval with a variable. However, any time I try to place a variable where the 0.001f is I get errors... any ideas?
