I believe what you'll end up wanting to do is, as a part of your "build" process (deployment, your case?), store the output of git rev-parse HEAD or git describe HEAD (better, assuming you tag releases) in a file. Your app can then display the contents of the file. The commit hash can't ever actually be part of any tracked content (the hash of the commit depends on the tracked content). Of course, if your app is running out of a repo, you could simply run the command from the app, but it's a lot more elegant to just do it once. This is the approach taken by git itself, by the way. It has a teeny shell script which basically dumps git describe output to GIT-VERSION-FILE , which is then compiled in to provide the version information. Hopefully I haven't misunderstood your situation - I'm a little confused by you saying "a possible feature of Git that allows the output of the commit ID". This is a very basic capability of git.
