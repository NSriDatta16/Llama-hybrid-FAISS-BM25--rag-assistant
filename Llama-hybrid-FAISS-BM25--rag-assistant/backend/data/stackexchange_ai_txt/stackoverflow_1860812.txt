Connect your iPhone to the computer, launch XCode, go to the Window menu, and select Organizer. Click on your device in the left hand bar, and check your crash logs. That should tell you when it is crashing, and why. Actually, the crash logs should still be there from when your app WAS crashing, so even if you have reinstalled, you may be able to figure out what WAS going wrong.
