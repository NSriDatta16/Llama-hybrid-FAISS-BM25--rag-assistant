Nonstationary solutions for stationary ARMA equations

By "stationary" I mean "weakly stationary". Consider a "stationary" AR(1) equation: $$X_t=\varphi X_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t,$$ where $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ are discrete time moments, $\varepsilon_t$ a zero-mean white noise (just some iid sequence), $\varphi\in(-1,1)$. It is well known that there is a stationary solution (that is, a discrete time series satisfying the equation). Denote it by $X_t.$ However, we can introduce another time series $Y_t=X_t+\varphi^t$, which appears to be a nonstationary solution for the "stationary" equation (clearly, $\mathbb{E}[Y_t]$ is not free of $t$, since $X_t$ is evidently zero-mean). Given more general stationary AR($p$) process, is it possible to somehow damage the weak stationarity property? Or, in general, is it true that any stationary discrete time AR (or even ARMA) equation has a nonstationary solution?
