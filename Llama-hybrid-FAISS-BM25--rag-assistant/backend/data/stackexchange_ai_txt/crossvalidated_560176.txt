Why are MLE for high dimensional multivariate gausian covariance matrix likely to be ill-conditioned

In a book I'm reading (Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction) the author suggested that in high dimensions, the MLE estimate for the covariance matrix for multivariate gaussian is often poorly conditioned. I'm trying to understand - is there a mathematical explanation as to why MLE for high dimensional multivariate Gaussian covariance matrix is likely to be ill-conditioned? Is this even the case? I couldn't find any evidence for this online other than people encountering ill-conditioned matrixes while fitting a multivariate Gaussian.
