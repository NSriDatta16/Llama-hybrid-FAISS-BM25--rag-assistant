This is a "how long is a piece of string" question, i.e. one that can't be given an objective, quantitative answer without more context. @Aksalal has a nice technical explanation, but your question is effectively the same as "how many data points do I need to characterize the population mean?" - i.e., it depends how noisy your data are and how precise you need the answer to be. The only thing we can say with certainty is that you need $N>1$. Any rule of thumb you're given will depend on what levels of noise are expected in "typical" data in a particular field, and what levels of precision are useful. If you showed us a graph of a time series people here might be willing to give you subjective answers, but you're unlikely to get a hard-and-fast answer.
