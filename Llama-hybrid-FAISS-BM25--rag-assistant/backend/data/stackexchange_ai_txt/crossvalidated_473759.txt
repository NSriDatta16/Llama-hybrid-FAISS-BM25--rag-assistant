Logistic PCA and the train/test split

I did a lot of readings about how to do PCA with train/test split. see PCA and the train/test split I understand that we should apply the PCA on train set and then apply the same transformation to the test set. However, when it comes to logistic PCA, I have no idea: logistic PCA treat the binary data as Bernoulli with probability p, and used ALS to optimize U and V parameters. Logistic PCA My question is: How can I apply the same transformation to the test set? If I use the same log(p/(1-p)) transformation to test data to change them to probability, then it will be inf or 0. Then I cannot use V to project testing points to PCs.
