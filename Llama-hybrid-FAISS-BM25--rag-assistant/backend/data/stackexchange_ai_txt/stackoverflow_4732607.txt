How do I best organise multiple projects in GIT?

I'm elaluating whether GIT is possible to organise our projects. We are working under Windows with Visual Studio 2010 on a local network. Our project organisation is as follows: We have a shared code base (call it SHARE) where all developers are allowed to extend, modify and do bug fixes. All developers have multiple private projects which depend on thes shared code base. So the structure is: root | +-- SHARE +-- Project 1 Dev 1 +-- Project 2 Dev 1 +-- Project 1 Dev 2 What I think of is one origin Repository on a network drive with clones on every developer PC and 1 private Repository for each project on the developer PCs (maybe some backup on network as well). Good would be some kind of link, so that when a developer checks out his project he will get the correct shared source as well. Is this possible with GIT and how? Or can you recommend a better way?
