This is a pain. What we really need is for Microsoft to allow us to hook into a Post-Solution Build event. You can do this via macros but that's too complicated. I'm assuming this is a C++ project because I don't have this problem with C#. This is my solution, it's not elegant but it works: Create a new project whose only purpose is to run the post-build script. Mark it as dependent on every other project in the solution. Add a dummy file to that project called dummy.h or whatever. Right click on dummy.h in Solution Explorer and select Properties. Select 'Custom Build Step'. For the command line type 'echo' and for Outputs just type 'dummy' or something else that will never exist. This project, and therefore the post-build script, will now be run on every build. John.
