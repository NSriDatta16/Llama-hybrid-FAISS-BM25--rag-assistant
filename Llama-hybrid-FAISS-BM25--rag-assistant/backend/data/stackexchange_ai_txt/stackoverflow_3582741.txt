VBA Textbox loses focus on 'Alt-Gr'

I am experiencing a funny behaviour of Textboxes on a VBA Userform: On pressing Alt-Gr the box loses focus. This happens after running a bit of VBA initialization code for the form. The text box has neither initialization code nor event listeners. Starting the user form straight out of the IDE everything is fine. I suspect a MS Office or Windows update to be responsible for this change in behaviour but I can't pin it down. Anyone with an idea what the problem is and how to fix that? Thanks for any suggestions. BTW: The VBA runs within a CRM Application called Organice, which has an embedded VBA runtime environment. stengbiegel
