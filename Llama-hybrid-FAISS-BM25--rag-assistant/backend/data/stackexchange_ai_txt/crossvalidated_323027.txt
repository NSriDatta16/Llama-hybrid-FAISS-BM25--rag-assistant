Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks

I am trying to understand RNNs and then trying to implement them using batch SGD: I am stuck in understanding how it will work: RNN has $t$ time steps, $(X_i)$ is the input at each time step, $h$ is the hidden state, then RNN is just a linear layer with 2 inputs x and a hidden input (i.e 2 matrices). And if we do: for x in sequence_length: h = linear(x, h) This actually means recurrence. What will be the output at the end of this RNN? I want to understand, how to do batching here? When doing batching what will the input look like? [batch, seq, embedding_size] or [seq, batch, embedding_size] And how to extend to multiple layers of RNN? What do multiple layers even mean in case of RNNs... aren't RNN layers just determined by the sequence_length? So, how to implement multiple layer RNNs. All software packages just don't answer these questions. All tutorials just start from advanced without explaining these two questions.
