First, two pre-analysis suggestions: I would treat the units as individual observations without averaging. If you're going to want to say that the species responded differently to the treatments, you'll need the interaction terms, so I wouldn't do the analyses separately (though I can also imagine good reasons for doing them separately). I think of the random effects specification as (Within_Obs_Factor | Observational_Unit). The idea is that each Observational Unit has some random deviation from the group mean and has some random difference in response to the within-unit manipulation. Since both species and treatment were manipulated between plants, I would not put them in the random effects that way. As far as I can tell, the only factor that changed within observational unit was time (the same plants were observed each week). So, my suggestion would be a model like this: lmer(PN ~ Spp*Trt + (Week | Unit), data=Expt) If you'd like to stick with the averaging and analyzing species separately, I think that would mean something like: lmer(meanPN ~ Trt + (Week | Tub), data=SumExpt, weights=1/varPN) I'm not exactly sure how Block fits into your design, so I'm not sure where it belongs.
