Hidden Markov Model vs Recurrent Neural Network

Which sequential input problems are best suited for each? Does input dimensionality determine which is a better match? Are problems which require "longer memory" better suited for an LSTM RNN, while problems with cyclical input patterns (stock market, weather) more easily solved by an HMM? It seems like there is a lot of overlap; Im curious what subtle differences exist between the two.
