DragManager problem when loading flex app into flash app

I have a flex application which use DragManager. When I'm loading this application into flash application and trying to use drag'n'drop functions - I get an error: TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference. at mx.managers::CursorManagerImpl/showCurrentCursor() at mx.managers::CursorManagerImpl/setCursor() at mx.managers.dragClasses::DragProxy/showFeedback() at mx.managers.dragClasses::DragProxy/mouseMoveHandler() But, when I simply run a flex application (not loding it into a flash one) everything works properly.
