Well we have one of these humongous MFC Apps at the workplace. Its a gigantic pain to maintain or extend... its a huge ball of mud now but it rakes in the moolah.Anyways We use Rational Robot for doing smoke tests and the like. Another approach that has had some success is to create a small product-specific language and script tests that use VBScript and some Control handle spying magic. Turn common actions into commands.. e.g. OpenDatabase would be a command that in turn will inject the required script blocks to click on Main Menu > File > "Open...". You then create excel sheets which are a series of such commands. These commands can take parameters too. Something like a FIT Test.. but more work. Once you have most of the common commands identified and scripts ready. It's pick and assemble scripts (tagged by CommandIDs) to write new tests. A test-runner parses these Excel sheets, combines all the little script blocks into a test script and runs it. OpenDatabase "C:\tests\MyDB" OpenDialog "Add Model" AddModel "M0001", "MyModel", 2.5, 100 PressOK SaveDatabase HTH
