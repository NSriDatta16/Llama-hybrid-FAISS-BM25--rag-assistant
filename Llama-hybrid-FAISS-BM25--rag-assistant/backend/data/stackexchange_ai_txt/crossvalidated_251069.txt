Gaussian Discriminant Analysis and sigmoid function

In CS229, Prof.Andrew Ng says( but doesn't prove ) the relation between Gaussian Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression (hypothesis function is sigmoid in both models). Is this (similarity of hypothesis function) because of y being distributed Bernoulli?
