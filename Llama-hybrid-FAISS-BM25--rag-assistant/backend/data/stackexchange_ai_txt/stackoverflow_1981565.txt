Run both with SET STATISTICS IO ON and SET STATISTICS TIME ON. Run 6-7 times each, discard the best and worst results for both cases, then compare the two average times. I suspect the difference is primarily from a cold cache (first execution) vs. a warm cache (second execution). The output from STATISTICS IO would give away such a case, as a big difference in the physical reads between the runs. And make sure you have 'lab' conditions for the test: no other tasks running (no lock contention), databases (including tempdb) and logs are pre-grown to required size so you don't hit any log growth or database growth event.
