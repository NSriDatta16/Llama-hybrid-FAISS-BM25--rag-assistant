Uniqueness of the optimal value function for an MDP

Suppose we have a Markov decision process with a finite state set and a finite action set. We calculate the expected reward with a discount of $\gamma \in [0,1]$ . In chapter 3.8 of the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" (by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton) it is stated that there always exists at least one optimal policy, but it doesn't prove why. I suppose the various optimal policies yield the same optimal value function, at least this is what would make sense and also assumed in the book. Can someone give me a proof for the above statement or a link to a proof?
