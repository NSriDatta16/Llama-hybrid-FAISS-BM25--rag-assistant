Resizing a Silverlight or Flash video player?

Is it possible to resize a silverlight/flash video player on the fly? I would like to create a video where I can drag the bottom left corner to resize the player (maintaining aspect ratio) or at least eliminate the possibility of doing so I could move on to other methods. Thanks in advance... EDIT: // forgot to mention Sorry forgot to mention, this would also mean that the actual video itself resizing right?
