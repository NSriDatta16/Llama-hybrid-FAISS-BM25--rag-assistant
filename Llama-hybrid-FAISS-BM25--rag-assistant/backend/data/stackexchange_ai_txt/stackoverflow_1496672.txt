The way I've done it is by using my own custom images. If it's just one button, you can create an image for the whole button. If it's just the background, and you're going to re-use it with different button title text, you can create an appropriate smaller image, and use - stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight: (a method of UIImage for creating new images). The graphics editor I use is Fireworks. I've always seen it done this way by others, too. My designer friends use Photoshop. Some of Apple's sample code (e.g. UICatalog) has background images you can use.
