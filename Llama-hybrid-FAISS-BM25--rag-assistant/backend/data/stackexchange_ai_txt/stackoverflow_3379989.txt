Check out the Login Destination module . One of the configuration options for that module is "Return user to where he/she came from. (Preserve destination)", and I believe it's enabled by default. Also helpful is LoginToboggan , which offers a few more login/registration tweaks. LoginToboggan includes an option for a "Login successful" message, which is good way to make sure your newly logged-in users don't get confused when they get redirected back to the previous page.
