I think the simplest method would be moving average, by taking the mean of a group comprising $x$ points before and after each point: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average You could also try more complex techniques like gaussian smoothing, which applies a gaussian distribution rather than a uniform one as above: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur Note: This is not the same as a gaussian convolution filter, which does give a phase shift: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter From the link: "Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, applying a Gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the image's high-frequency components; a Gaussian blur is thus a low pass filter". Incidentally, you shouldn't get any phase shift as long as your smoothing distribution (whether uniform or gaussian) is symmetric around each point.
