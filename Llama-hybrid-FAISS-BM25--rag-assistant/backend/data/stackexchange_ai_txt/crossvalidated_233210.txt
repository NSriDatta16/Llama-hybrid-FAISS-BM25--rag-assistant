State-of-the-art algorithms may differ from what is used in production in the industry. Also, the latter can invest in fine-tuning more basic (and often more interpretable) approaches to make them work better than what academics would. Example 1: According to TechCrunch , Nuance will start using "deep learning tech" in its Dragon speech recognition products this september. Example 2: Chiticariu, Laura, Yunyao Li, and Frederick R. Reiss. "Rule-Based Information Extraction is Dead! Long Live Rule-Based Information Extraction Systems!." In EMNLP, no. October, pp. 827-832. 2013. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12856773132046965379&hl=en&as_sdt=0,22 ; http://www.aclweb.org/website/old_anthology/D/D13/D13-1079.pdf With that being said: Which of the ensemble learning algorithms is considered to be state-of-the-art nowadays One of the state-of-the-art systems for image classification gets some nice gain with ensemble (just like most other systems I far as I know): He, Kaiming, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun.
