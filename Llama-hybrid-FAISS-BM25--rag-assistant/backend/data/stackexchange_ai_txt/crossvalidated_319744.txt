Estimate a parameter from subset of the data, other parameters from all data

I use Bayesian random effects models [$y_i \sim bernoulli\_logit(\beta + \alpha_{subj})$ $\alpha_{subj} \sim normal(0, \gamma)$], the $y$ outcome is binary. Part of the subjects have two observations, part of the subjects have only one observation. I experience that when I use ($y_i, subj_i$) data where a large proportion of the subjects have only one observation the estimated standard deviation of the random effect ($\gamma$) increases to the top region of its weakly informative prior. In other words the model starts to explain the observations with the subject characteristics. I'd like to get realistic estimates of $\gamma$ and $beta$. Is there a way in Stan / PyMC / JAGS (or maybe another platform) to specify that the $\gamma$ should only be estimated from those cases that have more than one observations? Would that way introduce a bias or another problem?
