I solved it by rewriting my normalization algorithm. must have been some sort of error in there. I was trying to use a scaling formula i found in a paper about neural networks. When falling back to plain feature scaling the offset in output was gone. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Rescaling
