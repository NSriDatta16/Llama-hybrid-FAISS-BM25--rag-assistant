Any neural network trained using some variant of online learning (e.g. stochastic gradient descent) will be able to do this. If the stream contains independent samples, then a feedforward network would work. If the stream contains sequence data with time dependencies that you want to model, then a recurrent network would be the tool of choice (trained using a method like backpropagation through time).
