Well, the way we use it (with Cognos BI) is in the second sense. Business intelligence is the information about your organisation and Cognos BI is one way to gather and present that information in a way that's easily adaptable and useful. Having moved from BIRT to Cognos last year, I have to admit that, despite the increased cost of the product, things are a lot easier to do. It always seemed to me that BIRT was very little "BI" and mostly "RT" :-) Sorry to sound like an advertorial back there, I was just stating how we use the term.
