Thanks for the help and encouragement from everyone! What I ended up doing instead of using wrapped instances is to use a data declaration with default functions that can be overridden. This approach is a lot cleaner because there are no wrappers and no dummy variables- I think Stephen was right on that the original approach just isn't something that haskell/GHC was made for.
