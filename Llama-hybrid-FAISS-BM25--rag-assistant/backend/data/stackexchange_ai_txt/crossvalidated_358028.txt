How to interpret the coefficients for binomial reponse variables in SEM [R, lavaan]

I am learning SEM using the lavaan package in R. One of the response variables is binomial data (whether or not a participant answered the question accurately), which is predicted by a dummy coded predictor variable. binomial variable I would like to interpret the unstandardized coefficient of this dummy coded variable, but I am not sure whether I can interpret this as a percentage (i.e., when dummy coded variable is 1, the likelihood of participant answered on questions accurately increases by OO%), or as a logit in the same way as logistic regression analyses. I am not speficying the probability distribution so I am not sure if lavaan choose the best distribution automatically.. Thank you very much for your help.
