I store everything in the repository to make it easy for developers (or rebuilt devboxes) to check-out from SVN and then run a build (with all necessary assemblies in relative paths). If you have multiple projects that should be separate, this would also encourage the team of your shared components to deliver high quality assemblies. This could follow a normal release to production mentality where the shared assemblied would be updated in your downstream projects. This is a very natural Software Value Chain, at the cost of a little bit of disk space. JP Boodhoo has a great series on the topic of automated builds, VS folder structure, and getting developers up and running quickly.
