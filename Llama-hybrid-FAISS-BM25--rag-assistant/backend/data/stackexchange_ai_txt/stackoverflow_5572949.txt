I've had the displeasure of grappling with this problem as well, and unfortunately there's no way to pull it off (check out this actionscript.org forum post for details). The only option at your disposal if you really need a seamless loop is to embed the FLV in your swf by putting it in the timeline, which will give you perfect results; however, you then sacrifice the ability to progressively download the video. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news! I've always dealt with this in the past by either a) embedding my videos, if they're short enough, or b) engineering the video content so that the little hiccup isn't noticeable (e.g. using some sort of easing in the first/last few frames of the video).
