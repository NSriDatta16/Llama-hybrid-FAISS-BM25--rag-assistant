Edit: I think the best way to implement something like this is to use Facebook Connect to authenticate users on your site and connect the users that way. Once the users have connected on your site, invite them to connect on Facebook too (by using the method below or just linking to their profile). This way, you're controlling the "meet", like you want, but you're also allowing them to connect on Facebook in a legitimate way. Give this dialog a shot, and just direct the user to: http://www.facebook.com/dialog/friends/?id= &app_id& &redirect_uri= Alternatively, you could simply open a popup with that URL using window.open . From what you suggested in your question though, it doesn't sound like you wish to use the feature like Facebook intended. From the usage notes: This feature is intended to help users become friends on Facebook with people that they are connected to in real life. You should not use this feature to encourage users to friend other users that they are not connected to in real life. If your app is found to be encouraging this behavior, your usage of this feature may be disabled.
