Are replication data-centers useful for speeding up responses?

There are different types of data-centers so I want to explain that I'm talking about data-centers setup with the purpose of providing content faster to a certain local on the planet. From what I understand, each data-center shares access to the data storage and basically just exists somewhere in the world to keep requests from travailing thousands of miles to the main server. However, since the each data center has to keep the data in sync with the others wouldn't this slow everything down to negate the benefit of having them in different parts of the world? Say for example, that a result set had to be fetch from the main server back home - wouldn't that be the same as the user just making the request to that home server himself? Obviously not, because businesses use them so perhaps someone can explain this.
