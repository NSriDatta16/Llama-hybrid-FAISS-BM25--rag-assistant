What level of Haskell are you learning? There are probably two reasonable answers: have each function return its counts along with its return value like you suggested, or (more advanced) use a monad such as State to keep the counts in the background. You could also write a special-purpose monad to keep the counts; I do not know if that is what your professor intended. Using IO for mutable variables is not the elegant way to solve the problem, and is not necessary for what you need.
