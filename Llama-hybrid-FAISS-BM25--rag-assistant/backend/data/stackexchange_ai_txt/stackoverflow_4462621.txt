Thanks to polymorphism , there's no reason you should have to do this. Both ModelDerivedClass1 and ModelDerivedClass2 inherit from ModelBaseClass , so declaring the variable in your base class as type ModelBaseClass will allow you to store an object of any of those types. Any method that is defined in the base type ModelBaseClass is automatically available on the derived types. If you need to call a method that is only defined in one of the derived types, you'll need to upcast the object to a more specific type: DirectCast(_ClassVar, ModelDerivedClass1) As a more specific and literal answer to your question, you can't override variable declarations. You'd have to declare them as properties in order to override their declarations, and even then, you couldn't override exclusively by return type.
