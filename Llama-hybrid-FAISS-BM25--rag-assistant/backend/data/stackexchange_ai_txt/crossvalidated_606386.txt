The first clear autoencoder presentation featuring a feedforward, multilayer neural network with a bottleneck layer was presented by Kramer in 1991 (full text at https://people.engr.tamu.edu/rgutier/web_courses/cpsc636_s10/kramer1991nonlinearPCA.pdf ). He discusses dimensionality reduction and feature extraction and applications such as noise filtering, anomaly detection, and input estimation. Variational autoencoders, referred to as "robust autoassociative neural networks", were anticipated by by Kramer, 1992 ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/009813549280051A?via%3Dihub ). It wasn't until 15 years later that Hinton popularized autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, in 2006.
