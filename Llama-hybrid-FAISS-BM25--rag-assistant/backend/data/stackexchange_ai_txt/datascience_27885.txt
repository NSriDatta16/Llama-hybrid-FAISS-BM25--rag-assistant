Datum is latin for 'a given' , and data is the plural, meaning 'the givens.' If you want to be precise, you should refer to a single observation as a datum and multiple observations as data . Notice that the latter is a plural word: 'The data are [not is] hard to interpret.' But usage has changed. People, especially in Data Science, usually seem to talk about 'a single data point' and say that 'the data is hard to interpret.' See this discussion for example. My recommendation: As long as you are talking to Data Scientists and IT guys, ban datum from your vocabulary and use data with the singular. Reconsider once you are a professor in Oxford.
