Is it the correct neural network reprsentation

I am having the following problem. Note that the area for class $B$ stretches to the innity. We consider as an elementary computation the threshold neuron whose relation between inputs $\{z_i\}$ and output $z_j$ is given by In a similar way the XOR problem was solved in the slides, design at hand a neural network that takes x1 and x2 as input and produces the output \1" if the input belong to class A, and \0" if the input belongs to class B. Draw the neural network model and write down its corresponding weight and bias parameters. So I wrote neural network as below. $Just\ wondering\ is\ it\ correct\ or\ not\ because\ for\ weights\ in\ second\ layer\ I\ am\ assigning\ 1.$ $ Please\ tell\ me\ is\ it\ correct\ or\ not\ and\ can\ I\ use\ absolute\ value\ of\ x_i$
