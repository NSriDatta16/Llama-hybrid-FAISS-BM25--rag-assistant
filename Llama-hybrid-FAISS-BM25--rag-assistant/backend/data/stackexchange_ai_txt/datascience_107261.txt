I would like to treat both number of projects and tenure as numerical in personal. In general, there are three data types: Numerical , Categorical and Ordinal . It doesn't have a district statistical definition of these data types, it's more like a rule of thumb to me. But from the machine learning aspect, the tricky point here is that it doesn't matter how we interpret the columns. What matters is how we encode the columns , which affects the metrics/performance of the estimators. Take tenure as example, if we apply one-hot encoding, that increases the number of features and every category is treated as a new column; if we apply label encoding, the input is [0, N] , which changes the scale of the original column ([2,3,4,5] -> [0,1,2,3]). We could test different encoding method, do some experiments and choose the best encoding method which gets the best score.
