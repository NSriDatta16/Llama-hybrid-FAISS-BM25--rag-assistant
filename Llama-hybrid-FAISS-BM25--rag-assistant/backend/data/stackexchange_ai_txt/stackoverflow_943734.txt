From my point of view an shared component has some advantages that are somtimes realized as disadvantages. shared component defines interfaces in your process. So you are forced to decide which components/interfaces are visible outside and which are hidden. This automatically defines which interface has to be stable and which does not have to be stable and can be refactored without affecting any code outside the component.. Memory administration in case of C++ and Windows must be well thought. So normally you should not handle memory outside of an dll that isn't freed in the same dll. If you do so your component may fail if: different runtimes or compiler version are used. So I think that using shared coponents will help the software to get better organized.
