Compare Neural Network generalization results

I'm trying to develop my neural network with both early stopping and bayesian regularization (matlab implementation, lm algorithm is used for both). Since in bayesian regularization I have not the validation set, how can I compare the generalization capability of the networks obtained with the two methodologies? Thanks
