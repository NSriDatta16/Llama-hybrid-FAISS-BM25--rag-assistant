Honeycomb's launcher will use available hdpi drawables as higher-res mipmaps on mdpi devices. mdpi icons should still be 48x48. If you want to provide resources specific to xlarge screens you should provide versions in drawable-xlarge-mdpi, drawable-xlarge-hdpi, etc. However, if your goal is to provide icons that match the styling in Android 3.0 you might want to use v11 (API level 11) as your qualifier instead of xlarge. (e.g. drawable-mdpi-v11, drawable-hdpi-v11) API level version qualifiers in your resource organization can be useful in other circumstances where system styling changed too, such as the notification icon style changes in 2.3.
