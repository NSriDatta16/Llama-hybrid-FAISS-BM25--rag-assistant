Detecting outliers in a time-series

I'm trying to exclude the outliers using 2-sigma rule and I have a time series. So I use a moving average for this. Let's say I have this: W1 38 315 W2 48 002 W3 47 487 W4 50 977 W5 39 604 W6 46 058 W7 45 718 W8 22 408 and I want to exclude outliers. I calculate MVA for 8 values and moving stan.dev. The first question is when I calculate MVA for week8. Should I include it or not? The second question is when I detect W4 as an outlier, should I delete it from range and detect another outliers with recalculated MVA and st.dev. (without 50 977 value) or not?
