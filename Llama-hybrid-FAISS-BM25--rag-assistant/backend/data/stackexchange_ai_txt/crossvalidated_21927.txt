Margin of Error for Likert scale response

Suppose the target population is a group of 11 company CEOs and 7 CEOs responded to a question about their level of annual bonus on a 7 point Likert scale. The responses are as follows: 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, and 5. The average response score then is 6.71. If the last two levels of the Likert scale are '6 = satisfied' and '7 = very satisfied', this finding can be expressed as a 'very satisfied' rating. Do we apply a margin of error to Likert scale responses? (The margin of error for a sample of 7 is 38%. This is 1 divided by the square root of the sample - a rough guide!)
