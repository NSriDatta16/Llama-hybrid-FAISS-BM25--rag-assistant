Here's another way to get intuition that variance increases linearly with time. Returns increase linearly with time. $.1\%$ return per month translate into $1.2\%$ return per year - $X$ return per day generate $365X$ return per year (assuming independence). It makes sense that the range of returns also increases linearly. If monthly return is $.1\%$ on average $\pm .05\%$ , then it makes intuitive sense that per year it is $1.2\%$ on average $\pm .6\%$ . Well, if we intuitively think of variance as range, then it makes intuitive sense that variance increases in the same fashion as return through time, that is linearly.
