You need to set the text field's delegate. If you created the text field in code, then something like [myTextField setDelegate:self]; or if you created the text field in Interface Builder, control + click + drag from the text field to your view controller instance, and select delegate. Without setting the delegate, the delegate messages will never be sent to your controller.
