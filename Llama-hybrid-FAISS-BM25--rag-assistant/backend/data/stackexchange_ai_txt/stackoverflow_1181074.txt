CakePHP cache control for asset files (images, CSS, etc)

What's the best way to use CakePHP to control the Expires headers for image and CSS files? My host unfortunately doesn't support mod_expires or mod_headers , so I can't simply set these values in an .htaccess file. Right now there's no cache control for my files and a lot of unnecessary requests are made. What's the most elegant way to pipe requests for asset files through Cake and set the appropriate headers via header() ?
