How to threshold multiclass probability prediction to get confusion matrix?

Lets say my multinomial logistic regression predict that a chance of a sample belonging to a each class is A=0.6, B=0.3, C=0.1 How do I threshold this values to get just binary prediction of a sample belonging to a class, taking in to an account imbalances of classes. I know what I would do if it's just a binary decision (threshold based on classes prevalence), or if the classes are balanced (classify to a class with highest probability). My end goal is to get 3x3 confusion matrix
