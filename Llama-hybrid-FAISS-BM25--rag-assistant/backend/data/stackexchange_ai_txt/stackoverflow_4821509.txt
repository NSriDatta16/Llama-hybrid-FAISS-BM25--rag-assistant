XML with nested elements filtering with calculation using XSLT v1.0 C#

I have got a sample xml file where root has element with name "element". This elements can be nested. I would like to exclude elements with name "position" where "position" value x = ("number" + "another") * count is greater than average of sum(("number" + "another") * "count") from all "position" elements. How to process this xml file with xslt v 1. 1 2 3 3 1 5 3 3 5 3 6 5 3 3 5 3 7 5 33 4 5 34 3 5 5 1 2 3 3 9 5 3 2 3 3 5
