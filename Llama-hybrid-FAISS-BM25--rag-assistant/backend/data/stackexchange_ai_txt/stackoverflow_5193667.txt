Well, chances are that the printer, phone, etc. have general purpose computers in them running a TCP/IP stack and some specialized server software, so it boils down to what your definition of what a "computer" is... still, it sounds like more trouble than it's worth, unless you can identify something that only what you think of as computers will have, and that all of them will have. On a Windows network, SMB, perhaps - but that could catch a NAS that exposes storage over SMB. I don't think there's a general way to do what you want to do. Like Lloyd pointed out, nmap does some fingerprinting, but that is far from perfect (it will usually get pretty close to a specific OS version, but it can't tell what kind of physical device is running that OS).
