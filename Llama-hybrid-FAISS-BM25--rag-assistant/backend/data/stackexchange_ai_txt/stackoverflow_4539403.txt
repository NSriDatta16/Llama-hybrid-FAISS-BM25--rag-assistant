Firefox plugin development and embedding an .swf in xul with html:embed

I have a big problem with my firefox plugin. I have a button, which opens a new window for me, where I want to include that .swf file. Here is the XUL code for the embedding: -> html namespace was set above: xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" Reader.swf is in the same directory as the xul file without the html:embed, the window opens without problems, but as soon as I change that, firefox crashes without warning or something, it just disapears from the process bar. the .swf file works properly when I open it from my operating system (its windows 7 64 bit) and is coded in as3. can somebody help me?
