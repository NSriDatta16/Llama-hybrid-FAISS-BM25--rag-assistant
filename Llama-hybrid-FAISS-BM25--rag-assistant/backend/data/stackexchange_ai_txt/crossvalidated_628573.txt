Why does adding a time trend can make an explanatory variable more significant in time series data?

So the statement is: Adding a time trend can make an explanatory variable more significant if the dependent and independent variables have different kinds of trends, but movement in the independent variable about its trend line causes movement in the dependent variable away from its trend line. I don't really understand the meaning. Why can variable signifcance increase?
