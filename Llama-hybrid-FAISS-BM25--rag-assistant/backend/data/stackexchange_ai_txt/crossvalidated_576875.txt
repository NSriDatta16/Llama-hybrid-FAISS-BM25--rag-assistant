This is a bit library dependent, but if the cross validator object returns you the best performing model, the significant difference is not normal. Because what it does is just a wrapper of what you do manually. Besides, cross validator(s) do not (and should not) average the coefficients found via different folds. They should return the best hyper parameters and sometimes the refitted model with these HPs.
