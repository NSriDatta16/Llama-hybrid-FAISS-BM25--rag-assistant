Vincent and Lance McNearney's answers show how to solve your problem. To answer your exact question, no you cannot get access to "h3"/"a" from your elm element the way you want to. elm is a string based on the html of your and has no ties to the DOM anymore. You could parse it to find the value of the h3 tag (not too elegantly), but you could not tie that tag to the real tag existing in the DOM.
