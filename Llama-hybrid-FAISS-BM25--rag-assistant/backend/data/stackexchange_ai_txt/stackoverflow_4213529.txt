Saving UIView contents in iOS 4 with real size of the images inside (i.e. scale contentes up for save)

I have an UIView with many UIImageViews as subviews. The app runs on iOS4 and I use images with retina display resolution (i.e. the images load with scale = 2) I want to save the contents of the UIView ... BUT ... have the real size of the images inside. I.e. the view has size 200x200 and images with scale=2 inside, I'd like to save a resulting image of 400x400 and all the images with their real size. Now what comes first to mind is to create a new image context and load again all images inside with scale=1 and that should do, but I was wondering if there is any more elegant way to do that? Seems like a waist of memory and processor time to reload everything again since it's already done ... p.s. if anyone has an answer - including code would be nice
