Confidence interval of a linear function of a multinomial distribution

Say we have a $K$ sided (unfair) dice, that has unknown probabilities $p_k$ of rolling each side. We roll $N$ trials and observe $n_k$ occurrences of each side (so $N = \sum_{k=1}^K {n_k}$). The average roll $\hat a$ of our trial is $\hat a = \sum_{k=1}^K k n_k/N$. I would like to find a confidence interval on $a=\sum_{i=1}^K k p_k$. In some cases $N$ is fairly small, so I don't think we can make a normal approximation (we will have $n_k \hat{p}_k I'm currently doing this with a bootstrap simulation. I estimate the Laplace smoothed $\hat{p}_k = \frac{n_k + 1}{N+K}$, and then bootstrap $N$ samples a bunch of times, and look at the empirical confidence interval. What's a good way to go about this analytically? It seems like we could get a confidence interval on $p_k$ using one of these techniques (other than the normal approximation) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval but I'm not sure how you go about combining them to get a bound on $a$.
