The general principle here is that it only makes sense/is only possible to estimate within-level variation for factors that actually vary within that level in the course of the experiment/observation period. Since happiness might vary within individuals across trials, but race can't, the maximal model you can fit would be lmer(liking~happiness*race + (happiness|participant), data) In other words, the effect of happiness on liking may vary across individuals; you will get estimates for (fixed) average effect of happiness on liking for the "baseline" race (whichever is the first level of your factor) (fixed) average effect of race (differences in liking from the baseline race) on liking for happiness zero (you might want to center happiness so that the 'zero' level of happiness is a more meaningful level [e.g. a baseline level of 4, or a baseline level of the mean happiness across the study population] (fixed) race-happiness interaction (the average difference in the happiness-liking slope between the baseline and other races) (random) among-individual intercept variation (difference in the expected liking of an individual at the baseline happiness from the expected liking for an individual of their race at the baseline happiness) (random) among-individual happiness-slope variation (difference in the expected effect of 1 unit of liking on happiness from the average effect for an individual of their race) You could change the interpretation of the fixed factors slightly by changing contrasts. To stretch a point a little bit, it might be possible in principle that the effect of race, or the happiness by race interaction, could vary across individuals, but you can't measure it. (This discussion would make more sense if considered in terms of a characteristic that is more likely to vary within individuals over some reasonable time scale but doesn't vary within individuals within the scope of the experiment.)
