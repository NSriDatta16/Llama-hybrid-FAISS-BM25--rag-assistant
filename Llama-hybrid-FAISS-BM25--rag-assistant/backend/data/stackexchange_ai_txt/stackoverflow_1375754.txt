Empty Dialogs in Flex Builder

I have been experiencing a strange issue in Flex Builder 3 where certain dialogs such as the Add New Project wizard and the SVN Commit dialog are completely empty save for the title area. I'm running Flex Builder v3.0 (build 3.02.2.214193) on the Windows 7 RC. I have tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling Flex Builder to no avail. I don't think it's Windows 7 causing the issues because it was working a couple of months ago with no problems. Even more strange is that I have not installed any additional plugins or made any configuration changes to Flex Builder between the time before these problems began and now. Has anyone else encountered this problem, and if so, know of any solutions? Here are a couple of screenshots to illustrate the behaviour. alt text http://www.colincochrane.com/image.axd?picture=2009%2f9%2fdialog2.PNG alt text http://www.colincochrane.com/image.axd?picture=2009%2f9%2femptydialog.png
