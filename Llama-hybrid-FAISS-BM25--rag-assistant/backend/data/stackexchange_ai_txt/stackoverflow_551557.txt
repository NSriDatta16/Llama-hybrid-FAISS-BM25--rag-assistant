Appending to the 20-entry table and removing the eldest element (i.e. the one with the minimum ID?) is possible. However, note that this will fragment the table. That's OK so long as you run OPTIMIZE every once in a while. A different way would be to pre-allocate 20 entries and keep a separate counter of which entry is the latest. Then instead of insert/delete, you would update the item ID based on the counter, which you would then increment (mod 20 + 1) and store again. However note that both of these models work only under a "single-threaded" model. If multiple threads are running on the table it's possible that they'll conflict. If the counter is in program memory, shared by threads but guarded properly, that will be both thread-safe and efficient.
