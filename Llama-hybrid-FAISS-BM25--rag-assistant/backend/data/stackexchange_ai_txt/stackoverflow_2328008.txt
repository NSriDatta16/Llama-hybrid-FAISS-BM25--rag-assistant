Drag-and-drop to canvas in wxPython

Do you know if there is an easy way to drag-and-drop elements (icons or buttons) into a canvas and create different drawings on it as a result? The idea is to have a set of objects and let the user drag them into a drawing space. In the worst case the user could just click on the icon/button, and then click on the canvas and draw the element in the position, but I think the dragging is more intuitive.
