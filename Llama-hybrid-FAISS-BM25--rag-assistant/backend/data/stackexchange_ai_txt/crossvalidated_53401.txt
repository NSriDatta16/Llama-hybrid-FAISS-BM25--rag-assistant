There are some suggestions: Convert it to dimensionless form. If it goes from 0 to 1 and doesn't have units like furlongs per fortnight or tons of coal attached then it is harder to recognize. Add a small random number to it. When you convolute a gaussian with a gaussian, you just get another gaussian. It doesn't change the essensce of it, but moving from exact values keeps someone googling numbers to try and figure out what it is. I like the idea of rotating it. You could take a lag of some number of time-steps to create a 2d data-set from the 1d data set. You can then use PCA, or SVD (after centering and scaling) to determine a rotation. Once the data is rotated appropriately you have changed the variance and confounded the information in itself. You can report out one of the rotated coordinate axes as the "sample data". You could mix it with strongly formed data from some other source. So if your sample data is stock market data, you could add perturbations based on the weather, or on the variations from the mean of pitch from your favorite soundtrack of the Beatles. Whether or not people can make sense of Nasdaq, they will have trouble making sense of Nasdaq + Beatles.
