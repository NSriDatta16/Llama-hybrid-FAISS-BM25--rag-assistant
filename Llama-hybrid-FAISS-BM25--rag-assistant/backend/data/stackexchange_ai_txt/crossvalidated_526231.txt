When comparing two classification methods in a Data set, is it important to use the same Training / Testing data set?

Suppose we wish to compare the efficiency of two classification techniques on a data set (kNN vs SVM for example). We have two options: We can first separate the original data set in two groups: Training vs Testing, train each algorithm on the same training set, and then compare their efficiency on the same testing set, or we can create different training / testing divisions for each of the algorithms, and test their performance on each of their specified pair of Training/Testing data sets. I think if the samples are independent, both techniques should give the same result. Is this true? Which of both is preferable?
