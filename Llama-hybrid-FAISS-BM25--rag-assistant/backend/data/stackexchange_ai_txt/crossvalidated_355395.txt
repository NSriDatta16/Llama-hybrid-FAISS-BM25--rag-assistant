By way of background, I have been doing forecasting store $\times$ SKU time series for retail sales for 12 years now. Tens of thousands of time series across hundreds or thousands of stores. I like saying that we have been doing Big Data since before the term became popular. I have consistently found that the single most important thing is to understand your data . If you don't understand major drivers like Easter or promotions, you are doomed. Often enough, this comes down to understanding the specific business well enough to ask the correct questions and telling known unknowns from unknown unknowns . Once you understand your data, you need to work to get clean data. I have supervised quite a number of juniors and interns, and the one thing they had never experienced in all their statistics and data science classes was how much sheer crap there can be in the data you have. Then you need to either go back to the source and try to get it to bring forth good data, or try to clean it, or even just throw some stuff away. Changing a running system to yield better data can be surprisingly hard. Once you understand your data and actually have somewhat-clean data, you can start fiddling with it. Unfortunately, by this time, I have often found myself out of time and resources. I personally am a big fan of model combination ("stacking"), at least in an abstract sense , less so of fancy feature engineering, which often crosses the line into overfitting territory - and even if your fancier model performs slightly better on average, one often finds that the really bad predictions get worse with a more complex model. This is a dealbreaker in my line of business. A single really bad forecast can pretty completely destroy the trust in the entire system, so robustness is extremely high in my list of priorities. Your mileage may vary. In my experience, yes, model combination can improve accuracy. However, the really big gains are made with the first two steps: understanding your data, and cleaning it (or getting clean data in the first place).
