I think what you are referring to is called Nowcasting - i.e. like forecasting but for variables that are happening now, not in the future. The textbook example of this is large-scale economic variables like GDP: There is a present value $y_t$ for the GDP, but it will take a long time to gather all the information required to calculate $y_t$ . So instead we use a model to estimate $\hat{y}_t$ based on present data $x_t$ and historical values of $\pmb{y}$ ( $y_{t-1}$ , $y_{t-2}$ , $y_{t-3}$ , etc ...). You can simply use time series models with external regressors (for example ARIMAX, or RNN/LSTM if your data is rich enough and complex enough to warrant a deep learning approach). A popular nowcasting approach from the last few years has been Bayesian Structural Time Series models, see this paper and the corresponding BSTS package in R.
