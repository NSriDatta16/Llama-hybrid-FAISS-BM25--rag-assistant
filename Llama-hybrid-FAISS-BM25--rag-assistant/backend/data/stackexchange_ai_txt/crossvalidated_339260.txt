The Schwartz & Lellouch paper mentioned by Alexis, originally published (1967) in J Chron Dis , was reprinted in 2009 in a J Clin Epi issue that took up this theme in a number of papers [1–8]. Of these papers, I found Karanicolas et al [5] particularly helpful for introducing a new distinction that illuminates (and helps to restore) the original sense of Schwartz & Lellouch. (See also the ensuing exchange [6–8] with Oxman et al .) In brief, [5] argues that Schwartz & Lellouch's original focus on constrasting the purposes of trials has been lost in subsequent usage. To restore that focus, [5] articulates a more refined mechanistic-practical contrast, advancing 'practical' trials as those useful for individual-level decision making (doctor-patient) as against 'pragmatic' trials that may appeal to policy-makers wishing to influence the clinical encounter from behind their desks at insurance companies or government agencies. The intrinsically political aspects of this matter have, no doubt, contributed to muddying the concepts. There is an ongoing tension within medicine, between efforts to centrally plan and control the doctor-patient encounter and efforts to preserve (and increasingly, to restore ) the traditional character and independence of the doctor-patient relationship. Probably the phenomenon of pragmatic trials cannot be fully understood without appreciating arguments against industrialized medicine such as Victor Montori (a coauthor of [5]) now prominently advances in his book, Why We Revolt: A patient revolution for careful and kind care .
