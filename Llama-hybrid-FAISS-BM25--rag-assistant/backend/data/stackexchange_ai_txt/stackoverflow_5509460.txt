PostgreSQL Query to Excel Sheet

I need to export some data from PostgreSQL to Excel (quick customer wish), and the last time Excel had serious problems opening or importing my COPYd csv files (line endings, utf-8 encoding, etc), and it took me an hour at best. Does someone know a quick, elegant solution that generates a real Excel file? Like a small shell script or the like? I want this to be done either on my Linux box (Debian 5.0 Lenny) or on Windows (XP or higher).
