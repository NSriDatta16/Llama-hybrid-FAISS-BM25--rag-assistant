one (very) minor optimization that can be done is: double sum = 0, *array; array = (double*) malloc(T * sizeof(double)); double* pStart = array; double* pEnd = array + T; while(pStart this eliminates the addition of t to array for every iteration of the loop, the incrementation of t is replaced by the incrementation of pStart, for small sets of iterations(think less than 3, in that case the loop should be derolled), there is no real gain. the compiler should do this automatically, but sometimes it needs a little encouragement. also depending on the size ranges of T it might be possible to gain performance by using a variable sized array(which would be stack allocated) or aligned _alloca
