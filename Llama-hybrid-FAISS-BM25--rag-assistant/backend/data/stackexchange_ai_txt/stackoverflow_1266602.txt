Is MS Access a viable database for storing narrative, charts, graphs, photos etc?

As mentioned I write a lot of proposals to reply to government RFP's. No matter what the RFP is about most require the same information. It is always narrative, charts, graphs, photos, tables, organizational charts, etc. To save time cutting and pasting and searching old proposals I was wondering if it is possible to create a database in Access to extract the type of data needed?
