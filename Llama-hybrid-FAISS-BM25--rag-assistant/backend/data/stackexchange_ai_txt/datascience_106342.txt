In order to make your model more robust to different wordings, you may try with data augmentation techniques, that is, creating variations of your sentences and adding them to the training set with the same label as the original sentence. There are frameworks like TextAttack that offer several text augmentation techniques. Another option is using back-translation (i.e. translating your sentence into a second language and then translating that again into English), either locally with publicly available machine translation models or via some API like google translate. Note that making fine-tuned language models resistant to this kind of (common) problems is an active area of research. For the latest advances, you can check this NeurIPS'21 article .
