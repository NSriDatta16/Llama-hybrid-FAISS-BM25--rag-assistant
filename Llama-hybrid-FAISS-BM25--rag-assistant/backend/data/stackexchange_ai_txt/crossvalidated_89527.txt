Let's start with the first, best, model: mixed where I've tidied the syntax and removed the extra reference to Accent . This seems reasonable as a starting point. Should you ignore (by leaving out) Noise_Factor ? Surely not, if you don't have to. You put it in there for a reason I presume. Consequently the right hand side of the third model seems underspecified. In the event that it truly has no effect itself and it also does not moderate the effects of anything else then leaving it out would be reasonable, but I assume you are not in a position to assert something that strong. Certainly you don't have to. Is the data set fit better by one of the first or second model? That's very hard to say. The DV in the first and second models are not the same and the models are not nested so any analysis of deviance (or even an R-squared) comparison doesn't seem to make any sense. Are you specifying the DV in the first model correctly? Yes. Recommendation In sum, I'd recommend you start with model one as above. If you wonder about interactions then you can use the anova function to compare models with and without them because they are nested and have the same DV. You might look also to see whether the effect of other covariates vary by subject. Currently subjects vary in the ratio of correct to incorrect responses they make on average, but they might possibly differ in more than that. This is quite straightforward to check in lme4 .
