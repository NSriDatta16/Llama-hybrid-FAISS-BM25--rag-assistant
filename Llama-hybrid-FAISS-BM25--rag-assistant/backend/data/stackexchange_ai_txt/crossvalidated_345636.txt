Which Optimization Technique does CARET use when Training a Model, say glmnet?

I am trying to understand the mechanics behind the training of models. Specifically, I need to know how R's CARET package trains models. Which technique or algorithm is applied? Usually for linear classification models, such as glmnet (logistic regression with regularization), a gradient descent algorithm is used but I connot find any documentation of the proess on the CARET guide . Thanks for any help.
