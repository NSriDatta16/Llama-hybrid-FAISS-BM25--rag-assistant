What is wrong with my logic in a rails hash?

I have a setting in environment/production.rb of HEROKU = true This should change my has_attachment has to use s3 instead of the file system, but it doesn't. What's wrong with my logic? has_attachment :content_type => :image, :storage => ($HEROKU ? :s3 : :file_system), ... Thanks!
