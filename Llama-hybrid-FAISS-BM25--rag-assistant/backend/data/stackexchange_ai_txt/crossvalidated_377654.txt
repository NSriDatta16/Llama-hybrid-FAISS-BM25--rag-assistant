More of an extended comment than of an explicit answer - but too long for comments: 1) A distinction needs to be made between prediction and optimization. Prediction is used to model phenomenon over which we have no control (i.e. we are merely a passive observer) - in your case this is the whether the stock will be trending up or trending down. Optimization is used for variables over which we have control, i.e. we decide what that variable is (i.e. we interact with environment). In your case this whether to buy or sell. There will be several scenarios for example where the stock is trending up, but buying isn't the best decision to take. At the very least, you should have three target values to train your network (1: Buy, 0: Wait, -1: Sell) - but even if you did that, your approach is still problematic because your conflating a prediction problem and a decision/optimization problem. 2) You might be better off using reinforcement learning instead of conventional neural networks. W/R to your problem, reinforcement learning has two advantages: In reinforcement learning, a model is trained to maximize a target function, as opposed to conventional neural networks where the model is trained to minimize a loss function. And reinforcement learning is better suited for problems where the goal is a long term goal, compared to supervised learning.
