Using the Stanford Named Entity Tagger in R

I am experimenting with the Stanford Named Entity Tagger here http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/ner/process and I feel it would be useful in my research. Does anyone know of a example that I could follow so that I could do the analysis in R? Ideally I'd want to provide a string and get back a count (as a list) of the number of organisations, persons, etc recognised in the string. Thanks.
