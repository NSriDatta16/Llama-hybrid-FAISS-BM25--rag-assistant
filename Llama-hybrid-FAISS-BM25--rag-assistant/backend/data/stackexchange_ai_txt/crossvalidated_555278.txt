If Scikit-learn's API doesn't support the sample weights for this model, you can't use it there. In such a case, you would need to code it yourself, for example Keras does support sample weights . Implementing it yourself is rather straightforward, since weighted loss means just that you calculate the overall loss as $\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \; loss_i$ with $w_i > 0$ so multiplying each sample by the weight $w_i$ behaves as if you observed it $w_i$ times more (or less) often in the dataset. Notice however that there are research results ( Byrd and Lipton, 2019 ) showing deep learning models can learn to ignore the weights if trained long enough, so it can be a little bit more tricky fpr this class of algorithms.
