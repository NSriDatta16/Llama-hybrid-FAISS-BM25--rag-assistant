I don't know if you are OK with the Bayes Estimate? If yes, then depending on the Loss function you can obtain different Bayes Estimates. A theorem by Blackwell states that Bayes Estimates are never unbiased. A decision theoretic argument states that every admissible rule ((i.e. or every other rule against which it is compared, there is a value of the parameter for which the the risk of the present rule is (strictly) less than that of rule against which it's being compared)) is a (generalized) Bayes rule. James-Stein Estimators are another class of estimators (which can be derived by Bayesian methods asymptotically) which are better than OLS in many cases. OLS can be inadmissible in many situations and James-Stein Estimator is an example. (also called Stein's paradox).
