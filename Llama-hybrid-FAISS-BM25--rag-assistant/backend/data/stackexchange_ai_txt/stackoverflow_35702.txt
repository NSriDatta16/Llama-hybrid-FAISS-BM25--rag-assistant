A multi-agent system is a concept borrowed from AI. It's almost like a virtual world where you have agents that are able to observe, communicate, and react. To give an example, you might have a memory allocation agent that you have to ask for memory and it decides whether or not to give it to you. Or you might have an agent that monitors a web server and restarts it if it hangs. The main goal behind multiagent systems is to have a more Smalltalk-like communication system between different parts of the system in order to get everything to work together, as opposed to more top-down directives that come from a central program.
