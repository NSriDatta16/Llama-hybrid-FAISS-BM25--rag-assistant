PreparedStatement pStmt = // ... however you make it pStmt.setFetchSize( /* desired number of records to get into memory */ ); Note, setFetchSize(int) is only a hint - last time I was using it with MySQL for example, it wasn't supported. Looking around briefly at the Oracle documentation, it looks like their JDBC does support it. I wouldn't quote me on that, but it's worth trying at least; and yes, this answer is fragile, but it might be enough less headache than implementing the robust solution. Essentially, you can issue the request for everything, and you only get the fetch size into memory at a time (providing you're not holding onto the previous results). So you'd set your fetch size to 50, make your connection/query, display the first 50 results (causing the another fetch for the next bite of your query) and so on.
