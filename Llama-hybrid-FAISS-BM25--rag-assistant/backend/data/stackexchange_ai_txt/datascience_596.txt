Network analysis classic datasets

There are several classic datasets for machine learning classification/regression tasks. The most popular are: Iris Flower Data Set ; Titanic Data Set ; Motor Trend Cars ; etc. But does anyone know similar datasets for networks analysis / graph theory? More concrete - I'm looking for Gold standard datasets for comparing/evaluating/learning: centrality measures; network clustering algorithms. I don't need a huge list of publicly available networks/graphs, but a couple of actually must-know datasets. EDIT: It's quite difficult to provide exact features for "gold standard dataset", but here are some thoughts. I think, real classic dataset should satisfy these criteria: Multiple references in articles and textbooks; Inclusion in well-known network analysis software packages; Sufficient time of existence; Usage in a number of courses on graph analysis. Concerning my field of interest, I also need labeled classes for vertices and/or precomputed (or predefined) "authority scores" (i.e. centrality estimates). After asking this question I continued searching, and here are some suitable examples: Zachary's Karate Club : introduced in 1977, cited more than 1.5k times (according to Google Scholar), vertexes have attribute Faction (which can be used for clustering). Erdos Collaboration Network : unfortunately, I haven't find this network in form of data-file, but it's rather famous, and if someone will enrich network with mathematicians' specialisations data, it also could be used for testing clustering algorithms.
