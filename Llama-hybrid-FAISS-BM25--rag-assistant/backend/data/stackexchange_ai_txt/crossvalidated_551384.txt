In my research group, we calculate the Dice coefficient for the separate image sets. Here are some papers in which this method is used: [1,2,3]. We are currently writing another paper in which we use the same method. The reason for this is that you can not only report the average Dice, but also the range (worst Dice - best Dice) and standard deviation. In my opinion, this is a far more intuitive way of calculating the Dice than concatenating all image sets into one. Good luck! [1] Linderup BW, Küseler A, Jensen J, Cattaneo PM (2015).
