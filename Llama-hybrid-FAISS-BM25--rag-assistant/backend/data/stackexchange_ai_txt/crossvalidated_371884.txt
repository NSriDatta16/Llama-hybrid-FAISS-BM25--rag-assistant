This is something that I think you can do in two steps. I had the very same problem years ago, but that was before I knew too much about ML. What I think would work really well for name identification is a recurrent neural network. Because it's really the sequence of odd letters and numbers that hints at a spammy name, vs a more normal name. IE A name like 9b02ngd9dbee is different from 2beegee1992. A RNN would be perfectly suited for that type of classifying problem. Then, you combine that with the other features that you mentioned, the order amount, maybe frequency of orders etc... as raw inputs into a really simple fully connected layers of a network then have that be the end result.
