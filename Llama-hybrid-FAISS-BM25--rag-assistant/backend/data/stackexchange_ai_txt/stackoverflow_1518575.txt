I haven't used Prestashop but I have recently deployed a Magento store. As others have said, I wouldn't suggest it for small, simple stores. Also, if you are on an economy server, you're likely to have sluggish page loads. The good news is that (after a steep learning curve), it's incredibly flexible and powerful. I personally think the templating system is great.
