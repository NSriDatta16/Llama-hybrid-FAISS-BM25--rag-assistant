Bayesian- If I only have prior distribution, is there a way to calculate posterior distribution?

I have a question about Bayesian inference. In my research, I have only a normal prior distribution with known parameters (mean and std.). I do not have a likelihood function, but I need to calculate a posterior distribution parameters (mean and std.). Is it possible that I only use the prior as input, and through monte carlo simulation (it is not the MCMC, but only monte carlo simulation that give random generated numbers around my prior known mean and std.). In this way, is it possible to use the final stimulated random numbers as the posterior parameters? Thank you!
