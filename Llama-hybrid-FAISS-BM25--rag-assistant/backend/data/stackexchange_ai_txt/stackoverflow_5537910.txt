To begin with styling an iframe is a little headache, or at-least that is what my designer told me ;) The easiest solution would be to add the styles directly in the template of the node type that you are trying to display in lightbox. This would work if you lightbox is the only place where you are displaying that node. This is a working solution but not an elegant one. Would appreciate if somebody can come with a more elegant solution.
