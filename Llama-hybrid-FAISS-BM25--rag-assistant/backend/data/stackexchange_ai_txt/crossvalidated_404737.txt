This warning (not an error) is informing you that the seasonal unit root test (used to select the number of seasonal differences, D) has errored. Admittedly, the message is not very informative for why this has happened. In your case, an STL decomposition cannot be performed because your data contains less than two seasonal windows after the first seasonal difference. This is necessary to use the nsdiffs(y, test = "seas") , or auto.arima(y, seasonal.test = "seas") which are both defaults. Note that the message informs you that D=1 has been selected for this data. The test for D=2 failed due to insufficient available data (generally one seasonal difference is sufficient, however you should check this visually or with other unit root tests). I've now improved this message to now also include the error message for why the test has failed: https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast/commit/eebea5ee93cd8b125d5220c54721895b57396157 library(forecast) fit Warning: The time series frequency has been rounded to support seasonal #> differencing. #> Warning: The chosen seasonal unit root test encountered an error when testing for the second difference. #> From stl(): series is not periodic or has less than two periods #> 1 seasonal differences will be used.
