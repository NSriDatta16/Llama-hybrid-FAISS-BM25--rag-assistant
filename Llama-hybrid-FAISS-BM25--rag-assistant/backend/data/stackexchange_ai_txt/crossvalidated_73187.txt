It's very difficult to add to the constellation of stars that are already listed, but for interest purposes I will throw in the improbable polymath John Maynard Keynes who many would not realize published A Treatise on Probability (1921) that can be downloaded here ; and whose work was quoted frequently by Harold Jeffreys (1939). Keynes by all accounts helped to bring forward Bayesian statistics and in his treatise considered the most important principle to be the Principle of Indifference . According to Wikipedia, The "Principle of insufficient reason" was renamed the "Principle of Indifference" by the economist John Maynard Keynes (1921), who was careful to note that it applies only when there is no knowledge indicating unequal probabilities.
