If the struct contains pointers, the value of all bits zero as produced by memset may not mean the same as assigning a 0 to it in the C (or C++) code, i.e. a NULL pointer. (It might also be the case with floats and doubles , but that I've never encountered. However, I don't think the standards guarantee them to become zero with memset either.) Edit: From a more pragmatic perspective, I'd still say to not use memset when possible to avoid, as it is an additional function call, longer to write, and (in my opinion) less clear in intent than = { 0 } .
