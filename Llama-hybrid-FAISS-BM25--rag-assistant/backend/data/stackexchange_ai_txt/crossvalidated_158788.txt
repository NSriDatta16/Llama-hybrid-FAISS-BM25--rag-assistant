Both time series have exactly the same autocovariance function . What does it imply ? What is the message of the example ? That the autocovariance function (which is something we estimate based on the data available), in general, does not uniquely identify the process . A related discussion can be found in Jenkins and Watts (1968), "Spectral Analysis and its Applications" (ch. 5.26, p. 170): "A stochastic process is said to be Gaussian or Normal if the multivariate distribution associated with an arbitrarily chosen set of points is multivariate Normal. Then the process is completely characterized by its mean, variance and acf (autocorrelation function). However, there will be a very wide class of non-Normal processes which have the same acf as a given Normal process but which differ markedly from it in other respects." They offer a specific example after the above passage, and they conclude that higher-order moments should come into the picture.
