Quick reactions: It sounds like you're asking about how to separate tomatoes from olive oil from peppers etc... after it's all been mixed together in tomato sauce $y_t$. It's actually even worse than that because at least you know what peppers look like, there's some way to identify individual components. If you tell me $a + b + c + d + e = 10$, how can I possibly determine what $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$ are? It's an undetermined system. There are quite a few questions on here of the form, "I don't have some data Z, but I'd like to have it. Is there something magic I can do?" And the answer generally is no. You do have the $x_{t,1}$, $x_{t,2}$, $\ldots$, $x_{t,5}$ series though. If you assume that $\frac{\hat{y}_{i,t}}{y_t} \approx \frac{x_{i,t}}{x_t}$ then you perhaps could try the following: Something ad-hoc?: For $i=1,\ldots,k$, let $a_{t,i} = \frac{x_{t,i}}{x_t}$ where $x_t = \sum_{i=1}^5 x_{t,i}$. You could try something ad-hoc like $\hat{y}_{t,i} = a_{t,i} y_t = x_{t,i} \left(\frac{y_t}{x_t}\right)$, the idea being the shares are the same $\frac{\hat{y}_{i,t}}{y_t} = \frac{x_{i,t}}{x_t}$. Realize though that you'd just be rescaling the five $x_{t,i}$ series so that they total to $y_t$ instead. This isn't magic. And I don't know if it would be at all useful. If you really have a ton of information that you've been holding back... Let $\mathbf{y}_t = \begin{bmatrix} y_{t,1} \\ y_{t,2} \\ \ldots \\ y_{t,5} \end{bmatrix}$. You don't observe $\mathbf{y}_t$ but if you have other data $\mathbf{z}_t = f(\mathbf{y}_t)$, and process $\mathbf{y}_t$ satisfies the Markov property, then you could treat this is as a Hidden Markov Model and try to infer the hidden state through some Bayesian filter . For example, $\mathbf{y}_t$ could be a state variable describing the location, speed of a rocket, and you try to infer this hidden state based upon instrument readings. For this to work, you need some strong theory about how $\mathbf{y}_t$ evolves and how other data you do observe is related to $\mathbf{y}_t$. But this doesn't sound like the situation that you're in.
