Estimation of Bayesian Ridge Regression

According to scikit-learn , by using a probabilistic model : $p(y|X,\omega,\alpha) = \mathcal{N}(y|X\omega,\alpha)$ with $\omega$ given by a spherical Gaussian: $p(\omega|\lambda) = \mathcal{N}(\omega|0,\lambda^{-1}\mathbf{I_p})$ it is now a Bayesian model of ridge regression. So can i say that the estimation of this model on unknown data $X^*$ is a probability distribution on y with mean $\mu$ = $X\omega$ and variance $\sigma^2 = \alpha$ or $\sigma^2=\lambda^{-1}\mathbf{I_p}$ ? What exactly do $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ do in the equations ?
