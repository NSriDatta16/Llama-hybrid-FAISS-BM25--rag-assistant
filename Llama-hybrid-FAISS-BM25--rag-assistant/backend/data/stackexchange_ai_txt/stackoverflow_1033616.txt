Hoptoad is my preferred exception notifier by a landslide. It's intelligent about the emails it sends me, and it's web interface does a nice job of automatically organizing all of the exceptions. If I make a change that causes an error, I'll likely get several of the same error messages, so Hoptoad sends me an email, and in the web interface I might see something like 4 of the same error, I can click through to the details, patch the bug, and with one click check them off as fixed. It's a really nice clean way of handling exceptions and strikes me as far less intrusive/ghetto.
