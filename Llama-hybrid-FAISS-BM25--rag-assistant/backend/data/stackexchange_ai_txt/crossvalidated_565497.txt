As I am cited here, I guess it is fair that I should comment. There are two issues with calculating CIs / p-values on model-averaged coefficients. The first is that model-averaged coefficients inherit all the problems that arise in calculating CIs on ensemble estimators in general. We discussed those in detail in Dormann et al., Model averaging in ecology: a review of Bayesian, information-theoretic, and tactical approaches for predictive inference https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecm.1309 (see in particular section on Quantifying uncertainty of model-averaged predictions ). The bottomline of this discussion is that it is exceedingly difficult to guarantee nominal coverage on CIs of model ensembles, due to the difficulty to estimate the correlation between the estimators of the individual models, and that the existing approaches, which all make some kind of approximation, can be quite wrong. The second point is specific for model-averaged coefficients, and this is what we show in the presentation: conditional and unconditional model-averaged coefficients are in general not unbiased, which further complicates the establishment of CIs with nominal coverage.
