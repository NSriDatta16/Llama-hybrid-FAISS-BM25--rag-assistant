The word "returning" is tricky here. The primary virtue of multi-tier design is orthogonality. You should be able to call the classes in your BLL from an entirely different UI than the one you're currently using and handle logging completely differently. If an exception is able to be handled without user intervention or notification, you should generally do so within the BLL. If the exception needs to be brought to the user's attention or logged, let it bubble up to the UI, which can implement notification and logging without building such things into the BLL.
