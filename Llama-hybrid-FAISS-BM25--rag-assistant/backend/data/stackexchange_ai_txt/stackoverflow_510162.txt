You are really going to do a little bit more homework here, I doubt its ZenTest: Grab a version of your code when stuff was great and dandy a few months ago. Run all the tests, output all the test durations to a spreadsheet or something. Grab a current version of your code base and repeat the process in 1) If durations are the same, something about your DB configuration or machine config has changed If all the tests are slower on average this is a hard one to diagnose, but it would seem that there is a new bit of code thats running in each test. If a handful of new tests are really slow, fix them.
