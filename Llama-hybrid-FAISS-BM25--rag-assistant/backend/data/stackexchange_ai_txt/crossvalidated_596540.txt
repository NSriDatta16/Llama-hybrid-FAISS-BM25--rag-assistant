How to estimate the probability distribution of the next point in a time series if the autocorrelation function is known

Let's consider a time-series $\{X_i\}_{i\in [1, N]}$ such that $X_i, X_j$ identically distributed as priori but are not necessarily indepedent. In fact, let's consider the two-point correlation function $$ g_X(i-j) = E(X_i X_j) - E(X_i)E(X_j). $$ Let's suppose that $g(x)$ has the form of $e^{-\tau x}$ where $\tau$ is a finite, nonzero real number. Suppose that we know the function $g_X$ and observed the random variable $X_1$ and learned it has the outcome $x_1$ . how can we use the knowledge of $g_X$ to derive a probability distribution for $X_2$ given that we know that outcome of $X_1$ is $x_1$ ? Addendum: The motive behind this question is the following: In physics, for instance, we typically look at the two-point correlation between two time-series and if the two-point correlation for at least one-time lag is significantly higher, then we say that these two-time series are correlated with a time lag... So, calculating the two-point correlation function helped us whether these two-time series are correlated or not (binary information), but if I want to know more about one of the time series only by observing the other time series, a binary correlated-not-correlated doesn't provide me with any quantitative information. I want to be able to use the two-point correlation function and observe only one of the time series in order to make quantitative inferences on the other time-series.
