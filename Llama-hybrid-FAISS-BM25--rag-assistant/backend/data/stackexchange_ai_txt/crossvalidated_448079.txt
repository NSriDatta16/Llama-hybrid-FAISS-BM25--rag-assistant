One option would be to use a Bayesian structural time series model with daily/weekly/monthly/whatever sales as the series of interest and price as a covariate. The big advantage of a multivariate time-series approach would be the ability to account for other things that might be affecting sales before and after the price change as well, e.g., seasonal effects, sales of related items, whatever you think might be relevant. If the price change had a significant effect, then you would expect to see a negative coefficient and a high inclusion probability for that feature. See here and here for some discussions of the technique and its implementation in R.
