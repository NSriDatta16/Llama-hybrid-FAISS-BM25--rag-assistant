Can't comment on other answers, so i have to create my own answer. Posterior = C * Likelihood * Prior (C is a constant that makes Posterior integrated to 1) Given a model that uses Binomial distribution for likelihood, and Beta distribution for Prior. The product of the two which generates the Posterior is also a Beta distribution. Since the Prior and Posterior are both Beta, and thus they are conjugate distributions . the Prior (a Beta) is called conjugate prior for the likelihood (a Binomial). For example, if you multiply a Beta with a Normal, the Posterior is no longer a Beta. In summary, Beta and Binomial are two distributions that are frequently used in Bayesian inference. Beta is Conjugate Prior of Binomial, but the two distributions are not a subset or superset of the other. The key idea of Bayesian inference is we are treating the parameter p as a random variable that ranges from [0,1] which is contrary to frequentist inference approach where we are treating parameter p as fixed. If you look closely to the properties of Beta distribution, you will see its Mean and Mode are solely determined by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ irrelevant to the parameter p . This, coupled with its flexibility, is why Beta is usually used as a Prior.
