_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks( ) == 1 on first line of code?

I'm working on an MFC Visual C++ project. As I understand from MSDN , _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks() should return TRUE when there are memory leaks. After noticing it is TRUE, I tried to find the first point in the code where it becomes TRUE. Evidently, it is TRUE right from the very start. If I click F10 (step-over) to start debugging the program, and enter _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks() in the watch window, it shows TRUE even before the first line of code, in the entry point to the program: extern "C" int WINAPI _tWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, _In_ LPTSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow) #pragma warning(suppress: 4985) { // call shared/exported WinMain return AfxWinMain(hInstance, hPrevInstance, lpCmdLine, nCmdShow); } Also, I speculated that maybe the debugging facilities are not initialized at that point and that the TRUE is erroneous. So I set a breakpoint at the first line in the OnInitDialog() function and there too the value is TRUE. How come I have memory leaks that early in the program?
