At least two options: 1) Use the categorization you list and then crosstabulate the original method with the approximate one 2) Keep $\epsilon_i$ as is and then do logistic regression with the true value (original classification) as the dependent variable and $\epsilon$ as the indepnedent variable. (As an aside, $\epsilon$ is usually used for the error term. You might want to call it something else if you write this up - just to avoid confusion)
