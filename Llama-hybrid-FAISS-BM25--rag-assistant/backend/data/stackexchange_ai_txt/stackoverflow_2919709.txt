PHP HTML CSS Beginner USE CASE / SWITCH / IF ELSE? Need advice

Building a website using a PHP based Ecommerce product Magento. The problem I have is that I want to use tabbed navigation. My idea was to use CSS to show the TAB over the relevant Navigation menu item based on the URL. However, one URL always changes, so I wanted to somehow use an ifelse statement. I've come up with two methods that I think could work, could any experts tell me what they would think is best and how they would implement it? Method 1 class="active" >Welcome class="active" >About us class="active" >Services class="active" >Testimonials class="active" >Contact us else class="active" >Store Method 2 $URL = store.php; SWITCH ($sample) { CASE home.php: class="active" >Welcome break; CASE services.php: class="active" >Services break; CASE aboutus.php: class="active" >About us break; DEFAULT: class="active" >Store }
