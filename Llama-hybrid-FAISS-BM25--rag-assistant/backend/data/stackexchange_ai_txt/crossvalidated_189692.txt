Deep Learning for Regression

I have dataset of 15 features and the goal is to estimate a best fitting curve (regression). Now I want to use a deep learning technique for this purpose. Now I see that there are many architectures that can be used such as CNN, DBM or auto-encoder, etc.. Which one to go for. And I could not find any examples for how to use the same. A sample code would be of great help. Thanks P.S. Some of the features are categorical. How do we handle that as well?
