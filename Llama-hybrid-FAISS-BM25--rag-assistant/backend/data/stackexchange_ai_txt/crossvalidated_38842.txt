I did get Kalman cleared after reading 'Kalman Filter for Beginners with Matlab examples' by Phil Kim http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8u_XwAACAAJ&dq=kalman+filter+phil+kim&source=bl&ots=N-I0YhBX_U&sig=pcfeeEGHYmYDr7bockF5kSIMM_s&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ir5xUM3gM8Op0QWI8YDwDQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA The book starts with some basic idea like recursion, moving average, low pass filter, to move to implementation of Kalman. There are Matlab's examples, which you can try by yourself and there is no space to any unclear method or derivation. The book treat Kalman Filter from practical point of view and all mathematics are left for more advanced books. Maybe after this book you will not be an expert but for sure you will know how to start to be an expert, and how to use Kalman straight away.
