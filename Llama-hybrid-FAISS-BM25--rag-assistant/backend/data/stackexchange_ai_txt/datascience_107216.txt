multiple images inside one large CSV file

I'm very new to data science, and was admiring how people had made these massive open-source datasets, on places like kaggle. I noticed that all of the datasets where all in CSV format. I have lots of images that I'd like to upload to kaggle for everyone to use, although don't know how to convert my images to CSV. (I can't upload them as individual images because there is a limit of 1000 files, which is not enough for a lot of small images). Thanks in advance, Tom P.S. The simpler the explanation the better. I've got some experience in python but not in this area.
