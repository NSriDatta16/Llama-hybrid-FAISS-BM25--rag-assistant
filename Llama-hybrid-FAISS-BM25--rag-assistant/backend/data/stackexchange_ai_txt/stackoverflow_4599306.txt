How can I create a draggable item in a web application?

first time creating something like this. How would I create a hotbar type rectangle where I can drag icons and have them lock into a space in the hotbar? This is 100% for my learning purposes and I'm aware I'd need something like Javascript. The thing is I don't know where to begin to tackle this. Just a simple example. Create a group of 3 icons and be able to click and drag around the icons in my page.
