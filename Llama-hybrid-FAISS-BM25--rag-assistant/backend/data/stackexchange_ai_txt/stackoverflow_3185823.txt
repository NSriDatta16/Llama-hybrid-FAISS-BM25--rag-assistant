Do you mean something like: (define (fv n pv r) (if (= n 0) pv (fv (- n 1) (* pv (+ 1 r)) r))) where the value of pv is replaced by the value at the end of the period, and the number of periods is reduced by one each recursion. SICP has good coverage of how to structure recursion --- it's worth a read.
