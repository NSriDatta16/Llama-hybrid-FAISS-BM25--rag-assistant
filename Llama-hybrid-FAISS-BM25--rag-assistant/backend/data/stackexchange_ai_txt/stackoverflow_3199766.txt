silverlight redirect to login page

I have a silverlight app where the users what a logout timer. So I use a timer and then after 10 mins i call HtmlPage.Window.Navigate(new Uri(loginPageUrl)); But the user can still just use the Back Arrow to return to the silverlight app. Is there any way to prevent that? I have added some code to the asp page, as below, but that does not seem to help. Response.Expires = -1; Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "No-Cache"); Response.CacheControl = "no-cache"; Any idea's or other suggestions?
