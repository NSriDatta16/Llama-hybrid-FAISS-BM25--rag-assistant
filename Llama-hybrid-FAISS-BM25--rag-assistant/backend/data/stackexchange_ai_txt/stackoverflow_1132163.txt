OpenFileDialog does not browse the folders under .NET CF

I have an WinMo app and I would like to open a file from the storage card. The file is NOT in the root but within the folder structure. I thought OpenFileDialog would do the trick just as it does under regular .NET. But it does not offer me to navigate over the folders. I looks really lame. Or am I just outstandingly stupid?
