On a modern PC, workstation, or server machine, the answer to "Is it the Random Access Memory or the hard drive?" is: neither . It's allocated in virtual memory . When it's first allocated, the virtual address given to you likely has no physical existence whatsoever. On the first access, it will be physically instantiated in RAM, but it may be later moved to storage on a disk or other swap device if RAM is needed for other uses. Upon a subsequent attempt to access it, it will again be moved back into RAM. This is just the very very basic explanation of virtual memory. If you really want to understand, go read some articles on Wikipedia or Google for it.
