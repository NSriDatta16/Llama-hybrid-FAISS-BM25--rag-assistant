Idiomatic clojure question on sequence transformation

I am learning Clojure, and I need a push in the right direction with this problem I came up with. I have a sequence of events. Each event includes a 'date'. (def events [ [1509 :marry "Catherine of Aragon"] [1527 :unmarry "Catherine of Aragon"] [1533 :marry "Anne Boleyn"] [1536 :unmarry "Anne Boleyn"] [1536 :marry "Jane Seymour"] [1537 :unmarry "Jane Seymour"] [1540 :marry "Anne of Cleves"] [1540 :unmarry "Anne of Cleves"] [1540 :marry "Catherine Howard"] [1542 :unmarry "Catherine Howard"] [1543 :marry "Catherine Parr"]]) I want to convert this into a lazy timeline, i.e. a sequence containing one vector per year. Starting with the year of the first event, and continuing to infinity. [[[:marry "Catherine of Aragon"]] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [[:unmarry "Catherine of Aragon"]] [] [] [] [] [] [[:marry "Ane Boleyn"]] [] [] [[:unmarry "Anne Boleyn"] [:marry "Jayne Seymour"]] ...]
