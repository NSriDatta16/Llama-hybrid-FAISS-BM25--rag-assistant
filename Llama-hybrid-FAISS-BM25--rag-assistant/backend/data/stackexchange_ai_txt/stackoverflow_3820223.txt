Hi I found the way It wasnt Complicated: 1-creat a Visual studio project such as console or winform or .. 2-add a class diagram to the project 3-go to View--->class view,now you can see class view panel 4-exapand the Project refrence node. and you can find .net dlls that your project refers to them 5-Now Drag your favorite dll into class diagram Editor 6-now you have a high level schema from inside of the dll and you have options to Rearange them and wok with the dagram but there is one thing,It seems that we could only see The Association Relation and unfortunately thers not more details such as aggregation and ... i think there must be some advanced tools and helpful utilities that enhance working with diagram its great anyone could help and introduce them
