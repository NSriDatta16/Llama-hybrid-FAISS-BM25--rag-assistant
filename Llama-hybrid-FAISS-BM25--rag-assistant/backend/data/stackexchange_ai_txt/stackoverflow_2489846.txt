Pros and Cons of automating Excel using VBA vs .Net

I've been tasked with creating a financial planning tool in Excel that would benefit from some custom functions/macros. My initial reaction was to use VBA. I've used it to drive Excel before (say 5 years ago). But I then began to wonder if I would be better off using VSTO. Has anyone has experience using both techs and can list the pros and cons so that I can evaluate which course would be best.
