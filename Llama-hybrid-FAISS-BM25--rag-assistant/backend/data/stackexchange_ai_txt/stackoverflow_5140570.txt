This is not basic testing, but requires non-trivial analysis of the token stream. You can either use phpmd scans PHP source code and looks for potential problems such as possible bugs, dead code, suboptimal code, and overcomplicated expressions phpcs phpcs tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards. It is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent. It can also help prevent some common semantic errors made by developers. or - if that doesn't suffice - look at the bytecode level with bytekit-cli bytekit-cli provides a command-line tool that leverages the Bytekit extension to perform common code analysis tasks on the PHP bytecode level. You will have to write you own sniffs for that. Further tools and resources: http://phpqatools.org/
