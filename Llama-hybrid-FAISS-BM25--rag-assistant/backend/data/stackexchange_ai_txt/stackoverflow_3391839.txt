Why do I get this syntax error in my code generating program?

I want to generate some lines of Perl code by using file handling in Perl, for example: open(FILEHANDLE, ">ex.pl") or die "cannot open file for reading: $!"; print FILEHANDLE "use LWP::UserAgent;" .... .... some code is here .... print FILEHANDLE "my \$ua = new LWP::UserAgent(agent => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5');" But when I compile the generator code (not the generated) I get this error: syntax error at F:\test\sys.pl line 14, near "print" Execution of F:\test\sys.pl aborted due to compilation errors. What am I going to do?
