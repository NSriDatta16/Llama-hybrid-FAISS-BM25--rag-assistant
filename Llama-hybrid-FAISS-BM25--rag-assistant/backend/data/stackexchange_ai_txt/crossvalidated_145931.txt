Masked variables in logistic regression

I have a logistic regression model with variables $V_1$ through $V_n$. When I build a full model with all of the variables, I find that $V_1$ and $V_2$ are significant. However, when I build a new model in which I remove $V_1$, I find that, in addition to $V_2$, $V_3$ is now significant. I assume this occurs because $V_1$ and $V_3$ are correlated, so that all the information $V_3$ is captured in $V_1$ in the full model. $V_3$ is of particular interest to me given my hypothesis, so I’d like to know what it’s reasonable to say about $V_3$ in terms of significance. Can I still report that $V_3$ is significant even though it’s masked by $V_1$? Are there further tests I can do that would be informative here?
