Comparison of Forecast Method for weather data, could I just use fitted curve or do I really need Out of Sample result?

I am trying to compare some method of forecasting on wind speed data that I have. Validation method I saw often use RMSE and MAE. So I am planning to observe these values on different forecast method. It is just in most paper I read the picture graph they only show curve fitted not out of sample graph. So I am kinda confused , could I really just use observation of fitted graph? Another question if you do not mind, is there recommendation of other method that I could compare with ARIMA? Currently SVM and Holt-Winters are a candidate but, I want to see if there are other method better suited for the 1 year wind speed data that I have. Thanks in Advance.
