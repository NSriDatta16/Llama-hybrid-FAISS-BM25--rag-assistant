You're correct. If a classifier is a "shoebox" and does nothing, then for $n=100$ objects (5 of which are 1 and 95 are 0), the accuracy is 95% since everything is classified as zero and only 5/100 are incorrectly classified. However, sens/spec will not be 95%. Have you tried logistic regression or using linear regression with $y=+1$ for class 1 objects and $y=-1$ for objects in class 0 (assign objects to class 1 if predicted $y>0$)? For the SVM, there are several different kernels which can be used, like linear, polynomial, Gaussian radial basis (RBF). So try the Gaussian RBF kernel and see what happens, since it's best for data that are not straightforwardly linearly separable, but rather take on a alternating checkerboard distribution of class memberships. Let $a$ be the true positives ($TP$), $b$ the false positives ($FP$), $c$ the false negatives ($FN$), and $d$ the true negative ($TN$). Under these definitions, sensitivity is the proportion of diseased subjects who have a positive test, defined as \begin{equation} sensitivity=\frac{a}{a+c}=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}. \end{equation} On the other hand, the specificity is the proportion of disease-free subjects with a negative test \begin{equation} specificity=\frac{d}{d+b}=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}. \end{equation}
