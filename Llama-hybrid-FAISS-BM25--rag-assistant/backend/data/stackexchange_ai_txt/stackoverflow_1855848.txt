The in-built Dictionary object (preferably a generic dictionary) would be ideal for this, and is specifically designed for fast/efficient retrieval of the values relating to the keys. From the linked MSDN article: Retrieving a value by using its key is very fast, close to O(1), because the Dictionary )>) class is implemented as a hash table. As far as your "reserved" keys go, I wouldn't worry about that at all if we're only talking about a few hundred keys/values. It's only when you reach tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of "reserved" keys/values that you'll want to implement something more efficient. In those cases, probably the most efficient storage container then would be an implementation of a Sparse Matrix .
