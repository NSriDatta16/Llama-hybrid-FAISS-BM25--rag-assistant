Do you need to be in DCIM folder? I think the preferred folder is Pictures. Here you have a link to the explanation on how to use shared folders: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html Saving files that should be shared If you want to save files that are not specific to your application and that should not be deleted when your application is uninstalled, save them to one of the public directories on the external storage. These directories lay at the root of the external storage, such as Music/, Pictures/, Ringtones/, and others. In API Level 8 or greater, use getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(), passing it the type of public directory you want, such as DIRECTORY_MUSIC, DIRECTORY_PICTURES, DIRECTORY_RINGTONES, or others. This method will create the appropriate directory if necessary. If you're using API Level 7 or lower, use getExternalStorageDirectory() to open a File that represents the root of the external storage, then save your shared files in one of the following directories: Music/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as user music. Podcasts/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a podcast. Ringtones/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a ringtone. Alarms/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as an alarm sound. Notifications/ - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a notification sound. Pictures/ - All photos (excluding those taken with the camera). Movies/ - All movies (excluding those taken with the camcorder). Download/ - Miscellaneous downloads.
