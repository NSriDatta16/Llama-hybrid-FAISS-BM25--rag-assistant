context within a query filter?

I have a very basic contact model. The model has the following fields: class Entry(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=64, unique=False) organization = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=False, blank=True, null=True) team = models.CharField(max_length=64, unique=False, blank=True, null=True) position = models.CharField(max_length=64, unique=False, blank=True, null=True) address = models.CharField(max_length=130, unique=False, blank=True, null=True) ... def __unicode__(self): return u'%s' % self.name I have different templates to display/edit individual entries. I'd like to accomplish the following. When viewing an individual record, I'd like the user to be able to click on "organization" and be redirected to a template that lists all of the existing records in the db from that organization. I've built the template but I'm unsure of the view code. I feel like it should be something like this, but I don't think it's legal. def display_organization(request): records = Entry.objects.filter(organization__exact=Context) t = get_template('org_list.html') html = t.render(Context({'records': records})) return HttpResponse(html) Can anyone assist?
