Bayesian decision theory - loss function

i am trying to learn bayesian decision theory. the book that i am using (Kevin Murphy: Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective) - has the following introduction on the action a: however - further in the text it refers to P(a|x) i am finding it hard to fully understand what P(a|x) means. i read it as hte probability of a certain action a conditional on the covariates x, but i am not sure that this is correct, or how the probability of this action is linked to the loss function. Any help much appreciated.
