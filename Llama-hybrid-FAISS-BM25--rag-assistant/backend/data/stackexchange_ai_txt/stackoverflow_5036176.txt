Moving average - MySQL

I'm trying to implement system-wide login throttling and I need to calculate the daily average number of failed login attempts from the last 3 months. I'm currently inserting a record on every login fail, each with a timestamp. How can I do this in MySQL? Thanks in advance for your help
