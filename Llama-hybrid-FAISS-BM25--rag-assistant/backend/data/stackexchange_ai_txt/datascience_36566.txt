Database for storing nested s3 objects from broom, sweep, or tidy in R

I'm working on a product that requires automated forecasting of time-series data in R & Shiny. Using R's sweep, broom, & tidy packages, I get these 'tibbles', which are like dataframes with nested objects. See below. In order to scale the product, I have to figure out where to store my data - currently keeping them in local .RData files. Need to separate the data storage from the application. Is there a way to reliably store this data in it's native format, or do I have to parse each of these nested objects to separate tables for a traditional database?
