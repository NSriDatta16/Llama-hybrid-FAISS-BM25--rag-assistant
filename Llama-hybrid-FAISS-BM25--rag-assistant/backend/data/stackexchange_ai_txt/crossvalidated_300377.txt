Identify two major change points in time series data and summarise for several replicates in R

I'm working with temporal simulations (forward in time) and I would like to find the best way to detect the two major change points in this time series. I have several replicates of the same simulation, then my idea was to collect the two change points identified for each replicate and average 1) the first change point among replicates; and 2) the second change point among replicates. I found the package tsoutliers but does not find what I would expect. This is an example of one replicate. The data are not continuous in the sense that I'm collecting data with an interval time of 50. data Do you have any suggestion on which method would be the best? The other option I was considering is to obtain the mean and variance for each time point and make pairwise statistical test for consecutive time points.
