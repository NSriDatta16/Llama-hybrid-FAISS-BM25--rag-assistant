They're both applying regression by estimating the parameters of the same logistic-transformed model. According to the properties of convex functions, the values of the parameters will be the same any way you choose to estimate them. To quote myself from a previous answer: Logistic regression models a function of the mean of a Bernoulli distribution as a linear equation (the mean being equal to the probability p of a Bernoulli event). By using the logit link as a function of the mean (p), the logarithm of the odds (log-odds) can be derived analytically and used as the response of a so-called generalised linear model. On top of prediction, this allows you to interpret the model in causal inference. This is something that you cannot achieve with a linear Perceptron. The Perceptron, takes the inverse logit (logistic) function of wx, and doesn't use probabilistic assumptions for neither the model nor its parameter. Online training will give you exactly the same estimates for the model weights/parameters, but you won't be able to interpret them in causal inference due to the lack of p-values, confidence intervals, and well, an underlying probability model.
