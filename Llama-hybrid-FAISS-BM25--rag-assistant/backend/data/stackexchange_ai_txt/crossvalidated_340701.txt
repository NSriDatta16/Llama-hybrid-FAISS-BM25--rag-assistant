If you want to model data that essentially follow a normal distribution for the positive values but have a point mass at zero, you could start with a Gaussian model censored at zero. In the econometric literature this is known as the tobit model. The next step would be to fit a two-part model with (1) a binary hurdle for zero vs. non-zero (e.g., using a probit link, corresponding to an underlying Gaussian distribution) and (2) a zero-truncated Gaussian model for the positive observations. In the econometrics literature this is known as the Cragg model. The tobit model is nested in the Cragg model, namely if the scaled coefficients from both parts coincide. See also: Is a "hurdle model" really one model? Or just two separate, sequential models? A potential caveat is that while the usual (un-censored and un-truncated) Gaussian regression is consistent under heteroscedasticity, the same does not hold for the censored and truncated versions. Hence, taking heteroscedasticity into account might matter. An R package that implements heteroscedastic censored or truncated models is crch at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=crch . A paper introducing the package along with a worked example that compares the censored model with the two-part hurdle model is Messner, Mayr, Zeileis (2016), "Heteroscedastic Censored and Truncated Regression with crch", "The R Journal", 8 (1), 173-181. https://journal.R-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-012/
