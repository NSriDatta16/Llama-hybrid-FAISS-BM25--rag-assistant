Each single DDL statement is a discrete transaction. This is because databases need manage their metadata (the data dictionary in Oracle). Basically it has to correct and valid all the time, so changes to the metadata cannot be rolled back. Consequently an implicit commit is issued before and after each DDL statement. This is applies to most, probably all, RDBMS products. Both TRUNCATE TABLE and DROP TABLE are DDL statements are DDL, so there is no rollback. If we have an Enterprise Edition license for a recent version of Oracle we can use FLASHBACK TABLE to recover the table to a previous state, including BEFORE DROP. edit Here are the differences between DELETE and TRUNCATE TABLE. The example date is this big table: SQL> exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(user,'BIG_TABLE') PL/SQL procedure successfully completed. SQL> select blocks, num_rows 2 from user_tables 3 where table_name = 'BIG_TABLE' 4 / BLOCKS NUM_ROWS ---------- ---------- 15449 2340320 SQL> Deletion first.... SQL> delete from big_table 2 / 2340320 rows deleted. Elapsed: 00:01:20.37 SQL> SQL> exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(user,'BIG_TABLE') PL/SQL procedure successfully completed. Elapsed: 00:00:10.20 SQL> SQL> select blocks, num_rows 2 from user_tables 3 where table_name = 'BIG_TABLE' 4 / BLOCKS NUM_ROWS ---------- ---------- 15449 0 Elapsed: 00:00:00.11 SQL> And now the truncate ... SQL> truncate table big_table reuse storage 2 / Table truncated. Elapsed: 00:00:08.31 SQL> exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(user,'BIG_TABLE') PL/SQL procedure successfully completed. Elapsed: 00:00:00.26 SQL> SQL> select blocks, num_rows 2 from user_tables 3 where table_name = 'BIG_TABLE' 4 / BLOCKS NUM_ROWS ---------- ---------- 0 0 Elapsed: 00:00:00.00 SQL> The differences between are apparent. The TRUNCATE is much, much faster. Also it has zeroised the number of blocks in the table. Notice that even the gathering of statistics is faster after the truncation. This is because the TRUNCATE statement resets the high water mark, (i.e. the zero blocks), so the job knows all the assigned blocks are unused.
