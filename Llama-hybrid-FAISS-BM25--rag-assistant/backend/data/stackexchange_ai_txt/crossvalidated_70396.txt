There are some good answers here already, but I thought I'd chime in with one more, which has been used in areas related to gesture recognition. This paper by Taylor, Hinton, and Roweis is similar to an HMM in the sense that it's a time series model with latent states, but: 1) the structure of the hidden states can be much more complex (many many more possible states) and 2) many of the connections are undirected (as in a conditional random field or a Markov random field) rather than directed. Figure 2 shows a diagram of the basic model, and the authors have some great videos of what the model can learn on their websites.
