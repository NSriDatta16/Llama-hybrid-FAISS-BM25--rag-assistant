Cocoa: Drag and Drop any file type

I'm trying to create a drag and drop region that accepts any file type and will upload it to a server (using ASIHTTPRequest). I looked at the following example that Apple provides: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/CocoaDragAndDrop/Introduction/Intro.html but it only covers dealing with the dragging and dropping of images. How can I set up my drag and drop operations to deal with any file type? Thanks.
