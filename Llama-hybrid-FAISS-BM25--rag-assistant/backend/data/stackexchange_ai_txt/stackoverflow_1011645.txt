A couple of variants, using the "delete the last comma" rather than "delete third last character" are: s[::-1].replace(",","",1)[::-1] or ''.join(s.rsplit(",", 1)) But these are pretty ugly. Slightly better is: a, _, b = s.rpartition(",") s = a + b This may be the best approach if you don't know the comma's position (except for last comma in string) and effectively need a "replace from right". However Anurag's answer is more pythonic for the "delete third last character".
