I would recommend Eclipse as the closest match for the multi-language requirements. There are IDEs that possibly shine better for a given language (e.g. I prefer IntelliJ for Java), but none that have such a broad coverage of multiple languages. As far as memory/bloat, it's a price you pay for the convenience that an IDE provides.
