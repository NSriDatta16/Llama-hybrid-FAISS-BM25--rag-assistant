Set UITableViewCell background color on plain style table view?

I'm building a plain style table view with a search bar and I'm having trouble replicating the look of the "gutter" (when the table view is dragged down) in Apple's table views. Contacts screenshot http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/2633/picture5m.png If I set the background color of the table view, the gutter looks fine, but my cells use that color as the background color. I've tried setting the background color of the cell and of the cell's contentView in tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath: , but it gets overridden at some later point. I've also tried creating an empty view and setting it as the cell's backgroundView and as a subview of the contentView, but only the edges are colored white. There are two solutions I can think of: Convert my UITableViewController subclass to a UIViewController and insert a blank view behind the table view. Create a UITableViewCell subclass that doesn't allow the backgroundColor to be overridden. Both of these solutions will require quite a bit of work. Is there an easier way? UPDATE : The first solution didn't work. I have to set the table view's background color to clearColor in order for the gutter to change to the view's color. However, when I do this, I get the same result as setting the backgroundColor on the table view.
