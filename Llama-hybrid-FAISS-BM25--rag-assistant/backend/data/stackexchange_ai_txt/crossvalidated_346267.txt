Since $\delta_i = L_i / \sum_{i=1}^n L_i$, this allows you to rewrite your quantity of interest directly in terms of the wages and sizes of firms (I am going to add a subscript for dependence on $n$): $$\chi_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i x_i = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n L_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n L_i}.$$ The statistic $\chi_n$ is the average-worker-wage in the first $n$ firms (where the average is by worker, not by firm). In contrast, the unweighted average $\bar{x}_n = \tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ is the average-firm-wage in the first $n$ firms. (The latter can also be considered to be the average-worker-wage that would occur if all firms had the same number of workers.) The statistic $\chi_n$ is a function of the average-wages $w_1, ..., w_n$ and the firm sizes $L_1, ..., L_n$. Its sampling properties depend on the properties of these underlying variables, and descriptions of its expected value, and other statistical aspects, would be determined by the underlying distribution of these values. Decomposition 1 (multiplicative decomposition): What you have figured out in your first decomposition is that the average-worker-wage to the average-firm-wage using the multiplicative equation: $$\chi_n = \bar{x}_n \cdot M_n \quad \quad \quad \quad M_n \equiv \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i x_i}{\bar{x}_n} = \frac{n \sum_{i=1}^n L_i x_i}{(\sum_{i=1}^n L_i)(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)}.$$ The multiplicative factor $M_n$ converts the average-firm-wage to the average-worker-wage; it is a measure of the spread of workers across firms, relative to the wage of those firms. This quantity takes on a large value (higher than one) if workers are concentrated in high-wage firms, and takes on a low value (lower than one) if workers are concentrated in low-wage firms. In the special case where all firms have the same size we have $L_1 = \cdots = L_n$, which gives $M_n = 1$ and $\chi_n = \bar{x}_n$. The only real use of this decomposition would be if you want to use the multiplicative factor as a measure of concentration of workers across firms with different wages. This statistic could be a useful quantifier of worker "concentration" across firms with different wages, if this is something of interest. Since the multiplier is more complex than either of the individual averages (and is derived from their ratio), it is unlikely to be useful beyond this. I am not aware of any particular literature on this decomposition, but you might try looking at economic literature that looks at macroeconomic aggregates of wages and worker concentration. In any case, whether or not there is literature on this statistic, the interpretation of the statistic is obvious enough. Decomposition 2 (additive decomposition): It is hard to make sense of your work here, since there is a lot of conflation of expectation with averaging, etc. In any case, the decomposition you are looking for is resolved by the comment by Martijn Weterings above. The sample covariance between the values $x_i$ and $\delta_i = L_i / \sum_{i=1}^n L_i$ (without Bessel's correction) is: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \mathbb{Cov}(\boldsymbol{x}_n, \boldsymbol{\delta}_n) &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}_n) (\delta_i - \bar{\delta}_n) \\[8pt] &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}_n) (\delta_i - \tfrac{1}{n}) \\[8pt] &= \frac{\bar{x}_n}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\tfrac{x_i}{\bar{x}_n} - 1) (\delta_i - \tfrac{1}{n}) \\[8pt] &= \frac{\bar{x}_n}{n} \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \tfrac{x_i \delta_i}{\bar{x}_n} - \tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \tfrac{x_i}{\bar{x}_n} - \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i + \sum_{i=1}^n \tfrac{1}{n} \Big) \\[8pt] &= \frac{\bar{x}_n}{n} ( M_n - 1 - 1 + 1 ) \\[8pt] &= \frac{\bar{x}_n}{n} ( M_n - 1 ) \\[8pt] &= \frac{1}{n} ( \chi_n - \bar{x}_n ). \\[8pt] \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ Hence, you have the additive decomposition: $$\chi_n = \bar{x}_n + n \cdot \mathbb{Cov}(\boldsymbol{x}_n, \boldsymbol{\delta}_n).$$ The additive term in this latter decomposition adjusts the average-firm-wage upward or downward to yield the average-worker-wage; this is also a measure of worker concentration in high-wage firms, but this time the measure is relative to the average-firm-wage $\bar{x}_n$, and it is on an additive scale. This term is positive if $M_n > 1$ and negative if $M_n Again, I am not aware of any particular literature on this decomposition. It is just one way that you can express the average-worker-wage using an additive metric representing worker-concentration in high-wage firms.
