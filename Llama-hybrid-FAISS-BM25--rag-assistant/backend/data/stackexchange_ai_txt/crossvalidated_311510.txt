I'll first provide an example, retaining the high vs. low distinction you made in your original question. Then, I will argue for why you should not distinguish between high and low—but use a continuous predictor instead. I would recommend using a mixed-model (also known as multilevel or hierarchical models). You can think of your data being measured at two "levels": Level 1: Measurement occasion Level 2: Person Your score is then predicted by measurement occasion (start vs. end), condition (experimental vs. control), and standard of English (high vs. low), as well as all of the two-way interactions, and the three-way interaction between the variables. You can set up a model where occasion is a Level 1 predictor and the Level 2 predictors are condition and standard of English. The model would be: Level 1: $y_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j}X_{ij} + e_{ij}$ Level 2: $\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}Z_j + \gamma_{02}W_j + \gamma_{03}Z_jW_j + u_{0j}$ $\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + \gamma_{11}Z_j + \gamma_{12}W_j + \gamma_{13}Z_jW_j + u_{1j}$ Where $i$ is the subscript for Level 1 observations and $j$ is the subscript for Level 2 observations, $y$ is the score on the test, $X$ is the measurement occasion, $Z$ is the treatment condition, and $W$ is the standard of English. Written in the syntax of the popular lme4 R package, this formula would be: score ~ time * condition * standard_of_english + (1 + condition * standard_of_english | id) Where id would be an identification variable for each of your participants. So why use this instead of an ANOVA? Two reasons: First, the 2x2 fully between-subjects analysis relies on difference scores. Using difference scores is something hotly contested. A classic reference on this is Edwards, J. E. (2001). Ten Difference Score Myths. Organizational Research Methods. Simply avoid all that hassle and problems with difference scores by not using them! So then that leaves you with being able to use the 2x2x2 mixed-analysis ANOVA, where the within-subjects factor is measurement occasion (before vs. after). The problem here is that you have to dichotomize something that is fundamentally continuous. You are losing a lot of information in doing this, and splitting a continuous variable into two groups is pretty roundly panned these days. A classic reference for this is MacCallum et al. (2002). On the Practice of Dichotomization of Quantitative Variables. Psycholgical Methods. . What is great about using the mixed-model approach I described above is that $W$ (or standard_of_english ) in the model (or lme4 formula) above can be continuous—you do not have to cut it into two groups and lose lots of information. So, my suggestion would be to use the mixed-model, described above.
