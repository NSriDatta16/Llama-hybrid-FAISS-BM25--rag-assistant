I think it's perfectly fine. Only you can determine your best toolset for any given project, and as long as you're using them properly, following best practices, use what you think is best. Personally, I prefer to use the tools you mentioned, because I like the finer control. I only use the drag-and-drop components for very simple tasks, and hey, there's now Dynamic Data for those tasks.
