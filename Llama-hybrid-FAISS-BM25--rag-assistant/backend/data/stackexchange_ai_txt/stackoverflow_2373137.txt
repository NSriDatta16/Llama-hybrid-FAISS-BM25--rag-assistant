All *.mode* , *.pbxuser , and *.perspective* files can be safely discarded without affecting project organization. These files are used by Xcode to track which documents are open, which windows are displayed, what their sizes are, and how your project appears. I ignore everything except for the project.pbxproj file when managing projects in version control. Since I use Subversion, I have the following line in ~/.subversion/config: global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la .*~ ._* .DS_Store *.pbxuser *.mode* *.perspective*
