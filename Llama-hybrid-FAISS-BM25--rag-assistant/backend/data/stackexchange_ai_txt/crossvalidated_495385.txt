Does Lasso make irrelevant the need for coefficient significance testing?

Since Lasso selects the optimal predictors to include in the model, does this suggest that we don't need to do any of the typical significance testing that comes with OLS regression and logistic regression? I am pretty used to the R output with stars by each regressor, but from talking to people, it seems like in practice, they just optimize lambda in Lasso and then just use those coefficients - and make the implicit assumption that all are significant.
