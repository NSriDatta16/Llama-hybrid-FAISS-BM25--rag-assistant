embedding one kind of syntax inside another: is it kludge or clever?

Background: Recently while looking at a "structured text editor" I noticed they used a trick to change python/perl/c++/java et al. into a "structured" outline by sneaking XML into the comments of the respective languages. I remembered seeing this trick inside a windows bat file once as well. The REM statements of the bat file were used to "hide" some perl code. Question: Have you ever seen an instance where someone used the comments of a programming or markup language to embed the syntax of an entirely different language? If yes, can you give a link to the example or explain what it was? If you have not, here is an example: An example of an editor file format that uses this trick. Question: Is this kind of "trick" a clever and useful idea? If so, can you enumerate a special instance where you used this trick? If no, can you describe why you think it is a bad idea?
