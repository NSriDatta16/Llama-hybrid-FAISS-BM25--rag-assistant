I believe you are looking for HTML parsers. Here is HTML parsing module for python You need to parse the relevant data out of all the HTML files and then do whatever with it. I have not tried any php html parsers to recommend any but since you are working on a webserver I'm hoping it has perl? Take a look at perl html parsers . #this snippet will get contents of organization name sub start { my ($self, $tag, $attr, $attrseq, $origtext) = @_; if ($tag =~ /^span$/i && $attr->{'class'} =~ /^fn org$/i) { # see if we find now you have @org_names array that contains all organization names.
