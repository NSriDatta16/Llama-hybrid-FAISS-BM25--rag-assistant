Just for reference, so far all I have is brute force: make a grid, and for points on the grid, if they are inside the polygon, make a series of rectangles by expanding each corner or side in turn until it hits a side. Then just pick the largest. The simplest (and very effective) optimisation is only to test whether a grid point is in the polygon once you have checked that it is not contained in one of the rectangles already constructed, as 'point in rectangle' checking is blazing fast. For obvious reasons, this is fairly slow and inexact, not to mention inelegant :)
