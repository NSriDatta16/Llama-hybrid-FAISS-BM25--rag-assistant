Remember that a wiki is interactive. If you're thinking about publishing, as in publishing burndown charts, then you're not thinking far enough. Distributing that information is only part of it. For instance, rather than having a "Current Burndown Chart" page, create a page for "Burndown Chart for Week of 10-27-2008" and then encourage people to comment on the chart, and what it means, and why you did so poorly that week.
