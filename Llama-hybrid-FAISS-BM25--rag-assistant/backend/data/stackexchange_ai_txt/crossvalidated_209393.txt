Bayesian Optimization for a Stochastic Target that changes over time

Let's say there is a single slot machine that: costs zero to play can only be played once per day has a payout that is conditionally normal and is a function of the date and time. I want to use Bayesian Optimization to maximize my total payout. I have the following questions: Since the target is stochastic, are there any adjustments I need to make to my model/approach? How do I pick the parameters for the GP? Since the payout distribution changes over time, how do I take this into account? Do I use some sort of look back rolling window? Thanks everyone!
