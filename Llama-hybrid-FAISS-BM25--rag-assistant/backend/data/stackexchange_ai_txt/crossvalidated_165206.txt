If, in your example, you are trying to build a system to predict future instances of taking medical leave, then there might be a danger but perhaps not the one you fear. There does seem to be a circular logic in measuring severity of an injury by the probability of taking leave with a particular type of injury, and if the severity indices were determined from your data set then you would presumably have a completely over-determined model. If the severity indices were established from some other data set and just applied here, however, there might not be a problem. In principle in your example, you might then be able to examine how age and gender are related to taking leave once the severity (as separately defined) is taken into account. A danger in logistic regression is that your variables explain so much of the difference in outcomes that the model is completely fit and might not generalize well. That is called perfect separation , and it can happen in what might seem naively to be under-determined models if there are multiple predictors. This would be expected to be more of a danger when one of your predictors is so directly tied to outcome, even if the predictor wasn't defined by the data set you are trying to analyze. Then again, you presumably would want your model to predict that someone takes medical leave after losing a limb. So you do have to consider the purpose of building your model when you evaluate the use of such a predictor.
