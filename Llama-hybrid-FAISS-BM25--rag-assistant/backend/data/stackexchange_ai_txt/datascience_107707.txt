Study names not showing in forest plot (R)

Context: I followed an existing R script to create a forest plot in R using the forest function from the metafor package. Problem: The plot is showing, however, the study names are not showing on it and I am not sure why. See data frame here. I want author and year to show in the forest plot below in place of "Study X": See resulting forest plot here: Code below: library("here") # detect root directory library("tidyverse") # data science library("robumeta") library("metafor") # for meta-analysis functions library("dplyr") library("weightr") library("knitr") bio_path % rename("cytokine"="Ã¯..cytokine") %>% select(author:year, cytokine:dep_measure) # load data, rename + reorder col df % rename(c("ri"="r", "ni"="n")) # rename df and some col for z transformations df % filter(cytokine=="IFN-y" | cytokine=="IFN-y_PHA") %>% mutate(id=1:4) %>% select(id, author:vi) # print out the data and calculate and print the confidence interval for the amount of heterogeneity (I^2) res_ifny
