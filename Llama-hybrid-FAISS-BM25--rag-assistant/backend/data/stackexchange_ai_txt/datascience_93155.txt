Naives Bayes Text Classifier Confidence Score

I am experimenting with building a text classifier using Naive Bayes which has been pretty successful on my test data. One thing i am looking to incorporate is handling text that does not fit into any predefined category that I trained the model on. Does anyone have some thoughts on how to do this? I was thinking of trying to calculate the confidence score for each document, and if This is my code so far: df_train = pd.read_csv(__________) text_clf = Pipeline([('vect', CountVectorizer()), ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()), ('clf', MultinomialNB()),]) text_clf = text_clf.fit(df_train.text, df_train.label) df['predicted'] = predicted Like I said, it works well for documents that do fit into one of the categories, but if I have something that clearly does not fit into anything, it will still try and assign it a label, my guess is based on some kind of confidence calculation but just not sure how that works
