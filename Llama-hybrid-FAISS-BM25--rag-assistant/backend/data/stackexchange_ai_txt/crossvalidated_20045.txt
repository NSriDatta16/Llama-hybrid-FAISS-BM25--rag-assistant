When your data is skewed you may: use specific error metrics like precision, recall, F-score trade of between precision and recall accordingly: want to predict diabetes with confidence => adjust for higher precision, lower recall want to avoid missing too many diabetes cases => adjust for lower precision, higher recall (for example, in logistic regression, by adjusting the separating threshold) use F-score to find a good balance between precision and recall, that maximizes both as much as possible
