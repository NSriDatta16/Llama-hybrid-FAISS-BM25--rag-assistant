Is It Ever Appropriate to Treat a Bayesian Credible Interval as a Frequentist Confidence Interval?

I know that a bayesian credible interval and a frequentist confidence interval measure very different things, and have different interpretations. However, is it ever appropriate to treat a bayesian credible interval as a frequentist confidence interval (for example, for the purposes of adjustments for multiple comparisons) or to treat the bayesian quantity P(effect Since there are many questions on Stats.SE asking about comparing credible intervals and confidence intervals, I want to clarify that I am specifically asking about taking a credible interval (or probability statement) estimated in a bayesian framework and treating it as if it were a confidence interval (or p-value) for numerical adjustment, NOT about whether I can interpret this credible interval as a confidence interval.
