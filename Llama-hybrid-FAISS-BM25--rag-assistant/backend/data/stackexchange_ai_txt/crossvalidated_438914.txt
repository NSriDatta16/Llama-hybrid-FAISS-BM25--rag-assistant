Why TBATS model giving poor result?

I have time series data of number of units ordered from a manufacturing plant and number of units delivered. The are multiple different plant sites for which I need to build forecasting models. I started with one plant and used ARIMA models with seasonality and differencing of order 1 to induce stationarity. The model performance was decent but not very good. Here is the R code model = auto.arima(log(train),d=1, seasonal = T) f = forecast(model, 10) p = exp(f$mean) mape(test,p)*100 At this stage I had monthly data and number of data points was only 31 for each plant. Due to fewer data points I could not try other approaches. To improve the model I collected weekly data and tried other approaches. Since I had weekly data, I thought of modelling complex seasonal patterns using TBATS. Here is the R code y To my surprise, I got insanely high MAPE using this method, which made me feel I am doing something wrong. I went back to try ARIMA again on weekly data. However, I noticed that if I used log(train_a) to train the model I get the error which says "No suitable ARIMA model found". And if I use train_a to train the model I get almost the same high MAPE I got with TBATS. I am not sure why using weekly data (around 2500 data points) is giving very high error but using monthly data points (only 31 data points) was giving decent result (although not very good). What am I doing wrong here ? Given the result with TBATS was very poor, how can I check if TBATS is the appropriate model to use? When should I consider going for additive time series models such as those of prophet library? What could be some of the ways I can look at to improve the prediction accuracy?
