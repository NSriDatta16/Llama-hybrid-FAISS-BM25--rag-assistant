The only thing I enforce to stay within 80 chars is my commenting. Personally...I'm devoting all my brain power (what little there is) to coding right, it's a pain to have to go back and break everything up at the 80 char limit when I could be spending my time on the next function. Yes, Resharper could do it for me I suppose but then it freaks me out a little that a 3rd party product is making decisions on my code layout and changes it ("Please don't break my code into two lines HAL. HAL?"). That said, I do work on a fairly small team and all of our monitors are fairly large so worrying about what bothers my fellow programmers isn't a huge concern as far as that goes. Seems though some languages encourage longer lines of code for the sake of more bang for the buck (short hand if then statements).
