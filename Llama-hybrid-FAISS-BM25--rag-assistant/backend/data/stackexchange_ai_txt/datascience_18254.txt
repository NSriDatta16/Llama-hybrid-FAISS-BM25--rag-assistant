Which type of classification best suits this scatter plot?

The following image shows a scatter plot of my data. The Y axis points are the labels, labeled from 1 to 6 and X-axis are dimensionally reduced values of all my features. I reduced them for better visualization. I have used decision Trees and Random forests both give a score of 0.74 and 0.79 respectively. I have also tried SVM and Naive Bayes just for seeing the score they gave 0.37 and 0.33 respectively. I was using 75% to train and the rest to test. Which is the best classification algorithm for this data? Multiclass Classification
