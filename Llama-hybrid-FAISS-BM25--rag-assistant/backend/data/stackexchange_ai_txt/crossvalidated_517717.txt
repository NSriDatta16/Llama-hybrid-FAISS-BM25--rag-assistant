That looks like a discrete, ordered variable, which makes ordinal regression (e.g., ordinal logistic regression) appropriate for it. If you don't want to make the proportional odds assumption, you can also treat the variable as a nominal variable and run multinomial regression (e.g., multinomial logistic regression) on it. Ordinal regression would be the most interpretable model, though.
