How good a fit is my linear regression - really?

So I've made a linear regression of my two variables using pythons np.polyfit . This is my code: p = np.polyfit(lengths, breadths, 1) m = p[0] b = p[1] sumOfSquares(m,b,breadths,lengths) newlengths = [] for y in lengths: newlengths.append(y*m+b) ax.plot(lengths, newlengths, '-', color="#2c3e50") I find the sum of squares with this code: def sumOfSquares(m,b,breadths,lengths): sum = 0 for i in range(0,len(breadths)): sum += ((breadths[i]-(lengths[i]*m+b))**2) print sum print sum**(1/2)/(len(lengths)) The sum of squares is 7978.2877 While the average residual element is 0.00224 How do I quantify how good linear regression this really is? My goal is to prove linearity between lengths and breadths.
