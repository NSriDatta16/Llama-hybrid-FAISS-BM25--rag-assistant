What you probably want to do, if the computation of the array is too expensive, is serialize it. That basically places a binary copy of the data onto a storage medium (e.g. your hard disk) that you can very quickly load. Serialization is pretty straightforward. Here's a tutorial that specifically addresses serializing arrays. Since these values will presumably only change if your algorithm for evaluating a poker hand changes, it should be fine to just ship the serialized file. The file size should be reasonable if the data you are storing in each array element is not too large (if it's a 16-bit integer for example, the file will be around 1MB in size).
