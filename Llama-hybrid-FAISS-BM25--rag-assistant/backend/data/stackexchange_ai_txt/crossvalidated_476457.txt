Doing Proportional Odds Logistic Regression. Ordinary logistic regression produces correct class probabilities only if the two classes are normally distributed, with a same variance. It is already uncommon enough to check for that. However, in proportional odds, this condition cannot be satisfied, ever. If the classes $A$ and $BC$ happen to have equal variances, then classes $AB$ and $C$ cannot have them (except in a pathological case where they fully overlap).
