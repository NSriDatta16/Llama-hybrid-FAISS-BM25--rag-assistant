If sample average converges in an iid sample, must it converge to the mean?

WLLN tells us that if $X_1,...,X_n$ are iid, with $X_1$ having finite mean $\mu$ , then their sample average converges in probability to $\mu$ . Suppose instead we know that $X_1,...,X_n$ are iid and their sample average converges in probability to a constant. Can we argue that $X_1$ has a finite mean and hence that such a constant must be the mean of $X_1$ ?
