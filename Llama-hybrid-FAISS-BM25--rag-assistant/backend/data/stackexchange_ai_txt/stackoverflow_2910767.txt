I'd just ignore the gaps and ensure you have as large a range of ids as needed. The gaps do no real harm. Trying to fix them up by updating data might introduce broken relationships that are more trouble. By the way in MySQL INT(2) the 2 specifies the maximum display width , but doesn't affect the amount of storage. INT(8) uses the same storage as INT(2) - use BIGINT as you imply.
