Deleting a cookie no longer works after moving the code

I was using the code below to delete cookies and everything worked fine. A few days ago, I began hosting the code somewhere else and it will not longer delete the cookie. Any ideas? if( $_COOKIE ) { foreach( $_COOKIE as $name => $value ) { $params = session_get_cookie_params(); unset($_COOKIE[$name]); setcookie($name, '', time()-43200, $params['path']); echo $name; echo ' '; echo $params['path']; } }
