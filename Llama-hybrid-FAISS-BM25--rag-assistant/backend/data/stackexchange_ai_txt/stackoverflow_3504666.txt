How do I over write the styles on a jQuery dialog

I want to create a jQuery dialogue and overwrite the color setting for this one instance, not any others - now creating the dialog is easy but setting it's styles is providing difficult, how do I change the title and overlay colours? I'd like to add them dynamically here, something like background:"red", as I don't want to change any css files I don't mind dynamically updating the CSS values via jQuery for this one modal. Here's my code (document).ready(function() { var $dialog = $(' ') .html('Loading... ') .dialog({ bgiframe: false, autoOpen: false, draggable: false, modal: true, resizable: false, show: 'slide', height: 60, closeOnEscape: false, title: '', }); $dialog.dialog('open');
