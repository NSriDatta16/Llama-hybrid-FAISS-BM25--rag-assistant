In WTP you can download plugins for many different web container or Java EE application servers. To do so go to Window => Preferences => Server => Runtime Environments => Add... Select the server(s) you want to work with. However, as Raghuram as pointed out, you'd probably be better off starting from the 'Eclipse for Java EE developers` altogether. This is because WTP is built on top of many 'infrastructure' plugins such as EMF and the dependencies are sometimes wobbly because all these plugins evolve in a parallel manner... and more often than not, API change ;-)
