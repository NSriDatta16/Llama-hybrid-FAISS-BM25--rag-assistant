Natural deduction isn't that much used in practical formal methods: sequent calculus is generally a better basis, because it is closer to the tableau methods used in constructing decision procedures for logics. Tableau methods are pretty central to practical applications of logic in computer science. Natural deduction is most used in constructive type theory, and this gives it some leverage in programming language design. It's considered a nice-to-know, though, rather than a must know. The main value of natural deduction is that it is the nicest way to learn formal inference, but this is a didactic application seen mostly in academia.
