Another way to cross validate time series, which is worth sharing. Especially because the question is asked if H2o can support time-series cv. Existing h2o implementation is able support a variant of time-series cv shown below, with the help of fold_column variable. fold 1 : training [4 5 6 7 8 9], test [1 2 3] fold 2 : training [1 2 3 7 8 9], test [4 5 6] fold 3 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6], test [7 8 9] Solution: library(h2o) h2o.init() airquality $Year Date % sort()) # This will assign fold number randomly #fold_numbers Parts of code borrowed from link1 and link2
