Has someone experiences with metrics for Design-By-Contract or can recommend metrics to measure the usage of Design-By-Contract in a code base?

We are currently introducing Design-by-Contract to a software development group of about 60 developers, which are developing different components. We started by defining Design-By-Contract policies for C# and Java. To measure the progress we are counting the number of classes and the number of contract assertions (Preconditions, post conditions and invariants) with a simple search for keywords (excluding comments and string literals). So we have two statistics: Number of contract assertions per component Average number of contract assertions per class per component Has someone experiences with metrics for Design-By-Contract or can recommend metrics to measure the usage of Design-By-Contract in a code base?
