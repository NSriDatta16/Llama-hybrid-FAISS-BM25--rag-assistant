The best way that won't be fooled by browser UserAgent hacks is checking support for latest features included in the browser versions that support the GPU acceleration. You'd need to do some digging to find what was added in the same versions as the GPU acceleration to do that. Just keep in mind that GPU support for canvas at the moment works only on Windows - so you'd have to take all the OSX running machines out of equation and only in ie9, chrome 11 and firefox 4 - all of them either RC, betas, or dev builds. for IE9 for example: only IE have scrollabar color CSS properties and only IE9 form all the IEs supports css opacity function isIE9() { var bodyStyle = document.body.style; return (bodyStyle.scrollbar3dLightColor != undefined && bodyStyle.opacity != undefined) }
