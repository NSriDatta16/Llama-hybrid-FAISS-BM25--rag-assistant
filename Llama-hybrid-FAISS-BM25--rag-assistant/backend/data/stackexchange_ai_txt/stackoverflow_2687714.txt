The relevant section of the standard is ยง8.5.1, aggregates. An aggregate is an array or a class (clause 9) with no user-declared constructors (12.1), no private or pro- tected non-static data members (clause 11), no base classes (clause 10), and no virtual functions (10.3). When an aggregate is initialized the initializer can contain an initializer-clause consisting of a brace- enclosed, comma-separated list of initializer-clauses for the members of the aggregate, written in increasing subscript or member order. If the aggregate contains subaggregates, this rule applies recursively to the members of the subaggregate. GCC 4.1.2 may be violating paragraph 11. 11 Braces can be elided in an initializer-list as follows. If the initializer-list begins with a left brace, then the succeeding comma-separated list of initializers initializes the members of a subaggregate; it is erroneous for there to be more initializers than members. If, however, the initializer-list for a subaggregate does not begin with a left brace, then only enough initializers from the list are taken to initialize the members of the subaggregate; any remaining initializers are left to initialize the next member of the aggregate of which the current subaggregate is a member.
