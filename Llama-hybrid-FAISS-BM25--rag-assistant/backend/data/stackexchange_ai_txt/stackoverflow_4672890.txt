Getting the most efficient query based on multiple tables/primary & foreign keys

I have a site where some pages (we call them gateway pages) are based loosely on certain departments in the organization. Each department has classes associated with it. Unfortunately some of my pages are not associated with a specific department, but do display information about several classes from a department so I can't just query the database strictly on department alone. Would it be smarter to create a table called gateway_classes with a fk from the gateway table in each class or form a query to somehow filter out exactly what I need from my existing tables using an array of classes to be pulled during the query? Here's my tables: departments_classes | classes_vendors | departments | vendors | classes | products | gateway Any guidance is greatly appreciated. More Info: There are roughly 350 classes and 18 departments and 12 gateway pages...
