If there are large differences between the median and the mean when I use the permutation test, how can I understand what these differences tell me? This sounds like explorative research. If you are still in that phase, then it is of little use to derive p-values. You will be looking at too many patterns and approaches: difference in mean, difference in median, difference in stochastic dominance (rank test), with or without some data transformation, eliminating some outliers or not, etc. So it would be best to plot these data, look at the tables, perform potentially some additional analysis like PCA, LDA and clustering. Then, to decide on significance you should let your eyes decide whether any observed effect is strong enough. The reason is because any computation would give a false sense of computing some rigorous probability while the underlying approach and numbers are not rigorous. Thus, the test to use is the interocular trauma test, discussed here: Source for inter-ocular trauma test for significance If you need a more quantitative result, then you need to gather more additional data. It is bad news, but I guess that it is better than the suggestion to fool your collabor6 with a calculation that seems accurate but makes no sense.
