Is it possible to set up two FileHandlers in the same logging.properties file?

Using the logging classes in java.util.logging, is it possible to set up two different FileHandlers with different formatters that will write different logging information to two different files? I'm currently using a logging.properties file, and the handlers line is not encouraging: handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, java.util.logging.FileHandler I don't see how I could distinguish between two java.util.logging.FileHandler s later on in the file. Looking at Related Questions, it looks like switching to Log4J would give me the desired flexibility, but I'd rather avoid a dependency on another library if the JSE logging library can be finagled into doing what I want somehow.
