Vb.net on running shows updation exception

I've a website in vb.net. While running the website i get the following error: "Current Recordset does not support updating. This may be a limitation of the provider, or of the selected locktype." My DB connection.inc file looks as follows: Dim strDataSource As String Dim cnnCRM As ADODB.Connection I've tried giving the record set object all the properties it required. Still the same error. Can anybody tell me how i can get rid of this error?..... DB has full permissions. This error happened when i called a function.My code is shown below: The definiton works perfectly. The function definition is as follows: Function funcGetMaxDate(ByRef prmMonth As String, ByRef prmYear As String) As String Dim intPrmMonth As Integer intPrmMonth =prmMonth Dim iDate As String Select Case intPrmMonth Case 1 iDate = 31 Case 2 iDate = CheckMaxDateFebruary(prmYear) Case 3 iDate = 31 Case 4 iDate = 30 Case 5 iDate = 31 Case 6 iDate = 30 Case 7 iDate = 31 Case 8 iDate = 31 Case 9 iDate = 30 Case 10 iDate = 31 Case 11 iDate = 30 Case 12 iDate = 31 Case Else iDate = 0 End Select funcGetMaxDate = iDate End Function When the ctrl reaches back the calling function this exception occurs.....
