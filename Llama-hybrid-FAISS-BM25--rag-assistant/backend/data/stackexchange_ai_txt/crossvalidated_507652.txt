Bayesian compositional regression using ilr

I'm trying to fit a compositional data regression from a Bayesian perspective and using ilr coordinates. Once the ilr is computed for the response variable, a multivariate Gaussian regression has to be fitted in the Euclidean space. My problem is the variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$ . Taking a look to the literature, I have found the paper Egozcue et al., 2012, where it is proven that if we use least squares, the matrix $\Sigma$ has to be diagonal, and any correlation parameter has to be estimated. My question is, if we use other methods for estimation coming from the Bayesian perspective, $\Sigma$ is also diagonal? Thank you so much for your comments. Best wishes. Egozcue, J. J., Daunis-I-Estadella, J., Pawlowsky-Glahn, V., Hron, K., & Filzmoser, P. (2012). Simplicial regression. The normal model.
