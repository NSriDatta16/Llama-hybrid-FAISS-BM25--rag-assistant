Time Series using STS( Basic Structural Model)

I am using Basic Structs to forecast my time series. My forecast is exactly overlapping my data. I am sure no model can predict with 100% accuracy. I know I am missing something, can someone point me what the mistake is? My data and code are given below. As you can see, when I run the below code, I get the following image, which shows that my model is too good. Year EDIT: On the test set, it performs better compared to other models I tried Error Stats and plots are given below
