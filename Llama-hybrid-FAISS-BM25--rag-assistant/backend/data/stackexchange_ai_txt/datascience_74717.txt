Generate text using user-supplied keywords

I've got a use case where I need to generate sentences based on a set of user supplied keywords. Here is an example of what I need: User input: End-User: Data Scientists Region: Middle East Country: UAE Solution: BigPanda Application: machine learning Benefits: lower costs and runtime Output (Curly-Brackets are just there to highlight): Learn how {data scientists} in the {Middle East} such as in the {UAE} are using {BigPanda} to streamline their {machine learning} processes to {lower costs and runtime}. So the model needs to use the keywords given by the user and generate similar sentences. I also have a dataset of about 2000 of such sentences, which may come in handy. One way I thought this could be possible is by using the GPT-2 model and perhaps finetuning it with the dataset, but I haven't been able to figure out how I would actually go about using it for something like this.
