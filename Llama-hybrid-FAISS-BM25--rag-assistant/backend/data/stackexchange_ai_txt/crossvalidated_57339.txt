I think it depends on what exactly you mean by p(viagra|spam) and how you're modelling the data. As written, I would interpret your meaning as 'the probability the word viagra is mentioned at least once in a message, given this message is spam'. In that case, yes, the fact that one document mentioned viagra three times has no effect. You've defined a model which does not pay attention to such facts. Of course, you could have a different model. For example, instead of viagra being representing by a binary variable (present/absent), it could represent the count of the number of times the word appears in the message. In that case, from your raw data you'd estimate an empirical frequency of something like p(viagra=0|spam) = 0 p(viagra=1|spam) = 4/5 p(viagra=2|spam) = 0 p(viagra=3|spam) = 1/5 etc. I'm not saying that's a better way to do it. I'm just illustrating an alternate situation where your intuition that seeing viagra mentioned three times is relevant holds. A more practical example might be 'Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency', which is a method that pays a lot of attention to the frequency of a word in a document.
