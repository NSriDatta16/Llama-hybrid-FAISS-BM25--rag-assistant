use regular expression in if-condition in bash

I wonder the general rule to use regular expression in if clause in bash? Here is an example $ gg=svm-grid-ch $ if [[ $gg == *grid* ]] ; then echo $gg; fi svm-grid-ch $ if [[ $gg == ^....grid* ]] ; then echo $gg; fi $ if [[ $gg == ....grid* ]] ; then echo $gg; fi $ if [[ $gg == s...grid* ]] ; then echo $gg; fi $ Why the last three fails to match? Hope you could give as many general rules as possible, not just for this example.
