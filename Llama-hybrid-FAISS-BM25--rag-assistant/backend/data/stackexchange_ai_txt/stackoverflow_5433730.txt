The original ASP.Net (Webforms) framework made some assumptions about how you would work. Some of these can be annoying now, depending how you like to work. Most .Net controls require a form. ViewState requires a form, and only one form. the Postback model requires a form, and only one form. Most asp.net functionality would not work if there wasn't a form. So not having a form by default would cause a lot of problems, especially for beginners. The first step on almost every page would be to drag over your "form container control" or whatever it would be called, and people would get it wrong all the time. Given their plan, a one form that was always there made sense. This discussion assumes Webforms , the "default" ASP.NET web framework. In ASP.Net MVC, there is no automatic form element. A lot of assumptions like this one are traded for other assumptions , which many of us now prefer.
