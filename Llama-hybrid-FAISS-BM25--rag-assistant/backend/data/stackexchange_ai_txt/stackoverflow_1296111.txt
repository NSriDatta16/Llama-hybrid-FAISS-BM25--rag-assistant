Organizing a Department based site in Drupal

I'd like to migrate a large set of static pages to a Drupal site. The first problem I'm coming up against is that most content is structured under a department. A department page would have a list of most content in the center and then up to 3 sidebars, with the department info, additional links and maybe one more sidebar with some random links in it. How could this be achieved and make it user friendly to maintain? I'd also like to have special blocks tied to specific nodes, which I've found a module for. I'm also looking at crawling the site and putting that into Drupal, which is a whole other topic.
