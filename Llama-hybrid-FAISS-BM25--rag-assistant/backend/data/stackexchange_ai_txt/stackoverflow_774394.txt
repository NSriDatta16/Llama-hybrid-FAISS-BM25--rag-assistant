How do you write a search function that is easy to comprehend (/maintainable)? Maybe in a modular manner?

Every time I see a search function, the code behind it is a mess. Several hundreds of lines, spaghetti code, and almost ALWAYS as one huge method. A programming language (Java/C#/PHP/etc) is used to construct one big fat SQL query. Many, many if else's. There must be more elegant ways to do this than this? Or is this what you get when you use RMDBS instead of a flat data structure? I'd be willing to learn more about this topic, perhaps even buy a book. /Adam
