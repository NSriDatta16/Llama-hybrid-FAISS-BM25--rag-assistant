No, Reinforcement Learning and Unsupervised Learning are considered two different paradigms. We can refer to the seminal book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop for their respective definitions: Unsupervised learning: In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization Reinforcement learning: Finally, the technique of reinforcement learning [...] is concerned with the problem of finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward. As you can see, their goals are completely different: while in unsupervised learning we don't have labels and we are aiming at discovering the structure of the data, in reinforcement learning we want to learn a strategy to maximize the obtained rewards according to a reward signal.
