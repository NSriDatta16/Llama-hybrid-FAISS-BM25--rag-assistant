Find and execute Javascript fragments in a bunch of HTML

I need to detect and eval the Javascript code contained in a string. The following code works, but it only evaluates the first ... it founds. function executeJs(html) { var scriptFragment = " (.+?) "; match = new RegExp(scriptFragment, "im"); var matches = html.match(match); if (matches.length >= 2) { eval(matches[2]); } } I wonder if there is a method that allows me to iterate and execute all Javascript fragments.
