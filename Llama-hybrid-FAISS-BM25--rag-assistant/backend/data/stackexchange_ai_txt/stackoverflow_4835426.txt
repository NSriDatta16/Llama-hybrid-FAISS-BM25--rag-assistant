The data source type is fine, but you have set the update interval to 15 seconds and ALSO set the maximum update interval to 15 seconds ... I would suggest raising to maximum to 30 seconds as you might not be able to provide an update exactly every 15 seconds ... rrdtool create test.rrd --step 15 \ DS:na:GAUGE:30:0:U \ RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:1:244 \ RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:24:244 \ RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:168:244 \ RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:672:244 \ RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:5760:374 Further your first RRA will keep data for 61 minutes in 15 second intervals, the second one for 144 hours in 6 minute intervals. These seem odd numbers to me ... is this intentional? Maybe have a look at the rrdtool tutorials to see how others approach this.
