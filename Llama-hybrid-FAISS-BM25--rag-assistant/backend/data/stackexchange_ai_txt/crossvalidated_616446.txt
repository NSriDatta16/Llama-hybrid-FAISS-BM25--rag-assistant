Can the confidence interval of an odds ratio be negative?

I am running logistic regression. The odds ratio estimate I got is positive but the lower bound of my 95% CI is negative (close to -1) and the upper bound is greater than 1. Would this mean that my result is not statistically significant? In a hypothetical case that the odds ratio 95% CI is something like (-1, .5), would this also mean it is not statistically significant? The odds ratio in this hypothetical situation is not 0 or negative. I used stargazer in R to get the 95% CIs, and these are the optional arguments I put in stargazer: apply.coef = exp,ci = TRUE, ci.level = .95
