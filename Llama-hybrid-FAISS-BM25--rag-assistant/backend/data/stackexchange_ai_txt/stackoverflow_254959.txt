All of the different browsers have different behaviors and quirks when it comes to how history relates to the cache and the various headers available to control it. Firefox 3 works differently from Firefox 2, re-displaying potentially sensitive data when a user clicks the back button in spite of using caching directives to prevent it. The best solution is to use a session cookie that is not persisted and inform the user of the need to close the browser window after logging out. Especially if they are at a public terminal. Painful, I know, but current browser offerings and the HTTP specification do not provide any mechanisms for dealing with browser history. History may be treated differently than caching by a user agent according to the HTTP specification. See 13.13 History Lists as defined in RFC 2616 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 for the problem and rationale.
