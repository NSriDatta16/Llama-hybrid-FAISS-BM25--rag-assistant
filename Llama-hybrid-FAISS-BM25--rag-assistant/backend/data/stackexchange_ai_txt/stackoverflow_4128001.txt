Is it ok for an HTML element to have the same [name] as its [id]?

I'm working on embedding a flash app in a webpage using the Satay method: id="embeddy" name="embeddy" > I want flash to provide the correct objectID in ExternalInterface.objectID , which means I need to set both the name and id attributes for the object . Normally I try to avoid naming collisions with elements in HTML, but is there anything wrong with setting both attributes to the same value in this case? What about HTML forms? Does anyone feel that it's worthwhile to set a(n) ( input | select | textarea ) element's name and id attributes to the same value?
