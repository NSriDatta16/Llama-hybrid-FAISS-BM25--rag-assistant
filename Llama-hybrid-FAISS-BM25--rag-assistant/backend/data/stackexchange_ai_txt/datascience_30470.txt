The differnece between supervised and unsupervised learning is that in supervised learning we have a labelled data (with the correct output) i.e there is one dependent variable, and the job of the ML task is to produce an output that is close to the actual output. In unsupervised learning we dont have any dependent variable or we dont have a labelled data or the actual output and the job of the ML task is to find hidden patterns and group the data according to the patterns. What type of ML algorithm will you use largely depend on the type of the data, that you can find by visualizing the data. If there is a linear correlation between the inputs and the output you can use simple linear regression and that will suffice and there is there is not a linear correlation than you can use SVM'S and if you dont want to use that you can use hit and try method and apply all simple alogorithms like naive bayes , linear regression , SVM,s and pick the that gives the best result. Regarding LSTM'S they are a type of deeplearning networks and mainly used for sequential data in time and a very complicated one like audio data or words in a sentence and this is an overcomplication of this task. If you want to go towards deepl learning than you can use a simple ANN for this task
