First of all you have to give the containing div a position:relative . That way the absolutely positioned dragger stays inside of it and can't go over it's borders. I'm not sure why the scrolling doesn't work, but is there a reason you scripted your dragging function yourself while you do have access to jQuery? There's a powerful function in jQuery called draggable that does exactly what you want.
