After searching for a while I found the solution in a couple of blogs, so thanks to Pablo and Shimi . These contain a more detailed background if you're interested. The problem related to something called the Agent Controller being linked to an old version of libstdc++. To solve it you can run the following two commands: wget mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gcc-2.95/libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2_2.95.4-24_i386.deb sudo dpkg --install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2_2.95.4-24_i386.deb Though your mileage may vary depending on distro version etc. You should then be able to profile successfully in Eclipse, I found that I didn't even need to restart Eclipse.
