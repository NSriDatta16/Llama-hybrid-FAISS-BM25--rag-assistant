The only way that you could do this more efficiently is to serialize them into different files (based on a field criteria that makes sense to your domain). Because you are not guaranteed that they are going to be serialized into the file in a specific order, you'll have to read the entire file into memory when you deserialize anyways to find all instances of the type where the field value is what you are looking for. I think you're already doing the best that you will within the constraints for serializing to a file. Have you considered SQLite to be your storage mechanism?
