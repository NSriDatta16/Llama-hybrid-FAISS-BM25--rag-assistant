The first problem you're going to have in getting a multi-supplier type system is that it will never meet your needs. If you really wish to have the right system then you should create your own from a decent framework. if you still wish to use a pre designed system that meets the needs you specified i would go with Magento Magento is one of the most advanced E-Commerce system I have ever worked with. The code itself is not so much easy to work with at the start but you get used to it after a few days/weeks. In regards to the "Access control", im not 100% weather this is supported but the Magento system is very abstract and im 80% positive that this can be done. "Must be multi-language or localized to German", Every language you need. "The sales process is very simple: An E-Mail to the supplier and to the administrator, containing the buyer's data, is enough." instead of me going on about the features i advise you to check it out. http://www.magentocommerce.com/ But I still would prefer to develop my own framework and build from that. Regards.
