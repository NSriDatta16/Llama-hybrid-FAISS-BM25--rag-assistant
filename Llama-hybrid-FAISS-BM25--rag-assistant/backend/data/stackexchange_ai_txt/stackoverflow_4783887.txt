How to delete session on closing browser?

How do I destroy Magento sessions when a user closes his/her browser in Magento? I tried to close and reopen my browser and I remain logged in. It looks like Magento persists the login status for certain amount of time. I changed 'cookie lifetime' under configuration, but it does not work. I could use session_set_cookie_params() in index.php, but I would like to know if I can fix it without touching code directly.
