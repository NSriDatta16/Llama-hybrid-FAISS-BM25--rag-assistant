What is the 95% confidence interval / ellipse in a PCA plot telling me?

I am new to statistics and within the last two days I tried to get my head around PCA plots. Now, I kind of understand what they are showing but I am still not sure about the 95% confidence ellipse that is very often shown in such plots. The 2 dimensional PCA plot displays the two biggest variances (whatever these are) in the data but I don't know what the ellipse is trying to tell me and what it means if a sample/dot (whatever is displayed) is lying outside that ellipse. Help is very much appreciated.
