It's hard to ignore the wealth of statistical packages available in R/CRAN. That said, I spend a lot of time in Python land and would never dissuade anyone from having as much fun as I do. :) Here are some libraries/links you might find useful for statistical work. NumPy/Scipy You probably know about these already. But let me point out the Cookbook where you can read about many statistical facilities already available and the Example List which is a great reference for functions (including data manipulation and other operations). Another handy reference is John Cook's Distributions in Scipy . pandas This is a really nice library for working with statistical data -- tabular data, time series, panel data. Includes many builtin functions for data summaries, grouping/aggregation, pivoting. Also has a statistics/econometrics library. larry Labeled array that plays nice with NumPy. Provides statistical functions not present in NumPy and good for data manipulation. python-statlib A fairly recent effort which combined a number of scattered statistics libraries. Useful for basic and descriptive statistics if you're not using NumPy or pandas. statsmodels Statistical modeling: Linear models, GLMs, among others. scikits Statistical and scientific computing packages -- notably smoothing, optimization and machine learning. PyMC For your Bayesian/MCMC/hierarchical modeling needs. Highly recommended. PyMix Mixture models. Biopython Useful for loading your biological data into python, and provides some rudimentary statistical/ machine learning tools for analysis. If speed becomes a problem, consider Theano -- used with good success by the deep learning people. There's plenty of other stuff out there, but this is what I find the most useful along the lines you mentioned.
