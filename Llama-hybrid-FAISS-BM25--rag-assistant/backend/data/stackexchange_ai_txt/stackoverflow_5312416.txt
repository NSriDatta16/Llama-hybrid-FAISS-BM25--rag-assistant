This will depend on what the user is actually favouriting but here's a quick generic overview of how I'd approach this. (THis is quite like how I've done similar things in real projects.) If you had a dictionary/list (or similar collection/enumerable) of your pages, I'd just have a separate collection which stored the indexes of the favourited pages. To persist the favourites I'd just serialize the collection (I'd use json rather than xml for speed) and save it to a file in IsolatedStorage. Adding to and deleteing from the favourites woudl just be a case of updating the collection. To display the favourites I'd create a class which wraps the list of keys/indexes and does a look up on the full list of pages to see what their names are and where to navigate to if selected.
