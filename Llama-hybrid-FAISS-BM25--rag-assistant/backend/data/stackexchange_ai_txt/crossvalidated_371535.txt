As the RMSE is in log-space it behaves like a multipicative factor. So you are finding the square root of the mean of the squared ratio between the model values and the true values. I.e. if the RMSE were 0.693 (=ln 2) the model values would be roughly a factor of two out on average (in either direction) from the true values in the original (non-log) space. Also, by taking the mean in log space you are less sensitive to large valued outliers.
