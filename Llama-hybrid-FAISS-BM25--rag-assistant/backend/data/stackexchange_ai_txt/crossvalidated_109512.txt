If you just want to say that there is a statistically significant dependence between the occurence of the event and the sign of the change in the stock market, you can model it the following way: create two binary variables for each day of your observation period: $X_t=1$ if the stock market rose on day $t$, 0 otherwise $Y_t=1$ if the event occurred on day $t$, 0 otherwise You can then check the independence of variables $X$ and $Y$ using a chi-squared test. If you want to get more fancy, you can also fit a linear regression model, regress the magnitude of stock market changes on $Y$, and use the t-test p-value of $Y$'s coefficient. If you want to take account for the number of occurrences on each day (other than just 0-1), you can do Poisson regression of the occurrences, using the S&P change as the explanatory variable. NB: neither the chi-squared test nor the regressions take into account the time series aspect of the data, they work as if all days in the dataset were randomly drawn days in the whole period. Therefor they don't take into account the fact that the occurence of the event might also depend on its having occurred in the previous days.
