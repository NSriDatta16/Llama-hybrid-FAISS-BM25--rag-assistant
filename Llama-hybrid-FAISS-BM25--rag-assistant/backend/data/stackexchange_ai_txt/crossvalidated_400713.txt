increase dimensionality svm example

I understood that increasing the dimensionality in SVM will help, but I try to understand the concept mathematically, as described in Breiman, Leo. " Statistical modeling: The two cultures ." Statistical science 16.3 (2001): 199-231. However, let us increase the dimensionality by adding as additional predictor variables all quadratic monomials in the original predictor variables; that is, all terms of the form $x_{m1}x_{m2}$ . A hyperplane in the original variables plus quadratic monomials in the original variables is a more complex creature. The possibility of separation is greater. If no separation occurs, add cubic monomials as input features. If there are originally 30 predictor variables, then there are about 40,000 features if monomials up to the fourth degree are added. So let's say I have $y = x +1$ , then I do increase the dimensionality, how does this help with SVM?
