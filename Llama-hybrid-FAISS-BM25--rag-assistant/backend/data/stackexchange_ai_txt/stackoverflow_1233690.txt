How can I automatically prepend comment blocks to SQL Server stored procedures?

In my organization, the standard is to comment all stored procedures with a comment block that looks like this: /*-- ============================================= -- Created by: Chris McCall -- Created date: 08.05.2009 -- Purpose: Inserts new setting value, code and description -- Modifications: -- -- =============================================*/ I don't find this to be particularly useful, since the stored procedure is named usp_utl_CustomSettingsInsert anyway, and the comments are not guaranteed to be accurate. I usually ignore these blocks unless I have a problem and need to contact the original developer (who has long since departed, cackling maniacally, in a helicopter). However, it's not up to me, so I have to do this. Is there any way, with a trigger or some other SQL Server magic, to create these comment blocks with nothing more than the power of my mind ?
