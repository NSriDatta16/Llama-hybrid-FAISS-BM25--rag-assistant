As Mike pointed out in a comment, you should really set up a web service that some JavaScript on the page can poll periodically - this would then go and interagate the queue, check for messages, and if it finds one, display a message to the user. This site has a function very similar to that when you are answering a question - it has a "Heartbeat" javascript call that polls the server looking for new answers - if it finds some, an orange message bar appears at the top of the page telling you there are new answers, and would you like to view them?
