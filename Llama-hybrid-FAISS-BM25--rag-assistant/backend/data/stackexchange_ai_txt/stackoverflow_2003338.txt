Update your SQL query to use: ORDER BY state, alphaname This will make your database return results as: state city ------------------ AK Anchorage AK Juneau ...assuming using SELECT state, alphaname AS city for the purposes of an example. The presentation has to be handled in PHP: //Please excuse my hideous attempt at PHP. Better to think of it as Psuedo code while ($thearray = mysql_fetch_array($list)) { echo $thearray[state] echo " $thearray[alphaname] "; } ...or you could look at i-g 's post.
