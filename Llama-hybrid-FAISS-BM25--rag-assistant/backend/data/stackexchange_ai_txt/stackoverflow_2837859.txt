How to diganose an unlogged Error 500 on Apache?

We are running a very simple Symfony script, that randomly returns an Error 500. The system administrator says he can't find any trace of an Error 500 on the error logs, however using Curl or Firebug, it is obvious that an Error 500 is being returned. The script simply parses a POST request submitted to an URL on our server. We already checked for performance, memory etc but nothing seems to be the problem. How is this possible? We already enabled all debugging, logging, on Apache, PHP, etc and nothing.
