SAS is an excellent language for quickly processing huge datasets (hundreds of millions of records in which each record has hundreds of variables). It is used in academia and in many industries (we use it for warranty claims analysis; many clinical trials use it for statistical analysis & reporting). However, there are some caveats: the language has several deficiencies in my opinion which makes it difficult to write modular, reusable code (there is a very rich macro facility, but no user defined functions until version 9.2). Probably a bigger caveat is that a SAS license is very expensive; thus, it probably wouldn't be practical for a single individual to purchase a license for their own experimentation, though the price of a license may not be prohitive to a large company. Still, I believe SAS sells a learning edition, which is likely less expensive. If you're interested in learning SAS, here are some excellent resources: Official SAS Documentation: http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/base/index.html SAS White Papers / Conference Proceedings: http://support.sas.com/events/sasglobalforum/previous/online.html SAS-L Newsgroup (Much, much more activity regarding SAS questions than here on stackoverflow): http://listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=sas-l&D=0 There are also regional and local SAS users groups, from which you can learn a lot (for example in my area there is a MWSUG (Midwest SAS Users Group) and MISUG (Michigan SAS User's Group)).
