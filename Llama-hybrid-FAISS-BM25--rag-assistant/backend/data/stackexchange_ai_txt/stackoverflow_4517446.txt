Eazfuscator 2.9 & Visual Studio 2010: Drag'n'drop the ClickOnce project from Visual Studio onto the green zone of Eazfuscator.NET, so it gets protected on every build. You need to do this just once. Once the protection is set you can build the project over and over again. The corresponding assembly will be automatically obfuscated If you have multiple projects in your solution you can apply step 1 for them also, but I suggest to start with a few assemblies as possible Switch to Release build configuration. Visual Studio Express users please take note about build configurations Publish Works good for me.
