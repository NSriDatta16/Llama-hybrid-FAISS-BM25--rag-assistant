When it comes to displaying user submitted data, the generally accepted mantra is to "Filter input, escape output." I would recommend against escaping things like html entities, etc, before going into the database, because you never know when HTML will not be your display medium. Also, different types of situations require different types of output escaping. For example, embedding a string in Javascript requires different escaping than in HTML. Doing this before may lull yourself into a false sense of security. So, the basic rule of thumb is, sanitize before use and specifically for that use; not pre-emptively. (Please note, I am not talking about escaping output for SQL, just for display. Please still do escape data bound for an SQL string).
