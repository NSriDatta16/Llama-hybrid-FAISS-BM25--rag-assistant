This is no more than a bundle of comments but it will be too long for that format. I am no more than a time series amateur, but I do have some simple suggestions. You may be under orders here, but I think this needs some sharpening up in terms of what you expect to achieve and what is most important to you. Forecasting visits is, unfortunately, a fuzzy goal. For example, suppose it is 4 p.m. and you want to forecast visits one hour ahead. Do you really need a super-model incorporating a treatment of the entire previous series? This has to come from some consideration of the real practical and/or scientific goals, which may be stipulated by your superiors or a client or may be your own as a researcher. I suspect it's more likely that different models are needed for different purposes. Separating out hourly series seems to be driven by the idea of cutting down the computation without very much consideration of how much sense it makes. So, the implication is that you don't (won't) use information from earlier today in predicting what's happening at 4 p.m., just all previous 4 p.m. observations? It seems to me that needs a lot of talking through. You are evidently a learner in time series (and I'm putting myself on a par) but no learner should start with a problem this big. Really! You have a lot of data, you have periodicities on several scales, you have irregularities of opening hours and holidays, you have exogenous variables: you have picked a very difficult problem. (What about trends too?) It's easy to say, but it's evidently passed you by so far: you might have to work on very simplified versions of the problem first and get a feel for how to fit simpler models. Throwing everything in to a big complicated model is evidently not working well, and something radically simpler seems called for, or a realisation that the project is possibly too ambitious.
