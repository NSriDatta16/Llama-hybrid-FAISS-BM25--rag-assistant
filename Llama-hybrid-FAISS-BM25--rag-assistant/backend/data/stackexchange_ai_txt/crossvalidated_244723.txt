Assumptions of poisson regression model

I am going to use Poisson regression in my model, but I don't know what assumptions I need to check to verify adequacy of the model. In a normal regression, I had to check Gauss Markov assumptions for my estimates to be BLUE. Do I have to check same assumptions for Poisson? Can I apply tests like White's test, Breusch Pagan test, etc., to Poisson regression? I googled these questions but unfortunately didn't find anything helpful, so if you know good source please share.
