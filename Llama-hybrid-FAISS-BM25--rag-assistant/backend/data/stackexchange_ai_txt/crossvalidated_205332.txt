Assuming it is indeed the preferred bandwidth estimator in Sheather and Jones' (1991) JRSS-B paper [1] that you mean (specifically, $\hat{h}_{2S}$), here's a brief discussion (as requested), but a brief discussion of a highly technical topic is necessarily a little vague and cryptic. The basic issue of finding efficient$^\dagger$ bandwidth estimators boils down to finding a good estimate of $R(f'')$ (where $R(g) = \int g^2(x) dx$), the integrated squared second derivative of the density to be estimated -- i.e. the asymptotically optimal bandwidth depends on the second derivative of the very thing we wish to estimate! $^\dagger$ here, specifically in the sense of minimum asymptotic mean integrated squared error (AMISE) ... about which, see here Why does the integrated squared second derivative matter? In effect it measures how "wiggly" the curve is over the range you're looking at. If you have a very wiggly curve you won't get a good estimate of it with a wide bandwidth because you'll average over a bunch of wiggles instead of following them. If you have a curve that's pretty straight it makes sense to have a much wider bandwidth (since you can reduce the noise in your estimate by including more data). A number of bandwidth estimators use (in turn) a kernel based estimate of $R(f'')$. Sheather and Jones include a bias term in their estimate of $R(f'')$ that had previously been neglected. This results in estimating $R(f''')$ (a lot of detail is being glossed over here). How to summarize all that? It's an improved version of a kernel-based estimate of the optimal bandwidth, not that this is likely to help much. As to why it's popular (I won't engage in idle discussion of whether it's the most popular, since it seems impossible to reliably assess), the abstract gives a highly plausible reason: reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations [...] second to none in the existing literature i.e. it (demonstrably) works well in practice for a reasonably broad set of of cases. [There have been - unsurprisingly - further suggested improvements in the last quarter century, but this bandwidth estimator remains popular.] [1] S. J. Sheather, and M. C. Jones.
