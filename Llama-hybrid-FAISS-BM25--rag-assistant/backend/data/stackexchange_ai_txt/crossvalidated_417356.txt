One-hot encoding for duplicate words

I'm currently studying NLP and was practicing one-hot encoding for sentences at the word level. My question is, if we have multiple examples of the same word in a sentence, does one-hot encoding normally assign separate "slots" for each instance of the same word? For example, if we have the sentence "The cat sat on the mat." we can observe that the word "the" is used twice. Is each "the" assigned a separate entry, such that the encoding would look like: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
