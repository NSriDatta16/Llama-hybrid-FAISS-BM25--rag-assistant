It isn't that birth several days later is "triggering" prolapse at an earlier time. It's that pregnancy (along with other biological factors) increases the probability both of prolapse and (obviously) of giving birth. That's confounding in its strict sense.* You don't want to set up a model in which giving birth per se is assumed to be the "cause" of prolapse and prolapse-associated death, when they are both due to something else (pregnancy) and both pregnancy and giving birth can lead to death from causes other than prolapse. One way to approach this might be as a multi-state competing-risks model, in which you evaluate all states-- prolapse and gaveBirth both separately and as a combined state (or 2 states, if you think that the order matters), pregnancy (before prolapse or gaveBirth , as the starting state), and death--as a function of time from conception (or maybe from some later time to avoid pregnancies with early-term fetal losses). You model all the possible transitions among the states. If you are interested specifically in death due to prolapse, you might be primarily interested in the prolapse → death and (prolapse + gaveBirth) → death transitions, paying less attention to the gaveBirth → death and pregnancy → death transitions not involving prolapse. A vignette for the R survival package outlines how to proceed with multi-state models. *Hernán and Robins devote Chapter 7 and much of the rest of their Causal Inference book to problems arising from confounding.
