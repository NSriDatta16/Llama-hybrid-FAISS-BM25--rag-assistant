How to make random walk stationary?

I know that random walk is modeled as; $Y_t = Y_{t-1}+ u_t$ ; It is known that it is not a stationary model since the variance of observations at different times are not same. As a general, remedy difference (integration) is taken to solve it,hence make it stationary. I come up with the idea that it might be done it two way; one that; $Y_t - Y_{t-1}= Y_{t-1}+ u_t - Y_{t-1}$ $Y_{t-1}$ can be substracted in both handsides. In this way indeed we can have a stationary time series with the help of the assumption that $u_t$ is a white noise. I have seen that difference is also can be applied in a way that (I-L)(I refers for identity, and L for Lag operator). In this case; $(I-L)Y_t= (I-L)Y_{t-1}+ (I-L)u_t$ => $\Delta Y_t = \Delta Y_{t-1} + u_t$ In this case, if we try to take covariance of $Y_{t-1}$ we see that it is not constant, hence thestochastic process is not stationary. I feel like the latter derivation is wrong, since differincing does not end up with a stationary time-series. BUT, I couldnt find where I am mistaken. I need your help to understand my mistake. Thanks to all in advance!
