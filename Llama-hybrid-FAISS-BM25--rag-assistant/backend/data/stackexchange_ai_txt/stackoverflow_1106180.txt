serving xhtml + mathml to firefox and IE

Firefox requires xhtml extension for mathml but IE will not display pages with xhtml extension (it displays a download dialog box instead). I have tried apache content negotiation like so: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} .*MSIE.* RewriteRule \.xhtml$ - [T=text/html] but IE seems only to care about the extension. I have tried this on my local server where mod_rewrite is installed.
