actionscript dynamic text

I have a text box set up in my project and it works fine when I test it but when I put it in the web page it only shows part of the text here is the setup and when I build it I get this but then when I put it in the web i get this i've tried using both embedding and using device font without success anyone have an idea what I might be doing wrong ? EDIT here are the only calls to text box in acitonscript function onLoaded(e:Event):void{ try{ //try to stuff } catch(error:TypeError) { error_txt.text = error.toString(); } } function ioError(e:IOErrorEvent):void { error_txt.text = e.text; }
