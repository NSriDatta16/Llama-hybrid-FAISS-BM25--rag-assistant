Do not get hung up by the Finance or Economics tags. VAR is a time-series technique. This bears repeating: time-series, and nothing but. Its key innovation, back in the day, was that it removed all underlying domain-specific information encoded in a model and reduced it to pure time series interaction : in the simplest case, does the past of series A and B affect either one or both of A and B? If one series is shocked , how long does a change persist etc. Economics, particularly macroeconomics, simply became a big application area as there are often time series that are interrelated, and a model-free way (in the VAR sense) can not only be useful for model fitting but also for forecasts from these models.
