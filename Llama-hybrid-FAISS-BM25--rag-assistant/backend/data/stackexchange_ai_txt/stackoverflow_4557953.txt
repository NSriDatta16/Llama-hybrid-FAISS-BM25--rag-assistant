It sounds like you want a drawer (NSDrawer). Drawers have fallen out of favor with most app designers but are still an official, supported part of Cocoa on Mac OSX. You might use a drawer to hide a bunch of controls that you don't want to be cluttering up your main window all the time. Search for "Drawer" in the Xcode and under Titles you'll see a Drawers guide and DrawerMadness sample code. You can have a button open and close the drawer with very little code. A good pro/con discussion of using drawers A more general solution is a child window. It's just a completely separate window (probably without a titlebar) that is attached to your document or other window (I'm assuming "right of my application" in your question means "right of my window"). See documentation for NSWindow addChildWindow:ordered: The child window will remain attached to its parent window even when the window is dragged. But child windows are a lot more work than drawers.
