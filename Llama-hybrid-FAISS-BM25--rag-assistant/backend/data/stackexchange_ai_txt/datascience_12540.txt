Feature engineering is usually the way to improve the performance. Another possible way to improve result is through supervised feature selection. I could recommend Chi-square feature selection , step-wise feature selection . As for a more complete survey on feature selection, you could refer to Guyon, Isabelle, and Andr√© Elisseeff. "An introduction to variable and feature selection." Journal of machine learning research 3.Mar (2003): 1157-1182.
