CreateCompatibleDC doesn't do what you think it does. From the linked page: Before an application can use a memory device context for drawing operations, it must select a bitmap of the correct width and height into the device context. This may be done by using CreateCompatibleBitmap to specify the height, width, and color organization required in the function call. Device contexts are an abstraction. There must be a storage behind them -- a screen or, in your case, a bitmap.
