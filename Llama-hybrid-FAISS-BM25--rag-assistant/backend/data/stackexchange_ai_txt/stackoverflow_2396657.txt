I would recommend Restful Web Services . It's weel written, very complete and vendor agnostic. Also it has a fairly good coverage of both REST (with comparison to SOAP/WS-*), HTTP scaling, resource formats (JSON, XHTML, Atom, XML), security and service modeling. If you have any specific scaling needs, then you might also want to read Building Scalable Web Sites . It will teach you everything worth knowing about etags , proxies , caching , edge computing and so forth. However if you are just starting out, then the Rest book I mentioned earlier will properly cover most people needs.
