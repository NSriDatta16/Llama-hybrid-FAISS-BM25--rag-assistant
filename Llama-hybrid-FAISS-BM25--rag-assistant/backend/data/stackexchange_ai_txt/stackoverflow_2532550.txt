You could consider Spring dmServer . It's a rather non-traditional appserver, with a very lightweight OSGi core (the web container is optional, for example), but it gives you classloader isolation and basic container services. It's not a JavaEE container, but comes with plug-in modules that are. You're stlll going to have to do a lot of work yourself, but the basics of dmServer are very sound.
