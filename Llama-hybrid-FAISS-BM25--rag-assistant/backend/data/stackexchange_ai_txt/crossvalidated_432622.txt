Logistic regression is the goto first try to predict whether something does happen or does not happen from a multivariate sample. It is a generalized form of linear regression that will predict values between $0$ and $1$ that can be interpreted as probabilities between 0% and 100%. I have never unsed Excel for logistic regression but there is a huge number of introductory texts and videos to be found using the search terms "Excel logistic regression". Should you find that logistic regression does not quite fit the way people cancel their hotel bookings have a look at decision trees, though my first search results seem to show only hand-drawn, not automatic decisions trees. I have found these links without confirming them, though: www.stricklensolutions.com/excel-add-ins/solutiontree/solutiontree-decision-trees-in-excel.php www.treeplan.com go.palisade.com/DTSDownload.html It can also be done with free software outside of Excel.
