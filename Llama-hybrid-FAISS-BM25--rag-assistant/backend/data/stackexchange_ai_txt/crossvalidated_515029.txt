There is no perfect model one can recommend at this moment nor any particular moment unless you try several models on your data. R has great Logistic Regression models that you may try . When you try several models based on some metric you will find the best model. Usually the cross validation is the way to detect which model is the best for your data. Cross validation is not great just to detect if your model has good predictive capacity for the dependent feature, but also it can help you determine the relation in between independent features.
