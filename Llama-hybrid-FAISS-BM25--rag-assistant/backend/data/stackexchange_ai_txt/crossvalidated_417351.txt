Small sample size with very skewed right response

I have a dataset of 300 observations with 7 predictor variables with 1 continuous response variable. The response is strongly skewed to the right and there are no significant correlations among any of the predictors or the response. I have attempted several different models including XGBoost, random forests, etc. Even transforming of the response hasn't helped. Any advice on how one should approach a problem like this would be greatly appreciated.
