How does quantile regression compare to logistic regression with the variable split at the quantile?

I googled a bit but didn't find anything on this. Suppose you do a quantile regression on the qth quantile of the dependent variable. Then you split the DV at the qth quantile and label the result 0 and 1. Then you do logistic regression on the categorized DV. I'm looking for any Monte-Carlo studies of this or reasons to prefer one over the other etc.
