ASP.NET MVC: How do you set the selected item in a dropdown in the view manually?

I have a view that consists of a number of records. Each record has a corresponding form to edit its details that is hidden until the user presses Edit, at which point the form is displayed and can be posted using Ajax to save changes. Each record has a category (foreign key to another table). The list of categories is taken from the viewmodel, which is a SelectList. So, one SelectList of Categories which feeds many forms (one for each record) Basically, in my loop that renders out of my list of records I would like the edit form to have the correct category selected. It would appear though that Html.DropDownList does not have an overload that lets you set the selected item - this must be done when creating the SelectList - I only do this once in my ViewModel. Am I missing a trick? My code: File Category I'd like to pass in the selected item at this point based on the value of the record Thanks, EDIT Included some more code so that it makes more sense: Portion of the ViewModel that supplies data to the view: public class CustomerFilesViewModel { public List Files { get; set; } //added for the manage files area of the site public SelectList Organisations { get; set; } public int PDFS { get; set; } public int DOCS { get; set; } public int JPGS { get; set; } public double Quota { get; set; } public double TotalFiles { get; set; } public int SpreadSheets { get; set; } public SelectList Categories { get; set; } ............... In my view I then loop over the files and create an edit form for each File. I populate the category DropDownnn using the SelectList from the ViewModel. I would like to be able to set the selected item in the loop by using file.CategoryID .
