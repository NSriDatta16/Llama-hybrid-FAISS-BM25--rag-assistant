Sorry, due my reputation I cant comment the answer of @Ã‰be Isaac. If you perform z-test, which I think is a quite good option to compare two classifiers, you have to be careful about how to use the accuracy metrics. I suggest three possible experiments on applying z-test over accuracy values. Do the experiments with accuracy for each class. Do the experiments with balanced accuracy score. You have to pay attention also to n in the denominator of the formula. Use a test set where each class occurs the same number of time (>50). I done a colab notebook on which I reported this experiments for Floor Estimation. colab
