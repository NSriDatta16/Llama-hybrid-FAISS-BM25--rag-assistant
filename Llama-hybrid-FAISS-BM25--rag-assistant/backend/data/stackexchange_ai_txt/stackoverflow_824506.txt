When it comes to setting up routes like this, I use a config file. As a preference, I use XML to store my config data, however these could just as easily be stored in another supported format. I then add the routes from the config, to the router in my bootstrap. Config: :module/:id index index :module/:controller/:id index :module/:controller/:action/:id index index Bootstrap $config = new Zend_Config_Xml('config.xml'); $router = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getRouter(); $router->addConfig($config, 'routes'); Obviously, there are other options and I'd encourage you to read the documentation on this, however, this fits for your example.
