How can I determine whether PC1 or PC2 is more effective to separate enzymes and non enzymes for the CD proteins?

The score plot from the PCA is represented in the diagram. I performed the Mann Whitney U test for the Scores values for enzymes( blue dot in score plot) and non-enzymes ( red dot) for both PC1 and PC2. I found out that for both Pc1 and PC2, the enzymes and non-enzymes values were significant( both had p-value 0.00). Is there and way to find out by mann whitney U test ( by considering U value or any other values, whether PC1 or PC2 is more effective to seperate enzymes or non-enzymes?
