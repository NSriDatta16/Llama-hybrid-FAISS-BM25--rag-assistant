IBM SPSS Damped Trend time series analysis method no significance trend parameter

I have been doing a time series analysis of a PPP GDP with SPSS and I have tried to apply a Damped Trend method. This was a non-seasonal quarterly time series with a trend and as a result after using all of the models for exponential smoothing for non-seasonal time series the damped trend was the most precise one after comparing the basic RMSE, MAPE and MAE parameters and also when I compared it within ex ante analysis to a real data. Problem is that when I check the different decomposed parameters of this time series, the trend is statistically insignificant on 95% interval... Can I still consider this damped trend method to be the best one or is it even as it should be that the trend becomes statistically insignificant ? Those are the model paramethers: Exponential Smoothing Model Parameters Update I have wrongly assumed the significance of Gamma(trend), is more than a 5%, it was a mistake.
