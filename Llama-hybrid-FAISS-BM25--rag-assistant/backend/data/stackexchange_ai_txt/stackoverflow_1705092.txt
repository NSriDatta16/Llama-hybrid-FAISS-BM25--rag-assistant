First off, the way you've worded your question is a bit confusing here, but I think I understand. You've got a couple options here. If you want to design your toolbar, just add one to the view you are loading and drag the various buttons and separators onto it in Interface Builder. Then create IBActions in that view's view controller and drag connections from your toolbar items to the various actions. Since you are using a Navigation controller, though, you will want to hide the toolbar you get by default by unchecking the "Shows Toolbar" box in your MainWindow.xib when the UINavigationController is selected (Attributes tab in the IB inspector). alt text http://cimgf.com/files/toolbarthing.png Alternatively, you can just add toolbar items programmatically in the viewDidLoad method by calling [self setToolbarItems:items]; where items is an NSArray of toolbar items. Really there is no way that I'm aware of to cause the navigation controller to use your custom toolbar. Just hide the main one and use your custom one.
