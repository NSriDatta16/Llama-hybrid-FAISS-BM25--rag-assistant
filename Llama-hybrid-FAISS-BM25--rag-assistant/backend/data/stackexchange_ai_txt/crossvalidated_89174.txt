How to sum uncertainties, systematic and random

I apologize for the simplistic questions. I have a retrieval process that has a set of random and systematic uncertainties associated with it. I'm assuming that these are all independent. The goal is to find the total error for this process. I have two questions related to this: 1) To find the total systematic uncertainty can I sum all the systematic uncertainty components in quadrature? Assuming that they are independent, it is unlikely that they will all contribute in the same direction and it seems to make sense to add them in quadrature. However, by definition they are not random. Does this mean they must be added linearly? 2) To find the total uncertainty (total_random + total_systematic), can the total_random and total_systematic be added in quadrature or must they be added linearly? Thank you in advance for you help!
