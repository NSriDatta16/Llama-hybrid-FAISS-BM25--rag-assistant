I see two potential problems here. JavaScript, like many other programming languages, uses the " character to mark the beginning and the end of a string. Your hintbox text contains a ", so when JavaScript encounters it, it thinks that your string has ended. To fix the problem, you should refer to each " in your string as \". This tells JavaScript that you don't intend to end the string, but rather you plan to put a " inside your string. Similarly, JavaScript does not allow you to place a "paragraph break" directly inside a string. Instead, you must type \n each time you want a carriage return inside your string. So, here is how you should define your hintbox string: hintbox = "Hemmed Finish: Every side/edge (1/2\" to 2\") of the banner are folded and glued (special vinyl solution) or heat pressed. This is the most common and best finish option.\n\nStitched Finish: Every side/edge (1\" to 2\") of the banner are folded in the back and stitched/sewed with white thread. This is not a common option as thread can be seen on the banner."; This is typically called "escaping strings", and a quick Google should give you much more information on the toppic. Happy programming!
