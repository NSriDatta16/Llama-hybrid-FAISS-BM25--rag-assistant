Regex white list for input validation - accent insensitive

I'd like to be able to constrain user input to a white list of valid characters, but I don't want to prevent people from other cultures from signing up. So far, I have this: ^[a-zA-Z0-9èéêëàáâãäçìíîïòóôõöùúûü-_]*$ It allows for most French accents, but the list of accents in the latin character set are IMMENSE! I would prefer to use a white list instead of a black list, in case I miss something. Note , This will be for C# but I'd like to use the regex for client side validation to be consistent on both sides. I'm HTML encoding the input when I save it to the database as well. Is there a more elegant way of making the regex accent insensitive, but still being restrictive enough to prevent XSS? I don't want to alienate my users. I would like to be able to have some punctuation but not open myself up for XSS attacks, for example, I want someone to enter their company name: If someone worked at Yahoo!, they should be able to sign up.
