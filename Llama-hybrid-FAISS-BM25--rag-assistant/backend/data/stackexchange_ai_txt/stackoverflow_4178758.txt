Why would people want to steal your database? Why does it matter if they do ? Would asking them not to not be sufficient? Make your policy clear and ensure that your company legal department have checked the wording. Discourage unauthorised syndication by making it clear that it is not permitted and that you will take legal steps to prevent it. Or better still, encourage authorised syndication. People will only carry out unauthorised syndication if there is no sensible way for them to do so in an authorised manner. Technical measures might have some effect, but would only deter those who aren't particular competent or determined.
