I know in Oracle you can put in hints in the form of sql comments. There are optimizers that will see the comments and try to use the hints to make the sql run faster or other various functions. When it comes to db logging you will only decrease performance of the database if you attempt to log what users did what because you are now creating more overhead to build your log file or table rows to store the user related info. There are other tools for enterprise DBs like oracle that allow you to see concurrent transactions that can help you find bottlenecks when slow downs occur. The best meta data you can get for analyzing web traffic are the technologies you listed above. When it comes to banking transactions and the movement and storage of very massive amounts of data, anything you do to log how users move around in your site or the database will create more overhead. You can write code to check out suspicious behavior but you would end up doing it at the cost of slower performance.
