Without resorting to some 3rd party tools, the easiest way is just to delete the modified tables from the designer and drag them back in from Server Explorer. Unfortunately, if you've made any manual modifications in the L2S designer they wont be preserved and you'll have to manually make the changes again. huagati has a tool that claims to be able to refresh changes but I haven't tried it myself.
