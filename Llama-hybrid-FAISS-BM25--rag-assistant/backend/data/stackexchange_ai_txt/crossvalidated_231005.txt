GBM and 1-dim approximation

So, I guess I am completely lost on subject of regression trees. Here is my code: import pandas as pd import xgboost as xgb import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np x = np.linspace(0, 10, 20) train_X = pd.DataFrame({"A":x}) train_y = pd.Series(np.sin(x)) gbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=7, n_estimators=300, learning_rate=0.01).fit(train_X, train_y) predictions = gbm.predict(train_X) plt.plot(x, predictions) plt.show() The above code generates straight line as prediction. I expected some step function approximating sin . Any suggestions? How do regression trees work?
