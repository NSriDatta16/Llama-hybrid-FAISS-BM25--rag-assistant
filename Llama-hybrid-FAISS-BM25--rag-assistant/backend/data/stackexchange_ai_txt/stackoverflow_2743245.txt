How to use Pisa on Google App Engine to generate PDF from HTML/CSS

I'm developing a simple GAE application that crawls some data from a given site and presenst it formatted in html/css. What I would like to do now is to offer an Export to PDF feature trasforming the formatted html/css to PDF. I've imported Reportlab Toolkit and it works good but it's not what I need since it forces me to create PDF manually like: pcanvas.drawString(10, 10, 'This is the title Blah blah blah') What I really need is a library like PISA that trasforms Html/Css to PDF. Anyone has managed to succesfully intregrate and use PISA on Google App Engine?
