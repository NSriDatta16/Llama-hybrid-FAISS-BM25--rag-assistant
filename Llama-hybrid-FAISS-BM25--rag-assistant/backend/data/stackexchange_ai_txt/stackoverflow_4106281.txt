A few possibilities: you're compiling the two programs with different compilers and/or compiler switches you have another header which appears before the header in question in one of the programs and this messes with #pragma pack or similar and doesn't restore the setting a type that is used in the shared struct is defined differently in the two programs (Note: the last two points can be applied recursively to any other structs which are used within the problem struct.)
