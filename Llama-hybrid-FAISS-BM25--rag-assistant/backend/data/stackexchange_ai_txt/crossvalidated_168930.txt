Well, without more information its hard to say, but by the definition of logistic regression you are saturating based on the fitted data. So in the equation the e^-t term is going to 0. So the first place to look would be to see what the actual coefficients are. This could also be due to poorly scaled variables. There might be an issue where one of the columns is huge in numerical value compared to others that is causing it mess up.
