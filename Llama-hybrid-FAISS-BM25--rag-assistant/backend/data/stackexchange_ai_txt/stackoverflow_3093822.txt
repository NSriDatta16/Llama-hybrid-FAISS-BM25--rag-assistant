Ashish, Microsoft purposefully limits vsTestHost.exe to use only 1 core. I know of no way to get it to use multiple cores. This is a "bait-and-switch" tactic that Microsoft uses so very often. They want you to purchase separate licenses for their Test Load Agent software. The Test Load Agent software/process is multi-threaded, and will run across all cores of a CPU. Regards, Brent
