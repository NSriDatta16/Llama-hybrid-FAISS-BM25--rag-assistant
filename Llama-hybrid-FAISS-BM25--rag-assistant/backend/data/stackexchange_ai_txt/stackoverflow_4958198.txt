You could have a look at psfrag , that's what I usually use when I try to use Matlab figures in LaTeX. You basically put just tags into the figure in Matlab and replace those tags with LaTeX text afterwards. The biggest benefit is that this allows you to have identical symbols in text and figures. Edit: when looking for the psfrag-URL, I found a Matlab script to simplify this: LaPrint .
