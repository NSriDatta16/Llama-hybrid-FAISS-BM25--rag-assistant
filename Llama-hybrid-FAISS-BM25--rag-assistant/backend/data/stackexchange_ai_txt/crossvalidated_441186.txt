instantaneous transition rates in continuous-time Markov chain

Consider a set of n machines and a single repair facility to service these machines. Suppose that when machine i , i = 1,2, … n, fails, it requires an exponentially distributed amount of work with rate to repair it. The repair facility divides its efforts equally among all failed machines in the sense that whenever there are k failed machines each one receives work at a rate of 1/k per unit time. If there are a total of r working machines, including machine i , then i fails at an instantaneous rate /r (a) Find the instantaneous transition rates The answer is as following, Okay, I can understand that qS,S-i = µi / |S|. As far as I know, because the repair facility divides its efforts equally among all failed machines in the sense, we need to make µi divided by |S|. But I cannot understand that qS,S+j = . In my opinion, since the sentence- " i fails at an instantaneous rate /r " should imply that the rate at which process makes a transition from state S into state S+j is j/r, then qS,S+j should be j/| $S^c$ |. Do I misunderstand something?
