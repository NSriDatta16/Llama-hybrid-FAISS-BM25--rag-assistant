An estimate is biased if its expected value is not equal to the true parameter value. The magnitude of the difference between the expected or average value of the estimator and the parameter is the absolute bias of the estimator. Bias correction means that you take a biased estimate and add a constant to it to obtain an estimator with less or possibly (and ideally) zero bias.
