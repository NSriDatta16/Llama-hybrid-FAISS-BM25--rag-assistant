You can change the column order of a Foxpro Table within the Foxpro IDE. USE table EXCLUSIVE MODIFY STRUCTURE Click on the button on left of the field and drag it up or down to where you need it. EDIT: After reading the comment about it working on your boss's computer it sounds like the problem is that the foxuser.dbf is remembering the column order you browsed with last - since the columns weren't there the last time it just shows them at the end though they are really in the middle. What exact command are you using to look at the table on your computer?
