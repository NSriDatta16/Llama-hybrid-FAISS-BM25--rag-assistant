Python List Division/Splitting

Possible Duplicate: How do you split a list into evenly sized chunks in Python? Hello, I'm trying to find a simpler way to do the following: def list_split(list, size): result = [[]] while len(list) > 0: if len(result[-1]) >= size: result.append([]) result[-1].append(list.pop(0)) return result Example usage: >>> list_split([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5], [6]] >>> list_split([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3) [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]] I can't tell if there's a built-in way to do this, possibly with slicing or something. This is similar but not the same to the post at How to split a list into a given number of sub-lists in python Thanks EDIT : As is commented on by Anurag Uniyal, this is a duplicate of How do you split a list into evenly sized chunks? , and should be closed, which I cannot do.
