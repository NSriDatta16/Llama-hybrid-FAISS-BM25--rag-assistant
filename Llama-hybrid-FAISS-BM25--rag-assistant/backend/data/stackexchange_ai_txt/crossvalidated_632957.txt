Comparing distribution of a biomarker among patients with overlapping clinical features

I have a question how to compare the distribution of one tested biomarker among patients with different overlapping clinical syndromes. In my case, I am investigating patients with multiple sclerosis and their clinical symptoms can be attributed to several different syndromes, for example pyramidal, sensory, etc. Moreover, one patient may have two or even 3 syndromes. In my datasheet, I created columns with different syndromes (5 in total), and I encoded all my patients as positive (1) or negative (0). At this moment, I want to compare if the distribution of the tested biomarkers differ among these syndromes. Until now, I was able only to evaluate if it differs within one group, for example among patients with pyramidal syndrome and without it (using Mann-Whitney U test as data is non-parametric). However, this kind of comparison does not allow me to evaluate the overlap of these syndromes as the patient with pyramidal syndrome may also have sensory and brainstem symptoms. How should I organise my data and what statistical test should I perform to evaluate the distribution of biomarker between different syndrome while keeping in mind their overlap?
