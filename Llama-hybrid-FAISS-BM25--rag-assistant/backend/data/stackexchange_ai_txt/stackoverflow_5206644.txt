Naming conventions for a project containg only WCF ServiceReferences?

Let's say we have a back-end that needs to talk to N external systems using some kind of Web Services. What I do is: Create a separate project and generate there the proxy classes (using the service's WSDL in the WCF Service Reference dialog). About the project name suffix: I firstly though XxAdapter. But then, I started creating classes with additional logic like CircuitBreakers so I ended up with XxAgent (from ServiceAgent). What should be the "correct" suffix for the name of such projects.
