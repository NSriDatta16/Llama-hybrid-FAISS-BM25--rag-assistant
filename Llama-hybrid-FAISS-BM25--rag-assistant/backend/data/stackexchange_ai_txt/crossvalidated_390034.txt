A couple things: 1) If your data are bounded for good reason (e.g. your data is a rating, and 36 is the highest the rating can go), then Poisson regression is not appropriate. You should use something like Beta Regression or logistic regression, and transform your outcome to a number between 0 and 1 (1 being the largest the outcome can be). This can be done by dividing the observation by the max (so y/36). 2) Now this is sounding like you want to do inference, which is a lot different than just simulation. Are you interested in examining the effect of an alternative therapy as compared to standard of care ?
