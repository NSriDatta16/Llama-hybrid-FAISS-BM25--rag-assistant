Types of maps in Interpretable Machine Learning

I have worked on Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) for over 1 year. However, there are some terminologies that always make me confused. For example, saliency maps/heat maps. Are they same? Are activation maps visualizations of activation values of a unit(s) in Neural networks? Do you know any other types of maps? Thank you.
