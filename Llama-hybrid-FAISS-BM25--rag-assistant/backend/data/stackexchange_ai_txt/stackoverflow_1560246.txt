Java with database storage

I have to write a program that can take bookings, store them and then access them at a later time, the application has to be written in Java. Because of this i have been looking into various ways to use a database with Java. I have been looking into using the JDBC with the mySQL driver database and also looking into the javaDB. What would you recommend that i do to create this program, Has anyone have any experience of writing a program that uses a DB in java and could give me any tips? Thanks!
