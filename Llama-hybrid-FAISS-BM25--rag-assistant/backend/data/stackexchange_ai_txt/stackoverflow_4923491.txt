Try overriding pointInside:withEvent: in the bigUIView class to return NO if the point is inside the frame rectangle of one of the other subviews of the background view. Since it's a sibling of these other views, the hit testing mechanism will continue testing the other subviews and find the one corresponding to the point the user touched. Alos, consider implementing the event phase methods ( -touchesBegan:withEvent: , etc.) in your UIViewController subclass rather than in the bigUIView class. iOS inserts view controllers behind their views in the responder chain, so event messages will bubble up to the view controller unless one of the other subviews (for example, a button) intercepts it. The view controller can then send whatever messages you like to any of its views.
