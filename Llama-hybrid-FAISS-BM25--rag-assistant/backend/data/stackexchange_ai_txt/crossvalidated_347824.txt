Is it possible that ridge logistic regression will also reduce coefficients to exactly zero?

I have 105 predictors which contain dummy, numerical, and nominal variables. The output variable is dichotomous. I ran ridge logistic regression in R, using the following syntax: glmnet(x, y, alpha=0, family="binomial") After this I plotted the model. It shows that the variables are not all included in the model. Instead of 105, now there are only 72 variables (including the intercept). But why are the coefficients going to zero? I need some literature to prove it. Any literature that explains that ridge will also reduce coefficients exactly to zero will be helpful.
