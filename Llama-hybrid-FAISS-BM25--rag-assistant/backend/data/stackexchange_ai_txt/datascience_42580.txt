A few issues with the code above: Misspelling of variable name in line 1 - linerar_search instead of linear_search None is the reserved keyword in python, not none . Trying to return none would throw a NameError: name 'none' is not defined The indent for function verify is off but it shouldn't cause errors. The code below runs for me: def linear_search(list, target): """ Returns the index position of the target if found, else returns None""" for i in range(0, len(list)): if list[i] == target: return i return None def verify(index): if index is not None: print("Target found at index: ", index) else: print("Target not found in list") numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] result = linear_search(numbers, 12) verify(result) Hope this helps! :) P.S: This seems more so like a python problem then data science. Perhaps you could have posted this question in Stackoverflow instead.
