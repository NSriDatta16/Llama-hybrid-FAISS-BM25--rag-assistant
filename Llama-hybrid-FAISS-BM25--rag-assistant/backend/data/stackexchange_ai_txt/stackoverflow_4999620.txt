Resampling of two data sets of different length in MATLAB

I have two vectors: sensorA of length 927 and sensorB of length 1250. I would like to make them of the same length. The resample() function in MATLAB is very noisy at the edges and I need atleast reasonably good accuracy throughout. I understand that resampling can be done by interpolation, but how do I implement it in the most efficient way. I need to stretch 927 to 1250 as uniformly as possible. I was wondering if I could do something like this: I need 333 new samples in the shorter vector. So for every 3 values, I insert the average (midpoint) of two consecutive values in between then. => 309 samples inserted For the remaining I insert again for every 38 samples (927/(333-309)) Does this make sense? I still won't be able to get an exact interpolation. Is there any other function that I could use? (besides interp() because it requires an integral resampling rate?)
