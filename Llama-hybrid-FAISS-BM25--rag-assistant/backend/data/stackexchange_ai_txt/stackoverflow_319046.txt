Depends on the Function as well, if your function requires heavy user intervention or variables, I wouldn't go past 7-8 range. As far as average number of parameters to go with, 5-6 is the sweet spot in my opinion. If you are using more than that you might want to consider class objects as parameters or other smaller functions.
