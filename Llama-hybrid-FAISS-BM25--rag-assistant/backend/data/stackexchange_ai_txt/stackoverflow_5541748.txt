Magento Content Block Question

Noob Question here. I have created and successfully added an additional Page Layout to the existing theme on a client's website. I then checked what was going on in the content area and found that a file, named grouped.phtml was being called. The Problem : I want to duplicate that file and call it (for example) grouped2.phtml and add it to my custom page layout, while keeping the first file (grouped.phtml) alone. How do I do this? Thank you ahead of time.
