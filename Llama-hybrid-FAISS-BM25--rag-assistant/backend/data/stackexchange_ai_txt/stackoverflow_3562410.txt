For the second question I'd do the same and use the jQuery range slider as Haim suggested. For the first question I assume you would want to extend this to shapes other than just a square. You might want the user to pick 7/8ths of a pizza or similar. jQuery selectables and resizables might work for a square problem, but would be very difficult to implement (and use) for a pizza (or similar). I would use the html tag ( see here at W3schools ) and bind a javacsript command to when each area within the map is clicked. For example if you created a map interactively with http://www.carlosag.net/Tools/XMap/ (or similar) then bind each area to something like: where var pizza = new Array(); Array.prototype.sum = function() { return (! this.length) ? 0 : this.slice(1).sum() + ((typeof this[0] == 'number') ? this[0] : 0); }; // borrowed from http://www.gscottolson.com/weblog/2007/12/09/sum-array-prototype-for-javascript/ when the form is submitted you would just send pizza.sum() ! Granted this can be written a bit more elegantly into a function which would include highlighting the selected areas, but :-)
