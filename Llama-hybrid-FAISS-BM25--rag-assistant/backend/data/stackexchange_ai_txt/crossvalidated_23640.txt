SVM rbf kernel - heuristic method for estimating gamma

I read on this exchange a heuristic method of estimating gamma for the rbf kernel in SVMs. I was wondering if someone might be able to explain it to me in a little more detail? I believe you select 1000 (or a large number) of pairs of datapoints from the dataset then calculate the norm for the difference of each pair. Apparently, the inverse of the .1, .9 quantiles and median are good candidates for a suitable gamma for the rbf kernel. Thanks
