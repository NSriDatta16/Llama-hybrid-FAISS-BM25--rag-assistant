Workflow system

I've just started at a new communications company, and we're looking at a workflow / intranet system to manage jobs and processes. Basically, we receive data files from clients which we then process through our systems. Receive data file (FTP, Email, etc) Process data file (either generic script with data mapping to the file, or bespoke ETL package). Adds address values Create printstream (send processed data file into a postscript / PDF composition engine), or create email output Send output to production floor (copy to printer input stream, mailing machines) Process other streams (e.g. send emails / faxes, upload to e-Archive) Update internal systems (e.g. warehouse stock, invoicing) We also have a lot of other internal business processes (e.g. reprocessing damaged output, processing dead/returned mail). I'm trying to keep all elements separated. Some will be off the shelf (e.g. printstream composition, email sending / management, CRM). Some will be built in house (e.g. reprocess damaged output). But, I'm looking for something to tie it all together, and put the business workflow processes in. E.g. scheduling jobs, kicking off data processing tasks in sequence and managing errors. A lot of this will have human steps. Also, put in SLA management and business activity monitoring / reporting. One key requirement soon is for automated file receipt and processing (i.e. directory watching and matching to client / application). I'm keen for something that's easy to manage and maintain (e.g. adding in new steps to a workflow, or conditional logic, or whatever). I realise this is a big job, and at the moment we're focusing on each individual component and putting manual processes in place until we get a system to manage it. We don't want to design a gargantuan bespoke system to tie it all in, but would rather look at buying some kind of workflow or integration system. Any suggestions? I've had a look at Biztalk, but not sure if it's overkill or not suited for internal-only systems. Another product I've been exposed to is Sagent Automation, but it looks a little pokey. -- EDIT -- Forgot to mention, our existing skillset is largely Microsoft. So anything in Microsoft technologies / .Net based would be preferable. But if there's a fantastic product, we're not adverse to upskilling
