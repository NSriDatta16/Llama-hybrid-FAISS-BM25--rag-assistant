Assuming I have that $Y_i\mid \mu$ is an iid ~ $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ , for $i \in (1,\dotsc,n)$ with $\sigma_i$ known and improper prior $\pi(\mu)=1$ for all $\mu$ . i. How can I derive a formula for the MAP of $\mu$ . ii. Given that, $n=3$ , $Y_1=12$ , $Y_2=10$ , $Y_3=22$ , $\sigma_1= \sigma_2=3$ and $\sigma_3=10$ . Compute the MAP estimate of $\mu$ . I know I will have to take the log of the Normal distribution + log of the prior, differentiate and set to zero. However the questions says prior is improper and 1. Do I only therefore do the log of the likelihood because log of 1 is zero? I don't know how to go by ii, if I cant figure I out.
