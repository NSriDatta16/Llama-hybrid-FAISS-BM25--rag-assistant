NSNotificationCenter related crash on iOS 3.2

Our app works fine on iOS 4.2 and 4.3. However, on iOS 3.2 it crashes at this line [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"notificnname" object:nil]; The function postNotificationName is available since iOS 2.0. I am building my app with iOS 4.3 and the target sdk is set as 3.2. Any ideas what could be causing the crash. Thanks.
