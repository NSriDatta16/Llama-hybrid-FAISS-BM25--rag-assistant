Generally match prediction (across sports) relies strongly on feature engineering. There are 3 types of features being used: Basic features , e.g. team names, type of tournament, current team rank, odds incl. implied probabilities Lag features , e.g. previous winner of this matchup, win rates per team, days since last match per team Complex features , e.g. ELO scores, PI ratings, running scores Which features are most important is specific to the type of sports, e.g. in football "days since last match" is quite important but less so in esports. The 3rd group has usually the highest predictive value and is crucial (besides odds by professional bet providers). Moreover, text-based features, e.g. based on social media, can have strong predictive power too. Model-wise gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks are among the most successful models for match prediction. I recommend reading some of the relevant papers, e.g. for cricket specifically: Increased Prediction Accuracy in the Game of Cricket using Machine Learning The Cricket Winner Prediction With Application Of Machine Learning And Data Analytics Predicting The Cricket Match Outcome Using Crowd Opinions On Social Networks: A Comparative Study Of Machine Learning Methods
