You are correct that this program has entirely well-defined behavior as long as the arguments when you make the call are of the number and types matching those in the definition of the function that gets called. See 6.5.2.2 paragraph 6. My related question may also be of interest: Is this dubious use of a non-prototype function declaration valid?
