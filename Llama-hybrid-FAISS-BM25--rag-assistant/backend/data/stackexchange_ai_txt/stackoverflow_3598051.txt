qt - creator - how to maximize the widget screen

I am tryimng to make a UI. But in qt, the window size is too short, I want to work in a separate windows like photoshop. Here I am posting the picture. I want to see the middle window(i rounded it by rose color) in full screen size. Can anybody help me? EDIT: If I want to create a full screen application, How can I position the widgets in it. It's possible dragging a widget inside a scroll bared window,but is not user friendly. I want it to work like photoshop, like separate windows.
