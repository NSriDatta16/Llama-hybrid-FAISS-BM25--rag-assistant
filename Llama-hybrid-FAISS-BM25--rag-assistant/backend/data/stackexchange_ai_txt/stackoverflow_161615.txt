Use threadlocals if you want to get current user that edits this model. Threadlocals middleware puts current user into process-wide variable. Take this middleware from threading import local _thread_locals = local() def get_current_user(): return getattr(getattr(_thread_locals, 'user', None),'id',None) class ThreadLocals(object): """Middleware that gets various objects from the request object and saves them in thread local storage.""" def process_request(self, request): _thread_locals.user = getattr(request, 'user', None) Check the documentation on how to use middleware classes. Then anywhere in code you can call user = threadlocals.get_current_user
