You need to retrain your model every time you want to generate a new prediction: For most ML models, you train a model, test it, retrain it if necessary until you’ve gotten satisfactory results, and then evaluate it on a hold out data set. After you’re satisfied with the model’s performance, you then deploy it to production. Once in production, you score new data as it comes in. Eventually after a few months, you might want to update your model if a significant amount of new training data comes in. Model training is a one time activity, or done at most at periodic intervals to maintain the model’s performance to take int account new information. For instance, the visual properties of cats are stable over time. We don’t expect cats to look different next week, or next year, or even ten years from now. Given enough data, the model we trained this week is good enough for the foreseeable future as well. For time series models, this is not the case. Instead we have to retrain our model every time we want to generate a new forecast. To understand why this happens consider this...trends, and related seasonal variations, change over time!!
