You are POSTing the wrong data because you're taking the HTML to specify the widget and conflating it with the data it actually sends. The corrected data would be to just send the widget name and its value: term: 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6 Instead, the data that is getting POSTed currently is: maxlength: 2048 name: term size: 55 title: md5 hash to crack value: 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6 name: crackbtn type: submit value: Crack that hash baby! Corrected program: use strict; use warnings; use LWP::UserAgent; use HTTP::Request::Common qw{ POST }; use CGI; my $md5 = '098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6'; my $url = 'http://www.md5crack.com/crackmd5.php'; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(); my $request = POST( $url, [ 'term' => $md5 ] ); my $content = $ua->request($request)->as_string(); my $cgi = CGI->new(); print $cgi->header(), $content; You can also use LWP::UserAgent 's post() method: use strict; use warnings; use LWP::UserAgent; use CGI; my $md5 = '098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6'; my $url = 'http://www.md5crack.com/crackmd5.php'; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(); my $response = $ua->post( $url, { 'term' => $md5 } ); my $content = $response->decoded_content(); my $cgi = CGI->new(); print $cgi->header(), $content; Always remember to use strict and use warnings . It is considered good practice and will save your time.
