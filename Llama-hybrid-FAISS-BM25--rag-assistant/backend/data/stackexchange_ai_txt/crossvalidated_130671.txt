is it as simple as running a one-tail t-test to compare the means of the predicted time series vs. the actual time series The big problem is that with time series you don't have independence (after all, that's why you have an ARIMA model!), which the t-test definitely relies on; in general the forecasts would also be expected to be correlated (cross-correlated at lag 0) with the actual. Welch's t-test if there is a big difference in variance between the two series? No; the data would have to be regarded as paired, so you'd be doing a one-sample test on the pairwise differences, but you still need to account for serial dependence since it would impact the type I error rate.
