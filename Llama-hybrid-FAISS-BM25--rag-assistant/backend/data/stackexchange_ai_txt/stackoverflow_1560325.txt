The "wheel" you're talking about isn't round. It's as lumpy and pointy and oddly shaped as your business requirements are. If your business requirements are the same as those of other Magento and Sugar CRM users, and will be for the next five years, then they may be great products for you. Then you just need to figure out how to fire your friend, who will not be the best person to maintain those applications. Or you may need heavy customization, need or anticipate special features not already found in those applications, or want to continue working with your friend. If so, then perhaps you should defer to to your expert friend on technical, programming related decisions, while he leaves sales and financing decisions up to you.
