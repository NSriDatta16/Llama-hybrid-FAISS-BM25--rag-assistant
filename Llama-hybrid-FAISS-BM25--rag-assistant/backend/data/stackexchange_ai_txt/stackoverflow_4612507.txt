Uploading a large file(2GB Max) On Windows Azure Webrole Using SWFUploader

I have an application, in that I want to upload a large file max up to 2GB, and after processing this file I want to store it as blob on blobstorage. I am using SWFUploader to upload the files (I want to show progress bar, which is must). The problem is, I am unable to upload a file more than 100 MB. After uploading a file up to 100 MB (or sometimes 90-95 MB) it restarts the whole uploading process and sometimes it just fails. I am using a Webrole project, for this entire task. So my question is: Can I upload such large file on windows azure webrole project (basically its Asp.net website, so i want to upload a file on webserver) and process it over there and then upload it to blobstorage? According to my knowledge I did following things: 1: I have set following parameters in web.config 2: I have changed default TMP/TEMP folder of ASP.Net(which is 100 MB by default) to new folder that i have created in local storage resuorces by using follwiing code snippet I have created this "CustomTempLocalStore" as then set this local storage resources to use as TMP/TEMP by setting following code in onstart() menthod of webrole. string customTempLocalResourcePath = RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource("CustomTempLocalStore").RootPath; Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TMP", customTempLocalResourcePath); Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TEMP", customTempLocalResourcePath); I found this on follwing link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd573354.aspx Still its not working, the SWFUploader is giving follwing error: Server(IO)Error Any ideas?
