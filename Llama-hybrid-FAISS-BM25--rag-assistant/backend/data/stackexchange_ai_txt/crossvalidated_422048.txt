Neural Network regression on time series

I want to predict the trend values of a time serie [Y] based on the effect of other 10 input variables which can also have interaction. Since the combination of interaction between the inputs is unknown, I am applying a regression Neural Network to automatically detect and take that into account. The process I follow is: 1. Get raw data of [Y] time serie per day 2. Perform decomposition and extract the [Y] Trend element per day 3. Merge observations of the [Y] Trend with the observations of the 10 variables by day into a common table 4 Group the observations by unique combination of x[10] variables and average [Y] observations by "group_by" combination 5. Normalize (min-max) all variables between 0 and 1 6. Fit a NN model with: Trend as 1 output node The 10 variables as the input nodes 1 hidden layer logistic activation function 7. Perform k-fold cross-validation to estimate MAPE error Am I following a logic approach or is it anything important that I'm missing?
