Does an average web host support the Ruby language and everything that Rails needs? No. Many hosts have still to come on board with this. If you're looking for cheap shared hosting, I'd suggest http://railsplayground.com/ Does a normal Rails app using MySQL or does it handle data differently? Rails is database agnostic. You can connect to SQLITE, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and more. And is it as "easy" to get an app up and running, as PHP? Subjective. I'd say no. If you're looking for painless rails deployment with Apache or nginx I'd have to suggest using Phusion Passenger aka modrails.
