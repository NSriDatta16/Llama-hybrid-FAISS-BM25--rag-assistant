What @Chaconne mentioned in the comments is quite important. You should first shuffle your training set and then split the array into chunks. But I rewrote your code to the Javascript neural network library Neataptic , and i'm not having any issues. This is the code I wrote: // Create the network var network = new Architect.Perceptron(1,2,1); // Create training set var set = []; for(var i = 1; i Run the code yourself here (open console)! I'm getting these kind of results somewhat consistently: training error: 0.00008 test error: 0.00133 So dropout would fix the large gap, but my point is, something else must be wrong in your model . Consistently getting 0.48 as prediction seems like the network has never learned anything. What is your training error? What is your test error? How long are you training for (iterations).
