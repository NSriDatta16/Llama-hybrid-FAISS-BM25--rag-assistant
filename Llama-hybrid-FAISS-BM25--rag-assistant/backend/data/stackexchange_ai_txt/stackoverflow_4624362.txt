Firstly, don't store passwords! EVER! From the other question you just asked , you know how to get the data from the XML. If you need to persist data across multiple executions of an app then you should save this to IsolatedStorage. For your specific scenario I'd recommend using IsolatedStorageSettings . var settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; settings.Add("id", myid); then access it via if (settings.Contains("id")) { string stored_value = settings.["id"].ToString(); }
