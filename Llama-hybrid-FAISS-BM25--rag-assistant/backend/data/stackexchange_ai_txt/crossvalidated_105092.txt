Sounds like you are working with patient level raw data. Without knowing much detail about your data, I would structure the problem like this (assuming you have at least several years of data): 1) Define the target variable as something at a higher level (higher level than patient-level), such as unique patients for a given day (one level up might be patients for a given week). 2) Aggregate all your candidate predictors up to the same level as the target you are predicting. So if your target is daily patients, you could create candidate model features like "insurance type A %", "insurance type B %", "diagnosis code 1 %", "diagnosis code 2%", "% male", "% age 3) Perform some feature selection type exploration (scatter plots, histograms, box plots, correlations, trees, pca, etc.) and reduce predictors down to a manageable number. 4) Run some algorithms. I'm guessing for this particular problem, a simple stepwise regression would tell you enough if all you're interested in is descriptive analytics (as opposed to a more robust predictive model, which would require performing some train/test/validate tasks in addition).
