Classifying mouse gesture patterns based on time series of mouse coordinates

Hint: I am a programmer, but not a machine-learning guy, so be patient with me ;) I am currently working on a side project for finding patterns in mouse movement data. Example of patterns I am interested in are the following: Source: https://www.slideshare.net/silvanachurruca/mouse-tracking-technique-and-mouse-patterns I read a lot in past time about (un)supervised learning (I know the difference), Hidden Markov Models, LSTM networks etc. I also found some working "examples", but most of them are way to theoretical and often related to find patterns in images etc. Can some give me a hint or a (easy understandable) working example (language is not important) on finding and classifying patterns in time series data of mouse coordinates?
