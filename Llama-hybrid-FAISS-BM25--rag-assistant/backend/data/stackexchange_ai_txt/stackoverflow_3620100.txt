Access Database Alternatives

Ok before I explain... I know Access should basically not be used anymore. My application now uses access for its portability.. its an internal application and makes private/internal database storage a snap. Problem is, it uses JET 4.0 which is not supported in 64 bit operating systems and is frankly not very well implemented anymore. I am developing using C# .NET visual studio 2008. I am looking for a way to do this with some other database type that would not require me to install anything else on a users computer. I looked into sqlite but there's no easy way to implement it in visual studio An Ideas?
