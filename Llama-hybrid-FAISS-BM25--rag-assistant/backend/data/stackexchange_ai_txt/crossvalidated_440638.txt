You have performed MCMC in order to generate a sample from the posterior distribution $$\pi(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3 \lvert y)$$ Because it is a random sample $\{ (\theta_{i1},\theta_{i2},\theta_{i3})\}_{i=1}^n $ anything that holds for random samples apply. This means that Law of Large Numbers will apply such that a consistent estimator of $\mathbb E[\theta_j ]$ is the average $(1/n) \sum_i \theta_{ij}$ . The CLT can be used to justify asymptotic distribution and make tests if you should desire. And you can approximate integrals, for example $\mathbb E[h(\theta_2)]$ can be approximated $$\mathbb E[h(\theta_2)] = \int_{\theta_1} \int_{\theta_2}\int_{\theta_3} h(\theta_2) \pi(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3 \lvert y)\approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_i h(\theta_{i2})$$ which is just Law of Large Numbers again. When does CLT apply to MCMC? See this question CLT and MCMC .
