The split in training, including all optimization of models might be helpful and it is worth to use best practices in general supervised machine learning. On the other hand, the ultimate measure of quality in Reinforcement Learning is the discounted reward. To quantify the quality, you shall run several episodes after all your learning, tuning, and optimization - to see the ultimate quality of the solution. The fact is that even a model that is not very accurate in terms of MSE, MAPE, etc. can pretty well distinguish good and bad actions. Consider that you add a constant to true Q functions. They will be bad in terms of MSE, MAPE, etc., but they will be still able to decide optimally.
