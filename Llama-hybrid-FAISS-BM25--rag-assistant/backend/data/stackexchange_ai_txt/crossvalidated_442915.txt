You could adopt a Bayesian approach where you can specify the random effects to follow whatever distribution you want, provided it is supported by the software you use. WinBUGS, JAGS and Stan should all be able to do this, with multivariate responses. You could use the native software itself, or call it from within, for example, R or Python.
