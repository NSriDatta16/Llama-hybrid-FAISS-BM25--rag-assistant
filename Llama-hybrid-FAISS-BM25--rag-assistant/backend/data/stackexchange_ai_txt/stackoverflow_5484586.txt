I'd probably do this using a RewriteRule. Is this a one-off, or is it a general pattern that could be applied to other URLs? e.g. would you also want index.php?_escaped_fragment_=blah to redirect to snapshots/snap_blah.html ? If not, something like this: RewriteRule index\.php\?_escaped_fragment_=about snapshots/snap_about.html [NC,R=301] If yes, something like: RewriteRule index\.php\?_escaped_fragment_=(.*) snapshots/snap_$1.html [NC,R=301]
