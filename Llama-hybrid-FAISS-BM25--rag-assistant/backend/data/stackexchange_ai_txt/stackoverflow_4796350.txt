using a to run a function()

I was wondering will this link call the function I want? Some Text and this is the function I want to call... Can anyone tell me why it is not working also? $(function caShip(){ $('#caShip').replaceWith('Some HTML (the new HTML has an id of replaced)'); }); When the link is clicked it does go to the href, which is the same page and an ID, but it doesn't replace the with the new HTML, which is a ? UPDATE: THIS IS THE WORKING CODE: js $(document).ready(function(){ //Hide Canadian Information $('.locationDiv').hide(); //bind the links click events $('.locLink').click(function(){ $('#1').hide(); $('#desc_' + $(this).attr('title')).show(); }); }); HTML Canadian Customers Click Here Before Ordering! Attention Canadian Customers! Please note that there are fees associated with shipping to Canada from the US that are NOT included in the cost of the shipping or the cost of the unit. These cost are to be paid for by the purchaser. Here are some tips for shipping to Canada: -USPS methods are cheap but very unreliable. Border fees are not charged using USPS, only UPS or Fed Ex (which are the most reliable). - Customs fees can sometime run up to 50% of the purchase price (UPS/FedEx). -Smart Strips are available from a Canadian dealer. Visit our Store Locator to find a local seller. -Customers with a UPS or FedEx account may ship on their account and assume all fees with no delays. -Canadian customers selecting UPS or FedEx will have to pick the package up at their local station and pay the fees. So you order it online, but still have to drive and pay to pick it up unless you used your own UPS/Fed Ex account. I didn't use the CSS because I can achieve what I need without it. Thanks to everyone that was trying to help me with this!!!.
