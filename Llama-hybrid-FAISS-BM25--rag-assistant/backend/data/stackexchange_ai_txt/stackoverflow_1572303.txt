Rake (Ruby) catch error at end of build

I'm using Ruby and Rake to do our builds at the moment for .Net projects. I call a few commandline tools, such as NCover to check the coverage is high enough. When NCover returns and exit (fail) code though, Rake exits immediately stops. Is there a hook, like on_exit, that I can use. I basically want to output "Build FAILED" in nice red writing, and if possible the step it failed on, and even better a message as to why. Just so it's a little clearer to the devs. There is something similar in NAnt, and it's quite handy. Wondering if Rake/Ruby had anything similar. Anyone had any experience with this sort of thing? Cheers.
