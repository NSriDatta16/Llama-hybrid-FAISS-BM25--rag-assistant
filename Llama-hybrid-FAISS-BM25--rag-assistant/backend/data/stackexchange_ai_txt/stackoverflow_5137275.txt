First of all, you should pass in the array to the function and return the result. public static double[] prefixAverages(double[] inArray) { double[] outArray = new double[inArray.length]; //...compute the averages... return outArray; } Then you can do some manual testing in you main method: public static void main(String... args) { System.out.println( Arrays.equals( prefixAverages(new double[] {1, 2, 3, 4}), new double[] {1, 1.5, 2, 2.5} ) ); } Make sure this code prints true . Now, that's not a very robust solution because of accuracy limitations with floating-point numbers, but it should get you started. If you want to really look into testing your code, you should research using a test harness like JUnit .
