This looks like a Bayesian Hierarchical Model waiting to happen. Fit an unknown parameter to each movie/product that links to the data through a multinomial or ordered logit, or possibly even just a simple normal. Then put a prior on the parameters and fit the model. Movies/products with a large number of ratings will have a parameter that is mainly determined by the data (pulled a little ways towards the mean by the prior). Movies/products with very few ratings will be highly influenced by the overall mean and a little by the corresponding ratings (how much depends on the hyper prior). So a product/movie with 2 ratings of 5 out of 5 will be pulled towards the mean (but still above one with 2 ratings that were 1 out of 5 or 3 out of 5). Sort on the mean (or median/mode, etc.) of the posteriors for the movie/product parameters and that should give you what you are looking for.
