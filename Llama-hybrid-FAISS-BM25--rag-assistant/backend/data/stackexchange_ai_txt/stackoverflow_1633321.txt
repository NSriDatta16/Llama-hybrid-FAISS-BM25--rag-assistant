Wowwwww! It's ok! All I can say is : If you'r using Infragistics webdialogwindow with IntialLocation set to "Centered". Put it at the top of your page (It's a "popup" anyway so it "over" your page content). Because my problem were that when the page having, says more that 32000px lenght(dunno the exact length) popup were unabled to locate correctly the window cuz it can't put it in a int32... wow. What a bug
