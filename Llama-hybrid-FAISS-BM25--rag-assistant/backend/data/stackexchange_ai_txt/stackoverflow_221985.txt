With Ganymede (3.4), the correct way to manage your plugins would be to drop them in the ' dropins ' folder: \[eclipse\]/dropins/eclemma1.3.1/eclipse/(plugins|features) That plugin will be detected by the 'p2' provisioning mechanism and used, but not copied in the plugins and features directories of eclipse . It stays in the dropins folder. When you will drop eclemma1.3.2, all you have to do is delete eclemma1.3.1 from your dropins directory, and that old version is gone.
