It seems to me that tree-based models are very bad at extrapolation, please look at this discussion https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/discussion/38352 . Some people also pointed out that XGBoost has some weak "potential" at extrapolation https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/1581 , but in general and in my personal applications, I do not see that "potential" really helps. Here is one way around using stacked model: https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard I am hitting the wall of xgboost myself and turn to use deep learning algorithms for cases requiring extrapolation.
