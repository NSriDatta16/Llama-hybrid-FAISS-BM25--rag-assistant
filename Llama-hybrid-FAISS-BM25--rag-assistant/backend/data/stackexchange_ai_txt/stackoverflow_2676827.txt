Will a brush be disposed if created in the call to a method

below is a fragment of code that is found in my paint method. I am not sure what it is called when I create an object such as the brush this manner, but never the less will it be disposed of properly, or do I need to be concerned about it? g.DrawString("12", _ContentFont, new SolidBrush(Color.Black), new PointF(25, 25));
