Embed a Windows Form in a web browser

I have a class which inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form. I need to make the form available via a Web browser. The form currently allows a graph to be generated given various parameters. So embedding it directly in a web page would be ideal for my needs. How would I go about doing this? Thanks.
