I myself am in the process of learning D, coming from a C / C++ background. D attracted to me because of its elegance, it's well thought through design. That feels like heaven after intensive, deep and dark C++ corners. For me, the one big disadvantage of D is the lack of libraries. Even the standard library I don't find very well done. The language is great, but the libraries not (yet). You can use C libs though, which is a big thumbs up. Although D seems to have many know-hows and many language aspects, it's not half of what C++ has. So I'd argue it's remarkably quicker to learn (definitely because 90% comes from C++ or related languages). So learning the language should be a matter of weeks / months. Since there aren't great tools for GUIs yet, you might want to develop the editor in something else. The other two projects are perfectly suited for D.
