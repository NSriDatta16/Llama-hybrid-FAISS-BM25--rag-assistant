Common sense and efficiency can replace all design patterns. EDIT: Seeing that commenters didn't get my point... What I was trying to say is that instead of memorizing all design patterns and thinking in these terms, you can simply reflect about the problem for a while and solve it in an efficient and elegant way, based in common sense and your experience. With good probability, what you will come up with will be one or more of those design patterns. But you don't need to know them in advance in order to use them. Anyway, I could never master memorizing the names of those 20+ patterns and holding mental associations of what each name was standing for.
