How to visualize/summarize a matrix with number of rows $\gg$ number of columns?

I have a matrix of positive real numbers between 0 and 1; the rows represent genes and columns represent samples. Number of rows is greater than the number of columns by a magnitude of $10^4$. I am wondering how to visualize this in R . I know heatmap is one of the ways to do this, but are there other ideas. Here are a few points which I want to emphasize in the visualization: Data: The rows and columns have no order to them (as you may have already realized); specifically rows and columns are exchangeable. The entries of the matrix are positive real numbers between 0 and 1. A small fraction of the data (10% of the rows or genes, around 1000) are actually "interesting". The matrix represents the estimated probability of genes being more active in a sample. Aim: I want show: which genes are more active and in which sample. The matrix has a lot of rows in which the probabilities are very similar across columns. I am ok with ordering the rows (genes) to make the pattern clearer. My thoughts: At the moment I can determine active genes in a sample by choosing a cutoff (say $\ge 95\%$) and arrange the genes in such a way that first set of rows are active genes in sample 1, second set of rows are active genes in sample 2, ... I was also thinking about visualizing a subset of the data, may be by sampling rows. But I did not have any success. I know these ideas may not be very elegant but rearranges my data in a way which makes the pattern more recognizable. I know similar questions have been asked before, but I thought my query was a bit more specific, so hopefully I can get better inputs from the members of this forum.
