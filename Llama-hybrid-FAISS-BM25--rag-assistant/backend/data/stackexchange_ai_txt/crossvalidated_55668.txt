If I understand you correctly you are assigning values to categories of your explanatory/independent/right-hand-side/x variable based on average values of your explained/dependent/left-hand-side/y variable. I suspect that the purpose of that excercise is to assign values to the categories of verx_s such that the linear effect of the resulting variable in your model is (close to) maximal. If that is the case then what you are looking for is a sheaf coefficient (Heise 1972). However, for one categorical or ordinal variable this just boils down to a different way of presenting your results when you added your variable to the model as a set of indicator (dummy) variables. If all you care about is out of sample predictions, then the easiest way to achieve your goal is to just add verx_s as a set of indicator variables. As Peter Flom already suggested, you could try and do some programming to impose monotonicity, but the resulting program will in all likelihood fail to converge or converge at unreasonable values when the pattern in the data is not monotonic.
