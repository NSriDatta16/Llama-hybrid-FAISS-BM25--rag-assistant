You can use them together. But you need to be consistent on your use of const because when C++ does name decoration, const is included in the type information that is used to decorate the symbol names. so extern const int i will refer to a different variable than extern int i Unless you use extern "C" {}. C name decoration doesn't pay attention to const.
