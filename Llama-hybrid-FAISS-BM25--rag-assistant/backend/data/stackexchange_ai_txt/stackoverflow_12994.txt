In a way, I like its elegance, but in another way, it seems to defeat the purpose of exposing your web service to potential third parties or partners or whatever. How would they know what to pass? Would they have to rely purely on documentation? It also loses some of the "heterogeneous client" aspect, since the serialization is very .Net specific. I don't mean to be critical, I'm just wondering if what you're proposing is also meant for these types of use cases. I don't see anything wrong with using it in a closed environment though. I should look into WCF... I've been avoiding it, but maybe it's time.
