sqlbulkcopy, i want to overwrite current rows in the database

In my program I am populating a datatable and then bulkcopying it into my database. However, I want it to overwrite a row in the database if 3 of the columns in the the row match. For example if I have 5 columns membernum dateregistered name address city state So if the membernum, dateregistered and name match I want to overwrite the row. with the data from the bulk insert. In my program the entire database table is not populated and I think its to big to load it. Using bcp As SqlBulkCopy = New SqlBulkCopy(SqlDataSource2.ConnectionString) bcp.DestinationTableName = "dbo.dashboardtasks" bcp.WriteToServer(table) If the best method is to create a datatable with my database table how would I compare the rows and then overwrite the tables where there are matches in the particular 3 columns. and then update the database with only the rows that have either changed or the new ones INSERT INTO [dashboardtasks] ([tour], [taskname], [deptdate], [tasktype], [desc], [duedate], [compdate], [comments], [agent], [compby], [graceperiod], [id])
