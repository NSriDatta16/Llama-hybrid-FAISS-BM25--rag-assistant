Best way to display web content on my iPhone app (if possible without using UIWebView)

I want to build an iPhone app that should , among other things, display the some content of a website's detail pages. This content includes a)a title b) an image c) a text passage (with multiple paragraphs. I have done a brief research and found out that the easiest way to do this is by using uiwebview. The problem is that in that scenario I would have to be constantly in touch with the person responsible for the website in order to create a modified html/css version for the iPhone client. As a result I was wondering if there is a feasible alternative. I can get the data I want in json format with HTML Requests. Maybe if I used a UIScrollView that contains a UILabel for the title, a UIImage for the image and another UILabel for the text passage? But the problem is how to set the UIscrollview content size since it dependent on the size of the text passage? I am a iPhone dev noob and I am possibly missing something obvious here so I would be very greatful if someone could point me in the right direction.
