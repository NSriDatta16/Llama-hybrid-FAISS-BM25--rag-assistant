Bayesian bandits with delayed rewards

I looked into the topic of bayesian bandits in order to create a simple testing tool for headline optimizations. UCB1 seemed easy enough until I discovered that there is probably a problem with the delayed rewards in the real life setup. I am in no way a mathematician. Maybe anyone could point me in the right direction on how to handle this? Thanks Valentin
