Merging 2d arrays

Suppose I have two arrays: arrayOne = [["james", 35], ["michael", 28], ["steven", 23], ["jack", 18], ["robert", 12]] arrayTwo = [["charles", 45], ["james", 36], ["trevor", 24], ["michael", 17], ["steven", 4]] I want to merge them, so that I would have a single 2D array, where the first element of each inner array is the name (james, charles, etc). The second element of the inner array is its respective value in arrayOne , and if does not have a respective value it would be 0. Conversely for the third element. The order does not really matter as long as the numbers match the name. In other words I would get something like this arrayResult = [["james", 35, 36], ["michael", 28, 17], ["steven", 23, 4], ["jack", 18, 0], ["robert", 12, 0], ["charles", 0, 45], ["trevor", 0, 4]] Also, I am trying to have it so that I could add more "columns" to this array result if I were to give another array.
