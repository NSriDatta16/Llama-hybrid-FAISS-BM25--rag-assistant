Integrating js in build process

I'm wondering what the best way to minify and concatenate all my js scripts in one in a build process is. I've got the actual minifying working, but now need to set a reference in my html page to the minified file. In the dev version it has references to five files which get concatenated. Should I juts xmlpoke or something like that? Are there more elegant techniques?
