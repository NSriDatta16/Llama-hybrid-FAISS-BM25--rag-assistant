Is delta method better than bootstrap to generate standard error for marginal effects?

I read here , here , here , here , and elsewhere that " Parametric bootstrap closely related to objective Bayes. (That’s why it’s a good importance sampling choice.) When it applies, parboot approach has both computational and interpretational advantages over MCMC/Gibbs. (...) (...) the use of parametric bootstrap sampling to carry out Bayesian inference calculations. (...) possible in a subset of those problems amenable to MCMC analysis, but when feasible the bootstrap approach offers both computational and theoretical advantages." On the other hand, the delta method is widely used to estimate standard error (SE) for marginal effects (ME) as in the example below taken from here : set.seed(12345) n $y x + + rlogis(n)) > 0) + 0 library(margins) fit.logit My questions are: 1) Are the SE from the delta method more "robust" than those that would be obtained via the parboot approach ? 2) If not, how would the parboot approach be implemented to estimate SE for ME in R? Any help would be much appreciated.
