You're not really sharing common objects - this is common data (and yes, wrapped by an object). Lets say you have a minimal UserInfo class and a corresponding template fragment that displays it. That fragment will be included in your views. But regardless of the framework (and how you add this common fragment to your views) the framework/template engine will need to find a 'userInfo' binding and get the required fields. Unless you are planning on hitting your (db) back-end on every page request to get that information, you will need to cache it. Typically this will be in the session.
