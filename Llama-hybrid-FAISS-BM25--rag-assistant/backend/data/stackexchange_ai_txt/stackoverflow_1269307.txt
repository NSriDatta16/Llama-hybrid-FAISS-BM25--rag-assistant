I believe you want one of the Oracle Analytic functions . You're in luck if you're using Oracle because other RDBMSs don't have this functionality. They let you write SQL that allows you to query data in relation to adjacent rows, such as calculating moving averages. I don't have an Oracle DB here to play with, but I think it would be something like this: SELECT MIN(ID) AS From_Id, MAX(ID) AS To_Id, Assigned_To FROM Ticket PARTITION BY Assigned_To ORDER BY From_Id
