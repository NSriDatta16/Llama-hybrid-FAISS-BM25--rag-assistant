Files on Windows and Contiguous Sectors

Is there a way to guarantee that a file on Windows (using the NTFS file system) will use contiguous sectors on the hard disk? In other words, the first chunk of the file will be stored in a certain sector, the second chunk of the file will be stored in the next sector, and so on. I should add that I want to be able to create this file programmatically, so I'd rather not just ask the user to defrag their harddrive after creating this file. If there is a way to programmatically defrag just the file that I create, then that would be OK too.
