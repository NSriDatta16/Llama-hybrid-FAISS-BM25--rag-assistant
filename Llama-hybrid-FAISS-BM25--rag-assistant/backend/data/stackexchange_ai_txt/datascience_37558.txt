Can anyone recommend some good books or articles on working with time series?

I've read a couple of guides such as this link. I'm having real trouble getting to grips with how to use time series data effectively. Anything to help with the intuition ideally with some case studies. I am currently reading Applied predictive modelling so anything with a similar pedagogy would be ideal.
