I think that you are missing two critical factors. If you try to make a model of gravity but do not take into account mass or inter-mass distance, then no model will work well. http://www.ted.com/talks/geoffrey_west_the_surprising_math_of_cities_and_corporations.html I just love standing on the shoulders of giants. As much as I wish I were a giant, I always see farther with their help. You need the company-specific variables that include "the current number of employees", "the cumulative sum of all employees over the life of the company", and "the age of the company". I would also include the "cumulative revenue of the company" and "the current gross revenue". Now I do not use SPSS. I do not speak its language. I do, however know a little about models. I would suggest use of a random forest to determine which of the variables in this collection inform GSR_Raw. Once you get an idea of which variables are worthless then you can remove them from your model, and simplify your analysis. After you have a reduced model and are sure the inputs inform your output, then you can start trying to fit models. Start with the basics. Don't leap into crazy stuff until you are sure that the basic models don't do a "good enough" job.
