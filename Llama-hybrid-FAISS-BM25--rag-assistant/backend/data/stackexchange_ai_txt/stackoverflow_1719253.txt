Where to start... use do{...}while(). You're not initializing your array of floats. You're not keeping track of how many grades have been input. You're also never updating the total variable in your for loop, so no matter what they enter, the displayed total will never change. You never even use the declared avg variable. Here's a tip: think about the algorithm first; i.e., HOW are you going to perform these operations? Can you separate any operations (such as calculating an average) from others (such as getting user input)? Once you've figured out your process you want to use, consider what types of data structures and program flow (looping) constructs will be appropriate, THEN start coding; it'll make a big difference, and it'll be easier to implement.
