I'm not sure if the problem is occurring because my SeekBar contains a large amount of possible values, and with screen size limited this forces the numbers to be smashed closer together? Pretty much this. One thing you could do is add a small plus and minus button beside the seekbar, which increment and decrement the value by 0.5. This way you could still use the seekbar for general cases, and refine your selection with the buttons if needed. Maybe not the most elegant solution, but it would certainly work.
