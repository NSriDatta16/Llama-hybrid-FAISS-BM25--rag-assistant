Sending emails should be part of the business layer. I came across the same issue few weeks ago ,,, I am building a web application using asp.net mvc 3 that consists of three projects : Repository (DAL), Services (BLL) , Presentation (Web) My application logic is implemented at the service layer so I was searching for the best way to implement a completely independent module at the service layer for sending HTML emails to the users so that that my service layer functions can use it directly without having to bring it up to the presentation layer. After some searching I found an elegant solution that was done by Kazi Manzur where he created an email subsystem that makes use of Razor Views to send HTML/Text emails outside of the web proejct. Use Razor for Email Template outside ASP.NET MVC I have been using his subsystem since then and it has been doing a great job.
