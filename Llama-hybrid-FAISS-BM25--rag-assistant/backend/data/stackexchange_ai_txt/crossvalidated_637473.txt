By analyzing your contingency tables separately, the risk is to find spurious relationships ( correlation does not imply causation ), in particular if the actions you mention are related between them (e.g. are users who take action A also likely to take action B?). You might end up requiring users to take some actions when there is no need to. Other methods like logistic regression could be more adequate to analyze your data. (I don't know what other users think about it, but you could ask another question about what kind of methods would be appropriate in your scenario; it will require you to give more details about your data and use case.) But let's imagine for a second that confounding is not a problem for analyzing the contingency tables you have, and let's consider Cramér's V. You want to find actions that are beneficial, which I interpret as you wanting to identify actions that are likely to increase sales if you incite users to complete them. A pitfall here is that Cramér's V won't tell you anything about the directionality of the effect. In your case, a given Cramér's V can be indistinctly associated with larger or smaller sales compared to other tables. Consider the three following contingency tables, describing the behavior of potential customers (you don't mention what your data look like, so I'm guessing here): Table 1 don't buy buy take action A 1900 100 don't take action A 1500 500 Table 2 don't buy buy take action B 100 1900 don't take action B 500 1500 Table 3 don't buy buy take action C 1000 1000 don't take action C 900 1100 The two first tables mirror each other, so they have the exact same Cramér's V (0.28), however their number of sales is completely different. In addition, if you compare the first table to the third one, you see that sales in table 3 are higher both in absolute values and row-wise proportions, despite having a smaller Cramér's V (0.05). So Cramér's V won't tell you if taking an action is related to an increase or a decrease in sales, if you compare it to other contingency tables. In the case of 2x2 tables, looking at the odds ratio would certainly be more informative.
