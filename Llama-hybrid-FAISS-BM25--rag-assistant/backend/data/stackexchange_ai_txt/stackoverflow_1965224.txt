Floats don't affect the flow. What I tend to do is add a possibly some content at the end of the 'wrapping div' (in this case content). I can justify this on a semantic basis by saying that such a paragraph might be needed. Another approach is to use a clearfix CSS: #content:after { content: "."; display: block; height: 0; clear: both; visibility: hidden; } #content { display: inline-block; } /* \*/ * html #content { height: 1%; } #content { display: block; } /* */ The trickery with the comments is for cross-browser compatibility.
