What is the scope of yacc/bison actions?

I'm attempting to write a (relatively) simple config file parser in flex / bison . The basic idea is that my bison grammar uses some C functions to organize the parsed data into a series of C structs. I'd be happy to post my code if anyone thinks it is necessary to answer the question, just comment. The issue I'm running into involves the scope of procedures within bison actions. For example, if I have something like: set : NTOK name { section *sec init_s(sec, $2); add_s(cf, sec); } Shouldn't sec be available in a later rule of the grammar for use? I'm getting error: 'sec' undeclared when I try to call it as an argument again later on. Can anyone enlighten me?
