How to do cross validation in Random Forest if the objective is to measure variable importance?

As you know, the random forest algorithm and k-fold cross validation (except the case of Leave One Out) involve randomness. Thus a typical 10-fold CV in one run results in a certain variable importance values and a different run (with a different seed value, thus different splits in data) will result in different variable importance values. Now should I go with LOO CV or maybe multiple runs of 10-fold CV and try to average variable importance values in each run to address this issue? Any other suggestions? P.S. 1: I've already explained my purpose of measuring variable importance in: Computing variable importance based on decrease in performance when excluding each variable , in the comments section. P.S. 2: I understand that variable importance is algorithm dependent. But my idea here is to avoid making it seed-value dependent. I think the former is acceptable, but the latter is not.
