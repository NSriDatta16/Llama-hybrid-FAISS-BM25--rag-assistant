The short answer is no. The description text is intended to be a quick description of the contents of the dictionary, usually for debugging purposes. It might be possible (but not recommended) to parse the output string and use it to populate a new dictionary, but there are many cases where this would not work. If, for example, your original dictionary contained any custom data types, the description output would appear something like: { "key 1" = ; "key 2" = ; } Which is, of course, not reversible. From Apple's developer documentation for the description method in NSDictionary : If each key in the receiver is an NSString object, the entries are listed in ascending order by key, otherwise the order in which the entries are listed is undefined. This method is intended to produce readable output for debugging purposes, not for serializing data. If you want to store dictionary data for later retrieval, see Property List Programming Guide and Archives and Serializations Programming Guide for Cocoa .
