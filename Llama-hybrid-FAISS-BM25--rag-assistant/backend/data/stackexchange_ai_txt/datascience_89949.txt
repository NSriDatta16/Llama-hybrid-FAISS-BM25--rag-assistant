Since you have a regression problem, you can use many possible evaluation metrics. Other regression evaluation metrics include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute value (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). However, it sounds like the issue is variance across different target values. If you switch to Bayesian Regression, it will better model variance and uncertainty across the range of target values.
