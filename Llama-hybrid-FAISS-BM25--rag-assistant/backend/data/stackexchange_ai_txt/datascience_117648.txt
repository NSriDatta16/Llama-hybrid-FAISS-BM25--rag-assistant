You are correct in your reasoning (though I dont' know if I'd call it a "collapse")- the "collapse" to the prior is the ideal intent of a VAE. As a VAE is a type of autoencoder, it's purpose is to learn a latent encoding space $Z$ from which you could, in principle, "draw" random points. An example is a VAE trained to generate images of faces, where each point $z \in Z$ represents a particular face. The encoder in a VAE is a way to transform points into that space, and the decoder is a way to transform them out of it. In practice, however, we run into issues with data distributions, we may have data in one part of the latent space over-represented in some places, and under-represented in others. The "variational" part of VAEs adds regularization with this. Instead of encoding a single point in the latent space, it encodes a distribution over points. This helps mitigate this problem. So rather than going from $$x \rightarrow z \in \mathbb{R}^d$$ a VAE encoder goes from $$x \rightarrow z\sim\mathcal{N}( \mu_x, \sigma_x)$$ What this means is that every point $z\in Z$ should be drawn from the prior distribution, $p(z)$ . The encoder, $e(x)$ is just a means to find that spot $z$ in the encoding space (or, more specifically, it's distribution parameters). The distribution $q(\cdot | x)$ is just an approximation of the distribution $P(z)$ that uses the datapoint $x$ to generate the distribution parameters.
