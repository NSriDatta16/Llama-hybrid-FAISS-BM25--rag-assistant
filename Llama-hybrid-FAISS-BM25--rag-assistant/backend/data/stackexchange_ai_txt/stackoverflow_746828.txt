How to find rows n the dataset (with no primary key)

I using the Ultrawebgrid- Update event:: protected void UltraWebGrid1_UpdateRow(object sender, RowEventArgs e) so, I want to update the row(updated in the grid) in the datatable (inside a dataset) The datatable doesn't hav any primary key too.. How can i find any row in such datatable? for e.g. i can go for UltraGridRow oldrow = (UltraGridRow) e.Data; now, how can i find the row (in the datatable inside a dataset) which is same as the oldrow so that i can update it in the dataset? The datatable does not have any primary key
