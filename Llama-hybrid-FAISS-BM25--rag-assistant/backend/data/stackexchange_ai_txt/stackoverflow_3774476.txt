Approximating z = y^2 + x^2 with Neural Network

How quickly is a neural network expected to approximate the z = y^2 + x^2 function? Mine seems to struggle when I make the inputs negative as well and all the weights become really small ( *10^-16! if use 2x40x1) or all become of same number (like -0.16 and 0.16 if use 2x20x1). I am using 2000 input examples per epoch. However it seems to learn ok if all inputs are positive. What could this mean? What number of input pairs per epoch, architecture, and number of epochs should I use to solve this do you think? I am using backprop, neural network without bias with 1 hidden layer (and my inputs are all between -1 and +1 and desired outputs [0, 1]). Thank you,
