How to store a list of items on a single column in SQL Server 2008

I am looking for an efficient way to store users' information in a SQL Server 2008 table. In the design all users data will be stored in a series of columns in a single table but one of the columns requires to store a list of values, for example: 'column1' will store the username , 'column2' will store the userID and 'column3' will store a list of items that will change over time. I want to avoid putting this information on a different table for each user because that would require a lot of tables in the database. What data type should I use for this 'column3' ? Should I use a completely different approach? I see that on SQL Server we can use the table data type , but this seems to work only for temporary storage. Thank you.
