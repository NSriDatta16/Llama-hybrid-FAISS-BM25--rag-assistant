Understanding the example of RNN package in R

In the RNN package in R , there is an example to use RNN to train summation of two numbers. I tried to look up in Google, but did not find a good resource to explain how can we use RNN to train this kind of task. Could you give me some references for this task. The input of the task is: X1 X2 Y (with Y = X1 + X2 ) You give X1 , X2 and Y to RNN, and it can learn how to predict Y .
