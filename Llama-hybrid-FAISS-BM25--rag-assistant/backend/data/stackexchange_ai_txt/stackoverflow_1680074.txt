Do you want to use Interface Builder or do it in code only? With IB operation is very straightforward, you only need to drag segmented control to place on navigation bar where title is located. Title will be replaced by the segmented control. If you want to accomplish this in code, please refer to this section of iPhone reference library . It seems you need to set navigation item's titleView property to your segmented control, which is subclass of UIView, so this is completely legal.
