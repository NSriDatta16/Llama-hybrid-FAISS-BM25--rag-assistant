Possible to register Selenium RC's with the Hudson Selenium Grid Hub w/o the RC's being slaves in the Hudson cluster?

I am trying to get Hudson to run my ruby based selenium tests. I have installed the Selenium Grid plugin, but I don't want to have the RC's running as slaves in a Hudson cluster. The reason for this is I don't want to waste the next six years of my life trying to configure each of my projects in various Windows environments. Hudson currently pulls each project from Github and builds it just fine. With a regular Selenium Grid setup, I am able to edit the grid_configuration.yml file to represent the various environments I wish to tests against, then pass environment variables to the rake task that runs the test i.e. which browser/platfom to run on and the URL of the application under test -- usually a port on the hub machine running in a specific environment. In this way, the machines on which the RC's run don't need to know anything about the source code of my apps, they just need to have selenium-grid installed and have registered with the hub. Is there a way of elegantly emulating this with Hudson?
