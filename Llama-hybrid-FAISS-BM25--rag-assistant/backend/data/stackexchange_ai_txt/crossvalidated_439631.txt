Expectation Maximisation vs Expectation Propagation in the context of Bayesian Networks

I am confused about Expectation Maximisation and Expectation Propagation algorithms in the context of Bayesian Networks, especially whether one comprise another. What is the difference between expectation maximisation and expectation propagation? Is expectation propagation special case of expectation maximisation in the sense that it is used in Bayesian Networks to update parameters? For example, in Baum-Welch algorithm, an EM algorithm, can I use EP to approximate the posterior? Or is it used only in the context of message passing like TrueSkill model (is 'propagation' part derives from that?).
