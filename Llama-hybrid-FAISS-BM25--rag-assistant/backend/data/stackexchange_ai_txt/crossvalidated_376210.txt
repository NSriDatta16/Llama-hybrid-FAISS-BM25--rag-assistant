Of course it can. The binarity of the tree is only in the questions it asks. Each node of the tree represents a question with binary answer(unless it's a terminal node -> that one represents a "class") such as: Is the numeric variable $x_1 \geq \alpha_1$ ? Is the categorical variable $x_2 = male$ ? The tree then splits the observations according to the answer. There can be many terminal nodes leading to different "classes" or even many nodes leading to the same class. Note: I put the word "class" in "" so that I don't have to rephrase it for regression trees. Note2: Look up random forests for example to overcome some obstacles with trees.
