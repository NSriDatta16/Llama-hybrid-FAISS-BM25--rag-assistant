If the user doesn't know your hashing algorithm he also can't verify your signature on a document that you actually signed. The best option is to use public-key one-way hashing algorithms that generate the longest hash. SHA-256 creates a 256-bit hash, so a forger would have to try 2 255 different documents (on average) before they created one that matched a given document, which is pretty secure. If that's still not secure enough for you, there's SHA-512. Also, I think it's worth mentioning that a good low-tech way to protect yourself against forged digitally-signed documents is to simply keep a copy of anything you sign. That way, if it comes down to a dispute, you can show that the original document you signed was altered.
