The lesson? Reformulate the question, and search for a strategy instead of looking at the situation. Turn the thing on its head, work backwards... People are generally bad at working with chance. Animals typically fare better, once they discover that either A or B gives a higher payout on average ; they stick to the choice with the better average. (don't have a reference ready - sorry.) The first thing people are tempted to do when seeing a 80/20 distribution, is to spread their choices to match the pay-out: 80% on the better choice, and 20% on the other. This will result in a pay-out of 68%. Again, there is a valid scenario for people to choose such a strategy: If the odds shift over time, there's a good reason for sending out a probe and try the choice with the lower chance of success. An important part of mathematical statistics actually studies the behaviour of processes to determine whether they are random or not.
