Intuitive Sortable and Draggable UI indicators

I've got elements which i can sort and elements which I can drag and drop into container and back. How should I show to users that some elements can be sorted and some of them are draggable (so I also need to show drop area, which I can just highlight while dragging)? In jQuery Sortable UI demo I see double-arror indicator, on some sites there are two column dotted dash. Share your experience, please Some draggable examples Some sortable examples
