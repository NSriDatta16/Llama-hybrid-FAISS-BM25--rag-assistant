Pull Menu in CocoaTouch

I am attempting to make a UIView/UIControl that people can drag up and reveal a text box, and then drag down to hide it. However, I have yet to find a method to make this "fluid" - it always seems to stop at random places and doesn't allow any more movement. At the moment I am using a UIView for the top part of the view and here is the current code: - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch view] == topMenuView) { CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.superview]; CGPoint locationInsideBox = [touch locationInView:self]; CGPoint newLocation = location; newLocation.x = self.center.x; newLocation.y = newLocation.y + (self.frame.size.height - locationInsideBox.y) / 2; if ((self.superview.frame.size.height - newLocation.y) -32) { self.center = newLocation; } return; } } Any help would be much appreciated!
