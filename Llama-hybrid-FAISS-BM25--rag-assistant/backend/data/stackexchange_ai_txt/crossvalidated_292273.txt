MCMC for model with cumulative hazard involving integrals?

Let $h(t\vert \theta, x)$ be a hazard function with parameter vector $\theta$ and covariate vector $x$, and let $H(t\vert \theta, x) = \int_0^t h(s\vert \theta, x)ds$ be the corresponding cumulative hazard function. Let also $\pi(\theta)$ denote the corresponding prior distribution. Suppose that $H(t\vert \theta, x)$ is not available in closed form, and can only be evaluated using numerical integration. The posterior distribution is $$\pi(\theta\vert T,X) \propto \pi(\theta)\prod_{j=1}^n h(t_j\vert\theta,x_j)^{\delta_j} \exp[-H(t_j\vert\theta,x_j)],$$ where $T=(t_1,...,t_n)$, $X$ is the design matrix, and $\delta_j$ is the right-censoring indicator (1-dead, 0-alive). Is there a trick to sample from this posterior distribution without using numerical integration to evaluate this function at each MCMC iteration?
