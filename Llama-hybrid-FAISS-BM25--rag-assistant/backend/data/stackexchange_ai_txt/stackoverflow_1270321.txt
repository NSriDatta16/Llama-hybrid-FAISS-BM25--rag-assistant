A full list of all the new/popular databases and their uses?

Recently I have found that there are many new databases popping up all around my radar, and I would like to make a list of what they do and perhaps what their advantages/disadvantages are. I'll seed the list with some names and perhaps someone with more knowledge can chip in with some information about each and how they stack up. I hope this will fast become a comprehensive list of all the available database so that developers can leverage the right one for the job at hand!
