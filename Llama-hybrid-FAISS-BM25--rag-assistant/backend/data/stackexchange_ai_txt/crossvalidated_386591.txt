How much data is needed to train CNN from scratch?

Any rule of thumb, on how many input images would be needed to have a reasonable chance not to overfit the data when training a CNN from scratch? In other words, what is a reasonable amount of data (in order of magnitude) needed to train a CNN from scratch? For instance, for ResNet 50 that has about 26M parameters.
