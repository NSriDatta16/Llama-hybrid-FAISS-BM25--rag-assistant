JavaScript/JQuery: $(window).resize how to fire AFTER the resize is completed?

I'm using JQuery as such: $(window).resize(function() { ... }); However, it appears that if the person manually resizes their browser windows by dragging the window edge to make it larger/smaller, the .resize event above fires multiple times. Question: How to I call a function AFTER the browser window resize completed (so that the event only fires once)?
