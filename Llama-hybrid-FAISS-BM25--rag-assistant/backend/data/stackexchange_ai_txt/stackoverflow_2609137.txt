QLayout s are layout managers. They manage the positioning and resizing of widgets inside a parent widget. From the docs: Layouts are an elegant and flexible way to automatically arrange child widgets within their container. Each widget reports its size requirements to the layout through the sizeHint and sizePolicy properties, and the layout distributes the available space accordingly. For example, setting the layout of a widget to QHBoxLayout will result in its child widgets being laid out horizontally. You can read more about it here .
