maven 2 release plugin re-checking out all other SVN tags, not just current one being released

I have a Maven 2 project that I am releasing. I've released it several times before over the years, and nothing much has changed structurally nor configuration-wise on it since the last time I released it (maven version all the same, plugin versions all still the same etc.). However, I have just noticed that after executing release:prepare , and then running release:perform all tags are now being checked out of SVN, and not just the one we are releasing, and it's taking several hours to perform a release now (when it used to take max 30 mins). My Subversion repository is set out in the standard way : ├─ branches ├─ tag ├─ trunk Has the release plugin always done this and I've only just noticed it, or have I done something to encourage this? The commands I am using are as follows: mvn -DscmCommentPrefix=" [ maven-release-plugin refs #483 for version 2.8.0 ] " -DautoVersionSubmodules=true release:prepare mvn -DscmCommentPrefix=" [ maven-release-plugin refs #483 for version 2.8.0 ] " -DautoVersionSubmodules=true release:perform The only thing I can think of is that it might be the first time I am using the autoversion submodules switch, -DautoVersionSubmodules=true , could this be the problem? Alternatively, is there a way around it, could I use some ignore tags? Alternatively, have I cleared out maven's target/checkout working directory which had all the previous tags' checkouts in, and I don't need to worry because this will only happen this once, and next time it will only do deltas against the target/checkout directory?
