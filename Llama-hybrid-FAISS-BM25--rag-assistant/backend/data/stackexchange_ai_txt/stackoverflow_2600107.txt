First and foremost, neve store the plain-text password, instead store its hash. Using a salt is a good idea too if you expect the number of users to become large enough to have password collisions. Do you actually need to store password on all of the systems, or can you get away with a centralized, password server, solution? If a server based solution is acceptable then a decent challenge response scheme can authenticate people without revealing their password or its hash. Secure communication witht the server using certificates, to make forgery harder and then just don't allow access to the password storage on the server, through whatever means is appropriate, which can be OS specific since there is only one, or just don't let people onto the server.
