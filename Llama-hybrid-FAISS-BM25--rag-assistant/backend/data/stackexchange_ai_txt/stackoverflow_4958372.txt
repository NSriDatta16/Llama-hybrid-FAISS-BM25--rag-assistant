If you are doing this for a business I would suggest getting a Short Code with an SMS/MMS Aggragator like OpenMarket There is a chance (though I have never done this) you could create a email with the photo as an attachment and send to the MMS email gateway (if the carrier allows this). Example: Alltel (US): number@mms.alltel.net (MMS) AT&T (US): domestic-number@mms.att.net (MMS) If you try the second option, please post back your results
