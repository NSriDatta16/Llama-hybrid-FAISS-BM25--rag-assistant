I think cookies are a good solution. There is even a jquery cookie plugin here . You could save the coordinates in a cookie on the stop event . When the page changes you could check if the cookie exists and if so change the css on the dragable. You could save it on the server in a database but that seems a bit overkill to me. Because you will have to change your schema. Kevin suggested to use the unload event to save the coordinates. This way you don't have to write to the cookie every time the dragging stops.
