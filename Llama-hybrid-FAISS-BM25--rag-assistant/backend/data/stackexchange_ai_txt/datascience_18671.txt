What would you recommend to know before considering applying for a master in Machine Learning?

As someone who is about to finish a bachelor in Software Engineering still learning the basics of machine learning but would like to enroll in a master's course focused on machine learning. What would you recommend to learn before considering applying for a master? I'd like to hear experiences of people who have gone through ML or computer science with a focus on ML or have taught at that level, what is the expected knowledge you are suppose to have?
