How can I address a COM object identified by a given IUnknown* from another process?

I wrote two small C++ applications, one of which is an ActiveX container embedding some ActiveX control. This container application knows the IUnknown* referencing the ActiveX control. The other application is a client which shall interact with the ActiveX control in the former application. However, I don't know how to get a handle on the control in the client application. Simply transporting the pointer value of the IUnknown* from the server to the client won't work of courses due to independant address spaces. Is it somehow possible to "duplicate" a handle to some COM object so that the newly created handle can be used by other processes? I'd like to have COM do the RPC work for me. Otherwise, I'd need to do all COM calls in the server application and do all the RPC myself. :-/
