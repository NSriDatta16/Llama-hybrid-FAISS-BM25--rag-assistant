Random effects model in my opinion is easiest to understand when you write down the probabilistic model behind it: $$\begin{align} a_i &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \, \sigma^2_a) \\ y_{ij} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu + a_i, \, \sigma^2_\epsilon) \end{align}$$ As you immediately see, $a_i$ and $y_{ij}$ are both random variables. In fixed effects model $a_i$ would be just "fixed" parameters like $\mu$ in the above example. Your first question relates more to the nuances of the frequentist setting, because in Bayesian setting all the parameters are considered as random variables, so there is no distinction between fixed and random effects. Hopefully, we already have many good answers that explain it in detail, see What is the mathematical difference between random- and fixed-effects? or What is a difference between random effects-, fixed effects- and marginal model? . The biggest difference is that in fixed effects model $a_i$ are independent, "fixed" parameters, while in random effects model they are assumed to be random variables with the same distribution. In this sense we care about the variance of the distribution of those parameters. When fitting random effects models we use special methods that help us to precisely estimate the variance. You may also want to read What is the upside of treating a factor as random in a mixed model? or Fixed effect vs random effect when all possibilities are included in a mixed effects model for deeper insight on the differences between fixed and random effects, because it is quite subtle. Answering your second question, what is meant is that $a_i$ are independent and identically distributed random variables, with variance $\sigma^2_a$ . If the variance $\sigma^2_a=0$ this means that the distribution is degenerate, because it is constant, so all the $a_i$ are the same. With large $\sigma^2_a$ variance, the $a_i$ would vary a lot. It has nothing to do with $\epsilon_{ij}$ errors.
