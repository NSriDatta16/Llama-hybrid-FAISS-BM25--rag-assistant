Your question has already been answered, but I thought I'd be pragmatic here. 1) You will only give yourself 8 "hard-coded" options using this convention. 2) You could just create a real GUID for each these "special" cases instead of hand-cranking them. That way, it is guaranteed to be unique and you'll be able to have more than 8. That's not a direct answer, I know, but it is probably a sensible suggestion given your intentions.
