Silverlight Drag and Drop (without a Canvas)

I'm trying to drag and drop (slide) a Silverlight element from one part of a window to another. I've implemented the MouseLeftButtonDown, MouseMove, and MouseLeftButtonUp event handlers on the element, but I've run into a bit of a problem. All of the examples I've seen involve moving the element by setting the Canvas.Left and Canvas.Top properties. None of the elements I'm trying to manipulate live inside a Canvas. Is there a way to set the absolute position of the element being dragged, based on the coordinates of the mouse? Or is there a prepackaged solution to this problems somewhere that I've missed?
