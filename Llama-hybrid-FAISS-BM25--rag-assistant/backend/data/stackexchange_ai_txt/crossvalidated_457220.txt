Seeking Suggestion on Image Dataset for Logistic Regression

The problem is based on binary classification (target and interference). I have an image dataset for which I can not use pixel intensities. I can use pixel coordinates only. Nevertheless, CNN will work very well on this dataset. However, I have built a model with logistic regression using two features. In this case, will my approach become very weak (according to any machine learning researcher) since I am not using CNN? The logistic regression-based approach is giving perfect results. Also, for error analysis, which metric would be appropriate in this approach?
