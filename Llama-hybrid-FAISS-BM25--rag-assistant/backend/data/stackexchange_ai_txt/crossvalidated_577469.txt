What statistical tests can I use to compare two different ml algorithm on a dataset that has been augmented using two different approaches?

I used SMOTE and ADASYN on a dataset separately and used Random Forest and KNN on them. Both giving quite close accuracy(RF= 97.75 %, KNN= 97.22% where SMOTE was used) & (RF=97.67% and KNN=97.42% where ADASYN was used). Now I learned about statistical tests which can be used to compare two different models using single dataset. But in my case, because I used two different augmentation technique, my dataset also became different to some extent. Is there a way or statistical test that I can say that for my dataset, SMOTE is better than ADASYN or they are statistically not different?
