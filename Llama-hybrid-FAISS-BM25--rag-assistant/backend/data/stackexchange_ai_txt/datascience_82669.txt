CUDA compatibility of GTX 1650ti versus 1650

I am confused about CUDA compatibility. I am studying deep learning and looking for a laptop to buy. One laptop has GTX 1650ti and another has GTX 1650. Will both be able to use GPU for model training, or only second one? I checked for gpu compatibility. On the nvidia website only gtx 1650 is mentioned. But on some other forums I read that both can work.
