When compiling the DLL, are you linking to any static library dependencies? Those can bring in CRT references in the manifest; I've had problems before when linking in boost libraries that were compiled with a different version of VC. EDIT: The manifest dependencies are basically emitted by some #pragma s that are included at compile time. Even though the code links, those #pragma s will add stuff to your manifest. The Microsoft documentation for native side-by-side assemblies (and how the manifest affects the loader) is here .
