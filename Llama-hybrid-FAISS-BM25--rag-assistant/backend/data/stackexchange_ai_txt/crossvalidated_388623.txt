statsmodels logistic regression with binned variables has large coefficients and standard error for some variables

I'm fitting a logistic regression (binary) using Python's statsmodels , and here's a snippet of summary from the model: I have noticed that the large coefficients only occurred on two variables and it seems like it's due to not converging (though I set max to 500). Warning: Maximum number of iterations has been exceeded. Current function value: 0.094121 Iterations: 500 I'm wondering what's the reason behind it and what are some possible ways of fixing this. Just as extra information, I did: drop one of the levels from binning add a constant to the design matrix Any help is appreciated! And please let me know what other information might be useful to identify the problem.
