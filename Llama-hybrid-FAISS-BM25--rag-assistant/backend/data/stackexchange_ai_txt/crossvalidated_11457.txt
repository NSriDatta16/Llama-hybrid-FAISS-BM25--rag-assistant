Stepwise model selection, Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics and prediction success of model in nested logistic regression in R

is it possible to do stepwise (direction = both) model selection in nested binary logistic regression in R? I would also appreciate if you can teach me how to get: Hosmer-Lemeshow statitistic, Odds ratio of the predictors, Prediction success of the model. I used lme4 package of R. This is the script I used to get the general model with all the independent variables: nest.reg where: fish -- dataframe decision -- 1 or 0, whether the respondent exit or stay, respectively. age, education and children -- independent variables. town -- random effect (where our respondents are nested) Now my problem is how to get the best model. I know how to do stepwise model selection but only for linear regression. ( step( lm(decision ~ age + education + children, data = fish), direction +"both") ). But this could not be used for binary logistic regression right? also when i add (1|town) to the formula to account for the effects of town, I get an error result. By the way... I'm very much thankful to Manoel Galdino who provided me with the script on how to run nested logistic regression . Thank you very much for your help.
