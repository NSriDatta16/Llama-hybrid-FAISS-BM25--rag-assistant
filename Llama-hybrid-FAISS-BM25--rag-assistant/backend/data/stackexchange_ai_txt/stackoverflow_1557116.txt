I frequently don't test the convenience methods to the same level of detail as the core method they call. For example your ArgumentNullException case. I wouldn't test it twice. My feeling is that unit testing is white box testing. I'm allowed to know the implementation. Of course this could mean that I'm going to get burned when I go and refactor later and add functionality to the convenience method. But I'm pretty decent at doing TDD (not a full zealot as you can tell from the first paragraph). So I think I would most likely write a test for that new functionality and cover it then. I'm not claiming it's more or less correct. It's just what I do.
