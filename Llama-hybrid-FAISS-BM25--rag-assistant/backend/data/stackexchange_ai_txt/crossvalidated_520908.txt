In Bayesian modeling, are there any approaches to score the confidence of the predicted distribution, instead of just the point estimate?

In a situation where one is predicting a distribution, rather than just a point estimate, what are some approaches to check the goodness of fit on observed data? The goal here would be to get a metric that encapsulates the confidence of a given prediction (wider distributions would have a "worse" metric). Are posterior predictive checks used for this? Are there any other methods?
