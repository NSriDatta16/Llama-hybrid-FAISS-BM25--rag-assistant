Unsupervised soft clustering methods

I have a D-dimensional dataset composed of exactly two clusters (this is known) for which I have no labels; the clusters can potentially be wildly imbalanced. I'm after a soft (or fuzzy ) clustering method to assign probabilities to each element of belonging to either cluster. So far I've been able to come up with basically two: Fuzzy K-means Gaussian Mixture Models Then there are methods that apply hard clustering that could perhaps be softened by re-running varying the inputs (and averaging all the iterations?): DBSCAN Hierarchical And finally there's also those methods that I'm not sure whether they can be applied in an unsupervised way at all: Random Forests Mean Shift BIRCH Am I missing some method? Did I miss-classify any of the above? Is any method more suited to my particular issue than the rest? Any insight will be much appreciatted.
