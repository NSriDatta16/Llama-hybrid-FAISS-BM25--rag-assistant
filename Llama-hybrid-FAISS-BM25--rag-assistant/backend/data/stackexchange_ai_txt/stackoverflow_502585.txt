Svnserve VS mod_dav_svn

We plan to install a Subversion repository in an environment where the network is quite slow on its own. The previous VCS used there was VSS, and it was a nightmare to use it (not only because of its "feature"). So, my question is the choice between Svnserve and the apache module. I know that the apache module will be slower due to the stateless protocol, but I've no idea how much is the increase of the time it implies. Is there somewhere some benchmarks or rules that indicate the average difference of speed between the two servers?
