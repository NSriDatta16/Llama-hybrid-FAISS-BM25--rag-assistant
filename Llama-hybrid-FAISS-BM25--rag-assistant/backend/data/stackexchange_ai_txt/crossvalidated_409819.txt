A bit late, but I think I'll just add something here so that it can be referred to later, especially since it's pointed enough that it deserves a bit of attention. I would suggest Numerical Ecology (your initial choice), especially since the authors have come out with a 3rd English edition in 2012 . I also suggest this book since it comes with a companion book of sorts, Numerical Ecology with R (which also recently saw a new edition last year) and is kind of the 'practical' R version of Numerical Ecology (which would be the theory book, if you will). Zuur. et al.'s 2007 book Analysing Ecological Data also covers CCA and PCA analyses. It covers a lot of detail of analysing ecological data (as the title implies), but it doesn't have examples in R. Both books ( Numerical Ecology and Analysing Ecological Data ) are cited a lot, so they're good places to start.
