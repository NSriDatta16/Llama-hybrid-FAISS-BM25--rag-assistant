Does FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie() make a session based cookie?

Ok I'm rather confused, does FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie() in asp.net create a session based cookie or not? From what I gather to put something in a session you would do something like this in the code behind: Session["userAge"] = 25; Now regardless of whether a cookie is created this will work as its server side, so I'm confused as to when I read you can have session and sessionless cookies, if so how do you create each one and how would you access esssion variables in the cookie in .net?
