Linq to nhibernate question

I'm trying to create a query using linq 2 nhibernate which generate a sql like: select * from table where id in (1, 2, 3, 4) At the moment I have this code: var vouchers = Session.Linq () .Where(x => campaignIds.Contains(x.VoucherGroup.Campaign.Id)) .ToArray(); The campaignIds is array of 'long' variables. But this code will just download all the vouchers and iterate through them to find only those with specific campaignId. I could of course iterate through the campaign Ids and call the database for each campaign Id and use the union operator but I wonder if there is some more elegant way of doing it. Thanks
