Anomaly detection with a multivariate Gaussian vs. PCA + univariate Gaussians

In Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera Class , he covers anomaly detection in multiple dimensions for both independent univariate Gaussians and multivariate Gaussians, the latter being more costly than the former. Would running independent anomaly detection after orthogonalizing the data produce the same results as a multivariate anomaly detection? Is PCA too costly for this to ever be worthwhile (assuming it works at all)?
