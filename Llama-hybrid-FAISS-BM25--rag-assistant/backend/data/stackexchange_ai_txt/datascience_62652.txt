So now I am totally confused how people use one hot encoding for target variable in practice? please help me out. This mostly comes down to the tool you are using. Sklearn, which I assume you are using, does not use one hot encoded target variables. So your y should be of dimension (1600, 1) where the classes are 0, 1, 2 and 3. Instead of applying one hot encoding you can use a LabelEncoder to get it on the correct format. I suspect the reason for your confusion comes from having seen deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and Keras. With them you always one hot encode your target variable. Short answer: Using sklearn: Label encode Using deep learning: one hot encode
