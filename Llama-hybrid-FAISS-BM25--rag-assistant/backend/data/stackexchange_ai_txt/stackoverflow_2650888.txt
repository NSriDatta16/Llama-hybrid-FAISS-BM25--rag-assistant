It sounds like you're looking at a single TCP fragment. If that came from the beginning of a message, it will have an HTTP version in the first line, but if you're just pulling random packets off the network and hoping to be able to tell they're HTTP you're out of luck - there is nothing in the TCP fragments which indicates what is in them. The only way to know would be to look at the whole conversation.
