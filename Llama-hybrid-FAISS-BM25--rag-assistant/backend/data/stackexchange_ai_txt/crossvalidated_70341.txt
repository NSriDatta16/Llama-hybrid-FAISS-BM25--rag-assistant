First, in this case, confussion matrix roughly transforms to something like similarity matrix, not distance matrix. If two annotators are often confusing two labels, then it means that these labels are somewhat similar , not distant . The simplest approach to take account of all such matrices would be to simply calculate their mean. If you are already taking a mean between each pair, then taking a mean of all annotators would not bring much more harm to the information then it is already done. Second, I do not really see any correlation between such method and PCA (but I may be simply missing something here). Maybe you were thinking about applying the PCA on the data? Either way, does not seem as a good idea as PCA will result in linear combinations of your categories, rather then just "connecting" similar ones.
