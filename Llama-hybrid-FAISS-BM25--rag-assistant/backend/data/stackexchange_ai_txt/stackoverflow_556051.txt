Start with a good book. I always found T hinking in Java pretty good, besides there is a free online version available. Skip the things you already know. Well you probably know what an object is and so on... Next thing learn to use a good IDE. Have a look at Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. Java without a proper IDE is useless. If you transit from PhP you are probably going to develop some Web applications? This is a steep learning curve. JavaEE is big, complex and it takes a while to dig into all those frameworks. Propably you end up saying "Why is this so complicated, I can do it much easier in PhP". You will be right about that. Can't give you a good recommendation about the frameworks that are suited best for you. We use Seam + Richfaces. Not that hard.
