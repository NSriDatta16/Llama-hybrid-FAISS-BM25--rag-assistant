Magento Product Collection Get Only Products From Certain Categories

I am trying to get a list of products that have a sale price that are only in certain categories. Right now I am trying to use a product collection to get this data. I am not sure how I would go about restricting the collection for particular categories only. Here is what I have so far: $products = Mage::getModel('catalog/product') ->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addAttributeToFilter('status', 1) ->addAttributeToFilter('visibility', 4) ->addAttributeToFilter('special_price', array('neq' => "")) ->addAttributeToFilter('discontinued', array('neq' => 1)) ->setPageSize(10) ->setOrder('price', 'ASC') ; The discontinued attribute is a custom attribute that we use so that products don't display but also don't 404. Is there a way to use the product model and restrict to certain categories?
