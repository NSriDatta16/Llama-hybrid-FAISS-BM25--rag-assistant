VAR model residuals having significant correlation at lag 12

I have tried to fit a VAR model for two stationary time series dlogsl_ts and dlogllc_ts (tested by PP test and ADF test), the monthly river flow data. From: VARselect(dlogdata, lag.max=10) # SC(3) It seems that I could try fitting the model with a lag of 3. Overall my model seems good: dlogllc_ts = dlogsl_ts.l1 + dlogllc_ts.l1 + dlogsl_ts.l2 + dlogllc_ts.l2 + dlogsl_ts.l3 + dlogllc_ts.l3 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) dlogsl_ts.l1 -0.21404 0.06660 -3.214 0.001387 ** dlogllc_ts.l1 1.27827 0.05459 23.417 However when looking at the residuals it also seems that the model is not validated: My code: fit_var1 Can someone please tell my why I am having this significant residual correlation at lag 12? It also happens with other models I have tried fitting. I have already tried to remove seasonality in the beginning: dlogsl_ts If I simply use a VAR(12), the residual structure would not change much: Now go with VAR(24): And VAR(48): Hardly changes the residual structure. It is of course useless to model such a high-order VAR, but just to demonstrate here the "stubbornity" of the residual correlation.
