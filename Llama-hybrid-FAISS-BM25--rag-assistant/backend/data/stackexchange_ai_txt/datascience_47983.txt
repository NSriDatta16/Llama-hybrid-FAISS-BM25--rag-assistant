I'd be honored to serve this community as a moderator. As a principal data scientist for a Fortune 50 company, I am a working professional in this field & I believe that understanding the trends & patterns emerging in the profession are a critical part of being an effective moderator. If you check my recent posts to new users, I usually start with "Welcome to the site!" because we have to recognize that data science is still a nascent field & it will thrive with new users for a long time to come. I have a been a consistent visitor to the site & that is reflected in both my reputation score & badges. I am also active in the moderation cues that are available & I carefully apply edits & sound judgement in order to contribute to the site in a similar capacity to a moderator. I enjoy helping people new to the data science field & I am slow to use the "close question" option. Our approach to new users will dictate the long term health & viability of this SE & the next set of moderators need to have an understanding of that - the current state simply can't remain the same. I'm passionate about data science, I want to see this SE succeed & I ask for your vote.
