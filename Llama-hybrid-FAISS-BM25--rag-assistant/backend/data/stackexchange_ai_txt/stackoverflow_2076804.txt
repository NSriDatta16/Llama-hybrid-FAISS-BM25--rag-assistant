For one thing, there is no initWithURL:byReference: method. There are many ways to create a QTMovie object , none of which have a byReference: parameter and all of which (except for +movie ) take an error: output parameter. Once you're loading the movie, you need to hand it to a QTMovieView for it to display. The easiest way to create such a view is in IB, by dragging it from the Library panel (QuickTime Kit section) to a window in one of your xibs. Then, either have an outlet in your controller to the movie view and send the movie view a setMovie: message after creating the movie, or bind the movie view's “Movie” property to a property of your controller.
