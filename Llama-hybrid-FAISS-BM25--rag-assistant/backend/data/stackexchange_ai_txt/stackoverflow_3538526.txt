How to detect if a Blobstore entry is an image so get_serving_url would work?

I have a general purpose file storage backed by Google App Engine Blobstore, when I show users it's contents I would like to differentiate images from other files — I would like to show thumbnail for each image. Python get_serving_url function does not care (at least at dev server) if given blob is in fact an image, java's getServingUrl throws en exception... So my question, is: How to detect in python if a blob store entry is an image, so I could get a serving_url and use it in the UI? EDIT: On production python is throwing NotImageError on get_serving_url call with not supported blob—it's just not documented and it does not do that on dev server.
