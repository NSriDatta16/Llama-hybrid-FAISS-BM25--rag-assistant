WIF using SAML 2 protocol / Federate AD FS 2.0 with CAS

I'am are trying to implement a Web SSO with claim based identity using WIF and AD FS 2.0 right now. Right now I have a existing ASP.Net application which delegates authentification to the AD FS 2.0 server and trust issued security tokens. That works just fine. However, in the organization there is an existing JA-SIG Central Authentication Service (CAS) server which supports the SAML 2 protocol. I would like to replace AD FS 2.0 with the existing CAS service. In my understanding WIF uses WS-Federation, which is like a container around a SAML token. Is it possible to use the plain SAML 2 protocol and it's bindings (redirect or POST)? If that is not possible (as I guess), a second alternative might be to use federate identity and federate AD FS 2.0 with CAS. Is that possible? There is little to no information about that on the web. Thanks :-)
