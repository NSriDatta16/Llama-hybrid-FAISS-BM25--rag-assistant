I'd agree with SP -- if it's entry level, I'd worry more about the person's general knowledge, how well their personality meshes with the organization, and their willingness and aptitude to learn more. I was doing a telephone interview for a PL/SQL programmer (with no advance warning), and for one of the questions, the candidate said he didn't know, but he was fairly sure the answer was in a given book. I accepted that as a right answer -- for entry level, admitting that you don't know everything is pretty important. If you're asking what you should look over before the interview -- I'd say don't study too much, or you might stress out and make a bad impression. Normally, I'd look see if the person has good skills for the job at hand, but I don't know what they're hiring for ... so if you want to look at something, a good understanding of cursors and sql statement tuning go a long way.
