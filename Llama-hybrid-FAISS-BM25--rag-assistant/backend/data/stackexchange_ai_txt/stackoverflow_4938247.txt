microsoft access create forms and reports help

I am newbie to microsoft access. I am creating sytem for agent works to connect seller and buyer. Currently, i am maintaining my billing system manually with two different forms one for seller and one for buyer as follows: In the first invoice example which is for seller agent earns by recieving comission from seller. In quantity field the first item at left of dash sign represents mann (1 mann equals 40 kg) while item on right represents value in kilogram. Price column represents value per mann basis and the last column represents agent comission on per mann. Total qunatity is calculated through by adding kgs and convert it into mann unit if possible by adding kgs first and convert 40kg into 1 mann e.g 2-30 + 2-32 from kg field, kgs are equal to 62kg convert 40kg into 1 man and put remaining kgs into kgs field as follows 5-22 Price is calculated in Total filed which is hidden column by coverting quantity value in kgs first (2*40+30) and also convert price value in per kg (1800/40) and store result in Total field as ((2*40+30) * (1800/40)) = 4950 Finally for Seller deduct comission in another agent profit hidden field 140 per mann calcuated as convert agent value in kg first and multiply total kgs by agent value as ((2*40+30) * (140/40)) Name: ABC Address: Street # 02 Type: Seller DATE TIME QUANTITY(mann-kg) PRICE PER MANN Total(Hidden Field) AGENT COMISSION(per mann) AGENT PROFIT(Hidden Field) 09-02-2011 Morning 2-30 1800 4950 140 385 09-02-2011 Evening 2-32 1850 5180 140 392 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total 5-22 10130 777 Payable = 10130 - 777 = 9,353 All the above fields and calculation remains same except comission for buyer invoice. Name: DEF Address: Street # 05 Type: Buyer DATE TIME QUANTITY(mann-kg) PRICE PER MANN 09-02-2011 Morning 2-30 1800 09-02-2011 Evening 2-32 1850 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total 5-22 10130 Recievable = 10,130 What i want i am looking to convert all that stuff to microsft access 2007 by creating forms in the same way for user to input data and generate reports as above invoices example for seller and buyer. I am stuck how to input quantity field value as mentioned, how to calculate agent comission etc. Also i want searching option in reports where end user can easily search invoice for specific seller or buyer within date criteria and with other filters. I need help and asistance how to calculate and save quantity, price per mann, comission and the sub total in reports. Database schema i designed is: CustomerID is primary key in customer table and foreign key in Price table (one-to-many relationship) CREATE TABLE Customer ( CustomerID SMALLINT(6) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, Name VARCHAR(100), Address VARCHAR(255), Type ENUM('1','2') COMMENT 'Seller=1, Buyer=2', PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID)); CREATE TABLE Price ( PriceID INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, CustomerID SMALLINT(6), Date Date, PriceType ENUM('Morning','Evening'), Price INT(11) NOT NULL, Quantity INT(11) NOT NULL, Comission INT(11) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (PriceID));
