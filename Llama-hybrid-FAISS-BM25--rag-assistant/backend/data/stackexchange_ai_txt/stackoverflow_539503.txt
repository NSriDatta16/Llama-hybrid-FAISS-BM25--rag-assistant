WCF: Individual methods or a generic ProcessMessage method accepting xml

My company is developing an application that receives data from another company via TCP sockets and xml messages. This is delivered to a single gateway application which then broadcasts it to multiple copies of the same internal application on various machines in our organisation. WCF was chosen as the technology to handle the internal communications (internally bi-directional). The developers considered two methods. Individual methods exposed by the WCF service for each different message received by the gateway application. The gateway application would parse the incoming external message and call the appropriate WCF service method. The incoming XML would be translated into DataContract DTO’s and supplied as argument to the appropriate WCF method. The internal application exposed a WCF service with one method “ProcessMessage” which accepted an Xml string message as argument. The internal app would parse then deserialize the received xml and process it accordingly. The lead developer thought option two was the better option as it was “easier” to serialized/deserialize the xml. I thought the argument didn’t make sense because DataContracts are serialized and deserialized by WCF and by using WCF we had better typing of our data. In option 2 someone could call the WCF service and pass in any string. I believe option 1 presents a neater interface and makes the application more maintainable and useable. Both options would still require parsing and validation of the original xml string at some point, so it may also be a question where is the recommended place to perform this validation. I was wondering what the current thoughts are for passing this kind of information and what people’s opinions on both alternatives are.
