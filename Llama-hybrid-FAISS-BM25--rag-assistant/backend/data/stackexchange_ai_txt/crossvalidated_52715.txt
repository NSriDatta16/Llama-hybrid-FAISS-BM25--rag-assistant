SVM weights are calculated according to $\textbf{w}$ = $\sum_{i}$$\alpha_i$$y_i$$\textbf{x}_i$ ( good overview here ). These give insight into the importance of a feature to the classfier's ability to find the decision boundary between classes. Generally, if a feature has a positive weight, its presence contributes to the separating ability of the classifier, while if negative, it is the absence that is informative (see, for example, Lee et al. 2011 ). Also, this question , especially point 3 and the comment about the SVM-RFE algorithm (linked in the question) should be helpful as well.
