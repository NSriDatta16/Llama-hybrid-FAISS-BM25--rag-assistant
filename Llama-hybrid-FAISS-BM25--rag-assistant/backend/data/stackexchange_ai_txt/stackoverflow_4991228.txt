Pages does not find my PHP includes

I am having an include folder with haeder.inc.php, nav.inc.php and footer.inc.php. So, I do want to organize my php pages by sections. I mean, I do want to have a pic folder, then a video folder and put inside all php pages related to each folder. Problems The php pages does not find my include folder (haeder.inc.php, nav.inc.php and footer.inc.php.) I hope it makes sense.
