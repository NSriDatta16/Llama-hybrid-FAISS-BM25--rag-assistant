If you want to test the actions of an event-based item like this, separate the actions into a separate, testable method and just call it from the handler. Or, as darin suggested, test the effects of the method - in this particular case, that your routing table got registered correctly. BTW, I've never reached 100% coverage on a non-trivial app... We generally target 80% as "good enough". Some modules are 100% testable, but many aren't practical to do so.
