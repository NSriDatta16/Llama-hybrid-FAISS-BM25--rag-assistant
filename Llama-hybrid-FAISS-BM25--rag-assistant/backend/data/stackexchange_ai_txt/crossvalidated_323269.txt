Simple real world examples for teaching Bayesian statistics?

I would like to find some "real world examples" for teaching Bayesian statistics. Bayesian statistics allows one to formally incorporate prior knowledge into an analysis. I would like to give students some simple real world examples of researchers incorporating prior knowledge into their analysis so that students can better understand the motivation for why one might want to use Bayesian statistics in the first place. Are you aware of any simple real world examples such as estimating a population mean, proportion, regression, etc where researchers formally incorporate prior information? I realize Bayesians can use "non-informative" priors too, but I am particularly interested in real examples where informative priors (i.e. real prior information) are used.
