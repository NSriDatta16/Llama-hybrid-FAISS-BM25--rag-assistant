Making loaded image draggable actionscript 3

i want to load an image to stage using Loader and then I want to make it draggable. Loading is done by selecting from tilelist as seen below, but I have no idea about drag and drop in AS3, can anybody help me? I want to make it as simple as possible. Here is my code to load image: var charge1:Loader = new Loader(); addChild(charge1); this.addChildAt(charge1, getChildIndex(bg)); charge1.x = 280; charge1.y = 270; ... function setCharge1(e:Event):void{ trace(e.target.selectedItem.source); this.charge1.load(new URLRequest(e.target.selectedItem.source)); this.charge1.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE,onComplete); }
