Is the mean really the best estimator and why? If you're looking for the highest reward (or highest sum of ball numbers), then yes, the mean is the best estimator. It's also consistent with common sense to pick the robot which had the highest average in earlier rounds. Especially because the robots don't draw the balls randomly (though as stipulated in the problem, we don't know why or how they choose the balls). Why not the mean over all the balls drawn? Correct, you do have to do that (for each robot seperately of course). And based on the formula in your "Standard Solution", that's exactly what you're doing (per robot). Though it doesn't match your interpretation in the line before that: "...make the decision based on the mean and the standard error on mean for the sum of the balls in each round " . What about the sensitivity to outliers? In this case, I don't think outliers would cause a big problem for the very reasons you've given in your "Additional Information". If 0 is drawn 95% of the time, the second most common is a mere 1, etc. etc. You can do the math. The 'handful of times' that there are high numbered balls (even if there are several), it won't have a big impact if you're doing it a million rounds (and eventually thus devide by N (10^6) to get the mean). Plus, one would imagine the standard error to take this into account. It seems a lot of information is lost by not using the knowledge of the set Bk so is something more Baysian advisable? I'm going to refer to this paper by S.L. Scott because a) I couldn't put it better, b) I don't want to run the risk of oversimplifying the answer and c) I'm simply not sure with this particular problem: A modern Bayesian look at the multi-armed bandit - For a deeper understanding (including the 'regret' vs. 'reward' side of the story, etc.) I refer to: Best Arm Identification in Multi-Armed Bandit
