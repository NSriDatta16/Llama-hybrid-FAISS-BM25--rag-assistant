how come $π(x)π(x_p∣x)=π(x_p)π(x∣x_p)$? This is a consequence of the form of the transition kernel for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm: The Markov transition kernel associated with this algorithm is $$ \pi(y|x) = \rho(x,y) q(y|x) + (1-r(x)) \delta_x(y) \;, $$ where $q$ denotes the density of the proposal distribution, $r(x)=\int \rho(x,y) q(y|x) \text{d}y$ and $\delta_x$ denotes the Dirac mass in $x$. It is straightforward to verify that \begin{align*} \rho(x,y) q(y|x)\pi(x)&=\rho(y,x) q(x|y)\pi(y) \\ (1-r(x)) \delta_x(y) \pi(x)&=(1-r(y)) \delta_y(x)\pi(y) \;, \end{align*} which together establish detailed balance for the Metropolis-Hastings chain. From this equality, establishing stationarity of $\pi$ is straightforward, as seen by integrating both sides in $x$. Is it true for any Markov chains which are ergodic and aperiodic? This is a sufficient condition to establish stationarity (and in the case of an irreducible Markov chain ergodicity) but not a necessary condition. The Gibbs sampler comes as a counter-example. MALA (Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm) as another one.
