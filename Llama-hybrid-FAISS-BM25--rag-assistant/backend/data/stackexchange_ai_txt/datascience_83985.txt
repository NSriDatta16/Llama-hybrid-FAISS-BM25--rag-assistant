Trouble understanding some parts of machine learning

I am new in this field. I took one of the many courses “Introduction in Machine Learning” and realized that I have a problems with some parts of the machine learning like “Metric methods ”, “Linear classification methods”, “Support vector machine” etc. When I look at these formulas it scares me. What resources can I use to fill in the gaps in this part of math? I would be grateful if you can help me.
