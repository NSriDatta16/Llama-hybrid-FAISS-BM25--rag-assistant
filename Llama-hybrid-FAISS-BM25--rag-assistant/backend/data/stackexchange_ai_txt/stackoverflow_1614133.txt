With twit.el, there was a little farting around to make it work. Authentication info is stored inside of an alist. This a list is bound to the symbol in the variable url-basic-auth-storage . ELISP> (require 'url) ELISP> (pp url-basic-auth-storage) url-http-real-basic-auth-storage ELISP> (pp (symbol-value url-basic-auth-storage)) (("twitter.com:443" ("Twitter API" . "@uTh5tr!n6==")) ("twitter.com:80" ("Twitter API" . "AnotherAuthString=="))) ELISP> You could probably do something like this: (let ((my-temporary-auth '(("host.com:80" ("Auth Realm" . "@uTH5r!n6=="))))) (url-basic-auth-storage 'my-temporary-auth)) (do-gunk)) This will leave the users authentication info alone (if they have any). Upon retrospect that might have been the smarter way to go with twit.el.
