Does RandomForest ignore spatial independence?

I have 5 variables for each countries of the world and I need to analyze their effect and interactions on an independent variable. Random Forest would be adequate for my scope as it deals with non-linear relationships and predicts variables importance. However, I'm wondering if spatial dependence may be an issue. I've never seen spatial dependence discussed in RF applications even if it has been widely used for spatial data.
