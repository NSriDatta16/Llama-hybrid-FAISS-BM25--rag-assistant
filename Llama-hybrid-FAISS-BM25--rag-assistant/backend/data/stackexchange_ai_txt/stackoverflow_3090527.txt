how to get the attribute group in magento

I need to get the attribute group of a certain attribute set , how can i do this ? i think i got the attribute group id but i can't seem to get the attributes of that group. $attributes = $_product->getAttributes(); foreach($attributes as $attribute) { $group_id = $attribute->getData('attribute_set_info/' . $_product->getAttributeSetId() . '/group_id'); print_r($group_id); } I would really appreciate if somebody could help me out , thanx ;)
