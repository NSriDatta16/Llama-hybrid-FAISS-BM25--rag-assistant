Running a regression model that included depression, anxiety, and their interaction could yield the same results as excluding those with anxiety if the coefficients of the model were coded correctly. If $X_d$ represents depression (0/1) and $X_a$ represents anxiety (0/1), in the model $$Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_d + \beta_2 X_a + \beta_3 X_d X_a + \epsilon$$ $\beta_1$ represents the effect of depression on $Y$ for those with no anxiety, which would be equal to the slope on depression in a model fit to participants who had no anxiety. A problem is that "controlling for" is vague, and includes running the above model without including the interaction term. This will not fully control for anxiety, and the coefficient on depression will not be the isolated effect of depression in those without anxiety unless the effect of depression on mortality is the same in anxious and non-anxious people . If anxiety were controlled for using propensity score methods (e.g., matching or weighting), the estimated depression effect would be the marginal effect of depression in the population, i.e., averaged across levels of anxiety, so this also would probably not be the quantity you want to estimate.
