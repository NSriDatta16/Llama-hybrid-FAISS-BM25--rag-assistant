Personally we used the R CMD BATCH interface to R to achieve this. It's not very elegant, but essentially we have a user pasting data into a form which is passed to PhP which generates a .R file with something x = c(1,2,3,4); dev.off(); plot(x); Then we get PhP to do an exec "R CMD BATCH " In the directory you should then get Rplots.ps file which can be served to the client. Equally you can use the jpeg() function to return a jpeg picture of the graphic which can then be displayed on the web page PhP returns. Not elegant at all, but it works for us.
