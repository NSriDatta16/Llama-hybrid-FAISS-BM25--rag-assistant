Uberto, it's not at all weird for the service not to be registered yet. OSGi is dynamic. Services come and go. If you attempt to access a service before it has been registered then you will get null. When you do a plain getService() you are kind of assuming that the service already exists. If you need the service to be there, you should instead do something that involves waiting for the registration event. This can be done with ServiceTracker, but it is rather low level. As others have pointed out, using something like Spring-DM or Declarative Services makes this quite easy and robust.
