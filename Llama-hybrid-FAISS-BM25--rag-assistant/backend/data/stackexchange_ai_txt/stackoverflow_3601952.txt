If you have a sufficiently large class that doesn't lend itself to effective refactoring, separating it into multiple files helps keep things organized. For instance, if you have a database for a site containing a discussion forum and a products system, and you don't want to create two different providers classes (NOT the same thing as a proxy class, just to be clear), you can create a single partial class in different files, like MyProvider.cs - core logic MyProvider.Forum.cs - methods pertaining specifically to the forum MyProvider.Product.cs - methods for products It's just another way to keep things organized. Also, as others have said, it's about the only way to add methods to a generated class without running the risk of having your additions destroyed the next time the class is regenerated. This comes in handy with template-generated (T4) code, ORMs, etc.
