Filtering Eclipse's C++ Content Assist

I'm using Eclipse Ganymede (version 3.4.1) with a C++ project. Is there some way to filter the content assist list to only show methods and fields that are available in the current context? If not, why not? Is there ever a situation where I would want to access the private fields, etc. in an object?
