Are you using a multi-column document? I so, consider the table* variant environment. In a single column environment your options run to: Increase the textwidth . But the default margin were choosen for good ergonomic reasons, so this is to be discouraged beyond a minimal tweaking. Reduce the text size in the table (i.e. \small or even \footnotesize inside the tabular environment). Again, this is less than optimal. Use the rotating package as suggested in the link Stephan202 gave . I used this for a couple of very large tables in my dissertation (with only the p positioning options) and it came out very nicely.
