(Silverlight OOB) How to get the normal width and height of main window to save and restore them

I have a small out-of-browser app, and want to save and restore its window width+height+state between sessions using IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings. I'm trying to save settings like this (on Application_Exit): IsolatedStorageSettings appSettings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; Window mainWindow = Application.Current.MainWindow; appSettings["WindowTop"] = mainWindow.Top; appSettings["WindowLeft"] = mainWindow.Left; appSettings["WindowWidth"] = mainWindow.Width; appSettings["WindowHeight"] = mainWindow.Height; appSettings["WindowState"] = (UInt32)mainWindow.WindowState; The bad thing is when an app is maximized, this code stores the Width, Height, Left and Top of maximized window, not the normal size/position (before maximization). Can I get the normal window size and position somewhere? If I'll have that values on Application_Startup, I can set normal size/position and then set WindowState, so the window position will be restored correctly after returning from maximized state.
