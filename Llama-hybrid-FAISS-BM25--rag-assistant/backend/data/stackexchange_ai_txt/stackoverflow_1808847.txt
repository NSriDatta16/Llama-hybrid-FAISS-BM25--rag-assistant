You'll need to be more specific - what about this isn't "quite right"? -[NSView scrollRectToVisible:] Scrolls the receiverâ€™s closest ancestor NSClipView object the minimum distance needed so a specified region of the receiver becomes visible in the clip view. NSTextView is a subclass of NSView (though you should always consider whether a given view has flipped coordinates...), so you can use -scrollRectToVisible: Also, unless your text view content changes are pretty much exactly the same as before, the old visible rect isn't going to be quite the same, so I wouldn't expect it to behave perfectly. If you're only applying attributes (like syntax highlighting) to the text, there'd be no need to do anything to the text view (the text storage or container) that should require a complete reload (and re-scroll). I guess it boils down to "what exactly are you trying to do?"
