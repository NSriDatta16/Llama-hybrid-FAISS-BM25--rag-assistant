If your @property declaration references an undeclared ivar, the Objective-C runtime will dynamically synthesize the ivar for you. This requires that you compile for iPhone OS or 64-bit Mac OS X. If you want to target Mac OS X i386 or PPC you have to declare your ivars explicitly. There is a good article about this here. http://cocoawithlove.com/2010/03/dynamic-ivars-solving-fragile-base.html
