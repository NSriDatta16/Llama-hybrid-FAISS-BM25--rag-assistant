Showing an XML file in a form with C#

it might sound stupid, but I need a way to take an XML file / string, and show it to a user in a form. I'm currently trying to use the WebBrowser control, but its Document field is read only. I tried setting DocumentText instead but it seems to be accepting HTML only. What control should I use? It can be anything in WinForms or Infragistics. Also, if there's a .NET XML parser, I'd love to know. Thanks.
