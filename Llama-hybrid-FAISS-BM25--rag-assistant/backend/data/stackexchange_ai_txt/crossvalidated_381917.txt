ResNet 34 training with custom dataset

I am a beginner in Neural Networks and wanted to implement ResNet34 for a pet project at my workplace. Due to confidentiality issues, I do not want to use ImageNet trained weights. I have a dataset of around 10000 images which I can use to train my dataset. Can you suggest if that is possible without overfitting. I can use data augmentation for additional data. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
