Do repeated measures affect point estimates of predicted probabilities or AUC from logistic regression?

I understand the presence of repeated measures affects standard errors and hence inferences using p-values, confidence intervals, etc. However, do repeated measures affect the point estimates of predicted probabilities or the summary measure of accuracy using AUC-ROC (c statistic)? That is, do they affect prediction if that is a singular goal of the modeling? I would think repeated measures could affect the regression coefficients which then will affect the predicted probabilities - but I have not seen extensive discussion of this. Thank you.
