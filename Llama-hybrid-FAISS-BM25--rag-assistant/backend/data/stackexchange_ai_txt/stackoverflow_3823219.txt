Trouble merging branch into trunk after re-organizing the repository

For a very long time we did all of our development and deployment from trunk. After a while this led to a production environment that was out of synch with trunk as we'd get a request to move new feature "B" to production, but hold off on new feature "A" - basically we'd checkout from trunk to a temp folder then selectively merge files from temp to production (which wasn't under version control) After wrestling with this for far too long, I finally decided to rearrange the repository to allow for branching, but I made a few mistakes while moving (svn mv) trunk around so that I could make room for the branches and tags folders (previously there was no "trunk" folder, the files just sat in the parent folder for the project) and the end result is that my "trunk" is now newer than some of the branches I created off of it. And now I can't seem to do a merge from the branches back into trunk w/o missing lots of changes and getting lots of conflicts. (I've already updated the branch from trunk.) If I run svn log --stop-on-copy on my trunk, the earliest revision is r14376, and if I run it on my branch the earliest revision is r14368. (HEAD is at r14710) How can I do a proper merge without losing all of my changes between r14368 and r14376? I was just going to do a manual merge to trunk, but then I lose all of my revision history for the branch files.
