There is a whole standard organzied around querying data from an XML document. The standard is called XPath and C# has an implementation. It's not the easiest thing to learn out of the box but it is one of the best techniques for extracting data from XML and well worth learning. Here is an example. EDIT: I would recommend you figure out LINQ to XML however as it's more powerful but if you still want XPath then your specific question would look something like (I don't have VS on this computer so I couldn't verify this)... XPathDocument doc = new XPathDocument(new StringReader(xmlString)); XPathNavigator nav = doc.CreateNavigator(); // Compile a standard XPath expression XPathExpression expr = nav.Compile("/person/eye/eye_info/eye_color"); expr = nav.Compile("/catalog/cd/price"); XPathNodeIterator iterator = nav.Select(expr); // Iterate on the node set while (iterator.MoveNext()) { XPathNavigator nav2 = iterator.Current.Clone(); Console.WriteLine(nav2.Value); }
