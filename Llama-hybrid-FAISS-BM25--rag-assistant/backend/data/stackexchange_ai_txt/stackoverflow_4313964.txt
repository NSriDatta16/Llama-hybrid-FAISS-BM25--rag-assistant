We'll start by laying out a view containing buttons. In Xcode, create a new View-based iPhone application, and call it "GradientButtons" (or whatever you want). Double-click the GradientButtonsViewController.xib resource to open it in Interface Builder. Drag a UIButton control from the library onto the view. Set its properties like this: * Change the type to "Custom" * Set the title to "Gray" * Change the text color to white * Change the background color to gray
