json_encode() will produce valid JSON. If necessary, you can verify this for yourself by copy-and-pasting the JSON output into an online validator like the one at http://www.jsonlint.com/ If you're not sure if your data is being placing into the array with the correct organization , that's another matter. But given a valid PHP array/object/pretty much whatever, json_encode() will produce it encoded properly in the JSON format. EDIT: Inside your while loop, this code: while($category = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { $categories[] = array('category'=>$category); } Builds an array that looks like this: ("category" => [$catId, $categoryName, etc.], "category" => [$catId, $categoryName, etc], and so on) I think you'd be better off (and happier with the JSON produced) if you changed it to: while($category = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { $categories[] = $category; } The original code is adding each and every category to the $categories array with the same "category" key. But since this key is duplicated for each category, it serves no real purpose.
