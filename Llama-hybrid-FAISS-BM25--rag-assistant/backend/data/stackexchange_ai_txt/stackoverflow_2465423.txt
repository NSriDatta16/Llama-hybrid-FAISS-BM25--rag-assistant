The current Next Big Thing is Magento : Magento is the eCommerce software platform for growth that promises to revolutionize the industry. Its modular architecture and unprecedented flexibility means your business is no longer constrained by your eCommerce platform. Magento is total control. It is open-source and based on Zend Framework, although there is no much left of that (or so I hear). It can be customized to fit almost any needs and comes with an impressive feature set . Not sure from your question how much you are going to need from this. Might be overkill though. Magento has a Community Edition and a (pretty costly) Enterprise Edition. There is also an active community around it, providing extensions to it: Themes, Payment Gateways, etc. EDIT While not a generic Framework like CI, Cake or Symfony, it is an eCommerce framework and since your requirements are aimed at and the question tagged with ecommerce, it might fit your needs.
