Standardized residuals in fgarch package

I'm using the fGARCH package in R to fit a GARCH time series process. However, I'm getting different results when I inspect the standardized residuals manually vs when I set the parameter flag TRUE. Why are these two outputs differing from one another? Thanks. rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) library(fGarch) set.seed(4) x and condVar = gfit@h.t resid vs tail(residuals(gfit, standardize = TRUE)) #[1] -0.4156200 -0.8297368 1.5684382 1.0282689 -0.1734509 -0.7775190
