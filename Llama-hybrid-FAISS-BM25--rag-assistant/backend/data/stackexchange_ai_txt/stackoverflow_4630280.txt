Detecting Email Clients with Dynamic Image

I am wondering if it is possible to serve a different image to particular email clients that don't support animated gifs. I know it is possible to use PHP to dynamically generate an image. So if there is something like User Agent strings that can be read when the email client sends a request to download the Dynamic Image i.e. then php could send a different image to the email clients that don't support animated gifs. Is this possible or is there a comparable work around for sniffing out animated gif support and serving up a alternative image?
