GLSL - Why are bitwise operators reserved? What is a good alternative to using bitwise ops (floating point ops that emulate bitwise)

I'm running some experiments in WebGL, one of them being an XOR effect fragment shader. For some reason all the bitwise operators are reserved in GLSL and cause a compiler error when used. Why are these operators illegal? What can I use instead of | in this case?
