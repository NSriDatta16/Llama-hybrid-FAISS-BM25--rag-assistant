How to determine if a weighted average is accurate?

I have the following problem. Consider that there is an election where n persons are voting. The goal of the election is to estimate the weight of a bag. Each person can vote for an integer value : 1 kg , 2 kg, 3 kg.... For example, consider that 10 persons have voted and that the result is: value 1 kg : 1 vote value 2 kg : 2 votes value 3 kg : 3 votes value 4 kg : 0 vote value 5 kg : 2 votes value 6 kg : 2 votes I can calculate the weighted average of this vote: ((1 x 1) + (2 x 2) + (3 x 3) + (5 x 2) + (6 x 2)) / 10 = 3.6 kg So this means that on average people think that the bag has a weight of 3.6 kg. However, I would like to know how good this estimation is. What is the probability that this is accurate? Is there some statistical methods or something from statistics that can be used to solve this kind of problem such as to calculate a confidence interval or something like that? Thanks for your help.
