implementing a simple geofence in objective-C

I am trying to implement somewhat of a simple geofence algorithm that basically does the following: Say I have two point A and B (each point has a latitude and longitude value in earth). I can draw a straight line from point A to point B I can set a perimeter, which is a rectangle, around that line (see drawing below for more clarity) What I want to do is as follows, if the phone current location is outside of this red perimeter then it triggers something, basically a delegate. The perimeter size should be able to be adjusted to a percentage size, so 5% would be a small perimeter around the line and 70% would be a large perimeter around the line. Be aware that the perimeter should be a rectangle, not circle with radius. I am guessing that there will be a bunch of if statements involved in building this... if anyone could come up with a simple and elegant solution to this (would be great if I can see code in objective-C) that would be awesome. Or any guidance would be helpful as well
