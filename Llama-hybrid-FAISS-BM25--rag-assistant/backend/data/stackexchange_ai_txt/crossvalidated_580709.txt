If you can, you would benefit from defining your models based on physical principles, to properly capture the nonlinear relationships you are interested in. If that is not possible for all predictors, a simple alternative would be to use generalized-additive-model s (GAMs), which are linear models that allow you to model responses as smooth, nonlinear functions of predictors. So distance can be made a smooth function of angle (and any other predictors), without specifying the functional form. Other predictors can be constrained to follow linear relationships, as in a linear regression. You can also use neural networks or other machine learning methods, and then generate partial dependence plots to visualise the nonlinear response to specific predictors. This is a key trick in what is called 'interpretable machine learning', for which I recommend this free online book by Christoph Molnar.
