Your best bet is really to get your files into some sort of storage that scales. Storing files locally should only be done with good reason (they are sensitive, private, etc.) Your best bet is to move your content into the cloud. Mosso's CloudFiles or Amazon's S3 will both allow you to store an almost infinite amount of files. All your content is then accessible through an API. If you want, you can then use MySQL to track meta-data for easy searching, and let the service handle the actual storage of the files.
