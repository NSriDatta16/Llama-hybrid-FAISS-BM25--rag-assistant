Adobe AIR - file locked by air

I am downloading and storing files locally in the app storage domain. For some reason one of the files gets locked by air. I found this by looking at process explorer. If I clear the browser cache the file never gets locked, only if it attempts to download the file but it exists in browser cache does air lock the damn file. Please can you help? Neil
