The only thing that the TCP layer guarantees is that the receiver will receive: all the bytes transmitted by the sender in the same order There are no guarantees at all about how the bytes might be split up into "packets". All the stuff you might read about MTU, packet fragmentation, maximum segment size, or whatever else is all below the layer of TCP sockets, and is irrelevant. TCP provides a stream service only . With reference to your question, this means that the receiver may receive the first 500 bytes, then the next 500 bytes later. Or, the receiver might receive the data one byte at a time, if that's what it asks for. This is the reason that the recv() function takes a parameter that tells it how much data to return , instead of it telling you how big a packet is .
