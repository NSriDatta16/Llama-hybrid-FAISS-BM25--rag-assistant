Thanks for pointing out that limitations, yes as much as I want to believe the documentation, I tried MATCHES for SQLite fetch request, and it does work, though for safety I changed it into LIKE. The only thing that doesn't work is if I'm using this predicate on Core Data using SQLite storage with a fetch request on a related object (to-many in this case), not using matches. Right now, I'm not using fetch query based on relationship, it's too risky, and I still don't know what's the mistake, I had posted this on devforums.apple.com, nobody still answer it though.
