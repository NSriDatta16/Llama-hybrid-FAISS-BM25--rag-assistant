:last-child style working, :first-child style not working! Why?

I'm creating an inset border effect between paragraphs by using a light border as the border-top on the paragraphs, and a dark border as the border bottom on them. I'm trying to use p:first-child to remove the top border on the first paragraph, and p:last-child to remove the border on the bottom one. (they have a class of "intro" fyi). The style to remove the bottom border on the :last-child is working properly, but for some reason the style to remove the top border on the :first-child is not. It must be a typo or something silly because I can't figure out why it is working for the last-child but not the first-child. http://joelglovier.com markup: Hi!
