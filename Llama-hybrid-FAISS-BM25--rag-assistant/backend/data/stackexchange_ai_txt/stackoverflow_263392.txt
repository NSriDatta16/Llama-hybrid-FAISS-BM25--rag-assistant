Handling data in a PHP JSON Object

Trends data from Twitter Search API in JSON. Grabbing the file using: $jsonurl = "http://search.twitter.com/trends.json"; $json = file_get_contents($jsonurl,0,null,null); $json_output = json_decode($json); How do I work with data from this object. As an array? Only really need to extract data from the [name] values. JSON object contains: stdClass Object ( [trends] => Array ( [0] => stdClass Object ( [name] => Vote [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Vote ) [1] => stdClass Object ( [name] => Halloween [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Halloween ) [2] => stdClass Object ( [name] => Starbucks [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Starbucks ) [3] => stdClass Object ( [name] => #flylady [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23flylady ) [4] => stdClass Object ( [name] => #votereport [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23votereport ) [5] => stdClass Object ( [name] => Election Day [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%22Election+Day%22 ) [6] => stdClass Object ( [name] => #PubCon [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23PubCon ) [7] => stdClass Object ( [name] => #defrag08 [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23defrag08 ) [8] => stdClass Object ( [name] => Melbourne Cup [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%22Melbourne+Cup%22 ) [9] => stdClass Object ( [name] => Cheney [url] => http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Cheney ) ) [as_of] => Mon, 03 Nov 2008 21:49:36 +0000 )
