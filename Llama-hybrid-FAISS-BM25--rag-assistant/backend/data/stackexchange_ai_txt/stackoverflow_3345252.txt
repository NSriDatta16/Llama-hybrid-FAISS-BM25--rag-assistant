MySQL Combine multiple rows

I have a table similar to the following (of course with more rows and fields): category_id | client_id | date | step 1 1 2009-12-15 first_step 1 1 2010-02-03 last_step 1 2 2009-04-05 first_step 1 2 2009-08-07 last_step 2 3 2009-11-22 first_step 3 4 2009-11-14 first_step 3 4 2010-05-09 last_step I would like to transform this so that I can calculate the time between the first and last steps and eventually find the average time between first and last steps, etc. Basically, I'm stumped at how to transform the above table into something like: category_id | first_date | last_date 1 2009-12-15 2010-02-03 1 2009-04-05 2009-08-07 2 2009-11-22 NULL 3 2009-11-14 2010-05-09 Any help would be appreciated.
