It depends. If you're building a neural network, you would benefit by doing an EDA of the errors instead of the raw data, to see what patterns your neural net isn't capturing. EDA is great for discovering what features correlate with your target, and if you have a sense of the problem you can build complex features and test their correlations. Neural networks get rid of the need for feature engineering, and an error analysis instead after building a quick model may be more useful to refine the model pipeline.
