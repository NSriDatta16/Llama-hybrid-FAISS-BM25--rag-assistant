When I say throughput I mean the average latency from sending a task until it's been executed. With roundtrip I mean the average time it takes to send a task, executing it, sending the result back and retrieving the result. As I said in the comments I currently don't have any official numbers to share, but with the right configuration Celery is low latency compared to many other solutions, but still it does come with more overhead than executing a function locally. This is something to take into account when designing the granularity of a task[1] I'm currently writing a performance guide that may be of interest: http://ask.github.com/celery/userguide/optimizing.html Feedback welcome, and would like to know about any other performance factors you are interested in.
