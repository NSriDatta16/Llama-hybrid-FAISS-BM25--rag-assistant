The number of dogs in a household is a count. It is true that you cannot have $1.1$ dogs, but it is also true that the average of the number of dogs in low income households can well be $1.1$. There is nothing necessarily incorrect about this claim, and your top phrasing is the right one to use. What people sometimes say (which sounds the same, but is incorrect), is: 'the average low income household has $1.1$ dogs'. It isn't clear what an 'average low income household' is, and it certainly can't have $1.1$ dogs. As you haven't made that error, you have nothing to worry about.
