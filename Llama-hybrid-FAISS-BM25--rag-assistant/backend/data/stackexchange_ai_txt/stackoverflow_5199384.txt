For the integration part (multi protocol support) you could use either BizTalk or WCF, but BizTalk has the most comprehensive set of connectors for different technologies. For mapping, the BizTalk mapper (or another graphical tool) will work for simple cases , but these tools quickly lead to very complex maps (hard to develop/read/modify), for cases with even minor sources of complexity. So you should also look at another solution for mapping, such as XSLT. For the ESB part, I would avoid the ESB Toolkit, because it's a complex, immature and fragile framework, so using it in a project is risky and will probably lead to a more complex solution. NServiceBus would seem like a better solution and can fit nicely with BizTalk for the integration part.
