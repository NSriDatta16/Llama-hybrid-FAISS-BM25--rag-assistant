You are correct, the assumption of equal probability on a dice roll is a heuristic argument, not to do with science at all. In an experimental setting, we (frequentists) define probability according to the law of large numbers. We therefore concede it's not possible to experimentally obtain such a value, and then we use a pragmatic assumption as to what it is. A few hundred tosses would usually convince us that 1/6 is a reasonable assumption. Yet we don't actually believe the event probabilities for events {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} to be exactly equal. They are only practically equal. Similarly, no two dice are identical, and if you did the required experimentation - rolls on the order of billions if not trillions to even determine that roll probabilities are not equal - the dice would deform or degrade from use.
