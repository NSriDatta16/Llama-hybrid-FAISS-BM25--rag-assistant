How to organize page layout with div's

I have a question for the more experienced programmers here. How can I best organize the div's to have like a left side, a middle side and a right side? I am doing my website now for a while and I spend half a day moving div's around because they don't stay in place after I put another one in and I want to work with the relative option. Also what I do is get them into position with big negative numbers. It just does not seem to be the right way to do things. I also get scrolbars when everything fits on the screen. Working in designmode in dreamweaver cs3 is not possible, because everything is tumbling all over each other. I am hoping for some input on how to do this better. thanks, Richard
