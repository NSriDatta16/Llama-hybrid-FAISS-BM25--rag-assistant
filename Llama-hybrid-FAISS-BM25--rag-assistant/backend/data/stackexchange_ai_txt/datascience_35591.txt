You could just predict if the next hour a room will be occupied based on whatever features you give it. Each Example would be per room per hour. You can then use whatever machine learning model you want. It saves needing to go to the complexity of some sequence models - could just use Logistic Regression, for example. Some examples of features: Was it occupied in the previous hour? How many of the previous hours was it occupied for? Of the past 10 hours, how many were it occupied for? Since the start of the 'working' day, how many hours has the room been occupied for? Was it occupied the same hour yesterday? Was it occupied the same hour a week ago? You could obviously add any others and incorporate extra information, if you have it.
