You can use NDepend for this. Download it, build a new NDepend project, drag&drop your assemblies in the Application Assemblies data grid view, and you'll see NDepend resolving instantly the tier assemblies needed by your set of Application Assemblies. You can also provide a list of folders to tell NDepend where to look. If a tier assembly can't be found, then NDepend will mark it as not found, which I think is a valuable information.
