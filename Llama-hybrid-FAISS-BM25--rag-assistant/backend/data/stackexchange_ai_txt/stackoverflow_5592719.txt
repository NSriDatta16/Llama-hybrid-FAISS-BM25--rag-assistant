Bundle Product add to cart as individual line items

Is it possible to have a bundle product that when added to the cart adds each of the bundle items as individual line items. I want to allow my customers to configure their product (let’s say it’s a computer) and then in the shopping cart, remove an item they don't want - or change their mind about - from that bundle. They might then choose to add a new item instead - or a bunch of other (non-bundle stuff, just normal shopping). The idea being that they have a fast method of adding most of the stuff they want in this bundle, but they can then edit their cart to add something that wasn’t available as an option to them when configuring the bundle. I don’t want to overload the user with too many options in the bundle product page. I might have missed an option in Magento, but currently it adds all the bundle items into the caret as a single line item, making it uneditable in the way I want. Any suggestions please?
