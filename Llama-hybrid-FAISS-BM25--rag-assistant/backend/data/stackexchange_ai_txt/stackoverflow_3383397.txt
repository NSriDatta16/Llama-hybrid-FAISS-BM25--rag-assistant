How can I pass a variable number of named parameters to a method?

I understand how to get the names of parameters passed to a method, but let's say I have a method declaration as follows: static void ParamsTest(string template, params object[] objects) and I want to use object/property names in my template for substitution with real property values in any of the objects in my `objects' parameter. Let's then say I call this method with: ParamsTest("Congrats", customer, purchase); I will only be able to retrieve two parameter names trying to fill out the template, viz, template , and objects , and the names of the objects in the objects collection are forever lost, or not? I could require a List as my second parameter, but I feel there is somehow a more elegant solution, maybe with a lambda or something. I don't know, I'm not used to using lambdas outside of LINQ.
