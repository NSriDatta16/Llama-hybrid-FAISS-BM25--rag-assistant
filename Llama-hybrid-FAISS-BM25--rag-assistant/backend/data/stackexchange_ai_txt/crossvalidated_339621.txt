Multi step forecasts with Machine learning models

I have a dataset of weekly sale on which I applied ANN, KNN, CART and SVR to generate multi-step ahead forecasts. I directly used the corresponding packages in R. Is this methodology correct? I came across a paper by Prof. Markidakis in which they have used different approaches to generate multi-step ahead forecasts for Machine Learning models. Do I have to use one of the approaches(Direct forecasting, recursive forecasting, Multi neural network forecasting) approaches?
