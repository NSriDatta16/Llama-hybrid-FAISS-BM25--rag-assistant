You almost got it right. The key is: you usually don't do anything with the CV models except to make decisions. Afterwards, you would train a final model on all folds. Regarding your first comment: Not sure if I got your idea. The typical reasoning is like this: For m parameter combinations, I calculate the CV AUC (= average AUC over all folds). Then, a good candidate model would use the parameter combination with the best CV AUC. Regarding your second comment: No (due to different reasons). For instance: What is the null hypothesis? (It is not clear). Secondly: The AUC values of different folds are highly dependent, invalidating the basic assumption of most statistical tests.
