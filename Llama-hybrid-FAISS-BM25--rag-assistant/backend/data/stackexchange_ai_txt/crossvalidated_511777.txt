Why do OLS and logistic regression coefficients have opposite sign?

I have data $y$ which is the rate of success in $n$ trials. I also have covariates $X$ that I want to regress against $y$ to understand the relationship between them. I tried 2 different approaches. The first is to take the log of $y$ and apply OLS regression. The second is to apply logistic regression to $y$ directly. I noticed that one theoretically important coefficient, call it $x_0$ , is highly significant in both models but in OLS it is estimated as a strong negative effect and in logistic regression it is a small but positive effect. How is this possible? The variable is binary and I am comparing the standardized coefficients from both models. My assumption is that $x_0$ either increases the rate or not and it should be of the same sign in both models. UPDATE When my only regressor is $x_0$ this doesn't happen, it's only when I add the other covariates (of which there is about $200$ ). I have pasted the output of the full models below, excluding the estimates of the other covariates.
