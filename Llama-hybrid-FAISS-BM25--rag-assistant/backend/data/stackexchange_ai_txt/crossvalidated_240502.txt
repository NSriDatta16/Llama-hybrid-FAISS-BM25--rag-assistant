There are many issues to be discussed. I would recommend you to review a textbook or other resources about Econometrics. I will give some guidance on what to study there. 1) Diagnostic of the model : the linear econometric model rely on assumptions that should be checked in order to assess the quality of the estimates. You should for example check whether the residuals are homoscedastic (constant variance throughout time) and whether they are independent (absence of serial correlation). The plot of the residuals of your model, plot(residuals(model)) , reveals a pattern that is not captured by the model. This may lead to violation of the assumptions mentioned above. The package lmtest implements some of the test statistics that you may use to make a diagnostic of the model. 2) Model selection : Except for the variable clicks , the remaining explanatory variables are not significant at the 5% significance level ($p$-values greater than 0.05). Maybe you should reconsider the choice of your model. 3) The test statistic for the significance of all the regressors except the intercept concludes that the regressors are jointly significant, $F=31.34$ with $p$-value close to zero. This result is in contrast with the fact that the variables are individually not significant. As discussed for example here , this may be caused by the presence of multicollinearity across the regressors; this would be a violation of the assumption of uncorrelated regressors. 3) We usually refer to the fitted values; i.e., the values estimated for the in-sample observations as predictions ; while the term forecasts refers to out-of-sample or future forecasts. You mention forecasting in your question, but the values that you obtain by means of predict are the fitted values (in-sample). You can display them as follows: plot(cbind(dt[,"rev"], a), plot.type="single", type="n") lines(dt[,"rev"]) pred It may be illuminating to check that the output from predict can be obtained in this other ways: # matrix of regressors multiplied by the vector of estimated coefficients cbind(1, dt[,c("clicks", "displays", "sales")]) %*% coef(model) # dependent variable minus the residuals of the model dt[,"rev"] - residuals(model) If you are interested in forecasts you need to know future values of the regressors variables, then you can obtain the forecasts as follows: matrix_of_future_regressor_variables %*% coef(model) . 4) Dynamic model : It may happen that changes in the explanatory variable have an effect on the dependent variable only after a few periods; i.e., a change in the variable clicks at time $t$ may not have an on rev at the very time $t$, but for example $t+1$. The context of the data may suggest you whether this may be possible. You can conduct a cross-correlation analysis in order to check this guess. My comment to this post gives some links to other posts or sites discussing this. You may also be interested in the package dynlm . 5) The regression model that you use can be useful in order to get a better understanding of the observed data and the relationships across the variables (or the absence of relationship). You can use it to test your theory or hypothesis. However, if you are interested only in getting short-term forecasts (out-of-sample) for the dependent variable, the you may consider using a time series model , for example ARIMA or structural time series models.
