if the div has set width all you need is .myDiv { text-align:center; } Also listen to garry's comment. under no circumstances use inline css. Also another dirty fix for this in case you have other stuff in the div to centre: you can always: $('.youParagraph or .otherContent').wrap(''); Obviously do not practice this if you work within a large team and separation of concerns is an issue. I hope this helped.
