According to http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/v3/reference.html the events now supported are: dragstart drag dragend click dblclick rightclick tilesloaded idle bounds_changed resize center_changed zoom_changed maptypeid_changed so tilesloaded still exists. moveend is now center_changed , although maybe not exactly the same, it might meet your needs. and load ?.... well two out of three ain't bad.
