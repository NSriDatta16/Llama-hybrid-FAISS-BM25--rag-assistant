Compounded relative font-sizes: a clean way to adopt the font-size of the child, not the parent element

For example, if I have: td { font-size: 1.3em } h2 { font-size: 2em } h3 { font-size: 1.6em } p { font-size: 1.2 } And I have headings/paragraphs inside my table-cells, I know that I can avoid compounding the font-sizes by the following: td h2, td h3, td p { font-size: 1em } Which would result in the headings/paragraphs in my table-cells having font-size of 1.3em (that of the td). But what I'm looking for is a nice, clean way for each child element to have it's original font-size, not that of the parent. I'd really like to avoid doing the following (and of course I'd like to avoid using px): td h2 { font-size: 1.54em } // 1.3 x 1.54 ~ 2 td h3 { font-size: 1.23em } // 1.3 x 1.23 ~ 1.6 td p { font-size: 0.92em } // 1.3 x 0.92 ~ 1.2 For anyone familiar with LESS , I'm using that, and thought I should be able to use it to do the calculations for me, e.g. Using accessors: td h2 { font-size: h2['font-size'] / td['font-size'] } This at least would use the original values to do the calculation but feels just as clumsy as the above and besides, it seems LESS no longer supports accessors anyway. This seems so simple in concept, I feel like the answer's staring me in the face, but I've been banging my head against this for a while and can't find the answer anywhere.
