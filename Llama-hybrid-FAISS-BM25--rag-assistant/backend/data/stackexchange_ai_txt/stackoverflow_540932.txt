Personally, in this case, I would use the structure you described and use the database as a dumb storage mechanism. I'm fan of putting these complex and dependend constraints into the application layer. I think the only way to enforce these constraints without building new tables for every question with foreign keys to others, is to use the T-SQL stuff or other vendor specific mechanisms to build database triggers to enforce these constraints. At an application level you got so much more possibilities and it is easier to port, so I would prefer that option. I hope this will help you in finding a strategy for your app.
