You can 'cheat' using Python's behavior for default arguments. Default arguments are only evaluated once; they get reused for every call of the function. >>> def testFunction(persistent_dict={'a': 0}): ... persistent_dict['a'] += 1 ... print persistent_dict['a'] ... >>> testFunction() 1 >>> testFunction() 2 This isn't the most elegant solution; if someone calls the function and passes in a parameter it will override the default, which probably isn't what you want. If you just want a quick and dirty way to get the results, that will work. If you're doing something more complicated it might be better to factor it out into a class like S. Lott mentioned. EDIT: Renamed the dictionary so it wouldn't hide the builtin dict as per the comment below.
