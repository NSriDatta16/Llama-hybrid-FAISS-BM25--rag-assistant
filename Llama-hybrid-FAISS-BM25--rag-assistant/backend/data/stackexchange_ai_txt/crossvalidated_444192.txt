How can I combine different principal components into one index?

I'm a sport scientist working in football. I have a large number of variables describing match performance. I ran a PCA in order to reduce the number of variables and I obtained 3 principal components. I'd like to obtain only one index describing match performance in football. Is it possible to combine the 3 principal components I obtained? I read that there are 2 possible ways to do it: Re-running a PCA on the new factors obtained Multiplying the new factors with the variance explained. An example: PC1 explains 46% of the variance (0.46), PC2 30% (0.30) and PC3 12% (0.12). The total index will be calculated: Performance index= 0.46*PC1 + 0.30*PC2 + 0.12*PC3. Are those two solutions appropriate? If not, is there a way to combine different components?
