Spring is a good choice. Check out the Spring security module. It's based on aspect-oriented programming ideas. Looks like Spring does support GWT. It's relatively new (May 2010). If you're rusty with Java, you might want to minimize the new technologies you introduce at one time. Java's an object oriented language, so you can write the objects you need to model your game and get them running without any UI or database at all. That would allow you to focus on the game, the objects, and the use cases without getting wrapped around the axle with UI, security, persistence, etc. Once you have that sorted out and fully tested you can turn your attention to the other features: persistence, UI, security, etc. Maybe you can try basic authentication/authorization before you dive into Spring Security. If you bite off too much at once you'll never get this done. Take small steps.
