Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) tool, which runs on macos . It is used for creating apps for macOS ( macos ), iOS ( ios ), iPadOS ( ipados ),watchOS ( watch-os ) and tvOS ( tvos ) platforms. This tag should be used only for questions about the Xcode tool itself, not for programming questions for which you happen be using Xcode - if your question would stay the same if you used nano and make for writing your program, avoid adding this tag. For macOS programming questions, use the macos or cocoa tag. For iOS programming questions, use the ios or cocoa-touch tags. For Apple Watch programming questions, use the watchkit , watch-os or watch-os-2 tags. For questions about the Objective-C language and its features, use the objective-c tag. For questions about the Swift language and its features, use the swift tag.
