I would create a reporting database that was organized into a star schema. The membership dimension would be arranged temporally, so that there would be different rows for the same member at different points in time. That way different rows in the fact table could pertain to different points in history. Then I would create update procedures for updating the reporting database periodically, say one a week, from the main database. This is where the main work would come. Then, I would drive the reports off the reporting database. It's pretty easy to make a star schema do the same things a pivot table does. If necessary, I'd get some kind of OLAP tool to sit in front of the reporting database. This is a lot of work, but it would pay off over time.
