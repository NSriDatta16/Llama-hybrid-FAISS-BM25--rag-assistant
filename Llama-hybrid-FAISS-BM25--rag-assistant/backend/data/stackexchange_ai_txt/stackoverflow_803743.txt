VSTO Word 2007: How can a control be programmatically moved above/below the range of an existing control?

I am developing a Word 2007 document template with VSTO. The document has several RichTextContentControls and there is a visible ActionsPane with a treeview control where the nodes of the treeview are the names of the RichTextContentControls. Users can re-order nodes by dragging/dropping nodes to new locations in the treeview. As nodes are dropped, the corresponding RichTextContentControls should be re-ordered according the new node locations. I am able to find the Range of the control that the new control is supposed to be moved above of. Now I only need to find a way to simply...move the control to this new location. How can I move a control above/below a range?
