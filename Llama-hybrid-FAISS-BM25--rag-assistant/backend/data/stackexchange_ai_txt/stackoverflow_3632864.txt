This is a browser rendering "issue". You can replicate it using Firebug. Notice if you scroll down the page when there is a lot of content and you hide the first content by setting the css property to display:none (basically what it is animated to do). Then the page will automatically jump to the top. One option is to store the current scroll position pre-animation and then scroll to that position once the animation finishes, although this is quite ugly. The other option is to restrict the height of your content to be less than the average page size, you would then have the scrollbar on the active content rather than the whole screen. IMHO, either way it's not going to look nice. If I were a designer I would suggest a design rethink. If you are going to have large amounts of information I wouldn't be sticking it in an auto changing accordion.
