It looks like the files consist of discrete values that are compared. So what you want is a measure of closeness. One common statistical measure is mean square error (the average of the squared deviation for the number in the test file to the one in the control file. You could then pick a threshold C such that you would call the part good if the MSE is less than C and bad if it is greater.
