Feature selection clustering customer segmentation

Based on customer data I want to perform a clustering using different clustering algorithms (K-Means, Expectation Maximization, etc.) in R. The most attributes were engineered pursuing the goal to be basically meaningful for a customer segmentation. Without feature selection, the results are very poor regarding evaluation criteria like ASW, BSS, WSS, etc. My question now is whether I need to do a feature selection technique (wrapper/filter) or just select the features I think are most valuable for segmenting the customers. I found very different sources regarding this issue. The most authors say the features have to be selected concerning the business objective. Other sources propose feature selection methods for unsupervised learning. Is that really useful for a customer segmentation or is it only needed for image segmentation for instance? My opinion is: Attributes might be economic valuable even so not useful for the clustering process and vice versa. This would mean I select manually the features. I performed already a PCA which resulted also in poor results regarding clustering evaluation criteria. Therefore I obviously have to select only a few attributes in order to obtain a clear and stable clustering.
