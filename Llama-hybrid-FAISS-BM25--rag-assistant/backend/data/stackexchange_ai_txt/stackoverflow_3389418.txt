This is the way Word works. Adding a CustomDictionary will not trigger it to be used right away, there are only a few way ways to trigger it. One of which is the Proofing dialog (i.e. you don't have to click "Recheck Document", you just need to click "OK" and it will recheck). Another trigger is to manually type in text and then a seperator (like a space or paragraph). Yet another trigger is the Spell Check dialog. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any really good options I can see. But here's a bad option, which I haven't tried. (Note: SendKeys doesn't work well on Vista/7, there is a replacement out there). After you've added your custom dictionary, bring up the proofing dialog and then programmatically click OK. Again, I haven't tried it really, so I'm not sure if this will produce the desired results.
