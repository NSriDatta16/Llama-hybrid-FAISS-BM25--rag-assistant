We really need to know more about your situation! Are your data an iid sample, a time series, or some other? Comments below assume the iid situation. The 50% quantile (the median) have variance scaling as the mean, that is, with $\sqrt(n)$. The 99% quantile can be very different, dependent on the sample size. If the sample size is really huge (many thousands), then it will scale likewise. For small $n$, say $N=100$, that quantile is an extreme, and we need extreme order statistics theory to approximate its distribution. Distribution theory for extreme order statistics depends on the form of the tail of the distribution, so you will need to study that. Specifically, it depends on the so-called tail coefficient, so you need to estimate that. If you can give more information, maybe we can help more.
