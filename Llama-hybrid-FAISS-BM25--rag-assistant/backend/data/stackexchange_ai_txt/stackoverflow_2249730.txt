Thank you all for your answers. I've managed to come up with my own solution. The code is down below. There are no "lines" yet, but I'll get around to it oneday... Label l = (Label)sender; foreach (Control control in Canvas.Controls) { if (l.Location.X > control.Location.X + control.Size.Width && l.Location.X control.Location.X - l.Size.Width - 5) l.Location = new Point(control.Location.X - l.Size.Width - 5, l.Location.Y); else if (l.Location.Y > control.Location.Y + control.Size.Height && l.Location.Y control.Location.Y - control.Size.Height - 5) l.Location = new Point(l.Location.X, l.Location.Y - 5); this.Update(); } The above code must be placed inside the Control_MouseMove Event, and ofcourse, you still need your own code that actually moves the controls. The code above will snap the control you're dragging 5 pixels to the right, left, top or bottom of the nearest control.
