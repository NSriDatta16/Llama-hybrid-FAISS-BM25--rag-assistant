Agreed, it can take a bit of time to put together code that leverages performance counters. However, last time I did this I wrapped it all up in a nice reusable class. It made it much simpler for me to use perf counters throughout my code base with minimal friction. The end result was well worth it to me, given the tooling that exists on top of perf counters (perfmon is a big boon).
