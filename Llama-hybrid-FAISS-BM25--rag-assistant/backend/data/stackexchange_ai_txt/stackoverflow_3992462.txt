I think the reasoning in part is that +=1 is only one more character, and ++ is used pretty heavily in the collections code for concatenation. So it keeps the code cleaner. Also, Scala encourages immutable variables, and ++ is intrinsically a mutating operation. If you require += , at least you can force all your mutations to go through a common assignment procedure (e.g. def a_= ).
