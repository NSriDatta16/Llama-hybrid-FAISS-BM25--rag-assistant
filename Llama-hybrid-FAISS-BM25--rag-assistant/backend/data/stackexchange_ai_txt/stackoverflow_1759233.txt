Specializing this to OpenGL fragment shader debugging, which is very opaque. Dumbing stuff down is good and necessary, but checking the output is trickier than regular application programming, so you need some tricks: Render different parts in r,g,b, using step() if you need to check precise value changes. (Good for detecting floating point errors such as 1.001 or -0.001) Learn to interpret rgb as a normalized xyz vector. Remove texture samples, plot texture coordinates as colors. Consider rendering different variables in different parts of the screen and have a free-floating camera.
