How to chain/nest XSL Transforms in .NET

Context: .NET Framework 3.5 I realize how I can perform a single XML transformation using XSLT, but didn't find any good examples on chaining XML transformations. Input: - XML document as XPathDocument. - File paths to multiple XSL files. Expected output: - preferably XPathDocument/IXPathNavigable, representing the XML with all transformations applied, one by one. Example scenario : input xml: xsl-1: .xsl that adds as a child of the doc element. xsl-2: .xsl that adds as a child of the doc element. Expected result Goals Leverage the forward only nature of XPathDocument/IXPathNavigable or better. Avoid loading entire document in memory.
