I have solved this, though not as elegantly as I had hoped. All TextBoxFor had to be changed to TextBox along with the addtional changes needed with doing this. The names then were correctly generated and I could move on. This did break the ability for the validation message to appear next to the field, though ValidationSummary still does work. I will be working on fixing that later on and post code samples and a solution on my website.
