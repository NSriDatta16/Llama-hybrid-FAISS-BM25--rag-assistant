Your Model is the data structure that your program uses. The View is the part that interacts with the screen or the next level up. The Controller generally processes data between the model and view MVC structures are often nested, so a "Model" or "View" may contain its own MVC (Think of a component on the screen. You may just fill it with a string, but behind the scenes the code of the component draws its own little view, has it's own little model (the string you pass in) and has a little controller drawing the data onto the view. In Rails, the roles of the model, view and controller are well-defined by the framework, any tutorial will point out the three components as it walks you through the files it created. In other systems, those pieces may be harder to identify. Also, MVC is not "Perfect", just keep in mind that there are valid alternatives, but it's a good way to start organizing.
