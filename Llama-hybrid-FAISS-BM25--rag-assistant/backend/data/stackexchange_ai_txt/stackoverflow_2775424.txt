How to select multiple nodes in single for-eachin XSLT

I am trying to learn XSLT but I work best by example. I want to perform a trivial schema to schema transformation. How do I perform this transformation in only one pass (my current solution uses two passes and loses the original order of customers)? From: Donald Hong Kong 72 Jim Wales 22 Albert France 51 To : Donald Hong Kong 72 bad Jim Wales 22 good Albert France 51 good I already solved this a bad way (I lose the order of customers and I think that I have to parse the file multiple times: good bad Please can someone help me out with the correct XSLT construct where I only have to use a single parse (only one for-each)? Thanks, Chris
