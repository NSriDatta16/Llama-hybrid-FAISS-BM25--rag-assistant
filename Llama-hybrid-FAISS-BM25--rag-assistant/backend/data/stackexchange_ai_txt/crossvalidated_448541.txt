This is documented. I suggest reading the vignette on "basics", where EMMs are described: EMMs defined The reference grid consists of combinations of predictors. The predictions for the reference grid are each linear combinations of the regression coefficients. You can find out what these are by doing something like this: rg Each row corresponds to one prediction. EMMs are averages of these predictions, and their estimates are thus obtained by averaging together appropriate rows of the above. You may find out what these are via: emm Then the SEs are obtained using the formulas in the question: vcov.emm I'll leave it to you to translate all this into your own context.
