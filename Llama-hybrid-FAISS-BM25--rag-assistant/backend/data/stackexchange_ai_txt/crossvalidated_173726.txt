What version of the AIC should be used in total least squares regression?

If we are carrying out a regression and we have errors in both the x-s and y-s, we can estimate the parameter values using the total least squares method. In that case, I assume we shouldn't use the AIC or AICc, as they are for use where the x-s are deterministic and there are errors in the y-s. My question is: What version of the AIC, if there is one, should be used where we have errors in both the x-s and y-s, and where we've calibrated the models using total least squares? I did several searches on Google but didn't come up with anything that was the least bit encouraging!
