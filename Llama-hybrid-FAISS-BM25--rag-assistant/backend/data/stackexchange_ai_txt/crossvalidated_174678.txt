Whatever your software is, you should be able to calculate day of the month 1 to 31 day of month measured from the end of the month (so 28, 27, 26 February in non-leap years would be -1, -2, -3) day of the week (using whatever convention appeals about which day starts a week) 1 to 7. Then plot any or all of those variables -- on the $x$ axis, conventionally -- and the raw data (or the residuals from some model that sweeps out other variations, at least roughly) -- on the $y$ axis, conventionally. Having hourly data as well is naturally a complication. Without knowing more substantive details than you give (essentially none), there are many possibilities. In principle hourly data can clearly also be plotted against time of month or time of week. Whether daily cycles should be averaged out is a judgment call. Similarly without substantive detail it is difficult to advise on the role of dates of importance in business, religious and national holidays, etc. These techniques are simple but often effective and surprisingly often neglected. Even moderately experienced workers with time series often have just one graphical idea, to plot against calendar date or date-time as a single series. See also literature on cycle plots (other names exist). A friendly way in is Naomi B. Robbins' Introduction to cycle plots . She has various examples of weekly cycles. Although focused on detecting seasonal variation, my paper Graphs for all seasons may also be suggested.
