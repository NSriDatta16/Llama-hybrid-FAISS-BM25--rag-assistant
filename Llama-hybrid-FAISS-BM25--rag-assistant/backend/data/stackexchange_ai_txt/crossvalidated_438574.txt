Consistency of ADL/ARDL/ARIMAX coefficients

Enders in Applied Econometric Time Series (4th edition, p.282) has following statement about consistency of coefficients in ARDL models: "For the coefficients of C(L) to be unbiased estimates of the impact effects of {zt} on the {yt} sequence, zt must be uncorrelated with {t} at all leads and lags." To clarify this statement, the model is this: yt = a0 + A(L)ytâˆ’1 + C(L)zt + t and hence yt is our dependent variable and zt our exogenous variable. It is obvious that concurrent correlation would cause bias. However, I canont figure out analytically why zt being correlated with leads or lags of t (i.e. not not concurrently) would on its own cause bias. Moreover, some simulation exercises seem to suggest no problems with consistency. Is it possible he means any leads or lags included in actual equation (i.e. if zt-1 is included, ztmust not be correlated with t-1)? Thanks for any answers.
