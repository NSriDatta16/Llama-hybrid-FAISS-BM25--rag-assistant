It all depends of course. It will always have an impact. But if we are talking about an application running on the same server as the database, and columns that each contain some bytes, the impact should not be to important. On the other hand, if we are talking about a client running over a network to access a database, and extracting 190 extra columns like (string*255) then you are in big trouble if your network administrator can catch you alive. In either case, it's not very elegant to query so many needless columns. Why not adapt your query so that is only asks for the needed columns. I presume you use "select * from ..." which generates an other problem: when someone changes the view (adds columns or deletes columns) your program will block.
