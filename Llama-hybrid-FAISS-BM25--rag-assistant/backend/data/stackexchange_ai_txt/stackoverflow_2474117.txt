How to get a product's image in Magento?

I'm running on version 1.3.2.1, but on my client's server they had Magento 1.3.0 so my previous code to display images for my local copy, echo $this->helper('catalog/image')->init($_product)->resize(163, 100); , does not work on the client's installation. Looking at the results returned by their Magento, version 1.3.0 actually returns a URL although it points to the skin's media folder. Is there a way to get the absolute image path for the image? Or should I make changes somewhere else that would tell Magento that the media directory should be on the root?
