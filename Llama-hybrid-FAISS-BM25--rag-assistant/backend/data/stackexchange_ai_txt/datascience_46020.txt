How to elegantly caclulate probability distribution parameters for a particular random variable given some observed data?

I am using bnlearn package and R to learn Bayesian Network structure and also fit it using Maximum Likelihood estimation(MLE). bn.fit uses MLE to learn[as i understand] a generalized probability distribution for all data. However, it is required to obtain probability distribution for a particular variables given observed (evidence) data from other variables. There one straighforward answer is to sample required variable for given evidence variables and fit probability distribution from that data. I am new to bnlearn package and Bayes Nets and thinking of maybe there is more natural way of obtatining those probability distribution parameters?
