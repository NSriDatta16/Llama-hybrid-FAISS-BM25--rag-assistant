Interpreting vertical and horizontal parts of ROC curve

It's not clear to me how I can interpret vertical and horizontal parts of the ROC curve. What important information can I gain from this? This is a text from the book "Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning" by Robert Monarch: In this example, we can see that the line of the ROC curve is near-vertical for the first 20%. This tells us that for the 20% most confident predictions, we are almost 100% accurate. The ROC curve is almost horizontal at 1.0 for the final 30%. This tells us that by the time we get to the 30% least most confident predictions for a label, there are few very items with that label remaining.
