Does a seasonal time series imply a stationary or a non stationary time series

If I have a time series that has got seasonality, does that automatically make the series non stationary? My intuition (probably off) is that it does not. Seasonality means that the series goes up and down around a constant value....something like a sine wave. So by this logic a time series with seasonality is a (weakly) stationary series (constant mean). Is this wrong? Why?
