Although I don't remember all the details of my research for code coverage tools, I seem to remember the following about gcov and covtool: They require custom modifications to your build system They need custom compiler flags and/or link steps They both provide minimal output and formatting We needed support for Windows/Linux and gcc/MSVC and settled on BullseyeCoverage which is commercial and non-free. We estimated that it would cost us more, in money, to change our build system to use the free products than it would to pay for a BullseyeCoverage license. Their support was great and responsive and I was very pleased with the quality of the tool. Some benefits: Great query support both in command line and GUI form Required no changes to our build system Had minimal impact on both compile time and run time Provides tools to integrate with build bots such as CruiseControl and Hudson Nice GUI for visualization and navigation of coverage results
