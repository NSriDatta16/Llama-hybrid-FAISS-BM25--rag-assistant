No, I would not consider that to be valid. The problem is that the mean of the true values in each category is not likely to be the midpoint. For example, there are probably many more people who would answer 10 hours than one hour - so the average hours worked will be more than 5.5, but you are assuming that the mean is 5.5. Hence your estimate will be biased. What you could do is consider it to be a scale with a weird non-linear transformation - saying something like "On a scale where 1 = 1 to 10, 2 = 11-20 ... the mean score was 1.8." But if you only have three categories, you can just say "22% of people worked 1-10 hours, 43% worked 11-20 hours ..." Unless there's a very good reason that you need a mean, I would do that.
