Rayne, I used to work on DOE classified systems that could never touch the public internet. There is a very easy way to do this as mentioned. Just use the ISO as a repo, and for my example to work, it needs to be a DVD image. (The way around that using disk {1,2,3} is to copy the files from each disk onto the local disk or a storage device) You will need to install createrepo which for me involved two dependencies. createrepo deltarpm python-deltarpm mkdir -p /mnt/iso/rhel54 mount -o loop /path/to/rhel5.4.iso /mnt/iso/rhel54 cd /mnt/iso createrepo . It will look like this: [root@hostname iso]# createrepo . 44/20586 - rhel54/HighAvailability/Packages/PyQt4-4.6.2-8.el6.x86_64.rpm Create /etc/yum.repos.d/rayne.repo and add [Rayne-repo] baseurl=file:///mnt/iso/ enabled=1 gpgcheck=0 Then run yum update The update from RHEL 5.1 to RHEL 5.4 is not a small one, not like Windows patches. You can read the release notes, but you will end up with a newer kernel in the end and a ton of updates to the packages. I have not upgraded from 5.X to 5.Y+3 before, it's always been incremental (5.1 to 5.2). At any rate, this should work for you.
