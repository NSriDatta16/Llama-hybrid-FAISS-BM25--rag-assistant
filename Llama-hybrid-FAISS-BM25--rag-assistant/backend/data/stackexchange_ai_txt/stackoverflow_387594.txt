C# Open Source Project Namespace

I am considering releasing one of my class libraries written in C# as open source. Before doing that, I am trying to do some refactoring so that it meets the demands of the general public :) I wonder what would be the best namespace schema to use? Basically, I see the following options: namespace MyTool : This just doesn't really look like organized for me. I mean, (almost) all the namespaces in the .NET Framework are prefixed with System so I guess it is not really a standard way to do it. namespace MyOrganization.MyTool : The problem with that there is just simply no "MyOrganization". It is written in my spare time. namespace MyName.MyTool : I would prefer something more humble. I mean really, I don't want to have my name in the namespace. Now there are a couple of related questions on Stackoverflow already, like this and this , but none of them really answer my question. Any suggestions?
