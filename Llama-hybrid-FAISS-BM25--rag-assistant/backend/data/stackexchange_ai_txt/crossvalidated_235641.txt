Denote the coefficient for $b$ by $\beta$ and the model's intercept by $\alpha$. We let group $a$ be the reference level. Logistic regression fits the model: $logit(\pi(x)) = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_p x_p$ Where $logit(\pi(x)) = log(\frac{\pi(x)}{1-\pi(x)}) = log(odds(\pi(x)))$ Our reference group $a$ has the fit: $logit(\pi(a)) = \alpha$ Hence, the odds of success for an individual from group $a$ is given by $odds(\pi(a)) = e^\alpha$ While our group $b$ with coefficient $\beta$ has the fit: $logit(\pi(b)) =\alpha + \beta$ and so in the same way as above, we find the odds for group $b$ by taking the exponential of both sides: $odds(\pi(b)) = e^{\alpha + \beta} = e^\alpha \times e^\beta = odds(\pi(a))\times e^\beta$ Hence, under your model, the odds for group $b$ are $e^\beta$ times the odds for group $a$. It follows that if $\beta$ is positive, then $e^\beta>1$ and so the odds for group $b$ will be larger than group $a$. On the other hand, if $\beta$ is negative, then $e^\beta
