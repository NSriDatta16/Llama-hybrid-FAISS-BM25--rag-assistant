1) Is this approach (MANOVA followed by series of ANOVA) justified? Are there strict assumptions before we could take this path? In the example data you provide, there is no correlation between A, B, and C. Hence, a MANOVA seems beside the point. Unless you are interested in the relationship between A, B, and C, or have some reason to think that the three will be somehow correlated, just skip to the ANOVA. 2) If yes, should there be some kind of correction for the second step, i.e. series of ANOVAs for individual DVs (multiple-comparisons)? What kind of correction? No. Likely not. 3) What is the recommended approach for problems like this with multiple DVs? Well, if you know a relationship between them, or know that they will all be influenced by, say, subject, you have two possible options. If you know the relationship between them, try something like Structural Equation Modeling. If there is some reason to suspect that each metric will be influenced in the same way by subject, then you need to control for this. Might I recommend you see the following paper, as it addresses most of your questions: H. J. Keselman, Carl J. Huberty, Lisa M. Lix, Stephen Olejnik, Robert A. Cribbie, Barbara Donahue, Rhonda K. Kowalchuk, Laureen L. Lowman, Martha D. Petoskey, Joanne C. Keselman and Joel R. Levin. 1998.
