A tab bar is actually pretty easy to understand, once you know the organization. You have a tab bar controller, into which you can put any number of view controllers. As the tabs are pressed the view controller for that tab will be made active and visible. The tricky thing to understand is, that NavigationControllers are also ViewControllers. So if you want navigation for any one tab, you have to add a navigation controller which holds the view controller you use for display. Although you can do tab bar controllers in IB, this is the one area where I think starting by programming them from scratch makes a ton of sense, because you better understand how they are laid out.
