I don't think either is more or less relevant or robust for five-point Likert-type scales. The key consideration is more focused on whether any model selection has occurred. Overall, the two methods are fairly different in terms of how they approach importance but can result in similar results as is discussed by Groemping here . The Shapley/Dominance/LMG method as discussed by Groemping assumes model selection has been completed. Thus, LMG method assumes the helping behaviors used as features/predictors are valid predictors and will assign non-zero importance to all features. The PMVD and RF methods discussed by Groemping do not assume such selection has taken place and will assign zero importance to truly non-relevant features. This latter approach might fit your case better as it sounds like no other modeling has been completed based on your description. Reference: Gr√∂mping, U. (2009). Variable importance assessment in regression: linear regression versus random forest. The American Statistician, 63(4) , 308-319.
