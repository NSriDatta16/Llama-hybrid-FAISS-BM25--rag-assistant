It's possible that you don't have enough data to reliably use an SVM. That, and, in my experience, they tend to perform best with high-dimensional data (e.g., 1000s of variables). How many predictor variable are you working with? As a more direct answer to your p-value question, you should look at what the p-value is actually associated with--are you saying that it's associated with the accuracy statistic, or something else?
