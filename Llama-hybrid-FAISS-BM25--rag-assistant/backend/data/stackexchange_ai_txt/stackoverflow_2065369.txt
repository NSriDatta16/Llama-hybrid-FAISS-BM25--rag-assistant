I had the same issue after rebuilding my computer. After searching for answers, I found this thread. The solution for me was the hotfix found on MSDN, noted by a user in this thread. http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/KB957912/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1796 --Notable discussion-- MSDN does also have a great topic discussion, also noted by a user in this thread, with some workaround and a link to the patch. social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vsdebug/thread/f3fcb4fb-8a08-4fa0-8d58-9ed6f3eb1193 I have seen a post where the following line of code was placed at the beginning of Page_Load(...) method. Personally this was not an option for me, but if you are comfortable with this being a fix for your problem and it works... Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); My setup: - Windows XP pro - Pentium 4 3.0GHz HyperThreaded - VS 2008 Professional Edition - .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 - SQL Server 2008 - Development language: c#
