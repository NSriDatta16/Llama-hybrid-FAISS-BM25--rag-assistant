An automatic system for finding synonyms using word embeddings is not possible. Word embeddings find co-occurrence. For example, "good" and "bad" co-occur together in a corpus, thus are near each other in the embedding space. However, "good" and "bad" are antonyms. A copilot system could work. Word embeddings can find a set of candidate synonyms by finding the nearest words as measured by a distance metric. Then other methods (e.g., a person) can select amongst the candidates.
