Your second error is because you don't have a directory called /flvs/ . Create that in the same directory as your executing script and you'll be golden. As for your first error, it sounds like YouTube could be blocking your server. Try setting a user agent before making the request: ini_set('user_agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9'); (I found that snippet online in lieu of taking the time to write my own. Just saying.) Also, it doesn't look like you're passing any parameters ( ?video_id=&t= ). Either the phptube plugin you're using is jacked or you're not passing in correct values. What is your input? Hope this helps!
