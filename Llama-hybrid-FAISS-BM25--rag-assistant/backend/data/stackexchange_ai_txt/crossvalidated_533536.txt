To compare a biased with an unbiased estimate of $F(\cdot)$ , consider the case of a complement cdf, $$F(t)=\mathbb P(X\ge t)$$ which is strictly decreasing in $t\in(0,\tau)$ when $X$ is a continuous random variable with support $(0,\tau)$ . Then, given a sample $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ associated with the cdf $1-F(\cdot)$ the step function $$\hat F(t) =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb I_{x_i\ge t}$$ is unbiased, since $$\mathbb E_F[\mathbb I_{X_i\ge t}]=\mathbb P(X_i\ge t)=F(t)$$ Here is an illustration with $n=10$ points in the sample $\tau=1$ $F$ the complement cdf for the standard normal $M=10^5$ repetitions $100$ plots of $\hat F$ the graph of the average of the $M$ $\hat F$ 's (red) the graph of the true $F$ (blue) showing they are indistinguishable, i.e. the expectation of $\hat F$ is $F$ . In the opposite, if using the biased step function $$\hat F(t) =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \varphi(x_i)\mathbb I_{x_i\ge t}$$ instead, the bias is clear:
