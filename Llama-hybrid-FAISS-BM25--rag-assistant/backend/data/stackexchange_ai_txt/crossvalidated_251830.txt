Is probabilistic modeling the same thing as Bayesian modeling?

When titles, books, and posts refer to probabilistic modeling, coupled with it I usually see the word "Bayesian" near by and all around. If we were to think of this as a ven diagram, are they the same circle? Is Bayesian modeling within probabilistic modeling? What's the compliment of the intersection of Bayesian and probabilistic modeling ?
