The unit test framework will do what you want. You'll need to create a unit test that runs the function you want to call. Then, edit your test run configuration to enable code coverage. Finally, once you've run your unit test (which can be just a single line of code to execute a function), go to the "Code Coverage Results" window and select the "Show Code Coverage Color" option. The code that executed will be colored blue and the code that didn't execute will be colored red. Nifty, eh? Update In response to the comment about C++, I do believe that this functionality works with C++, but I've never used it. Try right-mouse clicking on the code that implements the function you want to test code coverage for. There should be an option that says "Create Unit Tests". Be sure to build the code before doing this.
