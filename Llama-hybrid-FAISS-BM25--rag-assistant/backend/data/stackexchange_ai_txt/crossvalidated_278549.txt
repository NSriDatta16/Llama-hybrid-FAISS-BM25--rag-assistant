R precision in operations

If you try to calculate the difference between (9.1 - 8.9) - (6.9-6.7) in R, you'll get > (9.1 - 8.9) - (6.9-6.7) [1] -8.881784e-16 I found this when I was trying to calculate ranks considering ties as average rank but I saw that because of precision issue, it don't consider the tie. A Expected result [1] 8.0 1.0 3.5 5.5 7.0 2.0 3.5 5.5
