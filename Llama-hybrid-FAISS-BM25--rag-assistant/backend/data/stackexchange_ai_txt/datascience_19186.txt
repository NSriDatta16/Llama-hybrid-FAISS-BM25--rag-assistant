Can training label confidence be used to improve prediction accuracy?

I have training data that is labelled with binary values. I also have collected the confidence of each of these labels i.e. 0.8 confidence would mean that 80% of the human labellers agree on that label. Is it possible to use this confidence data to improve the accuracy of my classifier? Would the following work? 1a) If the label is 0 and the confidence data for that label is 0.8 then give the training data a new label of 0.2 1b) If the label is 1 and the confidence data for that label is 0.8 then give the training data a new label of 0.8 2) Calculate the new label using this method for every entry in the training set 3) Treat the problem as a regression problem (where the labels range between 0 and 1) 4) Classify unlabelled data based on whether the new labels are above or below a specific value. i.e Give all predicted labels class 0 if below X and class 1 if above X. I am currently using a SVM with an RBF kernel for my model. Thanks in advance!
