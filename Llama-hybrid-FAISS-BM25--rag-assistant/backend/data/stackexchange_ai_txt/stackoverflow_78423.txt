Using a custom framework

The error I'm getting: in /Users/robert/Documents/funWithFrameworks/build/Debug-iphonesimulator/funWithFrameworks.framework/funWithFrameworks, can't link with a main executable Cliff notes: trying to include framework doesn't want to link More detail: I'm developing for a mobile device... hint, hint using Xcode and I'm trying to make my own custom framework which I can include from another application. So far, I've done the following: Create a new project; an iPhone OS window based app. Go to target info-> under packaging, change the wrapper extension from app to framework Go to Action->new build phase -> copy headers. Change roles of headers to 'public' From my application, I add the framework to the frameworks group.
