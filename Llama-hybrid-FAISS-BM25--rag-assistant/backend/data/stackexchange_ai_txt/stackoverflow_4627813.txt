Moving Objects Using Javascript

I want to make some interactions with some images on my site. I want to let the possibility to user of clicking on a image, holding it and then drag it everywhere he wants it on the page. Is this possible using only Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3? PS: I need it to run on iPhone Mobile Safari
