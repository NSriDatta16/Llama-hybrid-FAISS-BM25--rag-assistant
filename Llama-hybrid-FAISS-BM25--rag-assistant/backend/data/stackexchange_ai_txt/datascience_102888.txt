Why do we calculate the vector of a document by averaging the vectors of all the words?

I am trying to build a search engine to query a folder of documents. Tutorials online suggest that we should obtain the vector of a document by averaging the vectors of all the words, then compare similarity to the vector of the query. May I know how does the vector of all the words in the document retain the information of the words? Would it be better if i retrieved similar words of the query and checked if these words were in each document?
