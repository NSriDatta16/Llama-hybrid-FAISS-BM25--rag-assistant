Enable dropping a file onto a Ruby script

I'm creating a small ruby script to resize images and save them in a specified directory. I'd like the application to be as transparent as possible. Is it possible to allow file dropping onto my Ruby script in all platforms? For instance, the user drags a file onto the script, which then takes the file path as an argument and resizes the image accordingly -- No GUI, no console, etc..
