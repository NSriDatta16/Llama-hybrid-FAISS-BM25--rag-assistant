touchesBegan question in iphone sdk?

How do I code this so that that it detects which image was tapped first? In other words if one of them is tapped, but the other one was already hidden, i want it to play a different sound?? any ideas? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; NSLog(@"tag %@",touch); if([touch view] == test) { test.hidden=YES; [self playpopsound]; } else if([touch view] == test2){ test2.hidden=YES; [self playpopsound]; } }
