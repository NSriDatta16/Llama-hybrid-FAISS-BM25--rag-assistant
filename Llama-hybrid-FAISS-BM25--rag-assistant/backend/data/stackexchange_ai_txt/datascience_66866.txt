What is the main concept of using lexical,linguistic, semantic or syntactic approach in NLP for cyberbullying

I am really in need of some explanation, I am working on an NLP cyber-bullying detection tool which I will deploy to the web using Django framework, however, am stuck on some idea, can someone explain to me...What is the main concept of using lexical, linguistic, semantic or syntactic approach in (NLP) and how is applied in cyber-bullying or what are the step or why does people say I built this cyber-bullying system from a linguistic approach, I know POS-tagging is way of grouping word and look for dependency in other word, my idea of POS-tagging is a synonym of semantic because POS-tagging is a process linking words to it root and representation word in an understandable context correct me if wrong. I read an article where a paper tackled a project using a predictive analysis approach with feature extraction techniques, Naive Bayes for classification and to train the model, in the discussion they also spoke on how other team used the Semantics approach to classifier cyber-bullying. I know of data cleaning, tokenization stemming and most of feature extraction model, however, am stuck on the problem of approach which is what is the relevant on lexical, semantic or syntactic and how are they been approached.
