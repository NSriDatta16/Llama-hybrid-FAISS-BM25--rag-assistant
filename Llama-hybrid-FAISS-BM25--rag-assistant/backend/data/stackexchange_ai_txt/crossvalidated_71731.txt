Using JAGS for bayesian parameter estimation

I am using JAGS in R to construct a probabilistic graph model and estimate the corresponding parameters. The models is described as follows: model { for (i in 1:N) { # sample the hidden variable z[i] ~ dbeta(alpha+0.01,beta)T(0,0.9999) # determined relation lambda[i] where X[1:N] is the training samples, which are generated according to a Poisson distribution. The Poisson mean is also a random variable, which is denoted as mu*z . z is a hidden variable following a Beta distribution parametrized by variables alpha and beta . The parameters of this probabilistic model are mu , alpha and beta , and they follow Gamma distribution. I tested this model on a simulated set of data samples: library('rjags') N=5000 lambda=rbeta(N,0.2,0.3)*15 #alpha = 0.2,beta = 0.3 and mu = 15 X=rpois(N,lambda) jags = jags.model('poissontrunc.bugs',data = list('X' = X, 'N' = N), n.chains = 4, n.adapt = 1000) mcmc.samples The MCMC-based parameter estimation results are as follows: Empirical mean and standard deviation for each variable, plus standard error of the mean: Mean SD Naive SE Time-series SE alpha 951.13, 35.0186, 0.247619, 9.72810 beta 1013.24, 26.4553, 0.187068, 7.13232 mu 12.47, 0.3134, 0.002216, 0.08993 The sampling results give the right estimate of the true mu (12.47 vs. 15). However, for alpha and beta , it seems that the estimated values are severely biased (951.13 vs 0.2, 1013.24 vs 0.3). Even considering the variance of the sampling results, estimates for alpha and beta are still far from satisfaction. Is this a problem caused by any potential improper setting of the MCMC sampling, or perhaps MCMC is blocked within the local optimum region of a multi-modal conditional distribution in this case ?
