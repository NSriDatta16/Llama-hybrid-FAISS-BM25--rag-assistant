Good question! This might help: Let's say you have three countries: USA, Germany, and China. No ranking. Label Encoding turns the countries into numbers. For example, 1 (USA),2 (Germany), and 3 (China). If you don't One Hot Encode, the theory states (source: Sebastian Raschka "Machine Learning with Python"), that you create ordinalit y. In other words, USA is better than Germany and Germany is better than China. As you have no ranking (order), you don't want that. Thus, we One Hot Encode. Personally, I have tested this several times and only Label Encoded (not ranking features) with Logistic Regression and have NOT seen a difference . But I've only done it a few times. And, if an ML expert like Sebastian Raschka says we should One Hot Encode for non-ordinal numerical data than I trust him.
