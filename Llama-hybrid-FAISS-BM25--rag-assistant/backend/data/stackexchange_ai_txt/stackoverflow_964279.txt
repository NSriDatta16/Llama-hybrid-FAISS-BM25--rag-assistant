Neither, IMO. Fieldset combined with a list (or maybe even a table) is far more semantically correct. P is wrong plainly because a form just is not a paragraph. DIV has no semantic meaning whatsoever - it's just "part of something", so using it alone to contain the form makes no sense. Splitting by BR has no purpose, as you can just as well provide styling on your labels and/or input-fields to simulate the line break.
