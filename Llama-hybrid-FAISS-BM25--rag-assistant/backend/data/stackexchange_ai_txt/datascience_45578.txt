Why underfitting is called high bias and overfitting is called high variance?

I have been using terms like underfitting/overfitting and bias-variance tradeoff for quite some while in data science discussions and I understand that underfitting is associated with high bias and over fitting is associated with high variance. But what is the reason of such association or in terms of a model what is high bias and high variance, How can one understand it intuitively?
