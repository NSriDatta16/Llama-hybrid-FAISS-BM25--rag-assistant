Removing White Noise from ARIMA series

I'm a student using R to analyze inflation rate data for school. I've obtained a time series of monthly inflation rates. Using R's tseries library, I found an ARMA(1,1) model fit to the time series. Both the ar1 and ma1 terms are significant at alpha My question is given that the ARMA model is a linear combination of white noise, ar term, and ma term. Is there a way(using the ARMA fit) to obtain a series subtracting the white noise? I would like to see what the series looks like without white noise. I hope this is a reasonable question and my understanding is correct. Doing this in R would be easiest.
