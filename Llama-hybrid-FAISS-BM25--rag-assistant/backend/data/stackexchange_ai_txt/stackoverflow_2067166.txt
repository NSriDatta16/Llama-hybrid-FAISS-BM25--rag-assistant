Drawing a text along a path in QuartzCore

Say I have an array of points that form a line and a text. How can I go about drawing the text along this line in - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect of a UIView? I am able to draw the path without a problem. Is there a standard method that I overlooked or a framework that would allow me to draw the text along that path? Ideally I would like to do this using only QuartzCore/CoreGraphics. I tried calculating the width of each character and rotating every character. This kind of works, but I was wondering if there is a more elegant method.
