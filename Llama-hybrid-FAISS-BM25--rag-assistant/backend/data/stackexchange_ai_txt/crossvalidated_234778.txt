Is it possible to use machine learning techniques to find out underlying algorithm?

I am pretty new to machine learning. I understand that there are many machine learning algorithms to solve different types of problems. But suppose you are given a program with an unknown algorithm, and you can feed the program with many datasets and obtain the outputs, as well as error rates and other diagnostics. Is it possible that we can develop an algorithm that can learn from these datasets and outputs to find out or mimic the underlying algorithm? I apologize if any terms are used in a wrong way.
