The notice is telling you that a HTTP_REFERER isn't set. 'HTTP_REFERER' The address of the page (if any) which referred the user agent to the current page. This is set by the user agent. Not all user agents will set this, and some provide the ability to modify HTTP_REFERER as a feature. In short, it cannot really be trusted. http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php A quick search led to this, which provides a little more detail: http://www.electrictoolbox.com/php-http-referer-variable/ Update: You could try using a session variable. The variable could be a simple boolean, which is set to true if the splash page has been displayed, false otherwise. This would require some session handling on every page that may be an entry point to the website and/or every page where you'd want to display the splash. http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php Of course, this would only be viable for the duration of the session. So, you could use a cookie instead or with this approach. Personally, I would probably opt for the simple cookie approach, as this is just a splash. No need to add the overhead of sessions for something this simple.
