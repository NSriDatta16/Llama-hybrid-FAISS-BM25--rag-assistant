Pattern for retrieving complex object graphs with Repository Pattern with Entity Framework

We have an ASP.NET MVC site that uses Entity Framework abstractions with Repository and UnitOfWork patterns. What I'm wondering is how others have implemented navigation of complex object graphs with these patterns. Let me give an example from one of our controllers: var model = new EligibilityViewModel { Country = person.Pathway.Country.Name, Pathway = person.Pathway.Name, Answers = person.Answers.ToList(), ScoreResult = new ScoreResult(person.Score.Value), DpaText = person.Pathway.Country.Legal.DPA.Description, DpaQuestions = person.Pathway.Country.Legal.DPA.Questions, Terms = person.Pathway.Country.Legal.Terms, HowHearAboutUsOptions = person.Pathway.Referrers }; It's a registration process and pretty much everything hangs off the POCO class Person. In this case we're caching the person through the registration process. I've now started implementing the latter part of the registration process which requires access to data deeper in the object graph. Specifically DPA data which hangs off Legal inside Country. The code above is just mapping out the model information into a simpler format for the ViewModel. My question is do you consider this fairly deep navigation of the graph good practice or would you abstract out the retrieval of the objects further down the graph into repositories?
