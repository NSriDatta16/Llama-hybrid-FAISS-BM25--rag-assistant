Which versions of jQuery and jqModal you use? If you use jQuery 1.4.x you should verify whether the jqModal.js contain $() (for example {$()[t]("keypress",m)[t]("keydown",m)[t]("mousedown",m);} in jqModal.js ). This can not be used together with jQuery 1.4.x. To fix the problem replace $() to $(document) . UPDATED : After you post the link to site having the problem I could analyse the problem. If one clicks on "Save this Search" it will be loaded the div from http://camp.matrix6.com/matrix6studios/AssetSearch/Save?randomId=332557 . The results will be used as a dialog div for jqModal. Currently the div looks as following: Saving... Save Your Search Name Close How one can see the form element has onclick and onsubmit attributes which produce at the end the error. If you click inside of the form, you see the error because "Sys.Mvc.AsyncForm.handleClick(this, new Sys.UI.DomEvent(event));" could not be called. How you can see in http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/mvc/1.0/MicrosoftMvcAjax.debug.js (uncompressed version of the http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/mvc/1.0/MicrosoftMvcAjax.js which you use) it has Sys.Mvc.AsyncForm.handleSubmit but no Sys.Mvc.AsyncForm.handleClick function. It would be easy if you will use the MicrosoftMvcAjax.js from your current MVC project (probably MVC 2.0) because on the Microsoft Ajax CDN you would not find MVC 2.0. More better would be create the dialog with respect of jQuery only without any MVC controls. It is the main error, but there are some other small problems in your code. For example you should remove comma before '}' from the following code fragment $(function () { $("#accordion").accordion({ event: "mouseover", alwaysOpen: false, autoHeight:false, navigation: true, }); }); Next problem is: your code has two elements having id="jqmWindowContainer". Your code has lines in the middle of the HTML code. It is not allowed. The element should be moved inside of the . Moreover you include the code with and twice on one page which is also very bad. You should not load jqModal.js twice on the same page. If you move the code to the you can place it only once. I can continue with less important errors to hold XHTML 1.0 Strict which you use. For example you should place elements inside of and over and so on. I recommend you validate your page in http://validator.w3.org/ .
