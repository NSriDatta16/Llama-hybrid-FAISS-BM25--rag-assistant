UITableView: block cell dragging during reordering

I've a problem with UITableView. When I'm in editing mode i want to reorder the cell but e when I drag a cell at the bottom of the screen it's allowed to go down as much as the TableView height and down the last tableViewCell. I've only 4 cell and i want that when Im dragging a cell it's not allowed to go down after the fourth cell. Can Anyone help me?!?
