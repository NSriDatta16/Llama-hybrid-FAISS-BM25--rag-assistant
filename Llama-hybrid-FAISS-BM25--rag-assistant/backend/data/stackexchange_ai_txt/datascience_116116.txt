What is the best way to split small data?

I have dataset of 17-20 videos (5 minutes) each video representrepresents a different class (around 4 classes). I can'tcannot get more video because this was provided by the company. I'm planingI am planning to split the video path and then apply video capture to get the video frame as an image of each video then apply a CNN for classification. I know my data is small (couldthis could result in overfitoverfitting) how can I handle thatthis when I can'tcannot increase the number of videos ? train_data, extra_data = train_test_split(video_path, train_size=0.9, shuffle=False) #90 validation_data, test_data = train_test_split(extra_data, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False #10
