The likelihood maximization in the mixtures model is an issue in general. Some components cover most of the points while the rest sits on some points and runs to infinity. This is quite natural, indeed: this runs the likelihood to infinity (multiplication of some constants and some infinities). The situation can be avoided by using variational bayesian inference, implemented here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35362-variational-bayesian-inference-for-gaussian-mixture-model and explained here: http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~csatol/gep_tan/Bishop-CUED-2006.pdf - see slide 42.
