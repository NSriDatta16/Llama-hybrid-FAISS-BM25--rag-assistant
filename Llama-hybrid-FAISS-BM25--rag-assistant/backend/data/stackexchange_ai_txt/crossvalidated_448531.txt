PCA clustering and creating a new covariate for RNAseq

I am currently doing an RNAseq experiment and some quality control on data. I noticed that there seems to be some kind of batch effect that I cannot explain from the variables I already have. I've attached my plot below that models a known batch effect and variable of interest. I'm wondering if you think it is okay to create a new covariate (batcheffect2) with the ones outlined in the black box as "1" and everything else as "2" in my regression model? Or maybe use the remove batch effect from limma to do the sample? The variables being modelled in the figure below are [number of mutations]:[batcheffect1] Thank you for all the help! Much appreciated.
