Flex/AS3 Drag Drop - Custom Drop Feedback

I am using a HorizontalList component to display a list of images, you can drag images from another component to join the list, this all works fine. If I do list.showDropFeedback(event) I get an unsightly black bar at the top of images in the HorizontalList - what I really want is a line to the left/right of the image, where the new one will actually sit. I guess I need to define a custom DropFeedback to override the default. Does anyone know if there there is a way to achieve this? Thanks!
