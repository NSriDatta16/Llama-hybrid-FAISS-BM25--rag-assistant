GDP per capita is often better considered on a logarithmic scale, for at least two reasons: Over a range of countries, its distribution can be awkwardly skewed with outliers It tends to change multiplicatively, so changes in log GDP per capita might be more natural and/or more convenient than changes in GDP per capita. That said, "growth" can be occasionally be negative and in principle could be zero, so log growth sounds at best a poor choice of measure and at worst quite wrong as you could not helpfully take logarithms of zero or negative values. (The mathematical fact that logarithms are defined for negative values does not help here.) Discussing whether normalization is a good idea depends on knowing what you mean by it. Normalization in the sense of standardization (value $-$ mean) / SD can only be carried after logarithmic transformation. To see this, consider that if carried out before then some values will be negative and zero isn't impossible either, so the problem in the previous paragraph would bite hard. log(something $+1$ ) sounds like a fudge here. Sometimes there is a good reason for it, but often it is a poor work-around to apply logarithms whenever that is not helpful.
