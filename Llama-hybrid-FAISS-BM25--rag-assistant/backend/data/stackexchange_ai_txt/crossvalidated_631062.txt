I would not treat factors like income, education, etc. as random effects. Random effects should be interpreted as a sample of levels drawn from a population of that group. A sample of people or stimuli from a broader population of possible people or stimuli, for example. Demographics are fixed effects. There is not a population of possible genders or population of possible education levels or a population of possible income levels. Rather, there are a fixed number of income and education levels that you are trying to identify the typical or average effect of. So I think your modelâ€™s specification of random effects is incorrect. As is currently specified, your fitting a random intercept for every education level and income level which feels strange
