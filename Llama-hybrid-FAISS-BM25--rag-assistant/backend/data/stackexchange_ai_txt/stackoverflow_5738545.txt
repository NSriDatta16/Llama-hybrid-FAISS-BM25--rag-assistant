Check the primary key on the mapping class. It should have an attribute something like this: [Column(Storage="_LetterOID", AutoSync=AutoSync.OnInsert, DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsPrimaryKey=true, IsDbGenerated=true)] The important bit is the IsDbGenerated=true. If your attribute lacks that, we have found the error! If you're using the designer, just regenerate this class (by deleting the table in the designer and dropping it from the server explorer). This solved the problem for me, once before.
