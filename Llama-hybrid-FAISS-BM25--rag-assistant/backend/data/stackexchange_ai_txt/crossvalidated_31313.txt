According to Smithson & Verkuilen (2006) $^1$ , an appropriate transformation is $$ x' = \frac{x(N-1) + s}{N} $$ "where N is the sample size and s is a constant between 0 and 1. From a Bayesian standpoint, s acts as if we are taking a prior into account. A reasonable choice for s would be .5." This will squeeze data that lies in $[0,1]$ to be in $(0,1)$ . The above quote, and a mathematical reason of the transformation is available in the [paper's supplementary notes]. Reference: Smithson, M. & Verkuilen, J. A better lemon squeezer?
