Before applying clustering algorithms like K-means you could try to visualize the data to get some insights about the number of clusters. You could apply Self Organizing Maps (SOM - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map ) first. With SOM you can analyse your data in 2D or 3D. This way you can find a good range of clusters to apply K-means or other clustering algorithms.
