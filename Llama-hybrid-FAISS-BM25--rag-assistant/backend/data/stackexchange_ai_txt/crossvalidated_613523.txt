If I understand correctly, you have a set of insects, each of which were exposed to treatment for each insect, we have time series with the value at each point is a single feeding behaviour (one of 9 possible behaviours) The response variable (a 9-level factor) corresponds nicely with the multinomial distribution. The multinomial is a generalisation of the binomial to $\ge2$ categories. If you use a multinomial as the response, you don't have to use the mode summary that you're currently using - the mode is a useful way to summarise the data, but you lose precious information when you're modelling. I'm not sure what kind of model you want, because I'm not across the research question. But, a reasonable start to explore the data could be a multinomial GAM (I believe you can fit this model using mgcv in R), where the response variable is the insect behaviour factor, and the predictor variable is a smooth on time + treatment (or something like that). You could compare a model where treatment is a factor, and treatment is not a factor, and see if the response probabilities change.
