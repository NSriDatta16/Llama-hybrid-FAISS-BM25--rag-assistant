What you have, is not a problem suitable for DBN. There is no way not to overfit those data. You need to use linear and strongly regularized models. Linear SVM are often used. There is whole chapter in elements of statistical learning about dealing with similar problems, you might check it out (it's for free). Edit: whole point of MLP and DBN is that they can learn complex, nonlinear features from the data. You don't have enough data, therefore any method that allow complex models, will just overfit. Another issue is that in such a high dimensional problem, there is always some hyperplane that can separate your classes, therefore there is no need for nonlinear methods.
