I take it that "you've never tried" is a phrase that you don't want to extract, but which has high IDF. The problem will be that there are going to be a vast number of n-grams that only occur in one document and so have the largest possible IDF score. There are lots of smoothing techniques in NLP. This paper [ Chen&Goodman ] is a pretty good summary of many of them. In particular, you sound like you might be interested in the Kneser-Ney smoothing algorithm that works in the way you suggest (backing off to lower length n-grams). These methods are usually used for the task of language modelling, i.e. to estimate the probability of an n-gram occurring given a really big corpus of the language. I don't really know how how you might integrate them with IDF scores, or even if that's really what you want to do.
