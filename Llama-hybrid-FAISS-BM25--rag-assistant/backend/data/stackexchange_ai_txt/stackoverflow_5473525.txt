If you want a queryset of the items that belong to a client and are destroyed: clients_destroyed_items = StorageItem.objects.filter(client=client, itemstatushistory__status__description='destroyed') Lookups that span relationshipsÂ¶ Django offers a powerful and intuitive way to "follow" relationships in lookups, taking care of the SQL JOINs for you automatically, behind the scenes. To span a relationship, just use the field name of related fields across models, separated by double underscores, until you get to the field you want. This example retrieves all Entry objects with a Blog whose name is 'Beatles Blog': Entry.objects.filter(blog_ name _exact='Beatles Blog') This spanning can be as deep as you'd like. It works backwards, too. To refer to a "reverse" relationship, just use the lowercase name of the model.
