Does the threshold value of a logistic regression hypothesis has an effect on the accuracy?

It is true that the threshold value of a logistic regression hypothesis has an effect on the Precision/Recall metrics. Suppose you have trained a logistic regression classifier which is outputting $h_\theta(x)$ Currently, you predict $1$ if $h_\theta(x) \geq \text{threshold}$ , and predict $0$ if $h_Î¸(x) . Higher the threshold, the higher the precision. Lower the threshold, the higher the recall. This happens due to the Precision/ Recall trade-off. But, does the threshold affect the accuracy at all?
