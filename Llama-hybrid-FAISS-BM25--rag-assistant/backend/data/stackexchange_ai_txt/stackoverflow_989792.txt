Singleton example

Gang of four uses a load balancer example to demonstrate the singleton pattern. I'm just wondering why a singleton needs to be used in that example? Are there any other real examples that specifically demonstrate using a singleton pattern? I just want to know more specific reasons why I would want to prevent the creation of more than one instance of an object. And, I mean, if there were more than one load balancer instance, so what?
