I think this comes down to a battle of security models. A DBA may insist you do the former. I, being more pragmatic, would likely pass the tenant ID into my SPs or queries from the application layer. I would back this up with a whole lot of unit tests that ensure one tenant can never see another tenants data, and I would only store the current tenant on the server in session or simmilar, never in a cookie or in URLs, or anywhere else that can be hacked on the client. This makes it much easier to add new tenants, as there is no DB config required. Of course, sessions can be hacked, so you need to take all precautions to ensure that however you store tenant ID on the server, it is immune from spoofs, etc.
