Upper case (P) or lower case (p) to denote p-values and probabilities in frequentist and Bayesian statistics

I am conducting a study in which I am reporting results of hypothesis tests conducted in a frequentist framework, and also some additional analyses conducted in a Bayesian framework. Should I use upper case (capital) $P$ or lower case $p$ to denote $P$/$p$-values and Bayesian probabilities? "p" for both frequentist and Bayesian analyses? "P" for both frequentist and Bayesian analyses? "p" for frequentist analyses and "P" for Bayesian analyses? or "P" for frequentist analyses and "p" for Bayesian analyses?
