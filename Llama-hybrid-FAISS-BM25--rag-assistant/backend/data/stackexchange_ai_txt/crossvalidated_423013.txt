Finding out how change in other variables influence change in target variable

I have data in form of time series that consist 2 variables for 3 different products. First variable is quantity sold and the second is price for each month. And that is repeated for every product. So the data will look like this P1_price P1_quantity P2_price P2_quantity P3_price P3_quantity 2019-1-1 20 590 19 400 10 1500 2019-1-2 20.5 580 19.7 41 10 1521 What I want to find out is how changes in price in P1 P2 P3 affect quantity sold of each product resepctively. So what I did was use linear regression, where P1_quantity is target and P1_Price, P2_price P3_price are independent variables. However using linear model did not take into account how the quantity sold would change from different price points, i.e. change of 1 US dollar from 20 usd price should not have the same effect like from 25 usd price as the linear model implies. So I added quadratic terms into the function. But I'm not sure if this is correct approach to this problem. Is that a good way to deal with this issue? In both cases, linear and quadratic the models were good fit (R2 around 0.95)
