ATM I know of TSimulus and TimeSynth to generate data programatically in a controlled manner (instead of generating random data). TSimulus allows to generate data via various generators . TimeSynth is capable of generating signal types Harmonic functions(sin, cos or custom functions) Gaussian processes with different kernels Constant Squared exponential Exponential Rational quadratic Linear Matern Periodic Pseudoperiodic signals Autoregressive(p) process Continuous autoregressive process (CAR) Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average model (NARMA) and noise types White noise Red noise If you are looking for a graphical way to generate data TimeSeriesMaker is the only tool able to do this.
