I made a run at this and came close... but in the end it didn't really work out for me. The guy from Test Driven made a template for testing silverlight in nunit. I upgraded this to Silverlight 4.0 then I ran nCover. The proof of concept worked great... but when I tried it on our actual product things fell apart pretty quick. Many of our unit tests reference AGcore and others referent GUI objects, which is why I think I kept getting some sort of cross threading error. I read that SilverUnit may be able to do this sort of thing... but you have to pay 700+ dollars per developer. I wish the guy who wrote that would consider selling it separately. Oh well... someday maybe I'll see code coverage numbers... not today though :-)
