I'd suggest subclassing UITableViewController and add any methods, instance variables, and properties common to your different view here. Make your nib and have it have a reference to an instance of one of these objects. Then, subclass your subclass to get customized functionality, like GenericSubclassVC* checkPrimeViewController = [[SpecificSubclassVC alloc] initWithNibName:@"GenericNib" and Bundle:nil]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:checkPrimeViewController animated:YES]; You should stick to overriding the designated initializer. Put any custom initialization code into awakeFromNib or viewDidLoad methods, depending on if they need to modify UIView objects. However, as others have mentioned, it's not terribly efficient or elegant. If all your ViewControllers are table view controllers and have the same data model to display, then there are other ways to get code reuse, like defining a datasource object.
