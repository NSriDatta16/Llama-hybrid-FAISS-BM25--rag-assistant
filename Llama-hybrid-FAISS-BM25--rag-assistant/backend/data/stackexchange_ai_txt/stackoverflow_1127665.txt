I don't know Python, but I can think of one test- check that the class actually creates without error. This will at least regression test the class and means it should work in all circumstances. You never know someone might edit the class in the future and get it to throw an exception or something weird! Personally though, unless you are aiming for an insanely high level of test coverage I wouldn't bother. That said would it be catastrophic if this class did throw an exception? I'm guessing that would be one of those bugs that without a unit test would only be caught in the field.
