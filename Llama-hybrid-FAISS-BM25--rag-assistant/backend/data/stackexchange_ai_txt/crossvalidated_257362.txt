Is my data random according to clustering?

I have a data from 2 cohorts. Each cohort can be divided into 2 identical groups (actually I have ~10 old and ~10 young people in each cohort). I made a hierarchical clustering of the whole dataset of ~40 people. Is there a way to say that the clustering is not random according to the cohorts? (Picture is attached). The dataset depicted on the plot can be divided approximately in the middle and data from 1st group (Old) from both cohort will be on the left and data from 2nd group (Young) will be on the right so the problem can be simplified and divided into 2 subproblems, with stratification into 2 groups. Q: Having a hierarchical clustering and 1 trait (0/1), how can I say if clustering was dependent from the trait? PCA does not show the clear clustering of samples from different cohorts, but the hclustering looks suspicious. Q2 (more general): How to measure the strength of batch effect in the dataset?
