I do not think that this approach is reasonable. The cdf of a discrete random variable is a step function with jumps at the mass points, and if we would like to find a value $x$ such that $F_X(x) = 0.5$ , in most cases we would not be able to do so. Therefore, the approach that you are proposing is not better or worse than just taking any random number between two closest values. I see your problem, and I completely understand that this definition may lead to weird results. However, median in statistics and econometrics is a well-defined quantity that is also widely used outside of our field, so I would not recommend reinterpreting this quantity for a particular problem. Maybe, it makes sense to turn your attention to the mean instead of the median? I think it would provide a little better result in the context that you are describing (giving appointments to 100 people assuming certain number of them will convert).
