Unbiasedness of OLS when using averages instead of full data?

So my professor used the following so show that using averages instead of the full data set in OLS Regression will not cause any bias in our estimator. I understand everything up to the penultimate equality, as that would imply that Cov(X_id, X_d_bar) = Var(X_bar), which is either wrong or I'm really missing something. I tried for more than an hour to understand this and I'm sure that there must be some obvious thing that im just no seeing.
