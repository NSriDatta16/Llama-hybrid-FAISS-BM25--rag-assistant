Given that code is trivial for both (GIST + Network and Raw Pixel + Network), you can try three approaches for a given project. GIST + Dense layers (GIST is not space-distributed) Raw Pixels + CNN + Dense Layers Raw pixels + CNN + Dense + input layer 2 (GIST) + Dense For some projects, GIST can help since it is an abstract feature that CNN might or might not learn. EDIT: This paper compares GIST and CNN Regarding: Is there a way to visualize the extracted features on top of the image? This can be done with an attention layer in approach 3 (CNN + GIST). CNN provides spacial distribution (Required for visualization) and dense layer that merges CNN's output with GIST can be used with an attention layer. Paper for visualization
