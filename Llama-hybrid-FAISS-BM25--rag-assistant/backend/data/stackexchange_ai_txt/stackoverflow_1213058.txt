According to the standard, 5.16 paragraph 2 first point, "The second or the third operand (but not both) is a throw-expression (15.1); the result is of the type of the other and is an rvalue." Therefore, the conditional operator doesn't care what type a throw-expression is, but will just use the other type. In fact, 15.1, paragraph 1 says explicitly "A throw-expression is of type void."
