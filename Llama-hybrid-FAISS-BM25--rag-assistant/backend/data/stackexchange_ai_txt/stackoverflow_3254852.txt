If you want to unit -test your application, you haven't to focus on GUI testing techniques. It is much better to write the application using MVC , MVP , or other meta-pattern like these. So you get business logic and presentation layer separated. It is much more important to cover the business layer with tests since this is your code. Presentation layer is tested already by wxWidgets developers. To test the business layer it will be enough just basic tools like standard unittest module and maybe nose . To make sure the whole application behave correctly, you should add few acceptance tests that will test functionality from end to end. These will deal with GUI, but there will be few such tests comparing to number of unit-tests. If you will limit yourself with acceptance tests only, you'll get low coverage, fragile and very slow test code base.
