jquery-ui autocomplete with ASP MVC suggestions not displaying

I have been trying to get a simple example of the jquery-ui autocomplete to work. I have a controller setup to handle the query, and it returns the json that looks to be in order, but I am getting no suggestions showing up. Here are the js libraries I am including: and here is the javascript and the form tags: $(function () { $("#organization").autocomplete({ source: function (request, response) { $.ajax({ url: '/Organization/OrganizationLookup', dataType: "json", data: { limit: 12, q: request.term } }) }, minLength: 2 }); }); Organization: I get back a json response that looks reasonable from my controller: [ { "id":"Sector A", "value":"Sector A" }, { "id":"Sector B", "value":"Sector B" }, { "id":"Sector C", "value":"Sector C" } ] id and value seem to be the default naming that autocomplete is looking for. But I get no joy at all. Any thoughts?
