Single Instance Storage layers

I have a data storage requirement which is an excellent candidate for single instance storage and deduplication. Can anyone suggest any .Net compatible libraries or systems which handles SIS and deduplication, either with SQL Server as an actual back end or its own high performance storage engine? What have peoples experiences been with such engines, and are there any pit falls to watch out for? Regards Moo
