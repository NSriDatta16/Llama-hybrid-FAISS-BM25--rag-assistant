Algorithm to detect if a particular event (date) has an impact on a time series

I have many time series and a set of dates (key events eg public holidays or big sales days). There are too many for me to look as manually and determine if either an increase or decrease occured as a result of the event. Is there some algorithm that I could use? I am currently using R.
