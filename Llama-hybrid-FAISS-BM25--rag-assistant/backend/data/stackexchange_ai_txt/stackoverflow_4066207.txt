You could accomplish the screenshot's layout using RelativeLayout . The left and right images can have android:layout_alignParentLeft="true" and android:layout_alignParentRight="true" respectively on their declarations. As for the center content you could declare android:layout_alignParentTop="true" to get it anchored to the top and android:layout_centerHorizontal="true" to get it centered correctly. You can then assign an id to that top TextView (or whatever you make it), and then align the other two TextViews below it. You'll have to mess around with margins to get the Views looking nice space-wise, but the above layout parameters will get you started with organizing the Views.
