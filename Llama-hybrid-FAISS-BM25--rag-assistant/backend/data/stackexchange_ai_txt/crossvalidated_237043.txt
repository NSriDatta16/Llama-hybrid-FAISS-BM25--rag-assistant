You don't need a model to show that volatilities are changing. Simply show the time series of squared returns, you'll be able to spot the clusters of high and low volatilities easily. If you want to fit a model, then GARCH(1,1) will do. GARCH is usually not an undergrad topic, by the way, so you can do simpler analysis and get away with it. UPDATE: The simple analysis would be plots and trivial regressions. For instance, plot the squared return (y-axis) against their lagged values (x-axis). This was the GARCH idea to start with. If you see the significant slope, then you can claim autocorelation of returns, i.e. if the stocks were moving a lot recently then they're likely to be moving a lot in near future. That's volatility clustering in its simplest form UPDATE 2: I decided to write your thesis. I got SPX Index prices from Bloomberg: You can't see much from prices, so we get the daily returns: It turns out that the returns are not very infomative either, so let's look at the squared returns: Bingo! There's clearly volatility clustering in effect. So, let's scatter the squared return against itself one day ago: We can now fit the simple regression: $$r_t^2=\beta_0+\beta_1r_{t-1}^2+e_t$$ Here are the results. Note that the slope is significant, so you can claim that you tested the volatility changes.

Don't forget: this is bachelor level work :)
