Vardecimal Storage Format SQL Server 2005 adds a new storage format for numeric and decimal datatypes called vardecimal. Vardecimal is a variable-length representation for decimal types that can save unused bytes in every instance of the row. The biggest amount of savings come from cases where the decimal definition is large (like decimal(38,6)) but the values stored are small (like a value of 0.0) or there is a large number of repeated values or data is sparsely populated.
