Section on Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse in the Deep Learning book

I am reading the following section in the Deep Learning book by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. I have some questions. If $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $Ax=y$, then we can have left inverse $B$ such that $x=By$ only when the nullspace of the matrix $A$ is $\{0\}$, because if $Ax=0=y$ for some $x\neq 0$ then there is no $B$ such that $0\neq x=By=0$. In other words, the dimension of rowspace, and hence the rank of $A$, must be $n$. Thus, if $A$ is taller than it is wide, $m>n$, then it is possible for the left-inverse to exist. On the other hand, if $A$ is wider than it is tall, $m However, in the screen-shot I have attached, it shows the exact opposite: If $A$ is taller than it is wide, then it is possible for this equation to have no solution. If $A$ is wider than it is tall, then there could be multiple possible solutions. Where I have gone wrong in my reasoning?
