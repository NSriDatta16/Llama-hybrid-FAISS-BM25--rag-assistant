What are the model parameters in PCA?

I've been asked to report the number of parameters to be learned in a PCA model. This answer implies that parameters do exist in PCA, but does not explain. Software packages often report the number of parameters, but do not document what those parameters are . What are the parameters in a PCA model? Subsidiary question: how many parameters are there? To be clear - I am not asking about model hyperparameters.
