It's probably a really bad idea to fire request on a mousemove event. As you mentioned correctly, this will cause dozens of request, more than any average server will take/accept and are useless anyway in this case. You should reconsider your logic. If you need those request to get fired on mousemove, you should throttle them. This could look like: $(function() { var did_fire = false; setInterval(function() { if( did_fire ) { $.ajax({}); did_fire = false; } }, 2000); $(element).mouseover(function() { did_fire = true; }); }); This is a very simple technique to reduce the created requestes to 1/2000ms. Like always you can go crazy about this and write your own request manager (or use a plugin for that) which stores all the request and fires them in order.
