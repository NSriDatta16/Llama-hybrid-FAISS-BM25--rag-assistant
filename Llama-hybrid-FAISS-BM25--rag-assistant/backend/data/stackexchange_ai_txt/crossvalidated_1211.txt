It's like that old joke. When asked for directions the philosopher said "Well, if I wanted to go there, I wouldn't start from here ..." While I think each "culture" should be open to learning from the other, they have different ways of looking at the world. I think the problem with learning statistics through studying machine learning algorithms is that, whilst ML algorithms start with statistical concepts, statistics doesn't start with algorithms, but probability models.
