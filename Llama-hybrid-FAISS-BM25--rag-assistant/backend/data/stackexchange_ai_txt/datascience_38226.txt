Which is better for a beginner: R or Python?

From what I can tell, R and Python are the two most popular languages for data science. My question is which one would you recommend for someone just starting out in data science? Does any one have any clear advantages on the other? Is any one easier to learn or does any one have more potential? Thanks a lot!
