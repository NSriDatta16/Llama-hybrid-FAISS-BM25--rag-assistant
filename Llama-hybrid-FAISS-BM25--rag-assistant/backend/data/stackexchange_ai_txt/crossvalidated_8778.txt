One approach would be to use the second dataset to make a secondary model that predicts the exact variables as a function of the noisy variables and use this in operation to provide the inputs for the primary model trained on the first dataset (which predicts the target given the exact variables). However, to do this properly you would want to propogate the uncertainty of the secondary model through the primary model when making predictions. Say you used a multivariate regression model (as the uncertainty in the conditional estimates of the exact variables are unlikely to be uncorrellated) you would have a multi-variate normal distribution for the plausible values of the exact variables conditioned on the noisy ones. This could then be sampled a few thousand times and the output of the primary model averaged over that sample to get a more robust estimate for the target. I suspect if you kept everything linear and normal there would be an analytic solution so you didn't have to sample. The regression may at least help with the bias of the noise, if nothing else.
