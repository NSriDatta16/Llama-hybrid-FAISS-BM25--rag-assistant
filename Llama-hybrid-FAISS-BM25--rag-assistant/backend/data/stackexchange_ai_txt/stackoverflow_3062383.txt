UITableViewCell is meant to be used in a UITableView . I would imagine that there are things happening under the hood in UITableViewCell that assume that it's operating in a UITableView . Even if you were able to get this to work, I would expect it to be pretty fragile and vulnerable to breaking during OS updates, again, because it was written with the assumption of being embedded in a UITableView .
