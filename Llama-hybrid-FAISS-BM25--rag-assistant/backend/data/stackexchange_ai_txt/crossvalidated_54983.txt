Autocorrelation doesn't tell you anything about a trend - linear or otherwise. A high autocorrelation between time series values one period apart just tells you that the value in the previous period is highly related to the value in the current period. A random walk can have high first order autocorrelation but has no trend. There are tests available: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochran%E2%80%93Armitage_test_for_trend , but if there's a linear trend, a linear regression model should provide a "good" fit for the data. And of course, for a positive trend, the slope of the model should be positive.
