Here's my quick hack around this problem: Create a text file in the project. I called my "notes.txt", and I use it to store notes, ideas, etc. that don't have a home elsewhere in the project. Add the web link to the top of the file. Open the text file in the IDE and put it in a new tab group. I put mine in a vertical tab group off to the right. Drag the separator as far over as it will go to "hide" the tab group. This way it's always open and available but not taking up much space. When you want the web page, "show" the tab group (i.e. drag the separator back) and ctrl-click the link. This has the added benefit of opening the web page in the same tab group as the text file, so you can push them both aside when not using them. I'm sure there's more that could be done by writing packages as others have suggested, but this was a low-effort way to get me close enough to what I wanted. I'd love to hear other suggestions or modifications that might make this setup better.
