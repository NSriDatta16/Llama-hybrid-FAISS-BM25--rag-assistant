There is a RockScroll alternative called MetalScroll which is essentially the same thing with a few tweaks and improvements. Also there is a small and simple WordLight plug-in that only highlights the identical tokens. Both are open source and support code folding which is nice. Imho, the bar next to the scroll bar in Eclipse is a lot more elegant solution than the scroll bar replacement of RockScroll/MetalScroll. Unfortunately I couldn't find any VS plug-ins that do it the Eclipse way, so I just stick with WordLight.
