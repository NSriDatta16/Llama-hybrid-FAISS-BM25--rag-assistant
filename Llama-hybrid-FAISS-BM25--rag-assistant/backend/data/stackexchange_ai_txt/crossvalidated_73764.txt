How to test for randomness in bins with small N?

I observe a series of crime incidents linked by modus operandi or some other peculiar characteristic of the crime (e.g. cutting catalytic converters from underneath vehicles). I would like to know if the observed days of the week that the crimes occur on (ignoring the uncertainty that sometimes occur in crime incidents - e.g. it happens overnight) are random. I typically have very few linked crime events, say between 5-15. So question 1, there is a lot of knowledge about using Pearson's $\chi^2$ on small n contingency tables , can I use all of that same advice for $2\times 2$ contingency tables that come with it for just 7 day of week bins? (In particular can I use the $N - 1$ correction given expected cell frequencies are at least 1 and still expect similar coverage rates - which would mean I need at least 7 observed events?) Or alternatively question 2, are there any other obvious approaches I can take to test the hypothesis of the events being random with respect to the day of the week? (Permutation approaches perhaps given the limited nature of the potential permutations?)
