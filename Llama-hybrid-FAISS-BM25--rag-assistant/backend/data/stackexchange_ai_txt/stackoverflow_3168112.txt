You have to make sure that your using the right line breaks in your script and your app LF: Line Feed, U+000A FF: Form Feed, U+000C CR: Carriage Return, U+000D CR+LF: CR (U+000D) followed by LF (U+000A) NEL: Next Line, U+0085 LS: Line Separator, U+2028 PS: Paragraph Separator, U+2029 Within Windows systems (ms-dos) there line feed is CR+LF , And within "Unix-like" systems its LF adn 8Bit commodore's its a CR You have to make sure that the source location contains the same type of feeds to your edit location. Your server handles its line feeds different to the host that the editor is running on, just double check this and develope some means of auto replacing the Unicode chars depending on your OS As you say that your "translating my PHP application using gettext with POEdit", i would create a script to go threw all your files via shell/doss/php and auto convert the character codes to the type of system your running on. so if your working on Windows then you would search for all chars that are U+000A and replace with U+000DU+000A
