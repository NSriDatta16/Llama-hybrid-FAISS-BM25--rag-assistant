Do we need to standardize when our data is univariate?

In this question: What algorithms need feature scaling, beside from SVM? it is said that we need to standardize so that all features are weighted equally. But what if we only have as features: time and a count (ex: number of logins by hour). Do we still need to standardize? Why?
