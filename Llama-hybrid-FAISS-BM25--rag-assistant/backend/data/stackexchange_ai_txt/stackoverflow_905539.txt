What Conrad said, you need to send the file in smaller sizes, depending on what kind pf PPC you have. That could be as small as few mb, and then write to either a storage card or the main memory. I personaly use FTP to transfer "big" files ( Ranging in the hundreds of mb ) to transfer to my PPC, but im sure you can use any other solution you may desire. But you need to research the limits of your target PPC, they often have limited memory,storage and CPU. There is also a built in http downloader class in the .net compact framework you can use.
