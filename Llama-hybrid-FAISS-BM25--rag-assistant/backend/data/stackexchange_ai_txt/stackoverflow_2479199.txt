Querying a smalldatetime's date and time separately in SQL server?

Imagine a table that has two fields, a smalltimedate and an int and about 1000 rows of data. What I'm attempting to do in query is to find the average of the INT field for rows between 3/3/2010 - 3/13/2010 and only if the entry is between 6:00am - 11:00pm. I tried between '2010-03-03 06:00 AND 2010-03-13 23:00' However that only restricts that very beginning and end times. I could do this with a loop but I'm going to need to have the same query run over much larger date ranges and this will quickly eat server resources. Is there a way to query date and time separately?
