Deep Learning sentiment analysis model always predicts same class

I'd really appreciate your help as I'm not an expert in Deep Learning for sentiment analysis and I'm a bit lost. I'm using the Sentiment140 dataset: http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students First I've created my own word embeddings using the train dataset and gensim library, then I built a model in Keras. The val accuracy is low (0.5) and when I try to use the model to predict new sentences it's always predicting class 'neutral' no matter what sentence is. The code is on github: word2vec: https://github.com/zarkhaari/sentiment-analysis-dl/blob/master/sentiment140_word2vec.ipynb model: https://github.com/zarkhaari/sentiment-analysis-dl/blob/master/sentiment140_cnn_saved_w2c.ipynb It would be great if you could tell if you spot any evident mistake that is causing the low accuracy. Thank you in advance!
