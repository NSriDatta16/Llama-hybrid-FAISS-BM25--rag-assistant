Ideas to classify shipping addresses

I have a dataset of addresses for a bunch of users. I need to classify an address into residential/commercial or office/educational. Moreover, every user has multiple addresses. So every user has a set of addresses. There's no direct labelled data. What I do have are tags for some of the the users eg: Student, Parent, Gender Some intuitive thoughts: One might expect to have an Educational address in an address set of a Student. Every user will probably have at least 1 Residential address in his/her address set. But how do I use this data to create a classifier? Are there any existing techniques to solve this kind of problem? Any particular areas/concepts in Machine Learning that I should take a look at?
