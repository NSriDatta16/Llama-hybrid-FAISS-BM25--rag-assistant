There is no reliable way to detect the HTTP agent - you will break the form for some browsers in any case - unless you can force users in to using a very limited set of browsers (but this can be spoofed again). IMO, trying to limit the software that can be used to access the form, you should make sure that there is a real human controlling that software. Unfortunately there is no better way than captchas for doing this, unless all customer have access to biometric scanners.
