About binary logistic regression

I have been told that Nagelkerke should not be used in a model of binary logistic regression, but instead a R2 as a measure of goodness of fit. So, how can I apply R2 if I am not using a linear regression. How can I compare 2 or 3 models of binary logistic regression? is there any software? Thanks!
