The query likely fails because NHibernate does not know how to translate a ToString() (or the various parses) to CAST/CONVERT methods. I agree with Elian and SLaks - if you need a single "character" out of the product ID, this ID should be a varchar. There is no truly elegant way to get this query to work otherwise; if it were a string, the StartsWith() function would be converted to a ProductId LIKE 'x%' condition with little fuss.
