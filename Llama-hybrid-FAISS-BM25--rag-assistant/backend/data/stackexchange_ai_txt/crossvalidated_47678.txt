Comparing two Bayesian models

To compare two Bayesian models for the same data, I plotted the fitted values of the first model versus the fitted values of the second model. The plot indicates a perfect similarity. Relying on this plot, I said there is no significant difference between these two models. However, the difference between the Deviance information criterion (DIC) values of each model is 85, which I think shows that there is a significant difference between these two models. So, the plot and the DIC, I suppose, are in contrast. What does everyone else think?
