Generally, bias in a Neural Network context refers to an always on node which outputs 1. It's use is similar to the intercept of a linear regression. Depending on your system, what shows up as 'bias' might just be the weight of the connection on this bias node. I.e. the interpretation of a large bias is similar to the interpretation of a large intercept. Whether this is an issue depends on the problem at hand but in prediction, it's probably not an issue.
