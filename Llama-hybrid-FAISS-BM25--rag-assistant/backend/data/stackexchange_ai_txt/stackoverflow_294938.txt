Web page designers

Are there any Web page designing software out there that allow me to drag and drop controls just like desktop applications. I found it quite difficult to design a web page using the designer in Visual Studio 2008 as it constrains me to a flow or grid layout. (I am not an accomplished designer but there should be some ease as one experiences while designing desk top applications). Thanx in advance.
