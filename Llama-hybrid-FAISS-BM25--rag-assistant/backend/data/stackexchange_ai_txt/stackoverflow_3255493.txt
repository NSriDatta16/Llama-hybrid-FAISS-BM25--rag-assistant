Talking about an array with 4 or 5 elements, I'm guessing you don't have a memory size problem. Why not reserve one location in the array for a counter? That would be a bit of a "poor man's Vector" solution. Ideally, one would use location 0 in the array for the counter, but if you have a lot of code that believes in indexes starting at 0, you could put your counter at the opposite end, say at location 6 or 7. That element of the array would contain the number of items held in the array. Declaring a "not initialized" value and searching the array for that is feasible but a rather inelegant solution. For one thing, it costs longer to loop and search than to simply look at a single value. Ideally, that counter shouldn't even be in your array; it should be in a separate variable (we're once again approaching the Vector class suggested by others). But putting it in the array will probably make for a simpler change. Just look out for the possibility of storing more-than-expected values in the array and stomping over your counter!
