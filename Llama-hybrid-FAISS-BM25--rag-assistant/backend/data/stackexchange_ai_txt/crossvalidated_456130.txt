Just to make it clear, a regression problem is one whose target is continuous and not discrete. In this sense you can make any Neural Network that is primarily used for classification a regressor, with minimal changes. Namely it needs to end with $1$ neuron, no activation function and a proper loss function (e.g. mean squared error). For example, object detection is in its core a regression problem because you are trying to predict coordinates. Any ResNet could be used for these problems. I'm going to guess, however, that when you mean regression you mean on a structured dataset like "boston housing". This gets trickier, because here it comes down to how you define ResNet . If by a ResNet architecture you mean a neural network with skip connections then yes , it can be used for any structured regression problem. If you mean the specific type of CNN that is used for image classification then no . That network is build with 2D convolution layers which require their input to be 2D as well. Structured datasets won't work with this model.
