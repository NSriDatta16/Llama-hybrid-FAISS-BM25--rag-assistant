Loan contracts are very complex. If you don't want to dive into the complexity you have to make some simplifying assumptions. Here are some of the variables you need to consider: What is the base rate? Does the loan float over Prime? Libor? CMT? What is the margin above the base rate? How often does the base rate reset? What happens if the reset date falls on a holiday? A weekend? Are there ceilings or floors on the base rate? Is there an initial period at which the base rate is fixed before the first reset? How long is that period? Is there an initial discount on the margin that is later adjusted (a teaser rate)? What's the term of the mortgage? Is it a negative-amortization mortgate? What's the stop period on the negative-amortizing payments? Is it a fully-amortizing mortgage? Is it a balloon mortgage? Is the interest simple interest or compounded interest? If the latter, what's the compounding frequency? As you can see, if you haven't specified enough about the problem that you are trying to solve to even begin to come up with a solution. If you're not a domain expert on ARMs or financial products in general I strongly encourage you to find someone who is.
