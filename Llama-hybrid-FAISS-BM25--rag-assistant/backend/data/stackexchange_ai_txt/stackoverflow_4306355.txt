With inno setup you can put a lot of files into a single exe and execute any of these files during setup. A installer inside a installer will require you to check everything works well. For example you may want this inno setup installer does not register a uninstaller (because the ClickOnce may register the correct one). Unfortunately you question is to vague to provide a more specific answer. As starting point you should download inno setup and take a look at the examples: setup.iss will show a lot of inno capabilities. Pay attention and how to include and run files: [Files] and [Run] sections of the script.
