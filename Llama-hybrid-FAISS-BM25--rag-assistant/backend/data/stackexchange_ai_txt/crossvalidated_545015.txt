The Role of Summary Statistics

I am reading about this algorithm called "ABC" (Approximate Bayesian Computation). https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/vignettes/abcvignette.pdf (page 3) Over here, it makes mention of "summary statistics". For example, in the Bayesian Setting where we want to estimate some parameter "thetha": A randomly chosen value of the "thetha_i" is selected by randomly sampling the priors. This value of "thetha_i" is used to generate a series of realizations "y1, y2, y3...yn", collectively denoted as "y_i". A "summary statistic" for each "Yi" generated through simulation is denoted as : S(Yi). A "distance" (e.g. euclidean distance) is evaluated between the "summary statistics" of the original data and the simulated data, e.g. D[ S(Yi), S(Y0) ] ... where Y0 is the original data. IF D[ S(Yi), S(Y0) ] > "some threshold" , THEN the choice of "thetha_i" is accepted. We repeat this procedure many times, and keep track of all accepted values of "thetha_i". These (many) values of "thetha_i" can be used to make the posterior distribution of "thetha_i", and a final value of "thehta_i" can be selected. Throughout this whole procedure, I am still confused about what exactly is a "summary statistic". Does anyone know what is the functional form of the "summary statistic"?
