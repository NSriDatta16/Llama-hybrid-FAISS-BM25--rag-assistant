Bill James for his work in statistics that evaluate MLB player performance. His work spawned the term Sabermetics. He has created numerous statistics that can be found throughout the baseball world. His ideas stem from how to capture a player's overall impact on a game through run production (offense) and runs saved (defense). His work has led to less emphaisis on statistics that have low correlation to run production (batting average) and more on OPS (on-base + slugging). He works as an advisor to the Boston Red Sox and is credited to the World Series Championships in 2004 and 2007. His work has influenced the book and upcoming feature film Moneyball.
