You could escape any quotes in php using htmlspecialchars or htmlentities, however this doesn't solve the issue of single quotes, even if ENT_QUOTES is set. Doing a little testing I see the following should work, although it may not be very elegant: $name = htmlentities(str_replace("'", "\'", $event->getName())); $response = " "; Hope that helps
