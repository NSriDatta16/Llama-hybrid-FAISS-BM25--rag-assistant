I assume respondents were asked for each of the cost estimates you provided whether they would agree to screening. In that case, unless there are missing data, you have a balanced design and need not worry too much about repeated measures. The Cochran Armitage test-of-trend would be a way to answer the question, "does cost influence risk of not screening?" A logistic regression model treating the ordinal values of cost... or potentially the actual monetary amount... assesses the same thing. You can predict quantiles of screening based on cost, e.g. (we expect 50% of the population will screen if screening costs are reduced/increased to $XX). The logistic regression model allows you to adjust for other blocking factors and determine the relative impact of other test features, controlling for cost.
