Namespace Orginization and Conventions

So I have a little bit of a problem. I working on a project in C# using The StackOveflow API. You can send it a request like so: http://stackoverflow.com/users/rep/126196/2010-01-01/2010-03-13 And get back something like this JSON response: [{"PostUrl":"1167342", "PostTitle":"Are ref and out in C# the same a pointers in C++?", "Rep":10}, {"PostUrl":"1290595", "PostTitle":"Where can I find a good tutorial on bubbling?", "Rep":10} ... So my problem is that I have some methods like GetJsonResponse() which return the above JSON and SaveTempFile() which saves that JSON response to a temporary file for later use. I not sure if I should create a class for them, or what namespace to put them under. Right now my current namespace hierarchy is like so: StackOverflow.Api.Json . So how should I organize these methods/classes/namespaces?
