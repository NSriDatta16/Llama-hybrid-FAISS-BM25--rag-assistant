Predictive Modeling of Multiple Items

I have a dataset of Social Media Post and want to predict the number of "thumbs up" it will receive over time. +---------+----------------+-----------+----------------+-----+-------+ | Post_id | Timestamp | Follows | Comments_count | ... | Likes | +---------+----------------+-----------+----------------+-----+-------+ | 01 | 12-04-16 14:00 | 34 | 4 | | 23 | +---------+----------------+-----------+----------------+-----+-------+ | 01 | 12-04-16 14:35 | 35 | 7 | | 34 | +---------+----------------+-----------+----------------+-----+-------+ | | ... | | | | | +---------+----------------+-----------+----------------+-----+-------+ | 02 | 12-04-16 14:02 | 134 | 5 | | 36 | +---------+----------------+-----------+----------------+-----+-------+ | 02 | 12-04-16 14:45 | 136 | 23 | | 123 | +---------+----------------+-----------+----------------+-----+-------+ The likes amount over Time looks like f(x) = sqrt(x) My approach is to create a multivariable polynomial regression for each post and somehow ensemble/average them. Is this a good approach? Which ensemble technique is appropriate?
