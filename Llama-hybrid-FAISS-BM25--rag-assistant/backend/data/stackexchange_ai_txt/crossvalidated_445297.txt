Calibration-in-the-small and logistic regression

It is well agreed ( for example this discussion ) that Logistic Regression guarantees that model will produce well calibrated in the large (mean) predictions. Does Logistic Regression guarantees that calibration-in-the-small is good too, or not necessarily? If calibration-in-the-small is not guaranteed to be good (or in case when it is not good), what is known about the reasons? Are there known methods to improve calibration-in-the-small via some modified loss function (or some other ways) while training LR model, or this is only solved by using some calibration function/transformation that is applied on outputs from prediction?
