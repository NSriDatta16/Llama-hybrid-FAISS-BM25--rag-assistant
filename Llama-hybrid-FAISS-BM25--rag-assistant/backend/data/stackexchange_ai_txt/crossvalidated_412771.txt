The observed behavior in the post is expected behavior, and essentially a duplicate of Random Forest different results for same observation The discrepancy you find is fully explained by understanding what the software is doing. Attribute rf$votes reports OOB results for the training data, while calling predict(rf, newdata=something, ...) (which is syntactically equivalent to predict(rf,something, ...) ) reports predictions for the whole ensemble, without regard to in- or out-of-bag status. The two results would agree if you did not supply argument newdata in the call to predict, as in predict(rf,type="prob") . From the documentation: votes (classification only) a matrix with one row for each input data point and one column for each class, giving the fraction or number of (OOB) `votes' from the random forest. Where as for the predict method we have newdata a data frame or matrix containing new data. (Note: If not given, the out-of-bag prediction in object is returned.) So putting these two facts together, we can conclude that supplying the argument newdata is giving the random forest's predictions including all of the trees, while votes is only reporting OOB results. Obviously, these wouldn't agree in general, so that's why your results disagree.
