You're describing complementary label classification. This is discussed in Chapter 9 of Machine Learning from Weak Supervision: An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach (2023) by Masashi Sugiyama, Han Bao, Takashi Ishida, Nan Lu, Tomoya Sakai. Conceptually, a CL [complementary label] specifies a class that a pattern does not belong to. It's infeasible to summarize the whole chapter in an answer, but it is feasible to train a model in this setting!
