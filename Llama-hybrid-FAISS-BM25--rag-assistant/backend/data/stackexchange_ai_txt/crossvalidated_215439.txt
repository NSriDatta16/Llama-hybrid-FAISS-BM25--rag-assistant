Any way of getting vector of probabilities for each response with Naive Bayes in R?

I'm currently using naiveBayes from {e1071} . My response is simply a prediction based on my independent variables. Is there a way to get the probability for each possible prediction as a response with naiveBayes? So if I was trying to predict the outcome of a race, the predicted results would look like this : Name position prob Tom 1 0.1 Tom 2 0.2 Tom 3 0.7 Jim 1 0.2 Jim 2 0.5 Jim 3 0.3 Elizabeth 1 0.8 Elizabeth 2 0.1 Elizabeth 3 0.1 As opposed to just Name position Tom 3 Jim 2 Elizabeth 1 If this is not possible with Naive Bayes, are there any other standard models that would support this? Like a Random Forest for instance? I would appreciate any guidance/literature on the matter.
