Prevent ASP.NET Website project from building certain directories by using Web.config?

While programming, the longest part is a build on my ASP.NET Website project is the "Building directory" process seen below. (Note: I don't have the liberty to turn this into a Web Application with a .csproj build file. Wish I did.) The contents of the directories seen below are not changing although there might be some dependencies in the App_Code/ subfolders that do change. Is there any way for me to stop some directories from building using Web.config , to shorten a compile of my dev copy? It's the only viable file I can think of to use without having an official build file. ------ Build started: Project: C:\...\cmsappmin-abcd\, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------ Validating Web Site Building directory '/cmsappmin-abcd/abcd/controls/docsearch/'. Building directory '/cmsappmin-abcd/abcd/controls/'. Building directory '/cmsappmin-abcd/abcd/controls/pipco/'. Building directory '/cmsappmin-abcd/abcd/controls/reg1000/'. Building directory '/cmsappmin-abcd/abcd/TemplateC/'. Building directory '/cmsappmin-abcd/abcd/Template/'.
