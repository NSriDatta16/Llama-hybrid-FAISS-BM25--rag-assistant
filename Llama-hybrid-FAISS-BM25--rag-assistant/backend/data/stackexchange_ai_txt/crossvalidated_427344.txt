Instead of using the recursive relation for the expected number $J_n = J_{n-1} + \frac{1}{n}$ we could also try a more mechanistic approach by computing every path that the frog can take and the distribution of the probability of the position of the frog after $k$ jumps. This can be quickly computed using a Markov chain. # stochastic Matrix M giving $2.928968$ The mass distribution, $p(x,k)$ , for the probability to be at distance $x$ from the 'finish-leaf' in the $k$ -th step would look like the following: This method has one downside. It is not very easy to derive the final charming result that the expectation value for the number of steps is equal to the n-th harmonic number $\sum_{k=1}^n 1/k$ . In the comments I suggested that these distributions $p(x,k)$ would be like polynomial functions. However that is wrong. It is more complicated. The distribution follows the relation: $$p(x,k) = \sum_{y=x+1}^N \frac{p(y,k-1)}{j}$$ where $p(x,k)$ is a sum of the probabilities for the position of the frog in the $(k-1)$ -th step, and $N$ is the number of leaves (generalizing from $N=10$ ). To start this relation we use $p(N,0)=1$ . This could be expanded as $$p(x,k) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{l_1=x+1}^{N-k} \sum_{l_2=l_1+1}^{N-k+1} ... \sum_{l_k=l_{k-1}+1}^{N-1} \frac{1}{l_1 \cdot l_2 \cdot ... l_k}$$ which is some sort of generalization of the Harmonic number. You could describe it more compact as $$p(x,k) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{S \in S_{k,[x,...,N-1]}} \prod_{a \in S} \frac{1}{a}$$ where the sum is over all k-subsets $S$ in $S_{k,[x,...,N-1]}$ , the set of all k-subset of $[x,...,N-1]$ , and the product is over all the numbers $a$ in the subset $S$ . For instance a subset $\lbrace 3,5,7 \rbrace$ would represent that the frog jumped from position 10 to 7 to 5 and to 3. The probability for the frog to follow this path is $\frac{1}{10 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 \cdot 3}$ . I am not sure yet how to continue from here to obtain the final result... I imagine you could use some recursive relation.
