Could machine learning be used to select best parameter for more than one loop optimization?

I do not know if i can ask this question here or not. But I really need it. I'm very new to ML/DL/NN field. I have seen many articles tackling the problem of selection of the best parameter for loop optimization like use ML/DL/NN to find best tile size only or best unrolling factor only or best vectorisation factor only. So I wonder if is it possible to create a machine learning model that can at once find best parameter for loop unrolling, tiling and vectorisation together . I got hard to reformulate my question but what I want to say whether is it possible to do a model that can learn for every loop optimization which is the best parameter. Will it require only to create a complexe model. To take more time to train it. I tried to find an article to find a model in the internet that fix that but did not find yet. I asked this question cause i really have limited knowledge about machine learning. Thank you to share any useful help or article that may answer my curiosity. Thank you again. Honestly I have been afraid that my question will be misunderstood or taken as subjective, or get any pb so I hesitated at first but finally find if i do so will never learn so i get the courage to ask so I will accept every critic.
