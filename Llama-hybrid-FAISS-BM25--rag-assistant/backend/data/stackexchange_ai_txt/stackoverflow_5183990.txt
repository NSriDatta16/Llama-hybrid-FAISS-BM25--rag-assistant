If you're not using javascript, the only thing I can think of is taking advantage of IE Conditional comments , but even then, that will only allow you to include/exclude some javascript or css. If you really want to know the OS, browser, etc. you could try parsing the user-agent string. It reports on the browser, operating system, and other values, but it isn't reliable (for example, you can forge the string). Quirksmode has a good function to detect the browser and OS.
