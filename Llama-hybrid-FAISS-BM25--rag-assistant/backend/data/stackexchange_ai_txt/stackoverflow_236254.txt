Infragistics has some fairly robust web controls, one of them is a grid that can export to Excel. The Excel export component allows you to format the results, add images and other stuff, so it should do what you are after. The only problem with Infragistics is that their API is extremely ... what is the word ... cumbersome? So it takes some work to get used to and often much code to get things done properly. But the end result is good.
