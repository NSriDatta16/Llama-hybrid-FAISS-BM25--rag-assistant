The measurements need to be treated as repeated measures with each individual. They are a great way to get a better estimate of the contour-volume deviation for each individual, but they don't improve your estimate of the field as a whole by much. At its simplest, all you are doing is a t-test comparing the average score (or deviation) for each individual between the two groups. For the study that you describe, your sample size is three per group no matter how many measurements you make on each of those three individuals. To make broad conclusions about the fields, you need more than three individuals from each group. As a simple example, imagine that men and women differ in their contour size. If we assume that 50% of each field are each gender (for simplicity, though I know this isn't true), there is a reasonable probability that you will get an uneven number from each gender in each group. Then, the effect you would actually be measuring is gender, but you might misinterpret it as being representative of the field as a whole. Repeat this concern over every potential confound (which college they attended, where they attended med school, age, handedness, etc.) and you can see the risk you take in over-interpretting a result. On top of that, you may simply sample (by chance) from the low or high end of the distribution in each group. The power of the study is also low, which would make it difficult to interpret a negative result.
