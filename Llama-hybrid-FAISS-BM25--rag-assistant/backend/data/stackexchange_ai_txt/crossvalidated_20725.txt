Rolling analysis with out-of sample

I have a model that looks like lm(y ~ lag(x, -1) + lag(z, -1)) So basically, this is a time series regression with exogenous variables, and I want to carry out a rolling analysis of sample forecasts, meaning that: I first used a subsample (e.g., 1990-1995) for estimation, then I performed a one step ahead forecast, then I added one observation and made another one step ahead forecast, and so on. I have tried to work with rollapply , defining the model as arima(0,0,0) with xreg=lags of the other variables, but that doesn't work. Your help would be much appreciated!
