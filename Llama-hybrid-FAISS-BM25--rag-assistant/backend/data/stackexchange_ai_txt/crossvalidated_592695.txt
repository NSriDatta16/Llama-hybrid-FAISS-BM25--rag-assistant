Translating marginal effects for layperson

In a setting with a binary outcome logistic model focusing on a binary treatment, how would you translate the average marginal effects to make it understandable to a layperson? Letâ€™s suppose the treatment X has an AME of -0.025, meaning that the probability that y=1 decreases by 2.5% points when X=1. Could we say the that, comparing 1000 individuals with X=0 and 1000 with X=1, there will be around 25 people affected by the treatment variable? Is this a correct way to describe the outcome? Any possibile alternative interpretation? Thanks
