wget and curl much slower when invoked from bash script

I'm writing a little automation script and I need to download one file. When I use curl or wget directly from bash, the average dl speed is about 3MB/s. However, when I invoke it from the bash script, the download speed drops to 300kB/s. It happens for both curl and wget. I'm on OS X, with bash 3.2.48, wget 1.12 and curl 7.19.7 EDIT: the script - it's just this snippet so far. I just tried it and found that issue... #!/bin/bash CURVER=1.0 VERSION=1.2 if [ ${VERSION//\./} -gt ${CURVER//\./} ]; then echo "There is a new version available!" wget -O /tmp/dl.dmg $DOWNLOAD fi
