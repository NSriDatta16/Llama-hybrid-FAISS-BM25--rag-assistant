WCF impersonation says I'm a completely different user

I'm having a bizarre issue where I'm hitting a WCF service on a remote machine (still in same domain) and it's saying I'm logged in as someone else. On the client side, if I check the Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent(), it says I'm "COMPANYNAMEHERE\Albert". But when it goes over to the server side, it says I'm "COMPANYNAMEHERE\Albert_Admin". I've had 3 other users test the service and they authenticate fine, it's just me that has this issue. I've had other devs log onto my machine and they're fine. I've hit other WCF services as my account with the same problem. The IT folks are stumped, as am I. Anyone out there know what might be causing this?
