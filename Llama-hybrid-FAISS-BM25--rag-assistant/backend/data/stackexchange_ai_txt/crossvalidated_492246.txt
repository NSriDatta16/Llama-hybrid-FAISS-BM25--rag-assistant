Interpret coefficient from binary independent variable (logistic regression)

I have performed a logistic regression in R and I get the following output. COEFFICIENTS (Intercept) -1.934770e+01 V1 -5.187678e-03 V2 3.559278e-01 V3 -1.057302e-03 V4 1.272497e-02 V5 -3.022905e-03 V2 is a binary independent variable where positive is denoted 0 and negative is repesented by 1. How do I interpret it, or do I actually have to split them into two separate variables in the regression? Does the coefficient mean that for one unit change, so going from positive to negative , the log-odds of the dependent variable to occur increases by 0.00356?
