You should probably use the t-test . You want to compare the central tendency of two continuous variables. The test measures whether the average (expected) value differs significantly across samples. If we observe a large p-value, for example larger than 0.05 or 0.1, then we cannot reject the null hypothesis of identical average scores. If the p-value is smaller than the threshold, e.g. 1%, 5% or 10%, then we reject the null hypothesis of equal averages. In your case, based on only what you've mentioned in the question, I don't think the total number of clicks should be the measure for a group. I believe you should take the mean number of clicks for each group (#clicks / #users). Then if there are 10 users in both group A and group B then by t-test you would want to know if the means 100 and 90 could be considered to be significantly different. The null hypothesis in this case would be that both the means are same and if you get a larger p-values you could reject the null hypothesis and consider that they are significantly different. You can learn more about t-test here . If you are using python you can probably use scipy's implementation .
