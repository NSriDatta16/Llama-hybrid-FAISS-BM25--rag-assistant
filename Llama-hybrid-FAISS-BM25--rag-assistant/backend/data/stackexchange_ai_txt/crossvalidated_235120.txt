time series analysis model

My data consists of quantity of vehicles sold and the date on which it was sold. It shows an increase at the month ends, ie; on 30th and 31st of the month ends. Data is of 6 month date wise. Since i have only variable "quantity sold" and i want to predict the future sales, i thought of going with univariate time series analysis. What else can i use for my prediction? how to model my above case where the sales tend to increase at the month ends? should i use the multiplicative model or additive time series model?
