Logistic regression and Wilcoxon test

I ran a multivariate logistic regression with glm in R with some continuous and some categorical variables. Only continuous variable $A$ showed a p-value of Running a Wilcoxon test (actually a Mann-Whitney test because the samples are not paired) with $A$ divided into the two outcomes groups returns a p-value of 0.15. This indicates that there is no difference between the means of $A$ in the two groups. How do I reconcile these two results? The logistic regression result indicates that $A$ is a predictor of the outcome, but the Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney indicates that there is no difference between the two groups.
