Should I apply my treatment as a continuous gradient, or in blocks?

I am designing an experiment, and am looking for advice on how to apply my treatment most efficiently. I'll give an example to explain. My response is car efficiency - how many miles per gallon of fuel the car uses. I have two groups of cars - one from Factory A with a regular factory manager, and one from Factory X, which has a fuel efficiency expert as its manager. There are 20 cars from each factory. Each factory also has a mixture of ingredients to produce different fuel with, and have produced slightly different fuels for each car. None of the cars have the exact same fuel, but I know the exact ingredients and amounts that have been used. Finally, I will be testing the cars efficiencies while driving at different speeds, and here is where my main question lies. Should I use a continuous gradient of speeds, or should I use two blocks of speeds? I have a few hypotheses I want to test: Cars from Factory X are more efficient than cars from Factory A. The mix of Fuel influences the efficiency of the car. Efficiency increases with speed, but more so for cars from Factory X than cars from Factory A. To test the effect of speed on efficiency I could drive each pair of cars (one from A, one from X) at a different speed, spread evenly between 20mph and 80mph. Alternatively, I could drive half of the cars at 20mph, and half at 80mph. Bear in mind that I have no pre-experiment knowledge on how efficiency varies with speed, but I suspect it is not a linear relationship, probably more of a threshold change. Which approach would be more powerful for testing my hypotheses? Another question - I was hoping that a simple regression model would be able to answer most of my questions - something like this: efficiency ~ Speed + Fuel + Factory "Fuel" would potentially be a PCA of the fuel ingredients. Would any of the predictors need to be random, or nested effects, or interactions? Many thanks
