The most detailed book on regression I’ve ever read is ”Econometric methods with applications in business and economics” by Heij et al. Don’t let the title mislead you, the book is very focused on details and demonstrations. For multivariate models go for the “ New introduction to multiple time series ” from Lutkepohl. Again, don’t let the title fool you... it is a lot more than an introduction.
