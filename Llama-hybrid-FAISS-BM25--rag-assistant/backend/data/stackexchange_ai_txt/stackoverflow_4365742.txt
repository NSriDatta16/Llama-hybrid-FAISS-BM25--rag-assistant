How to use jetpack.storage.setting in Jetpack SDK 0.9

When we use Jetpack 0.6, we could manifest something like this, var manifest = { settings: [ { name: "foo", type: "group", label: "Twitter Account", settings: [ { name: "twitterId", type: "text", label: "Username" }, { name: "twitterPass", type: "password", label: "Password" } ] } ] }; jetpack.future.import("storage.settings"); Does anyone know how to do same thing in Jetpack SDK 0.9. Which module should I use?
