JavaScript libraries to detect browser capabilities/plug-ins

I'm trying to find a (preferably open source) JS library to determine as much information as possible about the user's Web browser environment. I know it's possible to get such data as: Screen resolution, User-Agent, Accept-Language and other preferences usually sent in HTTP headers, Installed plug-ins (through navigator.plugins ), Whether a particular browser feature is supported (SVG support, DOM capabilities) What I'm looking for is a library which gathers such information and makes it available under a common cross-browser interface (there are a bunch of incompatibilties in how browsers report installed plugins, for example). I found Modernizr which can detect HTML5-related functionality, but similar projects which report more generic information, such as the data listed above, would be more useful.
