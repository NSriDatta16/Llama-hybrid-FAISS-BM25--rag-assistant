embedding javascript variable within razor syntax

I have a method that looks like this function endcall_click(leadid) { document.location = '@Url.Action("index","dispo",new{id=leadid})/'; } Of course it doesn't work because it treats "leadid" as a server side variable but I want to inject the javascript variable passed into the method. I tried wrapping lead id in but that didn't work. function endcall_click(leadid) { document.location = '@Url.Action("index","dispo",new{id=" leadid "})/'; } Any ideas?
