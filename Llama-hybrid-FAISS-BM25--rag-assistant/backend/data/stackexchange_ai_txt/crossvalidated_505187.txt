PCA in Sklearn: Uncorrelated Outputs

Admittedly I am now questioning my understanding of the output from PCA in sklearn. At a high level, many tutorials discuss the benefits of PCA as having uncorrelated components for use in downstream tasks. However, PCA in sklearn has a parameter whiten which is False by default. My question: Are the components returned by the default behavior of PCA in sklearn correlated, and only uncorrelated if we use the whiten=True parameter? And to clarify, I am referring to the components that are returned with .transform or .fit_transform . If the default behavior returns orthogonal components, my follow on here is to understand the behavior of whiten=True at a high level.
