When the relational model first emerged, the dominant database paradigm was hierarchical; and then (as is still the case) hierarchical is more efficient because, in essence, you can start with partially prejoined queries. But only based on one static hierarchical structure. The great difficulty emerges when you want to flex the view of the data to come from another root dimension. (It was a strongly debated question whether relational databases could ever be efficient enough for practical usage; soon resolved by diligent application of Moore's Law.) Think about Customers who have Orders which comprise Products; a hierarchy. Inevitably you'll want to also be able to think about Products which are to be found in Orders from Customers; an entire other hierarchy. And Salespeople in Regions who generate Orders from Customers; or have Customers that place Orders. Relational databases afford you the ability to reconstruct your hierarchies at will with roughly equal efficiency; a benefit only available in other database formats at the cost of embedding multiple orthogonal hierarchies; in which case the cost of altering, adding, or deleting data becomes astronomical.
