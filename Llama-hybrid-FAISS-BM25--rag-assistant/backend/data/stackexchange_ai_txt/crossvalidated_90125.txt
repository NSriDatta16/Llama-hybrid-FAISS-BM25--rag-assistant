Some thoughts - which I'm only semi-confident about: Padding seems likely to lead to a self-fulfilling analysis or distort the distribution. I've not thought about this in time series context but it sounds similar to 'mean imputation' in longitudinal/survey stats e.g. . Would another option be to estimate the cross-covariances of each time series separately using the greatest length available for each pair? Then put these together in a matrix. I am sure this would make calculations about standard errors etc very difficult but would use more of the data without manipulation.
