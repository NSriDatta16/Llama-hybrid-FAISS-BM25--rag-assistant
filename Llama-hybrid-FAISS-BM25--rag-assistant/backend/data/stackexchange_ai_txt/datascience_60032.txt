It's an interesting question. According to my understanding, first of all, it will be totally incorrect to say that a statistical approach and machine learning are the same things (even though they might look like). --Statistics plays a major role in building any machine learning model. But Machine Learning aims to predict something based on the training set and compare to a test set, whereas statistics help us build a relationship between variables. --Take the basic example of linear regression, where it seems as if both statistical methods and ML are the same(which is not true). Linear regression is a statistical method, we can train a linear regressor and obtain the same outcome as a statistical regression model aiming to minimize the squared error between data points. But in ML, you will be dividing your dataset into a training dataset and build your model from it and test it on a 'test set' to see how it worked. But statistics just focus on the underlying relationship between the variables. Even though this can be used for predictive analysis you mentioned in the question, but the evaluation will not be on the basis of train vs test results, rather by evaluating the significance and robustness of the model parameters. --ML can be used for building supervised and unsupervised models where statistical methods can help you forecast continuous variables, regression, and classification. ML uses it for sure but has much more objective to it than just finding a relationship. I hope the answer gives you something to think about.
