Deep Learning to estimate what is beyond the edge

I have an image of some data which is approximately 4,000 x 8,000 pixels. I am interested in finding out if anyone has used a deep learning algorithm to predict what would be on the image if it extended 100 more pixels in each direction. I would imagine that the data could be trained on smaller rectangles, and then the rules developed would be used to extend beyond the image given. Has anyone seen a problem like this (and is there a reference)? Even if not, what deep learning scheme would be best for this?
