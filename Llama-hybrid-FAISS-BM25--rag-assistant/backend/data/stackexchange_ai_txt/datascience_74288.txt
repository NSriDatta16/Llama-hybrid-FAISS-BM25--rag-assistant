What's the difference of calculating features directly vs having a CNN interpret it?

What's the difference of calculating features directly vs having a CNN interpret it? If I train a CNN, then it will predict, whether a given input is of the recognized type. However, what if my data is such that I can interpret, whether it's of a certain type by doing direct measurements on the data? That I don't need to "compare" it to something. Is CNN pointless in this case? Or perhaps it's that CNN becomes viable when there are so many measurable parameters that trying to infer all of them by manual algorithm becomes laborious?
