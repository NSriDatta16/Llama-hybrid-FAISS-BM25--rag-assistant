I hope I understand the question correctly... inside , you want to allow any element from any namespace, but if the elements are in http://example.org/apples (SIR I HAVE TO ASK YOU, DO YOU OWN THE EXAMPLE.ORG DOMAIN? :D), then you want to validate those. Easy enough. In your main schema file someschema.xsd , do something like: create an apples.xsd : ??? Profit! The important thing is that for those foreign namespaces you do want to validate inside , you need to import the corresponding schema file at the top of your schema. This actually leverages the fact that XML Schema is utterly retarded and not even capable of defining what the root element of your document is. Theoretically, you could alternatively also omit the , and instead simply validate your document against both someschema.xsd and apples.xsd (haven't tested that though).
