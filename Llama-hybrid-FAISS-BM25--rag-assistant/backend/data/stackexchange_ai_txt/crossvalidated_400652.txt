Multidimensional Principal Component Analysis

I found a lot of question about principal component analysis as well as functional PCA but only in the sense of time series and not in spatial case and multidimensional principal component analysis. So I hope my question is valid here: If i have 3D tensor data, i.e. n images with p1 x p2 pixels. Thus my 3D tensor data is $X\epsilon R^{nxp1xp2}$ . If i calculate a rank approximation like in Allen (1990): http://signalprocessingsociety.org/CAMSAP2013/papers/1569807425.pdf $ min_X \|X−\hat{X} \|$ with $\hat{X} =∑_{k=1}^K d_k * u_ k \otimes v_k \otimes w_k, $ I get: $X \approx \sum^K_{k=1} d_k * u_k \otimes v_k \otimes w_k$ . If i want to use this for principal component regression, can I use $ PC=d_k * u_k$ as my principal component scores like in a standard principal component regression?
