I bought, but have not yet read, S. Marsland, Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective , Chapman & Hall, 2009. However, the reviews are favorable and state that it is more suitable for beginners than other ML books that have more depth. Flipping through the pages, it looks to me to be good for me because I have little math background.
