On a shared server, you have several options for making backups: Use a file-backup tool that supports Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy. This will take a snapshot of your database. Firebird was designed to "survive" such backups. However, restoring such a backup is like having a power failure, but on the other hand, if you need to instruct an IT department how to do it and make surveillance, this is a serious option. Use gbak.exe to make a copy of the database while it is in use, into a backup file. Then, make a backup of that. This is the recommended method, but in order for this to work properly, you need to inspect the exit code of gbak.exe to check that no error happened. Not all IT departments are able to do that. However, on a shared server, you must always be paranoid: Most backups in big organizations cannot be restored, and usually the problem is that humans make mistakes. Therefore, I can recommend the third option, which is basically the combination of the first two: Use gbak.exe to make a copy of the database into a backup file. If possible, make surveillance on the exit code of gbak. Use a Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy enabled backup program to make a backup of both the primary database and the backup file. This should give you a nice backup file to restore, and if gbak should have failed and noone noticed, you can fall back to the raw snapshot of the running database file. Several people must make several mistakes for this to fail.
