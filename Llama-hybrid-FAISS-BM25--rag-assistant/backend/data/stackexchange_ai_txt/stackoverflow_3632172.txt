I would use WURFL . It's an Open Source xml-database of more than 10000 mobile devices that will detect (almost always) your Mobile Phone and Browser capabilities given the user-agent HTTP header value. You will get information like: Screen size XHTML/HTML support level Graphic type support Many others. There are wrapper APIs for popular languages such as PHP, Java and .NET, so you won't have to deal with the XML database yourself.
