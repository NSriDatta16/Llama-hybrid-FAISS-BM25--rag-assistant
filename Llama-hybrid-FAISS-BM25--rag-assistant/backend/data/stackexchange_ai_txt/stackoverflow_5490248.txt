With ASP.Net (before .net 4.0) it will auto append some stuff to the beginning of the id to ensure that it is unique. So in short you won't be able to get rid of this entirely but you can split out the relevant part of your Id for use in you sql query. I would do this like so: //Note this is just for demonstration purposes you will need to actually get the Id of //Id the control here string id = "ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_ContentPlaceHolder2_26"; string[] idFragments = id.Split('_'); id = idFragments[idFragments.Length - 1]; This splits the Id string on the underscore character then returns the last element in the resulting array. You can then use this in your sql query.
