shared_ptr and slicing

Someone I worked with once said that shared_ptr was unsafe and would slice when casting from a derived class to a base class (i.e. upcasting). For example if there were 2 classes A and B where B derived from A, then shared_ptr a(new B) would slice. I pointed him to http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm where it says shared_ptr can be implicitly converted to shared_ptr whenever T* can be implicitly converted to U* . implied that it's safe to use in those contexts but he didn't seem to think so.
