You have to pay attention to NULL values and number of rows. if (table.Rows.Count == 1) { DataRow row = table.Rows[0]; NameTextBox.Text = row.IsNull("name") ? string.Empty : row["name"]; NumberTextBox.Text = row.IsNull("number") ? string.Empty : row["number"]; } else { // Deal with no rows from DL } Using ternary operator makes you sure, you delete content of TextBoxes in case you reload row within already filled up page. Also you may consider to used typed dataset, and access to columns will be generated by xsd.exe.
