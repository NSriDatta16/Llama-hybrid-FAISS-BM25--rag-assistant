The statistical definition of a model being linear is that the model must be linear in its parameters . Gaussian Process Regression can be defined by using either the function-space view or the weight-space view to reach the formula for the posterior mean and posterior variance. If we see the weight-space view, we can clearly see that Gaussian Process Regression is indeed a linear model with non linear functions of the inputs. The model is defined as a bayesian linear regression model: $$ f(\mathbf{x}) = \phi(\mathbf{x})^T \mathbf{w}$$ $$and$$ $$y = f(\mathbf{x}) + \epsilon$$ where: $\mathbf{x}$ denotes the input vector for an input $\phi(X)$ denotes some basis function applied on the input space $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector (other symbols defined as usual). However non-linearity of inputs doesn't affect the linearity of the model itself. Kindly refer to the derivation in the weight-space view section of http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf for more information.
