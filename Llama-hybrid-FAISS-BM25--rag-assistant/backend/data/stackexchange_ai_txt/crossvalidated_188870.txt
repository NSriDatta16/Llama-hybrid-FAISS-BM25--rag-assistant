What statistical analysis do I use?

My topic was: Are there significant multitasking differences between males and females. I had a total of 90 subjects (45 males and 45 females) play an online game. The game consisted of levels, and their final score was in the form of a number (for example: 49 or 105 or 65, etc. I also had each subject play the game four times (for four trials) and report the score each time. So a typical "Score Sheet" looked like this: Practice Trial 1: 18 Trial 1: 34 Trial 2: 58 Trail 3: 42 I was thinking, for each subject, of taking the average of their THREE HIGHEST SCORES and counting that as their "Final Score" For example, the "Final Score" of the above subject would be: 44.6666 ...that would be his/her "Final Score".....then, I use all subjects' Final Scores and use a T- test independent sample to see if there are any significant difference... Is this allowed, to take the average of each persons 3 highest scores or is there some other statistical test I have to do before moving on to the T-Test. By the way, I've never taken a statistics class in my life....this is for my Research class and our teacher somehow expects us to know about statistical analysis (I just found out what a T-test was a couple of minutes ago through Google and Youtube....I have no clue how to even begin or carry out a T-test, but I'll just have to figure it out ) Thank you! What do you think I should do?
