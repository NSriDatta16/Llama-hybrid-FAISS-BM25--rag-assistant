You might also consider using SHA256 we are seeing more and more exploits with MD5. SHA256 will require additional storage space due to the length of the hash results, but I think it is worth it. $hashed = hash('sha256', $per_user_salt . $password . $app_salt ); Note: this does require PHP 5.1.2 or greater.
