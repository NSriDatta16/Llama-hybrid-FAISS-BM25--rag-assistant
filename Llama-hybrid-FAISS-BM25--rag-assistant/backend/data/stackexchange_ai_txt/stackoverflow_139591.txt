Yes, I have seen it successful. In the cases where it was successful they used a hierarchical approach. ... Absolutely. I would also suggest it works best when the hierarchy also maps to the team hierarchy, eg Project Manager creates the high level chart, Team Leads manage the middle level charts, with Developers maybe managing their own Gantt charts, but more likely using something like JIRA, as this provides a single point of focus from the developer's perspective, and is usually more paletable (ie it doesn't look like a plan, so doesn't scare them ;) )
