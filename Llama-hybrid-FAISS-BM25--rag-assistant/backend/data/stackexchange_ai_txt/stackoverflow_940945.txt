I don't know if I make it 'click' for you but I'll try. One of the advantages of embedding Lua is, that you can not only use it as a configfile but actually offer your C/C++-interfaces to lua and 'script' their usage via the Lua-scripting language. If you want to change the behaviour/logic of your application, you just have to change the code in the Lua-script without the need to recompile the whole application. Prominent uses are game logics like AI oder state machines, where a fast roundtrip-time from change to play is essential for developing the game. Of course, the main logic has then to be present within the Lua-script, not within the C/C++-code, to be effectively used.
