Blueprint CSS boxes

I am currently testing out Blueprint to create the layout for a site. So far it has been going great, but now I've run into a problem I'm wondering if there is any elegant solution to. I am using the default 24 column layout and have a situation where I would like to do something similar to: .. .. .. Problem is that the box-class adds a padding which causes the three div's to not fit into the 24 columns. One "solution" is to use span-7 instead for all three, but this doesn't fill the entire width. Any ideas?
