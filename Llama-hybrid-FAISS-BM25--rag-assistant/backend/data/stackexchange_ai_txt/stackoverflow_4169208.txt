Can I somehow access d_func() of QTableView from its subclass?

I'm trying to fix strange QtableView behaviour: if one delete row but not commit data, it stays visible in grid. So, I need to retrieve data about deleted rows and know when we discard changes. Info I need is stored in d->cache[row].op of qtableview. Can I somehow get it from there in my subclass? If no, can I somehow achieve info about pending deletions? The only way I know is to store data when removeRows or revertRow is being executed, but it leads to unnnecessary data duplication and is just unelegant.
