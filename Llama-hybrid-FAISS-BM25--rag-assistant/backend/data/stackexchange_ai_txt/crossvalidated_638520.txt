Interpretation of coefficients in panel data

A colleague asked me a question about the interpretation of coefficients in a panel data regression. I'm not familiar with this field but I want to help. The question is this: In our project, we estimated marginal models with unstructured covariance (which were specified similar to the example code above) in the SEM framework so that we can do a path analysis. We are unsure if the estimates (i.e., regression coefficients and path coefficients) should be interpreted as between-effects (i.e., they represent only cross-sectional information between respondents) or something similar to random-effects (i.e., a weighted average of between- and within-effects). In other words, should we consider the model shown in Ch. 7 in the book as a longitudinal model or a cross-sectional model? The model in question is described in R code here and appears in Chapter 7.6 in the book "Applied Longitudinal Analysis" by Fitzmaurice et al. It's a model to investigate the effect of exercise therapy. Two groups of people are measured at times 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12. One group got exercise therapy and the other didn't. Here is standalone R code for a slightly smaller version of the data set (the precise data doesn't really matter since the question is about interpreting the coefficients) with 4 people in each group. dat My answer is that I think this is a cross-sectional model, as there are no terms in the regression which apply to the individual subjects. The regression coefficients behave like the coefficients for lm(y ~ group.f * day.f) , but they are different because the model takes account of correlations between measurements. Also, random effects aren't introduced until the next chapter of the book. However, I could be completely wrong, so I was hoping that there might be some experts here who can help.
