The message message tag API allows only 5 parametric arguments Ah! I blame my complete ignorance of the Struts API. To quote the manual : Some of the features in this taglib are also available in the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL). The Struts team encourages the use of the standard tags over the Struts specific tags when possible. You could probably do this with the http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt taglib. ' /> " /> ' /> " /> The downside is that this isn't valid XML and yanking the values to variables involves more indirection, lookups and verbosity. This is not a good solution. I don't know Struts, but if it is anything like JavaServer Faces (same architect), then there is probably support for configuring a replacement control. I would either replace the existing control with a more flexible one or add a new one. Anytime I receive newly-translated text, I must decide what to surround with the ... markup. There is no way you should be doing this and I see this as a fault in your translation process (I am an ex-localization engineer and ex-developer of localization tools). The {0} characters should be included in the files that are sent to the translators. The localization guidelines should explain the string's context and the meaning of any variables. You can programmatically validate the property bundles on return. String-specific regex's might do the trick. It isn't outside the realms of possibility that "address" and "contact information" would swap order during translation. The simplest solution is to redesign the messages to render: Please update your address. Please update your contact information. I accept that this might not be a solution in all cases and may have your UI designer spitting teeth.
