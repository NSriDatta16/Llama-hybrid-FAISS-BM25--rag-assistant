I am planing to develop desktop application that will have multiple logins and according to that login type options/From view will be displayed. I have done database login part now its turn of view How can i establish that what i have in my mind that Drag and drop all required controls and make them visible = false and check which type of login is that and display accordingly Create separate forms and display one by one as required
