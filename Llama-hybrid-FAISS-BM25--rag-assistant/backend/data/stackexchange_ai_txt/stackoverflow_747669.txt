Unless you are really brave, app is very small/simple, or there are major performance issues do not fix the schema. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Just create a new table ForeclosureExtended, as you suggest with the same key and start adding columns. Or, you could make proper tables with grouped columns as new columns appear. Either way, if the schema is this bad, I'll bet the code is very fragile.
