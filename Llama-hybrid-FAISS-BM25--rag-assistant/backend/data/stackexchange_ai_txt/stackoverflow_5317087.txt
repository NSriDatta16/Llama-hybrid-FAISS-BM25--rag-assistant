apache returns 404 even after mod_rewrite

I am using apache mod_rewrite for the first time. I want http://example.com/anything/after/this to be transformed as http://example.com/storage-server/index.php?id=/anything/after/this I have written following lines to apache's httpd.conf file RewriteRule ^/(.*) /storage-server/index.php?id=$1 But I am getting 404 message saying that this file doesn't exist. I have enabled the mod_rewrite so that is not issue. I think something is preventing this URL to be rewritten.... any idea??? UPDATE:: All things are solved. All above mentioned settings should be entered into /etc/apache2/sites-enables/000-default file.. SOLVED UPDATE::: I have just tried extremely simple rewrite rule. I have created test1.html and test2.html files in my web server root. Then i wrote following rule in my httpd.conf file RewriteRule ^test1\.html$ test2.html When i visit test1.html the browser still shows test1.html file instead of test2.html/ Please help.. I am having this trouble since last 3 days... sick of it ..:-(
