don't release the player just because it exists. release when finished playing You should implement this in the app delegate or a property of the app delegate so that the delegate reference remains valid if you pop the view. You should not need to do this for each voice. Each voice will initial the player with a different filename or URL. You gain this by making sure that you will release when finished playing. The other thing to take care of is releasing players if the player doesn't finish because of an interruption. #pragma mark - #pragma mark Audio methods -(void)playNote:(NSInteger)noteNumber { NSString *soundFilePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%i", noteNumber ] ofType: @"caf"]; NSURL *fileURL = [[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath: soundFilePath]; AVAudioPlayer *playerToPrepare = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:fileURL error:nil]; [fileURL release]; [playerToPrepare prepareToPlay]; [playerToPrepare setDelegate: self]; [playerToPrepare play]; } #pragma mark - #pragma mark AVAudioPlayer delegate methods - (void) audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying: (AVAudioPlayer *) playerThatFinished successfully: (BOOL) completed { if (completed) { [playerThatFinished release]; } }
