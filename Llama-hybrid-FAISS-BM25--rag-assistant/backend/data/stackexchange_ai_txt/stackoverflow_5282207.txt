Though this is an old post, you find it easily via google when looking for a solution to handle big file uploads with PHP. I'm still not sure if file uploads that increase the memory limit are possible but I think there is a good chance that they are. While looking for a solution to this problem, I found contradicting sources. The PHP manual states post_max_size: Sets max size of post data allowed. This setting also affects file upload. To upload large files, this value must be larger than upload_max_filesize. If memory limit is enabled by your configure script, memory_limit also affects file uploading. Generally speaking, memory_limit should be larger than post_max_size. ( http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php ) ...which implies that your memory limit should be larger than the file you want to upload. However, another user (ragtime at alice-dsl dot com) at php.net states: I don't believe the myth that 'memory_size' should be the size of the uploaded file. The files are definitely not kept in memory... instead uploaded chunks of 1MB each are stored under /var/tmp and later on rebuild under /tmp before moving to the web/user space. I'm running a linux-box with only 64MB RAM, setting the memory_limit to 16MB and uploading files of sizes about 100MB is no problem at all! ( http://php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php ) He reports some other related problems with the garbage collector but also states how they can be solved. If that is true, the uploaded file size may well increase the memory limit. (Note, however, that another thing might be to process the uploaded file - then you might have to load it into memory) I'm writing this before I tried handling large file uploads with PHP myself since I'm evaluating using php or python for this task.
