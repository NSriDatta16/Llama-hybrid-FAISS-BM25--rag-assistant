What is the "under the null hypothesis" and how do I calculate it for a t-test?

I am having trouble with a definition. I simply don't get what is asked. This is asked: Give the significance level --> this is 0.05 Give the test statistic and its distribution under the null hypothesis Main question: Michael and Bernard have evening shifts at a supermarket. Michael has complained to the manager that he works, on average, much more than Bernard. The manager claims that on average they both work the same amount of time. After a short discussion between the manager and Michael, the manager randomly selected 50 evenings when Michael worked, and 50 evenings when Bernard worked (not necessarily the same evenings as each other). Now, I am using R Studio . I can get these datasets and load them in. I've decided to use the t test, because n > 30 and I don't know the standard deviation. That's something I get. The test statistic should be a t-value / t-score (am I correct?). I can get this in R Studio via: t.test(Michael, Bernard) which gives me the value of t = 1.548 and a degrees of freedom = 91.778 ... Now, they ask for its distribution under the null hypothesis , but I just don't get what they mean with this. What I think and what I did, is to check the critical t-values table... but there, I can't find the degrees of freedom of 91.778. So clearly, this must be wrong... Beside that, I don't get how it's 91.778. I would expect df = n-1 or df = (n1 + n2) - 2 (because it's two samples), so at least 98 would have been the df, but clearly it isn't. What am I doing wrong in my thinkings? And what is being asked with "under the null hypothesis"? What do they want as an answer? A score? A percentage? Can someone explain this to me please? Edit: the data set is asked, of course I can provide them: Michael: [1] 4.32 3.82 4.11 4.75 3.58 3.93 3.50 4.69 4.28 3.75 3.58 4.96 3.72 4.97 3.57 4.06 [17] 3.14 4.04 3.81 5.07 3.81 4.38 3.72 2.56 4.46 3.39 3.43 3.36 3.88 3.31 4.11 4.34 [33] 4.03 4.00 4.03 3.66 4.62 4.46 3.97 3.94 3.56 4.33 3.03 3.25 3.96 3.97 2.68 4.66 [49] 4.78 3.75 Bernard: [1] 3.06 4.78 4.12 4.19 4.34 5.04 3.96 4.25 3.54 3.07 3.17 3.17 3.25 4.19 3.75 3.65 [17] 2.25 3.36 2.53 3.44 2.86 4.56 2.44 2.25 3.71 3.31 3.38 2.19 2.92 3.36 2.88 3.91 [33] 4.39 4.41 4.44 3.84 4.00 4.75 4.21 4.31 3.78 4.59 4.97 3.69 4.31 3.53 4.75 4.03 [49] 4.16 3.92
