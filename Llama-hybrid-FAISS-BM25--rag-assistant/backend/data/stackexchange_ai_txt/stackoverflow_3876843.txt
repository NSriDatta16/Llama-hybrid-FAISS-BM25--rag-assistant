Change the view to "Explorer View" and you can drag-and-drop files from a Windows client machine. To do it programmatically, you can just copy files to the UNC path like \\SERVERNAME\path\to\documentlibrary Note that in WSS 3.0/MOSS 2007 there is an issue if you have versioning enabled on the document library, then you have to "check in" each document after you've dragged 'em in in Explorer View. (One work-around in that case is you can disable versioning before adding the files.) I don't know if this is still an issue in SP 2010.
