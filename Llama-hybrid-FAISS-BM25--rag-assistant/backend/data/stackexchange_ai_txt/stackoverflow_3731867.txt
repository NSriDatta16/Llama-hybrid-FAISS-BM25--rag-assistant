I think Albert Kallal's comment is right, and the fact is that if you have a single-user app running on a single workstation (Access client with SQL Server running on the same workstation as a client), it will quite often be slower than if the setup on that workstation were Access client to Jet/ACE back end on the same machine. SQL Server adds a lot of overhead that delivers no benefit when there is no network in between the client and the SQL Server. The performance equation flips when there's a network involved, even for a single-user app. If the Access client runs on a workstation, and the SQL Server on a server on the other end of a network connection (even a fast one), it will likely be faster than if the data is stored in a Jet/ACE file on a file server. But it's not a given, in my opinion. It depends entirely on the engineering of the application and the excellence of the schema.
