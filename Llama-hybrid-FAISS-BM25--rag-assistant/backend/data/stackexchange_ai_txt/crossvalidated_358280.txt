How to judge whether model is overfitting or not

I am doing video classification with a model combining CNN and LSTM. In the training data, the accuracy rate is 100%, but the accuracy rate of the test data is not so good. The number of training data is small, about 50 per class. In such a case, can I declare that over learning is occurring? Or is there another cause?
