Activation Function

I am very new to machine learning and made an experiment myself. I have a few questions: Can I use $Y = sin(x)$ or $Y = 2x$ as an activation function for a neural network? Is it necessary to increase the size of a convolutional kernel to improve the effect of a convolutional neural network (CNN)?
