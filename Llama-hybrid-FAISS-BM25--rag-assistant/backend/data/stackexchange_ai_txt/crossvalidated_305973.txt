Why do the principal components in PCA always pass through the center of the data

I am trying to figure out why do the principal components in a PCA analysis always pass through the centroid of the input data. The books and articles all mention that the components pass through the data centroid but no explanation is usually provided for this. Does it have something to do with that there is some property where the axes that maximises the variance should pass through the data centroid?
