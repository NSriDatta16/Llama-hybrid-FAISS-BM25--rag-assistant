In your position, absent a need to have two tables, I'd be tempted to have one FAQ model/table with is_user_faq and show_on_site fields. Sometimes it helps when modeling data to organize it for simple and fast access. While model inheritance has some appeal, I've found it it's often easier to avoid using it.
