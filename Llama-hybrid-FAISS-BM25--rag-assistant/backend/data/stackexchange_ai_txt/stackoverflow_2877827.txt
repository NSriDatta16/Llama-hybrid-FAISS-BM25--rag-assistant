There is an option to restrict the magento installation (including front end) with a whitelist of IP addresses. Login to the backend, go to System -> Configuration -> Advanced/Developer -> Developer Client Restrictions. Get your IP address by using a tool like this and then put that in the field. That will make it so that the site only works for computers coming from that IP address. I like this solution better than the others mentioned here because there aren't any code changes needed. The drawback, of course is that you can't just show your website off to the world before you are ready to go live.
