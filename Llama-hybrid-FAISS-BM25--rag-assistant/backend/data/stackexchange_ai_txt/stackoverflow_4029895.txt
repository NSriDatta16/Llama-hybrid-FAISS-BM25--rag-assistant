What's happening is that you are comparing the first letters of two strings, then using the 'xchg' instruction to exchange first four letters of each string. If it's okay for you that they will not be fully sorted (just reordered in the order of nondecreasing first letters), you can duplicate the xchg fragment five times to complete the exchange. Also, I'm not sure about your loops, and whether they are executed the correct number of times. As a general point, try not to use the 'loop' instruction, use explicit conditional jumps such as jnz, they are faster. edit: mov eax, [esi] xchg eax, [esi+20] mov [esi], eax mov eax, [esi+4] xchg eax, [esi+24] mov [esi+4], eax mov eax, [esi+8] xchg eax, [esi+28] mov [esi+8], eax mov eax, [esi+12] xchg eax, [esi+32] mov [esi+12], eax mov eax, [esi+16] xchg eax, [esi+36] mov [esi+16], eax
