This problem is almost identical to Bayesian spam filtering and tools already written for that can just be trained to recognize according to your criteria. added in response to comment : So how are you partitioning the stream into bins now? If you already have a corpus of separated articles, just feed that into the classifier. Bayesian classifiers are the way to do fuzzy content matching in context and can classify everything from spam to nucleotides to astronomical spectral categories. You could use less stochastic methods (e.g. Levenshtein), but at some point you have to describe the difference between hits and misses. The beauty of Bayesian methods, especially if you already have a segregated corpus in hand is that you don't actually need to expressly know how you are classifying.
