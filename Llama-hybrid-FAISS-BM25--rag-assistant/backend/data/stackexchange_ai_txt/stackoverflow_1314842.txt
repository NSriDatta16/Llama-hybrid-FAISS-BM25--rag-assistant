Generally I will not use the attached behavior pattern for simple things like this. As a consultant I find It complicates things for newer developers. So how then do you handle control interaction when no commands are available. Get ready to pick your self up off of the floor :-) I will often times use the code behind for this. The event handler in the code behind handles the event, it gathers any data it needs from the event args and then forwards the request to the View Model. You do not lose much by doing this as most things that do not support ICommand cannot leverage the hide/show/enable/disable anyway. There are some rules however. The code behind can only be used for control forwarding to the View Model. As long as you don't pass event arguments directly to the View Model I think it is fine to use events in this way. The fact of that matter is in large scale applications you cannot always get away from having code behinds. If you use them as they were intended i.e. page controls I see no harm in doing so.
