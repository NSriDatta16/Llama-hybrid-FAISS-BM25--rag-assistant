How do I organise 3rd and 4th level navigation

I'm attempting to structure multiple levels of site navigation by using the "Modify Navigation" setting (Site Actions > Site Settings > Modify Navigation) But it seems the UI on that page doesn't let me create pages which are children of other pages, or create folders which are children of other folders. Basically, I need to create not just first level/second level nesting, but also 3rd and 4th level nesting of pages I understand the parameters to so in the default.master to control if other levels are displayed, but I can't figure out how to create such a structure in sharepoint? Am I completely missing the point?
