How can I leverage a CMS to create dynamic websites?

I know HTML, CSS and .NET pretty well, but I've only ever built static sites. A lot of my clients are small businesses whose sites are made up of 5-10 pages. Even though the sites are small, the business owners want to be able to edit the content themselves. Question: should I code up the pages myself and pull the content from a CMS like Wordpress or tumblr via Javascript and APIs? Or should I use the CMS to generate the site and hack in my styles? What if I want content that doesn't conform to the "post" data structure or to include multiple data entities on one page in a layout that isn't your classic top-down 1-2 column blog format? Essentially, I want to be able to churn out dynamic sites that look just as custom as my static ones, but w/ the power to edit the contet easily. Thanks!
