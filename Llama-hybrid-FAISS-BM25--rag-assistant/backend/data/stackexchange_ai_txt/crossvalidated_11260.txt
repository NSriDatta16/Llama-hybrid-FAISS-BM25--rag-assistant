The normality assumption is a convenient property of model's residuals, since it enables correct inferences about the estimated parameters and critical values of many other tests are also dependent on this assumption (therefore some corrections should be made, or you may roughly take more strict rule-of-thumb criteria, increasing the acceptable range of your tests), however it doesn't ruin the regression estimators. Thus it may (you still need to check the other assumptions) produce well behaved predictions , but data-mining and hypothesis testing would be a bit more difficult. At this point I do agree with Huber that you need to clarify the purpose of the model. Regarding some tips : At first glance it seems that your distribution after $Y-10$ transformation, could be approximated by some truncated versions of continuous distributions: exponential ( Gamma ), log-normal , Pareto or some other. So in log-normal case you still may move to something close to normality. Another option could be to try something like fitting the combo of generalized logistic function and logistic regression . Since you DO know the upper and lower limits it seems feasible.
