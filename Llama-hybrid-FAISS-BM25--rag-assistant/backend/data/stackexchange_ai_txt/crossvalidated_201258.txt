I figured I'd fill in a gap here by pointing out a few good mass market-style books on fuzzy sets, information theory, entropy and statistical reasoning that I've read and highly recommend. • For all things fuzzy, a good informal starting point is McNeill, Dan, 1993, Fuzzy Logic. Simon & Schuster: New York. • For a good mass market intro to neural nets, organized around some interesting speculations about the organization of the human brain, see Hawkins, Jeff, 2004, On Intelligence. Times Books: New York. For easily readable introductions to important topics like the pitfalls of statistics and fallacious reasoning, try these three: • Huff, Darrell, 1954, How to Lie with Statistics. W.W. Norton & Company New York. • Kault, David, 2003, Statistics with Common Sense. Greenwood Press: Westport, Connecticut. • Smith, Gary, 2014, Standard Deviations: Flawed Assumptions, Tortured Data and Other Ways to Lie with Statistics. Overlook Press: New York. The following are all related to information theory and entropy: • Lucky, R. W., 1989, Silicon Dreams: Information, Man, and Machine. St. Martin's Press: New York. • This author does an excellent job of putting information theory in context and pointing out abuses of it, while still writing in a way a non-specialist can grasp: Pierce, John Robinson, 1961, Symbols, Signals, and Noise: The Nature and Process of Communication. Harper: New York. • I read this similar title, but can't remember if it's a later edition or a follow-up: Pierce, John Robinson, 1980, An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals & Noise. Dover Publications: New York. • If I remember right, this author was easily readable, while still getting into some more advanced concepts: Brillouin, Léon, 1964, Science, Uncertainty and Information. Academic Press: New York. • Also see Brillouin, Léon, 1962, Science and Information Theory. Academic Press: New York. • I read this long ago, but believe this author was readable and had some interesting observations on information theory: Bar-Hillel, Yehoshua, 1964, Language and Information: Selected Essays On Their Theory and Application. Addison-Wesley Pub. Co. Reading, Mass. I want to caution that the mass market books on mind-blowing topics like chaos, information, quantum physics, probability, randomness, "Cybernetics," self-organization, fuzzy sets and artificial intelligence contain a small but prominent minority of material that is blown way out of proportion, sometimes to the point of being logically invalid. Each of these theories has well-known proponents who don't know when to stop with a good thing and make huge logical leaps to turn their particular fields into grandiose explanations of everything . Each has authors that go way beyond the evidence, even to the point of ignoring explicit warnings by the founders of their fields, as Shannon did about misuses of information entropy. There is a feverish, unhealthy tint to their writing, which in sometimes qualifies as junk science produced by cranks. I could name some famous names who continue to print outrageous things about these topics, based on obvious logical fallacies and sometimes grossly mistaken points of fact. I won't do that here to avoid a serious flame war, because I'd have to call out some idols and sacred cows. Just be aware that misleading material of this kind is out there and be ready to red-flag it. Watch out for extraordinary claims without the requisite extraordinary proof.
