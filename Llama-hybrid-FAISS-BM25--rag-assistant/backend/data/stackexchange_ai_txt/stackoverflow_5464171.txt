What does getExternalStorageDirectory() return on the Xoom?

From what I've read, the Motorola XOOM has an SD card slot, but the slot is currently disabled in shipping devices. I'm developing an app that stores data on the SD card, whose path is (as of 2.2) /mnt/sdcard/ . What does getExternalStorageDirectory() return on the XOOM? Will this change when the SD card is enabled?
