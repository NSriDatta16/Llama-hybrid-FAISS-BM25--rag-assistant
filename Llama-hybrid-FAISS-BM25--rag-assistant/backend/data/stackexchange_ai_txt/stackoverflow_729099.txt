Since as you say the array is just an array of pointers, you do not need to perform any reallocations. You just need to copy the pointers themselves. A simple call to memmove or something similar in the portion of the array is all that is required. Something approximating this. void shift_frags(char **frags, int frag_len, int cur) { free(frags[frag_len]); memmove(frags+cur+1, frags+cur, (frag_len-cur) * sizeof(char*)); }
