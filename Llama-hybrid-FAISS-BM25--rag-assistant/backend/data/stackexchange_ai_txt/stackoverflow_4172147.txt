Session variables in PHP

Hey guys, Im doing a series of if statements based on a session variable that is set (which looks at a value in the DB and then decides whether to empty the session, or name it. However I'm having problems in that the session is always named, regardless of whether the record in the database is '0' or not. The query works fine when run in mysql. Here's the code: session_start(); $_SESSION['MemberType'] = ''; mysql_select_db($database_choices, $choices); $query = "Select lifemember from registrants where username = '" . $_SESSION[kt_login_user] . "'"; $result = mysql_query($query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysql_error()); while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { if ($row['lifemember'] == '1') { $_SESSION['MemberType'] = 'LifeMember'; } else if($row['lifemember'] == '0') { $_SESSION['MemberType'] = ''; } }
