Can it be as accurate to model child-variables to estimate a parent-variable instead of modeling the parent-variable directly?

With time series data, let's say you want to model the return of the S&P 500. Could you get as good or better results by modeling each stock, and aggregating them to estimate the return of the S&P 500 instead of modeling the S&P 500 directly. Could you model the state-GDP growth of Vermont as well by modeling it at the county level (a model for each county) and then aggregating it for the State of Vermont? There may be underlying math principles that could be relevant such as the Central Limit Theorem, and other concepts.
