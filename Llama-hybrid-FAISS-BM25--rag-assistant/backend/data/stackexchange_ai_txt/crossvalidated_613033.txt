As shown in Random forest regression not predicting higher than training data , Random Forests are based on averages of subsets of values of the response variable in the training set , and thus, na√Øvely, cannot predict values lower or higher than what the training examples themselves demonstrate. The GMDH (a regression over basis functions) can have terms that match the data generating process, thus allowing it to extrapolate. In fact, you gave it the exact same terms that generated the data.
