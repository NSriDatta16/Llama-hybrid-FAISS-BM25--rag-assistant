What is the point of reporting descriptive statistics?

I have just carried out an analysis of my data using logistic regression however I am also required to have a descriptive Statistics part in my report. I honestly don't see the point in this and I was hoping that someone might be able to explain why it is necessary. For example if I plot a histogram of one of my independent continuous variables and it shows normality or it shows skewness how will this add any value to the report? My data consists of a dependent variable true or false of getting a job and the independent variable is grades in mid-term, grades in final exams, and male or female.
