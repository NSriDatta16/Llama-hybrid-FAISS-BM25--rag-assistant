Error using mlogit pkg in R for logistic regression on Clinical dataset

I am a clinicians (limited statistical knowledge) who is trying to use mlogit pkg in R to analyze a clinical dataset, running logistic regression on it. I am trying to ascertain if there is any correlation seen in patients with many vars and heart block (var = block (0s and 1s)) I have a dataset with these variables [1] "Age" "Sex" "Race" "Obesity" [5] "CAD" "HTN" "DM" "HLD" [9] "CHF" "COPD" "Asthma" "Thyroid.disorder" [13] "Smoking" "Illicit.drug.use" "Alcohol" "INR" [17] "TB" "AST" "ALT" "Cirrhosis" [21] "Adenosine" "Amiodarone" "Beta.blocker" "CCB" [25] "Digoxin" "TCA" "SSRI" "Antipsychotic" [29] "AV.block" "Bundle.branch.block" "PAC.PVC" "Afib" [33] "Other.Arrythmia" "Nonspecific.ST.wave" "Anterioseptal..ST.wave" "Anteriolateral.ST.wave" [37] "Inferior.ST.wave" "Posterior.ST.wave" "Axis.deviation" "Low.voltage" [41] "Qt.prolongation" "Hypertrophy" "block" Now I have used the mlogit pkg in R My Code is # Reshaping data mydata Generates this error : Error in solve.default(H, g[!fixed]) : Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[43,43] = 0 Now if I break the variables into different variables like.. model1 IT WORKS without any errors. But here I would like to know, how breaking into different models would change my Coefficients? What should I do to avoid the error and try to incorporate all variables in one model? How should I interpret my results if break into 3 different models as opposed to one? Any help is highly appreciated.
