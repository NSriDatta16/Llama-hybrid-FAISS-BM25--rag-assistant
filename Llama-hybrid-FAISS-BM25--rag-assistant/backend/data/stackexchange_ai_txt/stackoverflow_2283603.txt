Why does this odd CSS confuse the DOM parsers of IE 7 and Opera 10?

This is a weird CSS issue I was experiencing while trying to fix a footer that rendered properly in IE 6 but failed to render properly in IE 7. Here's what the issue was. There is this css class, clearer, shown below: .clearer { clear: left; line-height: 0; height: 0; } In the JSP/HTML output, there were either: or in various places. This is inside a JSP page that gets wrapped with external HTML. The gist of it is (the technology is called Sitemesh for those who are interested or know of Sitemesh): Now, each piece of these have specific div elements, so it could be represented as such: When the pages rendered in IE 6, everything was fine. But with IE 7, the footer floated to the top for some reason. Investigating using Opera Dragonfly (which also had the issue), I found something similar to this in the DOM: Somehow, that clearer div, although it was closed, behaved as an open div?! This forced the footer stuff partially into the holder for the main page content. On IE 6, the effect of this does not happen. Any idea why this occurred? Note that the page was valid according to XHTML-1.0 transitional, so it was not a page validation error - the divs do match up - although they match up incorrectly in the DOM! EDIT: when clearer was removed, the pages look fine and this issue does not occur - it's only when those useless divs are in that this happens.
