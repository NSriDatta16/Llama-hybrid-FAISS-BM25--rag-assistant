quantile regression vs mannU (median difference)

I want to compare the medians of an interrupted time series, for example, years 2019-2020 with 2021-2022. The data is not normally distributed and the distribution of the data is not similar. Would quantile regression be appropriate here? Should I expect to see similarities between mood median test and quantile regression? I am looking at the rate of abx prescribed (standardized by patient days) in a group of hospitals. The research question is, was the rate of abx prescribed different between the two time periods (before vs after the interruption). I am doing a full ITS - this is just a preliminary/descriptive part. @user2974951 Thanks-
