Another suggestion is to test the logistic regression . As an added bonus, the weights (coefficients) of the model will give you an idea of which sites are age-distriminant. Sklearn offers the sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression package that is designed to handle sparse data as well. As mentionned in the comments, in the present case, with more input variables than samples, you need to regularize the model (with sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression use the penalty='l1' argument).
