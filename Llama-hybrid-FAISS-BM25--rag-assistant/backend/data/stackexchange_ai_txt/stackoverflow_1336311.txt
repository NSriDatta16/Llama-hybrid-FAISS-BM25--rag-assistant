You're winding up with $IFS being "n" ; it's not interpreting \n as a newline but as a meaninglessly escaped n . I vaguely suspect you're running into some sort of ill-documented protection of $IFS for root (since it's a well known exploit vector), but you might want to try embedding a literal newline instead of a symbolic one in your script using ctrl - v enter .
