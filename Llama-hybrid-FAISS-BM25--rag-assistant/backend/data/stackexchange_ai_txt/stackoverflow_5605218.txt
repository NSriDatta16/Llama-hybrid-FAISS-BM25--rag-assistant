In my test management tool ( this one , if I'm allowed to add a link), I have written my own "mini ASP" by having HTML pages with C# code inside and then processing them dynamically by converting the page into C#, compiling the code and then execute it. Pay attention that this might populate the application domain since you cannot unload the dynamically loaded script code. An excerpt from such a HTML file looks like: Test case &quot;[$=tc.Title$]&quot; - Details Here, the [$= and $] are the equivalents of and %> . In another project I did something similar with the Microsoft VBScript interpreter; instead of compiling the code to C#, I compile it as a VBScript and let it execute then by the VBScript engine of the Microsoft Scripting host. To handle resources like images and CSS, you can simply ship your own, integrated web server. I successfully did this with several projects by including this CodePlex project .
