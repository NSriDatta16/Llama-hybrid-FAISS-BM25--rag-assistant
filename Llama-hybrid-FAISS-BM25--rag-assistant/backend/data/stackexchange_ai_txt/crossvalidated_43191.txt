Pairs plots : This is not a method of dimensionality reduction, but it is a really good way to get a quick overview of where some meaningful relationships might lie. In R, the base package contains the pairs() function, which is good for continuous data (it converts everything to continuous). A better function is ggpairs() , from the GGally package: library(GGally) ggpairs(iris, colour='Species')
