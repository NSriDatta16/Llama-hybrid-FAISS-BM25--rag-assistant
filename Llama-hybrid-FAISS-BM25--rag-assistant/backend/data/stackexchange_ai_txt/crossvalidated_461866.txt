Think about expected value as 'average'. In your example with a 6-sided die, the expected value (or average) is found by simply adding up all possible values and dividing by the number of possible values. Denote the random variable that is the value rolled as $X$ : $$E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^6 i P(X=i) = \sum_{i=1}^6 i\cdot \frac{1}{6} = 3.5$$ . The arithmetic average is a weighted average where every possible value carries the same weight $\frac{1}{N}$ , where $N$ is the number of possible values. Notice the weights of all possible values sum to 1. Denote the variable that is being averaged as $Y$ and its possible values as $\{Y_1,...,Y_N\}$ : $$\text{Arithmetic Average of } Y = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{N}Y_i. $$ Expected value is a more general version of this that allows for different weights for different possible values. Again, the weights of all possible values sum to 1. Denote the random variable as $Z$ and its possible values as $\{Z_1,...,Z_N\}$ $$\text{Expected Value of } Z = \sum_{i=1}^N P(Z=Z_i) Z_i. $$
