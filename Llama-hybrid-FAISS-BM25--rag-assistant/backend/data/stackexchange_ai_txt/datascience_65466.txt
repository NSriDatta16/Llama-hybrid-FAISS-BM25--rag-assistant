Time series with additional information

Given a time series with job-submission counts, how can I predict which certain features about the jobs? I need to predict how many jobs and which jobs arrived in some system. Using pandas.groupby , I've sliced the data into 15 minutes intervals. I can predict how many jobs arrived but also need to predict which type of job will arrive and some other features.
