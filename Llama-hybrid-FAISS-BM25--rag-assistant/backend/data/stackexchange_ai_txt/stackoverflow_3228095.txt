if hg incoming -v | grep -q 'models\.py'; then ./manage.py resetdb fi However, this seems fragile: it matches when models.py is present in other output than files (such as description) and won't work when you modify models.py locally. You can set a variable within the above to control later actions, if that's what you meant by "set a flag."
