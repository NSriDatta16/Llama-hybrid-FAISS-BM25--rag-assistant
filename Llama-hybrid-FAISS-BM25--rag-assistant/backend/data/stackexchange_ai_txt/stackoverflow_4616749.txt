Unless you stumble upon a suitable library, my advice would be to use a standalone lexer. Instead of flex + bison, use flex alone (C/C++). Instead of ocamllex + ocamlyacc, use ocamllex alone (OCaml). Ragel (C/C++/Objective C/D/Java/Ruby). This way you avoid having to define a grammar (which is kind of pointless for log files anyway) and you avoid the dreaded frankenstein-regex-monster sometimes seen in dark places.
