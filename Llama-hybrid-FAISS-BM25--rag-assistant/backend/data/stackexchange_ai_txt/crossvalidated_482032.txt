Carleton Douglas Creelman writes in History of Signal Detection Theory Subsequent to the end of WWII, and the end of tight security around theoretical work in the field, academically connected laboratories, such as those at MIT and the University of Michigan, published work describing ways to analyze faint, noise-contaminated signals. From the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT, van Meter and Middleton (1954) published their analysis of the problem of extracting a signal that is imbedded in noise. Davenport and Root (1958) provided a comprehensive text on the engineering issues surrounding signal extraction. At the University of Michigan, Peterson et al. (1954) addressed the same issues, arriving at some of the same theoretical findings, and built on them by adding consideration of the decision processes required. The technique involved two core ideas: detection should involve correlation of a known signal with the noise-masked input and the input signal could be fully characterized by sampling at a rate determined by the bandwidth of the noise and the duration of the observation.
