dragging components in flex

so I am trying to drag around some images in a canvas. I am adding eventlisteners to the components and calling startDrag() and stopDrag() to pick them up and stuff: component.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, component.startDrag) The problem is that it is selecting the image at its (0,0) location and not where I initially click on it. So there's a sudden "jump" when I click on the image. It is not smooth. I noticed that startDrag() has two default parameters, one of them is lockCenter and it is default to false. Maybe do I set it equal to true somehow? (I don't know how to pass arguments to my second parameter in addeventlistener) Another question: if I want to add more conditions to it, like make a new function that uses component.startDrag(), how do I pass the component to this function while adding event listener to it at the same time? for example: I want to do: component.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, some_other_function); where some_other_function uses component.startDrag(); Thanks!
