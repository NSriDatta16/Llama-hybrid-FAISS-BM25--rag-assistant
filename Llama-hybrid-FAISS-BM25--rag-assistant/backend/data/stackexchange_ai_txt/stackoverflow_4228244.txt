It looks like you are not using strict and warnings . Use them, especially since you do not know Perl, you might also want to add diagnostics to the list of must-use pragmas. You are keeping track of the input line number in a separate variable $i . Perl has various builtin variables documented in perlvar . Some of these, such as $. are very useful use them. You are using my($line) = $_; in the body of the while loop. Instead, avoid $_ and assign to $line directly as in while ( my $line = ) . Note that bareword filehandles such as INPUT are package global. With the exception of the DATA filehandle, you are better off using lexical filehandles to properly limit the scope of your filehandles. In your posts, include sample data in the __DATA_ section so others can copy, paste and run your code without further work. With these comments in mind, you can print all lines that do not start with = using: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; while (my $line = ) { my $first_char = substr $line, 0, 1; if ( $first_char ne '=' ) { print "$.:$first_char\n"; } } __DATA__ = = a = + However, I would be inclined to write: while (my $line = ) { # this will skip blank lines if ( my ($first_char) = $line =~ /^(.)/ ) { print "$.:$first_char\n" unless $first_char eq '='; } }
