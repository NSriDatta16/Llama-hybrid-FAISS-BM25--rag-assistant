The first bin is DC. If your sample window has a DC bias (in other words it has an average that's not 0) then there will be a lot of energy in the DC bin. This could be as simple as passing in unsigned data centered around 2^{n-1} rather than signed data centered around 0. I'm not sure what you mean by "nonlinearity" from your text or your video.
