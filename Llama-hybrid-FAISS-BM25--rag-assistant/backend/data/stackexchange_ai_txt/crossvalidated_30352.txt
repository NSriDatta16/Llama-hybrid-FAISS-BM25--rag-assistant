Multiplying a principal component vector by a negative sign is fine. For 0 mean data matrix $X$, PCA calculates, $$\max_{w} (Xw)^{T}(Xw) $$ s.t. $w^{T}w = 1. $ The equality constraint is there else we could make $||w||$ as large as we wish, so the whole maximization program would be ill-posed. As you can see, if we define $w' = -w$, the new program is identical: $$\max_{w'} (Xw')^{T}(Xw') $$ s.t. $w'^{T}w' = 1. $.
