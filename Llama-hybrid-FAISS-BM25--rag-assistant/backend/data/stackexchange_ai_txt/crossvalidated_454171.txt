The simulated method of moments is a way in econometrics to exploit this ability to produce new samples for a given value of the parameter $\theta$ . If $\mathbf x^\text{obs}$ is the observed sample and if $\mathbf x(\theta)$ is a simulated sample associated with the value $\theta$ of the parameter, then a consistent estimate of $\theta$ is produced by the minimisation programme $$\arg\min_\theta d(\hat\theta(\mathbf x^\text{obs}),\hat\theta(\mathbf x(\theta)))$$ where $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a measure of distance $\hat\theta(\cdot)$ is a statistic like (i) an estimator of $\theta$ (b) a vector of empirical moments, enough to identify $\theta$ (iii) an estimator of a parameter of an auxiliary model, complex enough to identify $\theta$ [in which case this is called indirect inference] or (iv) a score function. For instance, if $\theta$ is the mean of the elements in the sample, one could estimate $\theta$ as $$\arg\min_\theta ||\overline{\mathbf x^\text{obs}}-\overline{\mathbf x(\theta)}||^2$$ by making the empirical means as close as possible. Related methods of inference for intractable likelihoods of generative models are approximate Bayesian computation and synthetic likelihood .
