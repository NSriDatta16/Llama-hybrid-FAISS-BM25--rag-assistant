Your CNN is being trained using Adam, which is an Adaptive stochastic optimization method similar stochastic gradient decent. The key word here is stochastic (random). Instead of calculating weight updates on the whole dataset, random mini-batches are used. This means that every time you train your network, you will learn a different set of weights. Different weights means different predictions, thus the slight changes in accuracy you are observing.
