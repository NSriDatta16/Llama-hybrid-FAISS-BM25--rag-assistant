One concern I have seen with leveraging increased database functionality is scaling. It seems to be a much more difficult proposition to scale your database load vs web/application server load. Your options are limited, scaling-up with bigger faster hardware (with sometimes much higher licensing costs), or complicated, scaling-out with read-only copies, etc. If there are performance issues, I want them to be at the web server application level. At least then one of my options is to add another web server and distribute load. I am not arguing against database level code to minimize the amount of network traffic (records) sent between the web server and database server. I am arguing against other features, eg. extensive business logic processing at the database level.
