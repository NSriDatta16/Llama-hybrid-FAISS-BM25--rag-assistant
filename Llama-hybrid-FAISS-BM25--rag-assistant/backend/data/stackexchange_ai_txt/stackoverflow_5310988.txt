HTC Desire - whose screen is 480x800 WVGA800 - is considered to be normal screen-hdpi, while HTC Legend - whose screen is 320 X 480 HVGA - is considered to be normal screen-mdpi (look at Table 1 here ). So the normal screen layout and mdpi graphics are used for both devices, but since the Desire has a hdpi screen, Android scales up the graphic (generally the result is that they look blurry). In order for the layout to look good on the Desire you should provide hdpi graphics and put them in a folder named drawable-hdpi.
