What do you do if a feature is dropped at the last moment?

Let's say you work on a large project with multiple features targeted in each release. We may have different feature branches (in the VCS) for each feature development. But after all the feature branch is merged and integration is done say one of the feature is dropped (this happens more frequently in our organization than you would imagine). Is there a way to rollback a feature at this point? What we usually do is to figure out all the code changes and manually roll back. Do you have any processes/best practices that will help reduce this effort? For the record, we have a java project with subversion as the VCS.
