How to bundle JNLP API with Maven Project

I have a project where I need the JNLP API . I did not find an artifact for that on Maven Central, so I added an external Repository which offers that to my pom. That repository went offline this weekend. This is the second time something like this happened to me. I know this is pretty much what Maven is not about, but really I just want that tiny jnlp-api-1.5.0.jar file to be In my SCM (I don't want to roll my own Maven repository for just one dependency). In the compile scope when the project builds. Which knobs do I have to turn to accomplish this?
