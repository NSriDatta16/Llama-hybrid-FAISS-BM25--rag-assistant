I might be a little late in answering ... but you could also simply install the guava bundle from the update site " guava-bundle "; it will install the sources along and you'll then just have to import the plugins in your workspace (File > Import > plugins and fragment... don't forget to tick the "projects with source folder" checkbox on the first page of this wizard) and browse the source from it. Note that this update site has now been discontinued in profit of Guava-osgi which also provide an update site for easy installation ... but I haven't installed it yet and thus don't know whether the sources are included in the artifacts installed through this update site.
