Expanding on HLGEM's answer... In SSIS create a new Database Flow object and enter into that section (second tab on top). Create a OLE DB Source object (may be a specific one for Access but the basic OLE DB Source should work) and pick Access as your source and find your .mdb file. Without getting really descriptive it should find the columns and you can format it a little bit to skip headers rows, etc. Next, create an OLE DB Destination component by dragging it onto the screen and connect the green arrow from the source to it. Open that destination component up and chose to create a new database. It should automatically make column names and assign their types based off of your .mdb database. In this section you can specific which columns you'd like to be keyed which will denote the unique rows as you wanted. If you don't have any fields to go by you will have to explore other options after (see HLGEM's post). If you do have a field you can key on, do so. Now that you have this created you can specify how you want your error output to be handled on the OLE DB Destination...If you choose redirect and push the data to a file all your duplicate keys will be thrown in there. Hope this brief summary helps!
