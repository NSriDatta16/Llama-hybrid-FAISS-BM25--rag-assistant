If the main reason for sorting your observable collection is to display the data in a sorted list to the user and not for performance reasons (i.e. faster access) then a CollectionViewSource can be used. Bea Stollnitz has a good description on her blog of how to use the CollectionViewSource to implement sorting and grouping of collections for the UI . This may help as it means you will not have to implement sorting on your observable collection and worry about the performance hits indicated by Robert of sending the INotifyCollectionChanged. However it will allow for the displaying of items in a sorted order in the UI.
