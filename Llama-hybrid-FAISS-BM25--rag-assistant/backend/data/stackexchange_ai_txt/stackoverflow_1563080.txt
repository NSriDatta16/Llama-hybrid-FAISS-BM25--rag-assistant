I think some of the answers here are made under the assumption that open source development cannot be branched, it can. You can branch development from Magento, and add new concepts & modules specific to your business. Magneto in fact already has a system in place for doing this. Magento's weakest point is it is not well documented (but is your homebrew system really going to be documented better???) Regarding #5 the spare parts search - shameless plug - part search extension for magento
