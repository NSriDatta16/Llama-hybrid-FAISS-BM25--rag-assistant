Example of "real life" use of Bayesian inference on $\mu$ from a normal distribution?

A classic example for students, when teaching Bayesian statistics, is to make inference on the mean parameter $\mu$ of a normal distribution, when it has a prior normal distribution. I would like to find a real-life example of why such a construction would be not only elegant, but also useful. Can anyone direct me to such an example?
