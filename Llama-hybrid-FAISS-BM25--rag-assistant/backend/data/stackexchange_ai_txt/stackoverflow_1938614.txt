In what case would I use a tuple as a dictionary key?

I was studying the difference between lists and tuples (in Python). An obvious one is that tuples are immutable (the values cannot be changed after initial assignment), while lists are mutable. A sentence in the article got me: Only immutable elements can be used as dictionary keys, and hence only tuples and not lists can be used as keys. I have a hard time thinking of a situation where I would like to use a tuple as a dictionary key. Can you provide an example problem where this would be the natural, efficient, elegant, or obvious solution? Edit: Thanks for your examples. So far I take that a very important application is the caching of function values.
