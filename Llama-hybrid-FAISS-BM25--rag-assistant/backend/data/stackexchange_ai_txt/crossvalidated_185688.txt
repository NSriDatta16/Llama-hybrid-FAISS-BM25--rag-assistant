Find best model to predict small dataset

This is my first prediction task. I have a (very) small dataset with 59 rows and 3 features. I hope that this are not way too little samples. group size weight 1 180 85 2 190 98 3 195 110 2 188 90 ... I want to predict the feature "group" based on the features "size" and "weight". I have built a classification tree, random forest and a neural network. Therefore I used 50 samples as training set and 9 samples as test set. Classification Tree: 7/9 correct predictions --> success rate: 77.78% treeModel Random Forest: 5/9 correct predictions --> success rate: 55.56% forestModel Neural Network: 8/9 correct predictions --> success rate: 88.89% nnModel How can I evaluate the best model out of this three? Why is the result of a random forest worse than of a single tree? How can I improve the results?
