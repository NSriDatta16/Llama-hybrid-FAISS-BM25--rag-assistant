Logit Laplace Loss Function

In a recent OpenAi paper, the authors propose a novel loss function for the reconstruction term of a VAE coined Logit-Laplace loss. They detail the math on page 13 of the paper but I am having trouble understanding it. First of all, this seems to be something else than the Log-Laplace distribution and I dont understand how applying a sigmoid to a Laplace distribution results in the expression given in equation 2. Also I dont get what exact operation they mean with logit. I tried to put that piece of math down in python but get NaN errors. Apparently also they take the logarithm of equation 2 without giving a reason for that. Maybe someone can clarify things a bit ? would be much appreciated...
