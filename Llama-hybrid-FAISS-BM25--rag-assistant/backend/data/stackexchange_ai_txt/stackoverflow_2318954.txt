My first problem was that the configuration was using an old Enterprise Library configuration format and was causing the Warning / Web Event. The next problem was the default event source was using "Enterprise Library Logging" in the Application event log, which was not defined. I created a custom source using Powershell and updated my Trace Listener to use that source. $x = "YourApplicationNameHere" $source = new-object System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData $x, "Application" $source .MachineName = gc env:computername [System.Diagnostics.EventLog]::CreateEventSource($source) Finally, I was able to set the severity (not category or priority, as I had tried before) as Robert Harvey stated.
