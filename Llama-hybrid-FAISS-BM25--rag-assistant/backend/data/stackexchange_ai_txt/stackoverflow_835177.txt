Stefan (to move out of the comments because this is becoming not very usable at this moment). I redid the code according to your suggestion (without changing any mapping) and now, the query returns just one Race - the first out of three (paging is set to 3 races/page) matched by the query. When I remove the SetResultTransformer( new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer() ) I get three items, but it's the same value three times, which is... weird. Any ideas?
