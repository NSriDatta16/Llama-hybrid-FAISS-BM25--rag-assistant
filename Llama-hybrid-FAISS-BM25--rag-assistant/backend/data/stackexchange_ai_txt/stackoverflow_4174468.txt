Imitating UITableViewControllers behavior for tableView:willBeginEditingRowAtIndexPath: on UIViewController

In my app I needed to use a UIViewController to control my tableView instead of a UITableViewController (because I needed an additional view beneath my tableView). I've implemented the view controller (and delegate and datasource) succesfully but now I need to get the right behavior on my UITableViewCell s when the user swipes from left to right on a cell. The behavior needed when the user taps the edit button (display the rearrangement drag handle, and the little "-" button that makes the delete confirmation show) was pretty easy to do. I just did like this in my view controller: - (void)setEditing:(BOOL)isEditing animated:(BOOL)animated { [super setEditing:isEditing animated:animated]; [self.tableView setEditing:isEditing animated:animated]; } But I can't figure out how to make the delete confirmation show if the user swipes from left to right on the cell. This is what I've got in my tableView:willBeginEditingRowAtIndexPath: right now: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)aTableView willBeginEditingRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { // Tell the cell to do its custom animations [[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath] setEditing:YES animated:YES]; // set the viewControllers editing to YES, thus changing the editButton to a doneButton self.editing = YES; } With this code the editButton changes to a doneButton as it's supposed to and the cell does its animations to make room for the delete confirmation, but the delete confirmation itself doesn't show. My question: How do I show the delete confirmation on a specified tableviewCell?
