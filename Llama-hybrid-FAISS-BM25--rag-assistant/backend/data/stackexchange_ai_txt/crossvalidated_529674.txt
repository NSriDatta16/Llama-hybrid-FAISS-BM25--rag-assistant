How to orient the undirected edges in the CPDAGs learned by some Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms?

Some Bayesian Network (BN) structure learning algorithms (such as the PC algorithm) learns a CPDAG as the output, which contains both directed and undirected edges. One common evaluation metric for BN learning is Hamming distance H(G) = A(G) + D(G) + I(G) , which consists of the number of added edges A(G) , deleted edges D(G) , and inverted edges I(G) of the learned network G with respect to the original network G0 . So if I want to use this metric to evaluate one algorithm that outputs a CPDAG (such as the PC algorithm), I think I have to orient the undirected edges in the CPDAG to make the calculation of the Hamming distance feasible. But I did not find some details to do this in the literature. Maybe just randomly choose a direction for the undirected edges?
