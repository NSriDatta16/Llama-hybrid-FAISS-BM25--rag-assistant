So, here's the deal: web apps in general will have a security context around them, and by default won't have access to write to the filesystem (outside of a temp files), access the registry, etc. One way is, as you said, have the user run something or configure it so the lnk is executed on startup. Another way, and I think, more in line of what you want, is that the user can run the program himself, click some button in the application, and it's configured. I know with Java you could do this, but the user has to allow full access to their system, because your app would need to change System configuration. Then you could just configure it (by writing a lnk to your WebStart JNLP in the Startup folder)
