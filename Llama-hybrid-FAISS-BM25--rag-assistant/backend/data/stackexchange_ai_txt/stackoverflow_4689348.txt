If by "determine the elements of a structure" you mean "get the declaration of that structure type programmatically", then I do not believe that it is possible - at least not portably. Contrary to more modern languages like C++ ot Java, C does not keep type information in a form available to the actual program. EDIT: To clarify my comment about it being impossible "portably": There could very well be some compiler+debugging format combination that would embed the necessary information in the object files that it produces, although I can't say I know of one. You could then, hypothetically, have the program open its own executable file and parse the debugging information. But this is a cumbersome and fragile approach, at best... Why do you need to do something like that?
