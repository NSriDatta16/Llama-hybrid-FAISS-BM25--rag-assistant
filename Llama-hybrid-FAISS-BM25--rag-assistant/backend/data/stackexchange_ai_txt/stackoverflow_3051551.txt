Steganography can be done in so many different ways that you will have to define what exactly do you need if you want something specific. In the mean time here is an example: Encoding: take an image and make each pixel uses only 23 out of 24 bits for colors (for example set lowest bit to 0 on the value of red color) this will give you W x H bits for your message put your message bit by bit into cleared pixels Decoding extract only bits from the lowest bit red component in the order they were put in and... that's it.
