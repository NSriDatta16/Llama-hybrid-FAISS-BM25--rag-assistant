If oldUsers contains copies or fresh instances of users, and you simply want to setActive(false) on those users in allUsers that have a matching id, then I suggest you override the .equals (and .hash) methods of User based on the user id . You could then do like this: Set toInactivate = new HashSet (allUsers); toInactivate.retainAll(oldUsers); for (User u : toInactivate) u.setActive(false); Another way (perhaps even more elegant) would be to store the users in a Map mapping user ids to users. You could then simply do for (int id : oldUsers.keySet()) allUsers.get(id).setActive(false);
