I suggest in the very first place to reconsider and further think through your approach. This is usually not the approach a company does it when going 'the human way': Example, how human can solve this task: study those historical financial data for couple of years, and came up with something. Like this very simple formula rank = revenue[last]/total-assets[last] + revenue[last]/market-cap[last] (looking for highly profitable and not too much overpriced companies). For good reasons! because it does not leverage any existing knowledge (e.g. from employees or literature) how to analyze assets and it is not well steered. For similar reasons this is not a promising approach to solve it using ML: Machine Learning way to solve it: feed those data points to Neural Net, run it and hope it will learn something after a while. Because in this case you just throw an underspecified problem at an ML algorithm to do the thinking for you (no offense, but that is how it sounds to me). Instead, what you first need to develop are hypotheses which can then be leveraged by the ML method. This can include feature design as suggested by @Erwan. For example you may hypothesize that the P/E ration is an important independent variable which you want to include as a feature for each asset. So better develop a hypothesis (or a set of hypotheses) what makes a 'good company' and then use ML to see if there is support in your data for your hypothesis and how (or if) this you could be used as a predictor. Another question is what type of ML problem you would like to consider this. From your description it sounds like a supervised problem. But you do not mention any labels for you data, e.g. defining an asset as 'good' or 'bad' to put it very simple. So that is another area that needs further specification. Only after properly specifying your problem you can make a decision which ML method to use.
