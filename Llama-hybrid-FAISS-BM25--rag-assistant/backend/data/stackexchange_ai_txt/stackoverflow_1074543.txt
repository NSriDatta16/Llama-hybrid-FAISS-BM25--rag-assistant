Restarting Log4J logging via JMX

It seems a Log4j rolling appender stopped logging because it hit the MaxBackupIndex limit. I've moved the old log files out of the way but Log4j doesn't seem to start logging again. Is there a way to restart Log4J logging via JMX? I'd like to leverage this insteaed of restarting a Tomcat instance. Thanks.
