One way to deal with this is to create a Hibernate UserType . There are instructions in the link at hibernate.org with some already-made classes for String escaping. I realize this doesn't directly answer 'how do I tell hibernate not to convert 9 spaces to empty string', but it will solve the storage problem on the database side. There are 2 implementations on that page - one that escapes all strings (may handle your 9 spaces case in your desired manner), and one that only escapes the value ''. It sounds like the former may be a better fit for you. For the record - I am utilizing this method myself. All you need to do is have the class in your classpath, and set the 'type' attribute in your HBM.xml to the fully qualified classname (i.e add type="my.fully.qualified.HibernateUserType" to your property element). On the Java side your classes will still deal directly with java.lang.String and the values you expect to see, but on the hibernate side, they will use the UserType class.
