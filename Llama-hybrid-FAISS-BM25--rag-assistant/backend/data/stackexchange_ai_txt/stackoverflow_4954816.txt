How to run Xdebug with Zend Server

I'm running Zend Server CE on Windows. I recently installed Xdebug (so that I could analyse code coverage with PHPUnit), however that stopped Zend from running. (I couldn't boot the http://localhost:10081/ZendServer/ page.) I know this is a regular problem - I've read the solution put forward by Zend, http://forums.zend.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=553 , however this didn't work either. I read somewhere about running 2 Apache instances, with Zend debugger configured in one, Xdebug in the other, however I don't really want to do this. What other options are there? Has anyone managed to resolve this 'with confidence'?
