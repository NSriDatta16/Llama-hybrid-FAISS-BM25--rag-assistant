Sorry for the OT, but there are so, so many things wrong with this picture! I just hope that you will bail out of that class, that department, and that school just as quickly as you can. I promise that you'll have nothing near to a semester's worth of knowledge when February comes. And, if you're like me, you'll spend your classroom hours in frustration, resentment, and rage at the time your teacher is wasting for you. That woman is no teacher! Decimal to binary as an intro to coding? Gruesome! Is it the University (ha!) of Phoenix?
