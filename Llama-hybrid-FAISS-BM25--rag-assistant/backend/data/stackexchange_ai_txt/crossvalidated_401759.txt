How can MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error) score value be interpreted for non time series data?

If I have used MASE to calculate non time-series data error (as described by Dr. Rob Hyndman here ), how can I know if the score received is good or not? Since it is not a time-series, a random walk naive model is irrelevant here, and the threshold of 1 which is usually used doesn't seems to be a good comparison. Is it correct? if yes - what should be the consideration to decide what score is good or not? if not - why? BTW it seems that even for time series data, a score of 1 and bellow is not always an achievable target as describe here - so how can you know what is considered to be sufficient?
