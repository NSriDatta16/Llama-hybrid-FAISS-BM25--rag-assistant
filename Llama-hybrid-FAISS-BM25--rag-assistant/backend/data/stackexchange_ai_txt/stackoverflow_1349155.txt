Error when running Access 2003 app in Access 2007

My organization is in the process of upgrading from Access 2003 to Access 2007. One of the apps I am tasked with upgrading is returning very odd errors while opening and closing forms that have nested forms. Have the events changed between Access 2003 and Access 2007 ? The events seem to be firing in a different order in 2007 then they did in 2003.
