People are saying "call exit(return code)," but this is bad form. In small programs it is fine, but there are a number of issues with this: You will end up having multiple exit points from the program It makes code more convoluted (like using goto) It cannot release memory allocated at runtime Really, the only time you should exit the problem is with this line in main.cpp: return 0; If you are using exit() to handle errors, you should learn about exceptions (and nesting exceptions), as a much more elegant and safe method.
