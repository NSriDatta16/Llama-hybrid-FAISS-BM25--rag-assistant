I once solved the exact same problem you describe for a real estate app I wrote a little while ago. What worked for me was: Calculate a center point somehow (centroid, average the lats and lons, or whatever) Calc the distances between this imaginary point and each of your real pins Use a Standard Deviation algorithm and remove any pin whose distance has a StdDev > 2 (or whatever threshold for you) Repeat steps 1 - 3 (you'll be using a new center point each time you loop) until there are no more outliers to remove at step 3 This approach work great for my needs. But I'm sure there's more interesting ways to solve the same problem if you look around. For example, I found this interesting CompSci paper... http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~michiel/outliers.pdf Good luck!
