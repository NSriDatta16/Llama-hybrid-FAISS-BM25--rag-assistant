A statistics book that explains using more images than equations

I have become interested in statistics, but I must admit that it has been a long time since I have used math seriously. Sometimes I understand what equations mean, but sometimes I can't follow them. I like the answer given here that uses the image with an arrow: Conceptual understanding of root mean squared error and mean bias deviation . Would you have any advice regarding serious statistical books on modeling, PCA, simulation, etc., that use figures more than equations? I'm hoping for something like a 'stats for dummies' book, a book that would make stats accessible for everyone?.
