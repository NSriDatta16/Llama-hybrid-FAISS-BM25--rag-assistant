Based on java.util.AbstractCollection.toString(), it exits early to avoid the delimiter. StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer(); Iterator iter = s.iterator(); for (;;) { buffer.append(iter.next()); if (! iter.hasNext()) break; buffer.append(delimiter); } It's efficient and elegant, but not as self-evident as some of the other answers.
