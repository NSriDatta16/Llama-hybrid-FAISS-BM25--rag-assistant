Re-scale data after PCA for an LSTM?

I want to use the result of my PCA as an input for my LSTM model. I began by Applying the MinMaxScaler and then did the PCA, (then I reshaped my data of course) : sc = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)) data = sc.fit_transform(data) pca = PCA() data = pca.fit_transform(data) The problem is, this give me a data between -1,23 and 1,33. I know that the input of an LSTM must be between range 0 and 1. So what can I do ? Should I apply one more time a MinMaxScaler on "data" ?
