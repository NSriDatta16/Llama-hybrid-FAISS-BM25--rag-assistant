Is it correct to compare Bayesian and Classical estimates using Mean Squared Error Yes. This is possible, but there is difference in approach . Frequentist methods calculate MSE numerically without respect to any prior beliefs. This is how they achieve state of the art in many areas (i.e. linear regression and lasso regression), and Bayeisan methods need a prior belief as a reference point of aspect to start. Bayesian methods are complementary to frequentist, and you may mix both methods to get Empirical Bayes methods . At the end MSE will be MSE whatever approach you take. The difference: in classical approach you get a number (point estimate) in Bayesian approach you get a distribution of likely values and you need to deal with point estimate as prior belief . This prior can be: "frequentist" MSE, or mean or mode of the posterior distribution. Bayesian method is natural approach to infrequence and Bayes formula is a mathematical model of the inference. At the same time this same formula is how we learn new improved parameters by updating the prior parameter belief with the posterior parameter belief. In other words bayesian approach is belief shifting system that produces the update of parameters (read: learns). Both approaches share the same statistical primitives and there should be no terminology difference. Say, likelihood is the same for both approaches and there should be no difference in any respect. But I would like to hear comments on the last.
