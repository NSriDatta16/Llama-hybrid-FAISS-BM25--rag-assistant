jQuery Sortable Table plugin for Rails 3 Recommendation

Inside a Rails 3 app, what jQuery plugin for sortable tables / grids would you recommend that satisfies these conditions: integrates well with Rails 3 sort columns resize columns filter columns show/hide columns allows for pagination has a non viral licence: BSD, MIT are OK; (L)GPL is not is still under active development I've been looking over the jQuery Grid Recommendations , and also this article about 15 Great jQuery Plugins For Better Table Manipulation but there are many alternatives, and some even outdated. I paid closer attention to DataTables , even tablesorter , as good candidates, but how is the dual licensing working? If it says Dual licensed under A or B licenses. can I choose to respect only one of the 2 licences (the more permissive one)?
