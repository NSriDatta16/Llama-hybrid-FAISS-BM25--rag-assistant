Segmentation of time series into one-second non-overlapping windows

I need to split the time series dataset (accelerometer values (timestamp, X, Y, Z)) into segments in the form of a one-second window that does not overlap. I am trying to find an example of its implementation, but found nothing. I'm a beginner and don't know how to do this.
