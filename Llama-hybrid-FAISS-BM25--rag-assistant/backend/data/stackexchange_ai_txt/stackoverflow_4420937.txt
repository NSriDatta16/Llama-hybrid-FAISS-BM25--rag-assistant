XtraTreelist: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object - DragDrop

I have an xtraTreeList with both keyFieldName and ParentFieldName are set in some cases while dragDrop nodes to each other i got the exception as a messageBox "Operation is not valid due to the current state if the object" and for that the parentField not updated! the exception is vague, any suggestions?
