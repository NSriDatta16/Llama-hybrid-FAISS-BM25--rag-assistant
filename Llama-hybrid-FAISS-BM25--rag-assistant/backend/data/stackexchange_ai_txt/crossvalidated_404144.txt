I'm not entirely clear on why your intercept is 0 for each of your models, as Andrew M pointed out. The default gam() function provides an intercept, which is probably why your intercept did not change when you added + 1 to your model formula. Why do you feel the need to specify both a parametric term and a smooth term for Year ? Including both terms in your model seems to complicate the interpretation unnecessarily. A smooth term for Year by itself would allow you to visualize both the general trend in your data as well as any anomalies. I may be missing something important regarding your field, but based off of what I know so far, I would specify my model as follows: model Since you are trying to understand trends over the course of 40 years, I would also pay attention to the value of k for your smooth term. k specifies the maximum degrees of freedom your smooth can take (which is k-1), and the gam() function automatically constrains k to be reasonably flexible given the number of observations you have. The main thing is that you don't want k to be too small. This can be easily checked with k.check(model) . The easiest way to display the resulting smooth (and hopefully draw conclusions from it) is to use the plot.gam() function: plot(model, shaded = T) This will plot the smooth terms in your model with shaded standard errors. In my opinion, smooth terms are generally difficult to make hard conclusions about. It's not like a parametric term where you can make a statement like: "animal harvests increased by 15% a year." However, if the association with a response is highly nonlinear, smooth terms can provide highly intuitive visualizations. And if you desire to make bold, concrete statements about the predictor, you can always use smooths as a preliminary analysis to a parametric model, where you could specify higher order terms as needed.
