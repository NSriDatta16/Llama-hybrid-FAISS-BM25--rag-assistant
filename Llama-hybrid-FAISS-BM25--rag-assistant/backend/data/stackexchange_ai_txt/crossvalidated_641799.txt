Should you seasonally adjust time series if hypothesis testing shows there to be no identifiable seasonality?

I have run tests for stable seasonality and moving seasonality. The tests are unable to find presence of seasonality in the time series I am working with. I am wondering if I can still seasonally adjust the time series? What would be the potential issue in seasonally adjusting a time series if there is no identifiable seasonal component?
