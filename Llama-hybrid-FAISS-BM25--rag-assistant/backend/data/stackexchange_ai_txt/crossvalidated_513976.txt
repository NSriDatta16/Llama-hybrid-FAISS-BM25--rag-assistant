Both quantities are acceptance probabilities, assuming of course that the dominating inequality $$\sup_{z\in\mathfrak X}\dfrac{\tilde {p}(z)}{kq(z)}\le 1$$ holds. First, the quantity $$\dfrac{\tilde {p}(z)}{kq(z)}$$ is the conditional probability of acceptance given that $z$ is the outcome of a (marginal) simulation from $q(\cdot)$ . Defining the indicator random variable $$I=\mathbb I_{U\le {\tilde {p}(z)}/{kq(z)}}$$ when $U\sim \mathfrak U(0,1)$ , $I\in\{0,1\}$ and is therefore a Bernoulli random variable. Conditionally on $Z=z$ , when $Z\sim q(z)$ , $I$ is a Bernoulli random variable $$\mathcal B(\tilde {p}(z)/{kq(z)})$$ Second, marginally, i.e., on its own, $I$ is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $$p=\mathbb P(I=1) = \int_\mathfrak Z \dfrac{\tilde {p}(z)}{kq(z)} q(z)\text d z=\frac{1}{k}$$ (the last equality assuming both $\tilde p(\cdot)$ and $q(\cdot)$ are probability densities, i.e., are properly normalised). Therefore, $1/k$ is the average and marginal probability of acceptance in the accept-reject algorithm. Note that, while $Z$ is marginally distributed from $q(\cdot)$ , conditional on $I$ , we have $$Z|I=1 \sim \tilde p(z) \quad\text{and}\quad Z|I=1 \sim \dfrac{kq(z)-\tilde p(z)}{k-1}$$
