Your problem is not so related to the recommender system field. First of all, train a model with $A,B,C$ as inputs and $X$ as output. This is a standard task in machine learning called regression . Let call the learned model as $X=f(A,B,C)$. An iterative way to find the value of $A$ that optimizes $X$ is to use the gradient descent algorithm. You start with a random initial value for $A$ and in each iteration, you add/subtract a small value to $A$ such that it makes a small improvement to X. To do that you should first choose a small positive value $\eta$ called the learning rate . In each iteration, do the following: current_X = f(current_A,B,C) new_A1 = current_A + η new_X1 = f(new_A1,B,C) new_A2 = current_A - η new_X2 = f(new_A2,B,C) if new_X1 is better than new_X2: current_A = new_A1 else: current_A = new_A2 This algorithm iteratively approaches the desired value of $A$ that makes $X$ optimum.
