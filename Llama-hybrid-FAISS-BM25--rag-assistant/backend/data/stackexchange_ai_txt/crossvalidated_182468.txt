If your model (except for the individual-level random effect) is a fixed-effect glm, you could try a quasibinomial model in glm(family=quasibinomial) . Of course without being able to tinker with your data we can't know whether or not this is an appropriate strategy for you--but it might be worth pursuing. A separate alternative is to check whether fitting the individual-level random effect using a Bayesian mode of inference via the MCMC (e.g. with software such as BUGS/JAGS/STAN) resolves your convergence issues. Edited to add : Maybe others can shed some light on this, but if your response is truly presence-absence, rather than a count potentially greater than 1 (i.e. your binomial data always have the number of binomial trials equals 1), then any failure of the model specification must result from a mis-specification of the mean, because there is no freedom to specify the variance independent of the mean.
