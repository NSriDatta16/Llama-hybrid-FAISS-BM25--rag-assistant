One advantage of ints over enums is in a CLASS FACTORY. The following C# code is not extensible: class Factory { public enum DrawableType {CIRCLE,SQUARE}; public static Drawable GetInstance(DrawableEnum e) { if (e == DrawableType.CIRCLE) { return new Circle(); } else if (e == DrawableType.SQUARE) { return new Square(); } else { throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(); // should never get here } } I wrote this poor code. Reviewing Design Patterns, the gang of four used an int. I tried to recover here .
