Incorporating random effects in the logistic regression formula in R

I'm trying to find the best model based on AIC using the stepwise ( direction = both ) model selection in R using the stepAIC in MASS package. This is the script i used: stepAIC (glmer(decision ~ as.factor(Age) + as.factor(Educ) + as.factor(Child), family=binomial, data=RShifting), direction="both") however I got this error result: Error in lmerFactorList(formula, fr, 0L, 0L) : No random effects terms specified in formula I tried to add (1|town) to the formula since town is the random effect (where the respondents are nested) and ran this script): stepAIC (glmer(decision ~ as.factor(Age) + as.factor(Educ) + as.factor(Child) + (1|town), family=binomial, data=RShifting), direction="both") The result is this: Error in x$terms : $ operator not defined for this S4 class I hope you could help me figure out how to solve this problem. Thanks a lot.
