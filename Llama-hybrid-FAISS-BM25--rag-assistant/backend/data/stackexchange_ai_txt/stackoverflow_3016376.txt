I'm not sure what you mean - if you are worried that is cycles from one to the next to the next then you need to revamp your organization of elements.. such as have all the elements hidden except (and absolute positioned in a relative container) visible (say #1 ) user clicks slide #4, so place the #4 element to the right of the current div slide both over hide slide #1 That is, if your container is 500px wide And all of your slides are hidden with an absolute potition. When you animate to a slide, place it's left:501px; and animate it's left to 0. At the same time, animate the current slide's left to -500 and then hide it. You can decide if the slide is before (lower index/number) to reverse the animation. if you're just worried about the time it takes to get from slide 1 to 4, make the speed constant so it always takes X time to get from one to the other
