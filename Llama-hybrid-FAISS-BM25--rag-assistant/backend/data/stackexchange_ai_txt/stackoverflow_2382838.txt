From Flex, change the value of an Actionscript 3 property inside a Flash SWF that has been Embedded into an icon

Ok, so I've been toying with using Flash SWFs in Flex objects as icons and the like. I can embed it just fine, but I would like more control over certain flash Actionscript 3 properties WITHIN the embedded icon - for example, to change the size of the icon (icon used in two spots, one should be small, the other large). Once I get that figgured out, I also need to apply this to a TreeListItem's folderClosedIcon. That, however, is kindof secondary at the moment. Thank you for any attention.
