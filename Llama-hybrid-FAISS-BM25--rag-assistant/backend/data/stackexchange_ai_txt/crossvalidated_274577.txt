Becoming a data scientist using only StackExchange sites - what questions should I look at?

If I had a maths degree with a little foundation in statistics, what would be the top $100$ questions/posts on CrossValidated or MathStackExchange or MathsOverflow or Stack Overflow that I would have to study in order to become a data scientist? And if not possible, could you give me an idea of the steps (skills, knowledge, courses) that I would need for different career paths? For example research data scientist, data scientist in a start up, machine learning scientist, etc?
