If you only want to add more examples you can retrain the machine learning algorithm you had the day before. But if you want to add new features training it from the beginning is needed, you could train a new ML algorithm using only the new features and mix the outputs, but that is not a good solution, retrain the whole ML algorithm. I would use a neural network, which is very intuitive for your case, you calculate a set of weights and save them. When you get new data you load your old network and calculated set of weights and tune it using the new examples you have. NN natively support multilabel classification, and if one day you decide that you one to add a new label you dont need to retrain the whole NN, you could erase the last layer, add a new one, and only train this last layer weights.
