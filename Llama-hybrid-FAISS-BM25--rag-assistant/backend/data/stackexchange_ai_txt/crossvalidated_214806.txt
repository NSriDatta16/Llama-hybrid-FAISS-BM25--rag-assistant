Wouldn't a standard solution to this problem just be some kind of credibility factor? For example say $f(n)$ with your weighted average being $f(n) \bar{x}_i + (1-f(n)) \bar{x}$. Where $\bar{x}_i$ is the mean of the observations and $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the population. The google example is one. There is also the Buhlmann Model . In order to make this work I believe $f(n)$ should be bounded between 0 and 1 and should not be decreasing with $n$
