You need two tests: greater than 0 and close enough to an integer. The identical() test fails too often because it also checks for extraneous attributes and storage mode. The zapsmall provides the ability to restrict rounding to a particular number of digits and does so in a manner that can be applied to vectors of candidate values. You can adjust the number of significant digits if desired. is.natural 0 & zapsmall(x, dig) == round(x) & x Edit: A good point was made about checking for range, so that was added.
