It's not that scientific notation affects the precision so much as the limitations of floating point notation represented in binary. See the answers to the perlfaq4 . This is a problem for any language that relies on the underlying architecture for number storage. Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)? Why is int() broken? If you need better number handling, check out the bignum pragma.
