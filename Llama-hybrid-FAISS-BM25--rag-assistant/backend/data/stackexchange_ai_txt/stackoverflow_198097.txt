Creating test run configurations in VS 2008

I am working with an n-tiered architecture in Visual Studio 2008 (Developer Edition), and I have run into an issue. We are running unit tests on every method of our services layer, and I am attempting to see the code coverage results, to ensure I'm hitting all the main paths through my methods. When I attempt to view the results, I am informed that the test run did not have code coverage enabled. I tried editing the test run configuration through test -> edit test run configurations, only to discover that there were none found. I have yet to discover how to create a test run configuration so that I can enable code coverage results. How do I create the configuration?
