Restricted Boltzmann machines vs multilayer neural networks

I've been wanting to experiment with a neural network for a classification problem that I'm facing. I ran into papers that talk of RBMs. But from what I can understand, they are no different from having a multilayer neural network. Is this accurate? Moreover I work with R and am not seeing any canned packages for RBMs. I did run into literature that talks about deep learning networks which are basically stacked RBMs but not sure if it is worth the effort to implement them in R. Would anybody have any pointers? Thanks
