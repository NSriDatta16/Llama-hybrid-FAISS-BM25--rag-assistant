Your validation and test error are supposed to reduce while training. This means you're network is 'learning'. However, you should give your neural network a goal: e.g. a MSE error of 0.05 . Once you have reached this goal, report the error and the number of iterations as a result! PS: ~0.8 is a really high error!
