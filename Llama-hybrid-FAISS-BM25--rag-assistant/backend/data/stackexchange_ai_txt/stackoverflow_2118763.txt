If you don't use the following libraries/technologies: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF) Windows CardSpace (WCS) then you are more or less on the safe side, although I would recommend thorough testing anyway. You're able to use .Net 3.0 features like var etc. just because VS2008 doesn't care about target version of the framework when it comes to things like on-the-fly syntax checking, IntelliSence and probably others. And as far as I know VS2010 will pay attention on these things, which will prevent you from successfull compiling your " var x = ... " constructions when targeting 2.0 framework version.
