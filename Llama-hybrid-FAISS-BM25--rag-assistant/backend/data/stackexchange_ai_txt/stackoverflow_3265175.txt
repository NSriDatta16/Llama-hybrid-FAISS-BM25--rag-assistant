I have been using taskjuggler for the past 4/5 years now (4 projects with an average duration of a year or more). I find it very useful to create my initial estimates of how long the project will take When will each resource group be freed. What if we added more resources with varying level of experience and efficiency to different domains of the project. Typically the kind of stuff that upper management will ask you about your schedule can be generated much faster and at a more accurate granularity compared to doing something similar using MS Project or other GUI based tools. Till recently I was using taskjuggler to get my initial schedule and using ms excel to track the project. This is the first time I am using task juggler to actually track the project on a weekly basis. and so far the results look good.
