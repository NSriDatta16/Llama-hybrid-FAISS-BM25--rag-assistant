Regex pattern matching (Javascript/ASP)

I need some help with a regular expression, please help if you can I have the following code: I am using Javascript and ASP {In|inside|during|into|in the sphere of} {this} {article|piece of writing|editorial|commentary|paragraph|section} {we} {will|desire to|wishto|want to|resolve to|will} {tell} {you} {more} {about|regarding|with reference to} {the} The desired code should look like this: {In|inside|during|into|in the sphere of} this {article|piece of writing|editorial|commentary|paragraph|section} we {will|desire to|wishto|want to|resolve to|will} tell you more {about|regarding|with reference to} the The brackets around the single words with no | should be removed like - this - we - tell you more - the in the example above. I am thinking that the solution should be something like this replace(/{.+?[^\|]/ig, ''); to replace the { there should not be a | in the code; {.+?[^\|] and replace { with nothing Then if there is not a starting { to replace the } with nothing I am not sure how to do this, and how to only remove the {} where there is no | inside without removing the content...
