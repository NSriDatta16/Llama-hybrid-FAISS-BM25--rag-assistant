Is it good practice to transform some variables and not others?

I have a dataset with categorical variables encoded into numeric values, other variables that are continuous and have many outliers, and other continuous variable with a fairly normal distribution. I was planning to use the sklearn preprocessing method .PowerTransformer in order to transform all of them, but maybe it might make more sense to just use it for those columns that have not normal distribution at all and many outliers? It's for a classification problem (the Titanic machine learning one).
