1] Yes, you have to add data with the 4-th case, "none of the above". 2] The three characters may be present in an image concurrently. So instead of performing 1 multi-category classification, you should perform 3 binary classifications... Even if an image is guaranteed to have at most one character, 3 binary classifications may deliver higher overall accuracy. 3] You may benefit from taking your time before jumping into SVM. You may run less computationally demanding gradient boosting (boosted trees) and random forests first. They will allow you to calculate out-of-bag (OOB) feature importance. The OOB importance will be used to pre-screen the features, with only the best performers entering SVM. SVM are quite slow when the number of features falls above 10-20 (depending on the implementation and the percentage of categorical features). So you may benefit from using only the most powerful ones. This will allow you to experiment with a larger number of SVM specifications.
