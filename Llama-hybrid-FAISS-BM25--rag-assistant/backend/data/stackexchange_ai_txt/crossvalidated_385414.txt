Preparing data for cross-correlation time series

I have several data sets with air quality measurements for 20 locations. The measurements were done per second over a period of two weeks, 5 locations per period (because there were only 5 instruments). The data looks stationary when plotted (see plot for 1 period). I want to calculate the cross-correlation between the relevant time series, to see if there is a temporal correlation between the measured concentrations at the various sites. It does not feel useful to analyze the data per second. What is the best way to go with this? I tried to use hourly average. Or should I smooth the data? I read something about modeling the data ( How to use Pearson correlation correctly with time series ), but that sounds rather complicated. Edit: I am using R.
