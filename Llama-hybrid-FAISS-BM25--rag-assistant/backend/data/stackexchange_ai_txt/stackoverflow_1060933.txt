How to make last cell of a row in a table occupy all remaining width

In the below HTML fragment, how can I make the width of a column that contains 'LAST' occupy the remainder of the row, and widths of columns that contain 'COLUMN ONE' and 'COLUMN TWO' be just wide enough to contain their content, and not larger. Thank you table { border-collapse: collapse; } table td { border: 1px solid black; } COLUMN ONE COLUMN TWO LAST ANOTHER ROW
