I've just found the solution. Believe it or not, it links perfectly with v2.20 of the GNU linker (ld) but fails to do so with ld 2.19. By the way #pragma interface and #pragma implementation is a g++-specific workaround addressing the problem of implementing template classes in header files. Using the pragma tags it can be avoided, so it wasn't the problem, but thank you for your suggestions anyway.
