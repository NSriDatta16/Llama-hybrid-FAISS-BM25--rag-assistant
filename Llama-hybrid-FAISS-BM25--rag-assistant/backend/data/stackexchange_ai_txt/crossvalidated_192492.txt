Justification of simulated annealing versus random search

I have a set of 16 integer parameters to optimize. The parameter space is too big for an exhaustive search, so I am using simulated annealing instead. I think my simulated annealing works - it finds a good solution relatively quickly, and quicker on average than random search. But how can I know for sure whether simulated annealing "added" anything beyond the random search? Is there any objective criterion to justify whether it is "worthwhile" to use a simulated annealing instead of a random search?
