The output of PCA is a matrix of your principle components. So, this matrix contains a set of new signals but now these components are ordered in terms of how much of the datasets variance they capture. The first principle component in the matrix coeff(1,:) describes the most variance to the last component coeff(27578,:) which captures the least. So you simply need to choose $k$ dimensions you want to reduce your new inputs to like so coeff(1:k,:) One method suggested here would be to select the first $k$ components that still captures 99% of the variance of your dataset. Thus you would have reduced dimension inputs but still describe your data well.
