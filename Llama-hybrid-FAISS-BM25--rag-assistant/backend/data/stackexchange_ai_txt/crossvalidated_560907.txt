How to anticipate whether a multivariate model will perform better than separate univariate models?

As the title says, I would like to know if there are any statistics or methods to check if a group of time series is multiple (i.e., independent) or multivariate (i.e., in the sense that they show some grade of correlation between them), so I can better choose which time series analysis models are most appropriate to study such group of time series (for example, individual ARIMA models vs vector ARIMA). I guess one could apply some causality test, like that of Granger, to infer causality between the individual time series, but since I have not seen any paper regarding this specific question I'm a bit lost. Thank you in advance! Edit To make the specific problem -from which the above discussion stems- (hopefully) clearer, when trying to forecast a group of time series, can we check beforehand whether a multivariate model will perform better than separate univariate models ? If so, how?
