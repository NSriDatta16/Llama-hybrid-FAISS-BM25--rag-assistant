I thought of expanding a bit on the answer by Stanpol. While recommendation system is one approach of suggesting related queries, one more standard information retrieval based approach is the query expansion technique. Generally speaking, query expansion involves selecting additional terms from the top ranked documents retrieved in response to an initial query. Terms are typically selected by a combination of a term scoring function such as tf-idf and a co-occurrence based measure. For example, in response to a query term "animal", a term selection function may choose the term "zoo", because "zoo" may be a dominating term (high tf-idf) in the top (say 10) documents retrieved in response to the query "animal" "zoo" may co-occur frequently (in close proximity) with the original query term "animal" in these documents
