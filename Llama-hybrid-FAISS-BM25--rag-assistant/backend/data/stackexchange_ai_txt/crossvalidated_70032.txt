What statistical methods are best suited for missing data problems?

The data I'm analyzing has been collected and measured from about 2'000 animals. For every animals, I have a number of discrete values, like species, gender, colour etc., as well as some continuous values, like age, size, weight, and some medicinal values like the level of some specific chemicals in the blood. I want to build a statistical model which can predict some missing values. For example if the data of an additional animal is missing the weight value, I want the model to predict it based on the other existing data. Coming from a software development background, I assume that Neural Networks would be one possible solution for the problem. But there must be others. What's the name of this kind of problem? What statistical methods are used for it?
