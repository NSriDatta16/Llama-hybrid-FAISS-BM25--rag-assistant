PHP codesniffer (phpcs) - how to allow override when using as part of a svn pre-commit hook?

We have a PHP 5 web application and we're currently evaluating PHP CodeSniffer in order to decide whether forcing code standards improves code quality. We use subversion for our code repository and deployment base and I have added a SVN pre-commit hook to ensure all files committed are free from coding standard smells. The hook technically works but causes too many headaches to be actually useful: If we have to fix an emergency bug that is causing a site outage, the last thing we need is the commit to be denied due to some minor whitespace indentation issue. We have ALOT of legacy code that has sometimes hundreds of phpcs errors - it is not pragmatic to fix all the phpcs errors in these files right now . One example is a file full of functions that don't have doc comments . Another example is if a class name starts with a lowercase letter an error is thrown but fixing this might involve changing 10, 20+ files which would need need committing which would then be sniffed, recurse... We have some files that are a bit large (e.g. 4000 lines of code?) and phpcs takes several minutes to check them. Delaying the commit by this long is unacceptable. I haven't tested this yet but I imagine if you do a svn branch and commit it, phpcs will check everything and take a very long time to check all 1000 files? Given that we can't refactor our whole codebase today - Does anyone know how I can use a svn commit parameter that will tell the svn pre-commit hook to not run phpcs? Or perhaps there is another way to remove the headaches described?
