The XRM thing does not replicate/replace everything that is possible in "classic" SDK development. I haven't used it with CRM 4, but with the CRM 2011 pre-release stuff, as soon as there were special Request classes beyond the standard web service messages involved, I had to use those through an IOrganizationService object. The XRM classes make much of the everyday data manipulation easier and nicer to handle (especially when one wasn't using another code generator such as Stunnware Tools already), but for anything a little more special, it looks like CrmService.Execute() (or IOrganizationService.Execute() in 2011) isn't going anywhere.
