You probably don't want to use separate activities for this. This pattern is used to navigate within the same activity. There are either two or three states to consider depending on how you choose to think about it. The first is the 'dragging' state when the user has a finger in the screen and is panning back and forth. The second and third are what happens when the user lets go. If the velocity when letting go is under a certain threshold, (the system uses the minimum fling velocity from ViewConfiguration) animate to the closest screen. If the velocity is over that threshold, fling to the next screen in that direction. Take a look at the VelocityTracker, Scroller, and Interpolator classes. All of them can help you here.
