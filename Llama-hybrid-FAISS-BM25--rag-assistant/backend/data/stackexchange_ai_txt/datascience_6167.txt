Don't just mix the data of two different sources. It looks as if the two sources may simply be using different scales. But that makes the whole PCA analysis meaningless. All your plot may be visualizing is that the other samples use a different way of measuring things. It seems all the variance is in the other samples . In particular this means that you cannot draw any conclusions about how your samples relate to the reference samples .
