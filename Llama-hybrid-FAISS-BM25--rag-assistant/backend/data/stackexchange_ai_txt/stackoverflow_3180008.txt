You need 3 tables here: StudyPrograms, Courses and Components. Components represents the Courses which comprise each StudyProgram and is a junction table between Courses and StudyPrograms. Each Component record can contain a field indicating if the Course is a compulsory part of the StudyProgram. You can also include a field to indicate whether the Course is one of a list that can be chosen. There is no way to represent the 'X of Y' relationally, you will need some logic in your stored procedures to ensure this business rule is followed (or possibly in your data access code layer, depending on how you want to organise the application).
