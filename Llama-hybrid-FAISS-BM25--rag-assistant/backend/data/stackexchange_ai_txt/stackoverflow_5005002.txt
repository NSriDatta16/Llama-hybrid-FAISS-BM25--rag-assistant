QVT transformation applied to UML (XMI) models exported from Rhapsody

I guess this is quite a strange question about models transformation. I am starting from a UML 2.2 model defined with Rhapsody (IBM/Telelogic) and exported in XMI by means of the Rhapsody XMI toolkit. I have succesfully opened it with Topcased (The Eclipse based UML/Sysml modeling environment). I have therefore applied a QVT transformation to it, aimed at creating a new UML model with a specific subset of entities. Unfortunately i have not found the right way to retrieve entities description (i.e. class and methods description) i wrote in Rhapsody. I have noticed these are present in the XMI file as RhapsodyProfile:RhpModelElement tags and descriptionHTML or descriptionRTF attributes. However in the QVT transformation they are neither referrable as stereotypes nor as annotations. It is very important to me not to loose this information. Is there any of you who faced the same issue? Thank you in advance
