Statistical models or problems equipped with methods that guarantee optimal or near solutions in finite time

What are some statistical models or problems that have computationally tractable solutions and are guaranteed to be optimal or near optimal? By computationally tractable, I mean finite time and practical time. For example, a linear model can be fit by computing matrix inverses or optimized via gradient descent. Similarly, in the simplest multi-armed bandit problems, the upper confidence bound sampling method yields (near) optimal regret bounds. Examples of models and problems that don't come with guarantees in finite time: neural networks (non-convex optimization) high-dimensional integration, e.g., intractable sums due to combinatorial structures, Markov chain Monte Carlo requires infinite time
