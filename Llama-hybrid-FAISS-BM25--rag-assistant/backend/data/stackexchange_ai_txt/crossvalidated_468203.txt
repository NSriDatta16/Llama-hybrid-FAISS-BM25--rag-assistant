Changing cp very small say 1e-10 , and minbucket very small, say 1, will make the model more complicated and fit the training data better. Couple of things you may need to pay attention. You may never get the improvement too much by changing the parameters. Think about the term of "irreducible error". If the data is hard to model, may be 59% accuracy is good enough for any model and cannot be improved too much. If you are targeting on improving the accuracy, you may overfit data, i.e., it will work well on the training data, but cannot be generalized. In general, tree model is a "high bias" model (like a linear model). And we may not get a very high accuracy from tree. A common approach is using bagging or boosting on tree. See following question for details. Bagging, boosting and stacking in machine learning
