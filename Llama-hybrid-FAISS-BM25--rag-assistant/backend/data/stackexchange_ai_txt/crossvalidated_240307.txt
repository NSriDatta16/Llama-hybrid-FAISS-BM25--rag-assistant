Stationary distribution reversible for DTMC with tridiagonal transition matrix

For a discrete-time markov chain with countable (infinite) state space S, assume it has a tridiagonal transition probability matrix. How would I be able to go about proving that any stationary distribution for this MC must be reversible (satsify detailed balance condition). Just give me a hint on how to start
