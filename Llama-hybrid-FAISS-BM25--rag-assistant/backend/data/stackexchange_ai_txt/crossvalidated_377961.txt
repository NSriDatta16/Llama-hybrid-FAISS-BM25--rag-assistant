When you are interested in predictions conditional on the random effects, to my view it is easier to work with the hiearachical formulation of the mixed model that has a intrinsically Bayesian flavor. In particular, in your specific case, your are interested in the mean of the Poisson model conditional on the random effects, i.e., $$\mu_i = \exp(\beta + b_i),$$ with $i$ denoting the group, $\beta$ the fixed effect intercept, and $b_i$ the random intercept. You can derive a confidence interval for $\mu_i$ by using the following simulation scheme: Step I: Simulate a value $\theta^*$ from the approximate posterior distribution $\mathcal N(\hat\theta, \hat\Sigma)$ , where $\hat\theta$ denotes the maximum likelihood estimatates for $\beta$ and $\sigma_b$ with $\sigma_b$ denoting the standard deviation of the random intercepts term $b_i$ , and $\hat\Sigma$ the variance of $\hat\theta$ . Step II: Simulate a value $b_i^*$ from the posterior distribution of the random effects $[b_i \mid y_i, \theta^*]$ , where $y_i$ denotes the outcome data for group $i$ (note we condition on $\theta^*$ from the previous step). Step III: Calculate $\mu_i^* = \exp(\beta^* + b_i^*)$ . Step I accounts for the sampling variability of the maximum likelihood estimates, and Step II for the variability in the random effects. Repeating Steps I-III $L$ times, you obtain a Monte Carlo sample for $\mu_i$ based on which you could obtain a 95% CI using the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile. This procedure is implemented in the predict() method for mixed models fitted using the GLMMadaptive package. For an example, check the vignette Methods for MixMod Objects .
