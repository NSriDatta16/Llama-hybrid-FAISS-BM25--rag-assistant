A convenient parameterisation of this problem is through the marginal and conditional probabilities. So we have a parameter for exposure $\pi_{E}$ and two parameters for disease given the exposure: $\pi_{D|E}$ and $\pi_{D|\overline{E}}$. Then we do a hypothesis test $$H_0:\; \pi_{D|E}=\pi_{D|\overline{E}}$$ I would have thought that a good measure of association is $1-P(H_0|nI)$ where $n$ is the sampled counts and $I$ is the prior information/assumptions. Alternatively, you could calculate the posterior distribution of the difference $\delta=\pi_{D|E}-\pi_{D|\overline{E}}$ or the odds ratio $\gamma=\frac{\pi_{D|E}}{\pi_{D|\overline{E}}}$ if you prefer. One thing to note is that because the disease count is small, you inference will be sensitive to the prior distribution - so a sensitivity check for a few similar priors would be desirable. There is also a fair amount of literature on Bayesian approaches. here is a useful blog entry which discusses an example of what I'm talking about.
