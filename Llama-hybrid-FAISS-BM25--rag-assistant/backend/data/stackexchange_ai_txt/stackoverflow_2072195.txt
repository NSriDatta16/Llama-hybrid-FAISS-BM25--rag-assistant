TSQL Selecting 2 & 3 week intervals

I am attempting to populate a table based on 2 and 3 week intervals for a semi-monthly pay period in TSQL. The table should populate, 2 week date 2 week date 3 week date 2 week date 2 week date 3 week date ..based on the first date I supply, subsequently adding 2 or 3 weeks to the last date supplied. I should be able to supply a start date and end date. It may be that it's just early in the morning, but can't think of an elegant way to accomplish this task. Any pointers? Thanks! George
