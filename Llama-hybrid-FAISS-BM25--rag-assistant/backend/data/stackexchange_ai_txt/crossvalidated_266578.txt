Flat prior in Bayesian? Confidence intervals in classical statistics turn into credible interval?

We know confidence interval can't be used for probability statement, this is something reserved for credible interval . However, the most commonly used frequentist techniques (e.g. confidence intervals for means and proportions) are equivalent to Bayesian credible intervals for some specific prior. A common example is the flat prior. (Reference: William Bolstad on Bayesian Statistics ) If this is true, if I follow a frequentist text-book and calculate confidence interval. Can I say: "This is my confidence interval. I'm actually a Bayesian because this is also credible interval with flat prior. I'm going to interpret this interval as Bayesian probability statement about my parameters." So all statistical students learning statistics are Bayesian? We're all Bayesian?
