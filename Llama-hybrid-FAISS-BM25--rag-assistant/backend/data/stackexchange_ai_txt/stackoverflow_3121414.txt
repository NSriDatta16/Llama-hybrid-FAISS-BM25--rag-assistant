What do you mean by "takes too much time to respond"? a few miliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours? What is the average time difference in the query response when db is on same machine vs. another? How much data in bytes/KBs is returned by the query? PS: Would have added it as a comment to the question, but don't see option to add comments to the questions.
