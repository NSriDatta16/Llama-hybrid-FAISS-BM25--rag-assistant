Look for #pragma comment(lib) in the source. See if it perhaps is dependent on a #define - This is a common way for a SDK to ensure that the right libs are linked, and you may need to define THESDK_DEBUG or THESDK_RELEASE for the logic to work out. Additional information: I discovered in Visual Studio 2008 that even commenting out the statement from the *.idl file does not work , as in: //cpp_quote("#pragma comment( lib, \"MYLIB.lib\")") The compiler still adds MYLIB.lib as a DEFAULTLIB, and it winds up in the *.obj file. Make sure you remove the line completely from the code!
