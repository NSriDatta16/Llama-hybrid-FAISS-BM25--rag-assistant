Not built-in, that I know of, but you generally don't want to. If you do, you have to set the ‘Vary’ response header to include ‘User-Agent’, which degrades the efficacy of proxy caches and can confuse IE's own local cache. I've not had any problem serving deflated content to IE6 (admittedly from Apache, but I don't think IIS's implementation is greatly different). What are the actual issues you're seeing? The last browser I remember that had any trouble with gzip/deflate (but still passed Accept headers saying it wanted it) was Netscape 4, which soiled itself when it saw compressed stylesheets. But that's a browser that is thankfully no longer of concern to anyone.
