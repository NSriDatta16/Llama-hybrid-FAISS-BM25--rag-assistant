+1 Gaurav. "Dive into HTML5" is a great intro to canvas . Additionally, David Flanagan also has a new book, "Canvas Pocket Reference," which doubles as a tutorial: http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449396800/ . Also, I recently took an SVG course through the W3C and the entire course used its official primer as the class text. I'd definitely recommend that; its got tons of examples to follow. Lastly, check out RaphaÃ«l, a JS library to simply work with vector graphics -- http://raphaeljs.com/
