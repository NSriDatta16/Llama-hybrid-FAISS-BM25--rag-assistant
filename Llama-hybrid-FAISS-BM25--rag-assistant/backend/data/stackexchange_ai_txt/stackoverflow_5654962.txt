The simplest way to run this update (or the way I use anyways) is by leveraging javascript. Have each section of radio blocks in its own form that submits automatically onChange, and include a hidden variable to indicate page submission. Then just write a function to update the database, based on the inputted user's id (or however you're validating) and their selection choice... Something like: if($_POST["submit"] == 1) { $id = $_POST["id"]; $radio = $_POST["radio"]; $query = "UPDATE fire_alert SET warning = '$radio' WHERE id = '$id'"; $result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error()); } You have a problem with how you formatted your view.php link, that line should be as follows: 'Update'; ?>' Though the above won't quite work as you're intending since it's not submitting the form, so the radio button values won't be passed... instead you should do: Safe Caution L1 Caution L2 Closed " /> And you'll need to edit your php to reflect that difference as well
