Not paying attention to other problems (like the size, 255 and 1024, you pass to fgets when your buffer is only 100 characters long), this problem most likely comes from the fact that you are using the same buffer, char line[100], for both calls to fgets(). Strtok returns a pointer to a character in the line buffer , so when you store in "line" the female names, all these pointers, relative to line when line contained the male names, are now invalid. Try storing the female line in other buffer, it should work. EDIT: Sorry if the "not paying attention..." sounds discouraing. Nothing more far away from my intention. Everyone make mistakes everytime, specially when learning. I wish you good luck with the process :)
