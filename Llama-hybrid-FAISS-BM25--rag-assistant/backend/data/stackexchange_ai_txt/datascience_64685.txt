Is there any NLP framework/ algorithm which is able to derive relationships between different entities? Dogs bark For example, if the system can identify and understand a phrase, 'Dogs were barking loudly' and can relate to another phrase, 'Usually dogs bark loud, when they sense danger'. And from this piece of information, the system can imply/ derive: 'Dogs had sensed danger' - derived sentence. Can BERT help in identifying and implying?
