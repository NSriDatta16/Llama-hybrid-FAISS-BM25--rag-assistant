What you want is the #pragma pack command. This allows you to set the packing to any amount you want. Typically you would set the packing value to 1 (or is it 0? ) before your structure definition and then return it to the default value after the definition. Note that this does not do anything to guarantee portability between systems. See also: use-of-pragma-in-c and various other questions on SO
