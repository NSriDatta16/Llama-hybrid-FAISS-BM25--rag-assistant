I assume that each day $d$ you have 24 values $v_{d,h}$, the first series has values $v_d^{(A)}=v_{d,24}$, the second $v_d^{(B)}=\frac{1}{24}\sum_h v_{d,h}$. If the values within one day are independent and have a distriution with a standard deviation $\sigma$ and each observation can be considered as ''randomly drawn'' then each observation in the first series has standard deviation $\sigma$ and for the second the standard deviation is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{24}}$ (see P.S. below). So the first series has observations $v_d^{(A)}=v_{d,24},d=1,2,\dots,N$ and standard devitaion $\sigma_d^{(A)}=\sigma,d=1,2,\dots,N$ and the second $v_d^{(B)}=\frac{1}{24}\sum_h v_{d,h},d=1,2,\dots,N$ and standard deviation $\sigma_d^{(B)}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{24}},d=1,2,\dots,N$. If you now average over the days, assuming that you have data for $N$ days and that the observations are independent, the the average for case A has standard deviation $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sigma$ and the average for case B has has standard deviation $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{24}}$ P.S. if $x_i,i=1,2\dots,n$ is randomly drawn from a distribution with standard deviation $\sigma$ then the average of $x_i$ is a random variable with standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ EDIT 20140402: To answer your comment; if I take more than 24 values each day (let's say $N$) then, as $N$ increases, the standard deviation on the series $v_d^{(B)}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i v_{d,i}$ will decrease, that is correct. Note that it is a standard deviation of averages. Let us do a little simulation in R: # The number of 'samples' taken in a day N Now try for N , N , N , ... and look at the sd(sA) . You should also compare sd(sA) with 1/sqrt(N) (note that for standard normal $\sigma=1$, hence $1/\sqrt{N}$).
