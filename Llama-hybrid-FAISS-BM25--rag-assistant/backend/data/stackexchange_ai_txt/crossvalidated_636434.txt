More about the deterministic part of Wold decomposition

This is a follow-up on this question of mine. Wold's representation theorem states that every covariance-stationary time series $\{Y_t\}$ can be written as the sum of two time series, one deterministic and one stochastic: $$ Y_t = \mu_t + \sum_{j=0}^\infty b_j\varepsilon_{t-j} $$ where $\{\mu_t\}$ is the deterministic one. According to Hansen "Econometrics" (2022) p. 472, $\mu_t$ is the projection of $Y_t$ on the history of infinite past: $\mu_t=\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \mathcal{P}_{t-m}(Y_t)$ . For example, it could be $$ \mu_t = \left\{ \matrix{ (-1)^t \ \ \ \ \text{with probability 1/2} \\ (-1)^{t+1} \ \text{with probability 1/2} } \right\}. $$ Now if we observe only a single path of the stochastic process, we only face one of the two cases, either $\mu_t=(-1)^{t}$ or $\mu_t=(-1)^{(t+1)}$ . Without additional information, we would probably just model that component as deterministic, thinking that $\{Y_t\}$ is not stationary but $\{Y_t-\mu_t\}$ is. I do not think this would cause any trouble for modeling and predicting the future elements in that path, even though it would mess up inference about the stochastic process itself and predictions of its other paths. Thinking back about my original question (linked at the very beginning), I can say, if only all instances of Wold's decomposition were this nice! Are they, perhaps? Or does there exist a case in which $\{\mu_t\}$ is not completely deterministic within a single path?
