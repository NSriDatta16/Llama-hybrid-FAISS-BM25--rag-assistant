More complex data usually means adding more neurons in the input and output layers. You can feed each "field" of your register, properly encoded as a real value (normalized, etc.) to each input neuron, or maybe you can even decompose even further into bit fields, assigning saturated inputs of 1 or 0 to the neurons... for the output, it depends on how you train the neural network, it will try to mimic the training set outputs.
