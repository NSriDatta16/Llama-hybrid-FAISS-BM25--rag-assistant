dragging and dropping in asp.net?

I am new to web development, I am coding some ASP.NET, I watched many videos about using LINQ to SQL, I am happy I learned something, but is it the good way of using is: dragging and dropping and that's done??? what are the best practices to use LINQ to access Database ( my database is not only SQL server..MYSQL..) Thanks
