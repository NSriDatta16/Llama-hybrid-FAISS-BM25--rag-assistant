How to have different Project Dependencies for each Project Configuration?

I would like to have different Project Dependencies depending on which Project Configuration I'm currently building. For example, I don't want to build and link SomeTestLib.vcproj in Release configuration, but I'd like to build and link to it in Debug. One solution, that sorta works, is to use conditional compilation macros: #ifdef DEBUG #pragma comment( lib, "SomeTestLib" ) #endif But in this case, the debugger and IntelliSense don't work for SomeTestLib. Is there a .sln or .vcproj hack that I could use? Thanks.
