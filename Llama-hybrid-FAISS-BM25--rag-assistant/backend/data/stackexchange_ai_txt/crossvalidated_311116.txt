"Symmetric" property of stationary distribution

The above symmetric property isn't referring to the double stochastic property \begin{bmatrix} 0.2&0.8&0&0&0\\ 0.2&0.2&0.6&0&0\\ 0&0.4&0.2&0.4&0\\ 0&0&0.6&0.2&0.2\\ 0&0&0&0.8&0.2 \end{bmatrix} The stationary distribution is given as (1/16,1/4,3/8,1/4,1/16). Is it true that for an irreducible and aperiodic markov chain, if we can label the first row to last row (state 1 to 5) and also alternatively (state 5 to 1) and we get the same transition matrix, we will have a symmetric stationary distribution i.e. (a,b,c,b,a)?
