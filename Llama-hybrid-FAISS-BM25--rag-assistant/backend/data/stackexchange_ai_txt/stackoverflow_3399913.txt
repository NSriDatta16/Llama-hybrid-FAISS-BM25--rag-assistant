I was able to get VS 2010 projects to build using TFS 2008 source only by installing Team Foundation Server Build and Team Foundation Server 2010 Build agents. I also had to install Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008. I followed the advice here as well to set TFS 2008 build agent to use .net 4: http://www.richard-banks.org/2009/11/how-to-build-vs2010-solutions-using.html
