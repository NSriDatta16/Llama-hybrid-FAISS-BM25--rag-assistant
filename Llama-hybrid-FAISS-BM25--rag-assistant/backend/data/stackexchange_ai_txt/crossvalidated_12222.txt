Regular data gaps in a time series

I've been looking at attendance data for a college library taken during finals week when the library was open for 24 hours. However the staff only took head counts during the hours of 12am to 6am (7 data points per night, for about 11-12 nights, 3 semesters worth of similar counts). I was wondering if, because the data isn't "continuous" I can really make anything analysis on it, since it seems to create a cyclical pattern different from what I would see over a true 24 hour period. Do you think the data is still usable? Also if anyone knows of any special tool applicable to time series analysis using attendance data, where we want to know how many are using the library and how to get more people to attend, I would be extremely grateful, as I'm new to statistical analysis in general. Thanks!
