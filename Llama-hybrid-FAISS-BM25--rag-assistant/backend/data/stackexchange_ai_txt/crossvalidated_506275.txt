Remember that your neural network outputs probabilities, not classifications. It is up to you to use the probabilities to make classifications. The software default is to use a threshold of $0.5$ to determine classification, but that might not be the right number for you. While there are two outcomes, there is likely a third option in the decision-making process of your medical application: “inconclusive, collect more information.” Perhaps you will want something like below $0.3$ is category $0$ , above $0.7$ is category $1$ , and between $0.3$ and $0.7$ is inconclusive. This idea of neural networks outputting probabilities instead of categories is related to what are called proper scoring rules and (better yet) strictly proper scoring rules. Among others on here, Frank Harrell and Stephan Kolassa are fans, the former of whom writes about them on his blog. https://www.fharrell.com/post/class-damage/ https://www.fharrell.com/post/classification/ Also of interest: Proper scoring rule when there is a decision to make (e.g. spam vs ham email)
