Statistical analysis in the cryptoanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine (safeguarding of the intelligence source in Ultra)

During the second world war the British were doing cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine and subsequent signals intelligence. One of the issue was about the safeguarding of the source of the intelligence, see for example http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra#Safeguarding_of_sources In the recent movie "The imitation game" about the Enigma code breaking, the character of Alan Turing refers to the use of "Statistical analysis" to protect the sources. What analysis is talking about? Warning: a movie spoiler is following. STEWART MENZIES [Agent of MI6] ... Why are you telling me this? ALAN TURING We need your help to keep this from the Admiralty. Army. RAF. No one can know we broke Enigma, not even Denniston [Royal Navy Officer in charge of the cryptoanalysis]. STEWART MENZIES Who is in the process of having you fired. JOAN CLARKE [Cryptoanalyst] You’ll take care of that. ALAN TURING While we develop a system for determining how much intelligence to act on. Which attacks to stop, which to let through. Statistical analysis. The minimum number of actions it’ll take to win the war, but the maximum number we’re able to take before the Germans get suspicious. STEWART MENZIES You’re going to trust this all to statistics? To maths? ALAN TURING Correct.
