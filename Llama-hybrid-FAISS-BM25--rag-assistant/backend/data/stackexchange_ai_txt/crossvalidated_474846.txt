Can PCA be used when n = p, where n = 50?

I have a sample size of 50 items with 50 variables (continuous level), and want to minimise the dimension of my data in order to extract the "character" of each item through a small amount of p. Can I use PCA? If yes, do I need to use a specific technique for small sample size?
