I can not imagine for a moment why they are sizing the fields that way on either count 2^N or 2^N-1. From a SQL Server perspective, it sounds more like a misconception over how SQL is storing that data at the page level than a specific reason. I would pay more attention to the types, potential off page storage (SLoB / LoB) and rows/page + meeting the business needs with sizing, than a formula based on using 2^N etc
