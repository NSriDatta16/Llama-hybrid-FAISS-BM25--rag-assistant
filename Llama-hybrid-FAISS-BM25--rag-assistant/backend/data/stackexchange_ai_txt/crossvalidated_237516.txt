Vectorizing IPv6 Addresses for Support Vector Learning

So I am looking for a way to use a dataset with Support Vector learning where I have all the data either numeric or easily vectorizable. Only one challenge I'm facing is with IP addresses in the Dataset. I found a really good answer here for IPv4 addresses here. Email and IP String preprocessing for classification task I could probably adapt the same technique for IPv6 addresses too. But is there any preferred technique or can someone suggest some good technique for vectorizing the IPv6 Addresses for SVM?
