phpCAS - Make calls to HTTP:// and not HTTPS://

I'm using phpCAS to attempt to authenticate my users with a central credentials system. Currently in the development cycle so CAS isn't behind SSL, therefore the url is at HTTP:// I can't seem to get phpCAS to go there even though I'm using the no SSL validation for CAS server line: phpCAS::setNoCasServerValidation(); My code is exactly as shown in the simple example here: https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/phpCAS+examples The only difference is my server host name (www.mysite.com), and port is (8080). Anyone know how to get the redirect to go to HTTP:// instead of HTTPS:// ?
