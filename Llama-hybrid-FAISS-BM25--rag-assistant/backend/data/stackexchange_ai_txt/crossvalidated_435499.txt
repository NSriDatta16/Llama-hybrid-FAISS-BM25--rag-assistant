Good strategy for spatial sampling and accuracy assessment

I have to classify satellite images using machine learning algorithm, preferably Random Forest.I have read in several papers that sampling should be balanced and in some papers I found that training data should be spatially balanced ( https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/geostatistical-analyst/create-spatially-balanced-points.htm ). Also, after classification I have to evaluate the model performance and uncertainty in classification. For model performance people suggested ROC and AUC curve. For uncertainty mapping I have no idea. Any guidance in this regard will be very helpful. THanks
