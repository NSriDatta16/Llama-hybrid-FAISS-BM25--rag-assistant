Yes, it would be a bad idea. Doing a regression on dependent data without dealing with that dependence can yield silly results. For one thing, if two variables both depend on time, they will be correlated if you don't account for time: The Dow Jones Average is correlated with the number of people in China, just for an example. There are lots of models for time series; it's not my area of expertise, but ARIMA and ARIMAX are two that may be worth considering.
