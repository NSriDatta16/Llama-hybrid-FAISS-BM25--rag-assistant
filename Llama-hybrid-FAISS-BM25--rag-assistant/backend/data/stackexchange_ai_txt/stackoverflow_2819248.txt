Storage is cheap on App Engine, and CPU and request times less so. The predominant thing you should remember about the datastore is that you should optimize for reads, not writes -- you will end up reading your data far more often than you write it. If you think you may ever need to know a Force 's total hp , you should store it in a field called total_hp , and update it with the new value each time you update/add/remove its UnitGroup s and Unit s. You should probably do this in a transaction, too, which means they'll need to be in the same Entity Group.
