It makes perfect sense, and all implementations of random forests I've worked with (such as MATLAB's) provide probabilistic outputs as well to do just that. I've not worked with the R implementation, but I'd be shocked if there wasn't a simple way to obtain soft outputs from the votes as well as the hard decision. Edit: Just glanced at R, and predict.randomForest does output probabilities as well.
