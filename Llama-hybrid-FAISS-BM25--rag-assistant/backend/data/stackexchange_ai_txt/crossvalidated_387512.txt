Is it ever valid to include a two-way interaction without main effect? Yes it can be valid and even necessary. If for example in 2. you would include a factor for main effect (average difference of blue vs red condition) this would make the model worse. What if your hypothesis is only about the interaction, do you still need to include the main effects? Your hypothesis might be true independent of there being a main effect. But the model might need it to best describe the underlying process. So yes, you should try with and without. Note: In the case of only interaction you need to center the code for the "continuous" independent variable (measurement in the example). Otherwise the interaction coefficients in the model will not be symmetrically distributed (no coefficient for the first measurement in the example).
