My take on the problem: SQL It scales, most of the work is handled for you. If you understand SQL it is probably (98%) the way to go. CSV Files: These get ugly on a HDD once you are dealing with more than a few (12 ish) accesses per second. HOWEVER- if the data is of reasonable size consider using a ramdrive, you can separate the data into files, and access them at blazing speeds. Lots of small files, no problem. But you will need to make sure that any data that needs to be saved is saved on real magnetic storage, or an SSD. CSV files on an SSD you might be looking at 1000 accesses/second if the data is small enough. With some good naming of files and small enough dataset this can be a viable option. Plenty of ifs here but blazing speeds are a trade-off for crazy scalability, and having data consistency handled for you.
