how do you know that it's not working? 1) Be sure that the phone path is using in-band DTMFs What kind of SIP user agents or phones are involved in this test call? Softphones usually have the option to change DTMF settings. 2) Be sure to have your console log set to DEBUG to see if DTMFs get recognized. Usually you can set it in DEBUG by pressing the F8 key at the FreeSWITCH console. Ciao!
