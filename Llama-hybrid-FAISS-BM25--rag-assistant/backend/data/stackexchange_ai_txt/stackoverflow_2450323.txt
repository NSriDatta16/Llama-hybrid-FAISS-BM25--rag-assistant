How do you know there is no transaction? Are you using it from EJB? In that case I bet there is a transaction. From docs ( http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/FlushModeType.html ): If FlushModeType.COMMIT is set, the effect of updates made to entities in the persistence context upon queries is unspecified. If there is no transaction active, the persistence provider must not flush to the database. If you are in transaction, attached entities (i.e. those loaded in the same transaction) are automatically recorded to database.
