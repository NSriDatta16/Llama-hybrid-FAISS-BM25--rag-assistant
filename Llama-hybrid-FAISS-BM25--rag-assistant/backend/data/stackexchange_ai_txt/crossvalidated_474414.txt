Pre-Whitening results not conducive to white noise property

I have these two time series(df_errror,df_booking) (both are non-stationary, seasonal) that I want to prewhiten and then find cross correlation: I used this code for auto_arima for df_booking: ar1model = auto.arima( df_booking['sum'],d = 1, D = 1, max.p = 5, max.q = 5, max.P = 3, max.Q = 3, max.D = 3, max.d=3, max.order = 5, start.p = 1, start.q = 1, start.P = 1, start.Q = 1, seasonal=TRUE, stationary=TRUE ) This yields a results of ARIMA(0,1,0)(0,1,0)[12] as the best order with no coefficients. My results change significantly if change truth values of seasonal,stationary hyperparameter. I then save the residuals. pwx=ar1model$residuals pwy = residuals(Arima(df_error_plot['Error_Percent'], model = ar1model)) Then I check the residuals for statonarity: adf.test(pwx,k=12) adf.test(pwy,k=12) BUT they are NOT below 0.38,0.34. Which means my residuals are not stationary( requirement for white noise /pre-whitening) While the acf and pacf plots of the residuals show auto-correlation at only 0 lag and all below confidence intervals(which is I guess what is required for white noise): acf(pwx,lag=30) acf(pwy,lag=30) I tried to transform the df_booking['sum'] to log and cube_root to see if that changes the results for adf.test() but it doesn't . I have a few questions regarding it: Does passing transformed data in auto.arima() has any effect on the results Why does the value of k make such any effect, because when I change it 0 I do get the results of stationarity but they are 0.01 regardless of any transformed data. Why are the residuals showing no-autocorrelation but not stationarity How are my values changing so much when I change seasonal and stationary hyperparameter? Is the approach to prewhiten correct?
