This question on stackoverflow might help you. To sum up, some deep learning researchers think that padding a big part of the image is not a good practice, since the neural network has to learn that the padded area is not relevant for classification, and it does not have to learn that if you use interpolation, for instance. [Update April.11 2022] Well, based on the newer research[2019], it seems like zero-padding would not affect to the CNN model at all, since zeros would not change the synaptic weights during forward propagation or back propagation during convolution. paper reference: https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-019-0263-7
