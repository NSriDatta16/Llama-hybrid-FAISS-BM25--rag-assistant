While I don't know if that is possible you many not want your configuration to go down with the queue either. I would suggest some other kind of external storage mechanism. You could use another queue that holds messages for each queue configuration(just make sure it's a durable one). You could also look into using a database to hold your configuration and make sure that is backed up.
