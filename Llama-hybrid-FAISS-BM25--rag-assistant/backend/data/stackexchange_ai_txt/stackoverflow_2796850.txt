First of all: it's a good intent what you have done. Trying to keep your code organized will certantly help you at programming. But try to keep this in mind: developing good code goes beyond organize and clasify your source code. For example... are you using any kind of UML Model? Are you applying any design pattern? Are your classes really highly cohesive? How about coupling? All those things will guide you through the process of writing good code, which seems to be what you want at this point. And the result of all that will make your code organized and easy to mantain.
