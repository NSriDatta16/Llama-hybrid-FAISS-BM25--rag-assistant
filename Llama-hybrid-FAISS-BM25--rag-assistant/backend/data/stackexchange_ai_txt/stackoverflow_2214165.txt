I don't have the book, so I can't confirm this, but it's likely that the reason the example uses events and delegates is because these are first-class constructs in the C# language. Essentially, C# has already implemented the Observer pattern for you , so that you can use it wherever you want. Also, I suspect part of the reason that the C# example is clunky is because Jesse Liberty doesn't strike me as a terribly adept author. Some of his books are a little too formulaic and rote (e.g. "Learn Programming Language X in Y Hours!"). The result is that you wind up with awkward, somewhat rushed examples that look like they were copy-pasted from his IDE as soon as there were no compiler errors.
