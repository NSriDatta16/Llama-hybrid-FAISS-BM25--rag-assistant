That's not how switch statements work: http://us.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.switch.php Edit: take this code snippet: switch ( $skyCoverage ) { case ( $skyCoverage >= 1.00 ): $skyCondition = "Overcast"; When $skyCoverage is 0 the statement $skyCoverage >= 1.00 will evaluate to false. So, the case ( $skyCoverage >= 1.00 ) statement is evaluated as this: case ( false ) and since 0 == false the end result will be Overcast
