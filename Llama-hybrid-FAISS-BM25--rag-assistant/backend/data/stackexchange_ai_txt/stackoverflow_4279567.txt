What role is required to create an iOS distribution certificate?

In writing this question, I figured out that the Agent role is required to create an iOS distribution certificate . I'm working with a partner. He created an Apple ID for the corporation to use for enrolling into the iOS Developer Program, and he added me as an Admin. He is the business contact. I am the developer. How can I get the Agent role also so that I can submit the application?
