If your budget allows it, I would recommend taking one of the courses offered by WindRiver. My company brought in one of their trainers to teach a class on-site and it was excellent. They provided hands-on programming activities and a lot of information. If you are new to the concepts of real-time or embedded programming, they provided the necessary background information, and even if you were already familiar with these (as I was), there was plenty of useful training specific to VxWorks and Workbench. I believe they also organize their own courses, in addition to coming to companies. Course Schedule
