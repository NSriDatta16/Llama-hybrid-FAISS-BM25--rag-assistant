Can a narrow confidence interval around a non-significant effect provide evidence for the null?

It is obviously fallacious to assume that failure to reject the null implies that the null is true. But in a case where the null is not rejected and the corresponding confidence interval (CI) is narrow and centered around 0, does this not provide evidence for the null? I am of two minds: Yes, in practice this would provide evidence that the effect is more or less 0. However, in a strict hypothesis-testing framework, it seems that null effects are simply unusable for inference, as are their corresponding CIs. So what is the meaning of a CI when its point estimate is non-significant? Is it also unusable for inference or can it be used as in the preceding example to quantify evidence for the null?
