If you're dragging db objects from the server explorer into the L2S designer, then there's a bug where it caches schema information after the first round. If you do schema changes and want to re-drag the same object you need to disconnect and reconnect the server explorer thingie, or restart Visual Studio to get it to requery the db for schema info. EF's "update model from database" shouldn't suffer from caching, but instead it has another issue where it will only update the SSDL portion of the EF model, leaving previously mapped entities/columns/etc in the CSDL in place where they become orphaned and can cause model validation failures that has to be cleaned up by hand or using 3rd party tools. Both issues are addressed by various 3rd party tools, for a list or 3rd party tools for L2S and/or EF see: http://www.thinqlinq.com/default/LINQ-Tools.aspx http://damieng.com/blog/2009/06/04/linq-to-sql-resources One of the tools addressing both of the above mentioned issues is my add-in for Visual Studio, Huagati DBML/EDMX Tools. if you want to try it out you can download it and get a trial license from http://huagati.com/dbmltools/
