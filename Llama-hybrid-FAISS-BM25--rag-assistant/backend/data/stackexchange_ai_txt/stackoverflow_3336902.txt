You can find out how much memory is currently in use by your script using memory_get_usage But you can not determine how much your next function will need, before executing it. You can only see after execuiting, using memory_get_usage . You can however store the memory your function used the last times in a database and calculate with the average memory amount. Regarding the eecution priority, I don't think it is posible to determine with PHP. Apache (or whatever webserver you are using) spawns multiple processes and the operating system schedules which one will be executed in which order.
