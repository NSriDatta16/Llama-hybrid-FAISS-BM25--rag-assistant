I think it is the option "resizeWhileDragging: true" but it dont work in my example -> http://jsfiddle.net/FrbW8/28/ My Problem is that i cant find any documentation about his (myabe i am too blind :) ) -> http://layout.jquery-dev.net/documentation.cfm I hope somebody can help me. kind regards Peter
