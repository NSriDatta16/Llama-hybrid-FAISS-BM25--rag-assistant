R package for fixed-effect logistic regression

I'm looking for an R package for estimating the coefficients of logit models with individual fixed-effect (individual intercept) using Chamberlain's 1980 estimator. It is often known as Chamberlain's fixed-effect logit estimator. It's a classic estimator when dealing with binary outcome panel data (at least in econometrics), but I just don't find anything related to it in the CRAN. Any clue?
