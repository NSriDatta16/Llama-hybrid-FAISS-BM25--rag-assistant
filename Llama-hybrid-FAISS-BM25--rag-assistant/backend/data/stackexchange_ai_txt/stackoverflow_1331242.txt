subsonic . navigate among records ,view,query

i'm some newbie in this matter of .net i'm trying understand this new paradigm i began with linq for SQl but i found this library, kind of framework of T4 more specifically: subsonic T4 i think it could be very usefull but the support docs outside are very scarce my first intention is use them in the very simple form: a catalog lets say... Users so... how can i use the model generated with subsonic ( using the iactiverecord) to implement the record-navigational part.,...???!!! i mean i want a simple form to create, delete or modify records and that is fairy easy but what about to move among records ? i found how to get the first, the last record.. but how can i advance or go back among them??? how can i order the records..? it seems everytime imust query the table.. its so? but how can imove among the records i already got? all of the exmples found are very simple dont touch the matter and/ or are repetitive everywhere so.. please if anybody can help me or give more references... i'd thank you a lot gmo camilo
