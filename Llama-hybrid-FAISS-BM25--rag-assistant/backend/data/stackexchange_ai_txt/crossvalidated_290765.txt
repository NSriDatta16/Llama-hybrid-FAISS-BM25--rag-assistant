How do I calculate the posterior predictive distribution in WinBUGS?

I would like to work out the posterior predictive distribution from the following multilevel (mixed effect) model in WinBUGS. The example is taken from an example I found online for illustrative purposes. Yi ~ Binomial(pi,1) where logit(pi) = b0+ b1 log(income) + b2 distance + b3 dropout + b4 college + uj(i) Non-informative priors are given for the fixed effects, assuming bk ~ Normal(0,0.000001). The second parameter is the precision (the reciprocal of the variance), so the variance is one million. We assume that uj(i) ~ N(0, t) where the precision t has a gamma prior with parameters 0.001 and 0.001, so the mean is one and the variance is 1000. In WinBUGS: model { # N observations for (i in 1:N) { hospital[i] ~ dbern(p[i]) logit(p[i]) I can fit this model using stan_glmer which automatically gives me the sample average of the posterior predictive distribution mean_ppd. I would like to work out the same thing in Winbugs but don't know how
