You can seek a model churn ~ number_of_charges + international_plan + ... and include any number of predictors. Each predictor will increase or decrease the probability of churn. Churn is a logical variable, so it would be a classification model or a logistic regression. You would have to address multicollinearity and overfitting somehow, with possibly regularized regression. For example cv.glmnet(x, y, family = "binomial") or train(formula, data, method = "glmnet", family = "binomial") . I can anticipate a challenge: the customers that didn't churn might have a longer history and have accumulated more charges, etc. This could confound your results unless you can find a way to address. Recommend also you think about those histograms. If you're scaling them somehow to plot two histograms on the same plot, it may be problematic to make a statement about the probability. The height of a histogram or a pdf is not the same as probability.
