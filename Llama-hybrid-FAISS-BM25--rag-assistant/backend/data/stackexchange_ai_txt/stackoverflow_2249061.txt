Cocoa: Create draggable zones

How can I create draggable zones in cocoa and be able to drag and drop images between the two. Ex: Zone 1:no image Zone 2:image drag zone 2's image to zone 1, and be able to save (core data) the location of the image. Would I have to do something like this: http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DragandDrop/DragandDrop.html ?
