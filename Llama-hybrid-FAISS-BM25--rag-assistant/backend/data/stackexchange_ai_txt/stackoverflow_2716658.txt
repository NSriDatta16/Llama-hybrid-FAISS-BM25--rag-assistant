Not with the standard malloc() allocator - you need to investigate the use of memory pools. These work by allocating a big block of memory up-front, allocating from it and freeing back to it as you request via their own allocation functions, and then freeing the whole lot with a special "deallocate all" function. I must say I've always found these things a bit ugly - it really isn't that hard to write code that doesn't leak. The only reason I can see for using them is to mitigate heap fragmentation, if that is a real problem for you.
