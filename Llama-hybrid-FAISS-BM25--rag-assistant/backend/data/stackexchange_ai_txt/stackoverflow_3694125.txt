Well i think it depends on how you are are using the serialized data - is it for interchange, temp storage, long term storage, etc.. More importantly do you need to create instances of the objects from the serialization? If its for interchange then I would say its the property names themselves and any values they hold that are important not so much the type thus the type should be an attribute. On the other hand, if this is for storage purposes then the type names might be just as important if you need to instantiate the object based on the serialization and that might make using the type names as elements better.
