How to implement Semantic Search in R or Python

I have a task to provide semantic searching capabilities. For example, if I have a dataset of resume and if I search for "machine learning" than it should return me all resumes which have data science-related skills despite of missing "machine learning" keyword. How do we search the data through its meaning and related keywords I wonder? I have checked many algorithms also Like LSA, LDA, LSI but cannot find a resource which gives the implementation of the above.
