Coverage map with Drupal, GMap and Location

I'm using the GMaps, Location and User locations module on my Drupal site. I would like to have a map which can display the "coverage" of my users. The coverage radius is stored in a custom content type with reference to the user. How is it possible to display users with only their coverage circle on a map? I saw a display type like this when playing with the GMap macros, so I think it would be possible to use GMaps that way. I suppose most likely this isn't supported out-of-the-box with the GMap module. Anyway, I would be really glad if anybody could point me into the right direction...
