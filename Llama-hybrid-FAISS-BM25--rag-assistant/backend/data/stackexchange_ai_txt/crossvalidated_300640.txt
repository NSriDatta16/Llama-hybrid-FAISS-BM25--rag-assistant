Online versions of ICA do exist. ICA is appropriate if its assumptions are met: Sources must be non-Gaussian. Measurements must be linear combinations of sources. The mixing coefficients relating sources to measurements must not change over time (but some ICA variants claim to handle nonstationary/time-varying mixtures). The number of sources must not exceed the number of sensors. ICA assumes they're equal, but often returns reasonable results when the number of sources is fewer than the number of sensors. Reducing the dimensionality with PCA prior to ICA may also help in this situation (and can also be performed online).
