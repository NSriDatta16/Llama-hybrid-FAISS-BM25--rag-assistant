Architecting medium size asp mvc - using ninject and creating objects

I'm designing medium-size website using asp.net mvc technology. All business logic is organized into IServices (like IDomainService, IUserService, IAuthService, ITrainingService). All services are using IRepositories. I'm using Ninject 1.5 to wire services with controllers and it seems working perfectly. There is so far one subject I have no idea how to handle. Some services create contexts (per request) - for instance IDomainService creates DomainContext (per request) which is needed for IUserService. ITrainingService is used only in TrainingController, which is accessible only by authorized users, and ITrainingService requires UserContext (also per request) to know who is having training. This is my first project using IoC container. Is there any design pattern or code-schema how to solve it? I think I can fill context object using ActionFilters but how to manage their lifetime and where to put them to be accessible for IServices? (in an ellegant way)
