There is wisdom and experience in the circumspect way this question is worded, for it would be foolhardy to answer it with a calculation. Any estimates based on an hour's worth of data might apply to that one hour, but the prospect that they will accurately characterize future times is very, very poor: one would have to be extremely confident that the load will continue to behave like the load observed during that hour. It's impossible to attach a legitimate confidence to this assumption. You need to think about the ways in which the load might vary. In addition to unknown sources of variation, which will have to be modeled probabilistically, you can expect trends over time; cyclic patterns associated with activity that occurs periodically by the second, day, week, and year; loads that spike in response to special events; and perhaps other causes. At a minimum, you need to characterize these trends, assess the typical variation around them, and then allow for surprises. You may wish to model or forecast the special events that can spike the load, too. To collect the necessary data , you need representative measures of load, perhaps at one-second intervals, taken during a set of times and over a sufficient time period to assess all these trends and cycles. Therefore you should plan to monitor the server load with these analytical aims in mind and return to the problem of estimating the maximum number of servers once you have some relevant data. In the meantime you also should think about how to balance the cost of maintaining additional servers against the risk of becoming overloaded : at some point there are diminishing returns and identifying that point requires you to quantify this trade-off. Mark Twain famously lampooned this situation in his Life on the Mississippi (1883). After citing 160 years of data about how floods were altering the river's length, he wrote, Now, if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific people, and 'let on' to prove ... what will occur in the far future by what has occurred in late years, what an opportunity is here! ... In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles. That is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per year. Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind or idiotic, can see that in the “Old Oolitic Silurian Period,” just a million years ago next November, the Lower Mississippi River was upwards of one million three hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod. And by the same token any person can see that seven hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their streets together, and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen. There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact. (Chapter 17.) The last line beautifully sums it up.
