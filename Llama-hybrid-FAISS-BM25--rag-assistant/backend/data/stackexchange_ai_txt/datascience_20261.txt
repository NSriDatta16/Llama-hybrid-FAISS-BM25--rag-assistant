Multivariate time series classification

I have around 72,000 Multivariate time series (MTS) with four Dimensions and of Length around 3000 milliseconds(not constant). It is (4*3000*72000) DLN. This MTS has tow possible outcomes either Pass or Fail. How to select a better classifier that suits above criteria? I have read some implementations of MTS classification. I cannot apply distance measure techniques for classification as the data is too lengthy and is not constant when compare to other MTS. I am considering to apply below techniques for classification 1) Extract global statistical features from data and apply any classifier(KNN or Random Forest or neural networks) what would be the best approach. Please guide me better technique and I am also open for other techniques to classify MTS
