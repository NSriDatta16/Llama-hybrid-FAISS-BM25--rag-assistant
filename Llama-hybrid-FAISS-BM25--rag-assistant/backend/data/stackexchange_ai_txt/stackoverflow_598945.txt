Without taking pages and pages to go into the details, think of a C struct as a way to organize data, while a Python (or C++ or Objective-C) "class" is a way to organize not only your data, but the operations for that data. A Python "class," for example, can inherit from other objects, to give you an interator for the data associated with it (or you can write your own interator in the class). There's more to say, I'm sure, but this gets into "what is OOP" pretty quickly, well beyond the scope of this thread.
