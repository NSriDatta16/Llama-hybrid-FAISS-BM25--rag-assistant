If you need to calculate the least power of 2 (not the multiple) smaller then teamCount, then possibly it is the best way. Taking logarithm is a costy operation and can take more time then a simple cycle. upd Here is an algorithm (C++) using bitwise operations (http://aggregate.org/MAGIC/, section Next Largest Power of 2) unsigned int nlpo2(unsigned int x) { x--; // comment out to always take the next biggest power of two, even if x is already a power of two x |= (x >> 1); x |= (x >> 2); x |= (x >> 4); x |= (x >> 8); x |= (x >> 16); return (x+1); } First, it sets all relevant bits of the number to ones (for example, 0x3ff) and then increments it (0x400) to get the power of two.
