Recall two facts: Number of eigenvalues is equal to rank of matrix. Sum of eigenvalues of matrix is equal to it's trace (sum of entries on diagonal). In PCA "matrix" mentioned above is correlation or covariance matrix of your data set, so (provided none of your variables is linear combination of others): Number of eigenvalues is equal to number of variables Sum of eigenvalues is equal to number of variables (if you use correlation matrix) or to sum of their variances (if you use covariance matrix). This means that extrapolation you've made suffers from two things: You extrapolate "too far away" (do you have 1000 variables to extrapolate to 1000th eigenvalue?) You ignore the fact that sum of eigenvalues is well known. To answer your question: technically eigenvalues do not "converge" to anything, because we have finite number of them.
