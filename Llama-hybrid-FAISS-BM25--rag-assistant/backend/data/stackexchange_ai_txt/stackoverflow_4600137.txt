Following the tutorial in the CI forums I was able to achieve what you are asking for. 1) Put this in the SWFUpload JS config: post_params: {" config->item('sess_cookie_name'); ?>" :" session->get_cookie_data(); ?>"}, 2) And place the MY_Session.php file in your application/libraries/ folder. 3) The new library should be loaded the moment the view is loaded if not (for some reason) then load your library in the controller. P.S: You need to set: $config['sess_match_useragent'] = FALSE; Otherwise a new session will be created for a useragent Shockwave Flash EDIT: Okay, based on your comment..you really need to set your post_params setting to your current session so it can be sent when the flash post to your controller, now in your case the best thing I could think of is the below: Your externalUntouchableJsFile.js: // JS scripts... ... var swfu = new SWFUpload({ ... ... post_params: GLOBAL_VAR, ... }); ... // rest of your JS And in your PHP view and before loading this JS file have something like: var GLOBAL_VAR = {}; GLOBAL_VAR = {" config->item('sess_cookie_name'); ?>" :" session->get_cookie_data(); ?>"} path/to/js/externalUntouchableJsFile.js"> EDIT 2: Since you are using an external js file, you may forget to define the global variable so use: post_params: (typeof GLOBAL_VAR === 'undefined') ? {}:GLOBAL_VAR,
