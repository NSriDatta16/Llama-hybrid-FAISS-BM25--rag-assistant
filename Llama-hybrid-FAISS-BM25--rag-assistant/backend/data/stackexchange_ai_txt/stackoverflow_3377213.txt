This is the default behaviour of the out callback. See this jquery ui trac ticket I really do not agree with the 'logical' behaviour notion. "However, note that the "out" callback will still be triggered if you drag into a list and then release the mouse (but not if you're not over the list). This is logical behaviour and happens for normal sortables as well."
