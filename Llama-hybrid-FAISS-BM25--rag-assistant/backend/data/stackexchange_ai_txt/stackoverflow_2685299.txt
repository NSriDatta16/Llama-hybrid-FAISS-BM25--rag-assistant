There are a few libraries you can pickup, they all leverage stuff and try to degrade between, flash, html5 and cookies. However none of them really provide a full suite for offline in general. So your stuck with what parts you want offline, database? manifest (images, styles, scripts)? In a general sense offline storage is the only part that can be used today, the images / styles / scripts is not possible unless you use newer browsers. The most known one for offline storage is: http://pablotron.org/software/persist-js/ In combo with TaffyDB: http://taffydb.com/ You can make a offline storage solution work in ie6 and up solution. Again manifest stuff like images, script, styles (that are not inline) wont come up with older browsers. To read up about creating a manifest for newer browser to work offline you can read: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/offline.html I did make my own, but its not very good: http://www.gorilla3d.com/v8/html5-storage-off-line-cross-browser-support.html
