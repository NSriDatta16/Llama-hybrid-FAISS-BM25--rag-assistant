I think the best way to takle the problem is to take a Bayesian approach. Your scoring metric $S$ is going to be the expectation of the parameter of a Bernouilli distribution which represents the intrinsic accuracy of the player. As a prior distribution, you can take the conjugate prior that is the beta distribution with parameter $\alpha$ and $\beta$. You choose them such as expectation and variance are equal to the sample mean and sample variance of the data. The final posterior expectation of the accuracy becomes (using wikipedia ): $S=E(\Theta) = \frac{\alpha + n_{acc}}{\alpha + \beta + n_{tot}}$ where $n_{acc}$ (resp. $n_{tot}$) is the number of accurate (resp. total) passes of the player considered. The formula behaves quite nicely if the number of passes $n_{tot}$ is low / high.
