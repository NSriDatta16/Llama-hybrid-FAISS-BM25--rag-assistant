IMHO, the chances of coming across something like this in the wild are unlikely, unless you're working for a company like Google or Facebook, where they're dealing with insane amounts of data and have a need to optimize list traversal to allow for node removal and addition. As a rule of thumb, if your application is that slow, you're most likely doing something wrong elsewhere (I know that's not your question, but I thought I'd just throw that in ;)). For small to medium sized sites with small to medium sized data requirements, I'd say that an array would suffice (not to mention more readable and understandable by the average web developer ;)).
