You can provide explicit IComparer implementations for the columns, as well as event handlers, to handle both questions. Handle the click event on the header to resort your data however you like. http://www.longhorncorner.com/UploadFile/nipuntomar/SortingDataSilverlightDataGrid09152008025951AM/SortingDataSilverlightDataGrid.aspx And leverage the ICollectionView IComparer implementation to do the sorting of the HyperLinks http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.listcollectionview.aspx (is the text of the hyperlinks all the same, e.g. ClickMe ?) Also - since Silverlight is running on the client, has all the data been brought to it (or just that page's data, and paging is bringing data to the client)? eg what data source are you using? RIA Services and DomainDataSource? Or your own service calls?)
