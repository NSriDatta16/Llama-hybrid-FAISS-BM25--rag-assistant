Theano in deep learning research

How widely is Theano used in deep learning research? Is Theano a good start to learn the implementation of machine learning algorithms? Will learning the implementation of something like a feed forward network really help? Do graduate students implement neural networks or other algorithms at least once during their college days? Background: I have a reasonable idea about feed forward and recurrent networks, backpropagation, the general pipeline for a machine learning problem and the necessary mathematics.
