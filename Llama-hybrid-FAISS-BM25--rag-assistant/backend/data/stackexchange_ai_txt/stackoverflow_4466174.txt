I would recommend reading Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging by Karen M. Tracey . The first five chapters cover testing in Django. Specifically, you should look at Chapter 5 which discusses integrating other test tools. Below is an excerpt of what Chapter 5 covers: In this chapter, we: Learned what hooks Django provides for adding test functions Saw an example of how these hooks can be used, specifically in the case of adding code coverage reporting Also explored an example where using these hooks was not necessaryâ€”when integrating the use of the twill test tool into our Django test cases Here are links to some of the tools that Karen Tracey discusses in chapter 5 of her book: Ned Batchelder's coverage module Twill Lettuce You may also want to check out Lettuce . From the website: Lettuce is a very simple BDD tool based on the Cucumber. The Lettuce documentation also has a section on integrating Lettuce with Django .
