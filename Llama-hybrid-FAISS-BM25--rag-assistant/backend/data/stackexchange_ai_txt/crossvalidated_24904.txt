Least squares logistic regression

I have seen it claimed in Hosmer & Lemeshow (and elsewhere) that least squares parameter estimation in logistic regression is suboptimal (does not lead to a minimum variance unbiased estimator). Does anyone know other books/articles that show/discuss this explicitly? Google and my personal library have not helped me here...
