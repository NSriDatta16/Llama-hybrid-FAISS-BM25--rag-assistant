Regarding your secont point of the question, benefits of dimensionality reduction for a data set may be: reduce the storage space needed speed up computation (for example in machine learning algorithms), less dimensions mean les computing, also less dimensions can allow usage of algorithms unfit for a large number of dimensions remove redundant features, for example no point in storing a terrain's size in both sq meters and sq miles (maybe data gathering was flawed) reducing a data's dimension to 2D or 3D may allow us to plot and visualize it, maybe observe patterns, give us insights Other than that, beyond PCA, SVD's has many applications in Signals Processing, NLP and many more
