You cannot use XMLHttpRequest (that is, ordinary "ajax") to call a service on a server that is not in your domain. You can, however, use the JSONP trick, which takes advantage of the fact that the browser will load Javascript from other domains. However, the service has to know that you're going to do that, and it has to understand the protocol. That particular service seems perfectly willing to give me a JSON response, but it doesn't pay attention when I give it a "callback" parameter. (I've tried both "callback" and "jsonp" and the JSON blob that comes back is the same, without a function call wrapper.)
