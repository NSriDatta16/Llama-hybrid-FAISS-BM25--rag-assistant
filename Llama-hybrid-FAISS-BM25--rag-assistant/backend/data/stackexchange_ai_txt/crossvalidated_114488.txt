Should the average prediction for a given attribute value equal the rate for that value?

Let's say I'm predicting the likelihood that someone will buy a widget, using their age, eye color, and gender as input attributes. I split my data into a training set and a test set, and train up my predictive model using the (large) training set. Let's say that 15% of people in the test set with blue eyes buy the widget, should I expect the average predicted buy probability of people with blue eyes would be around 0.15 also (assuming a good predictive model)? Intuitively it seems like it should, but I don't want to assume that it's true.
