Can we use bounded continuous variables as predictors in regression and logistic regression?

I am currently looking at a cheminformatics problem where I am looking at the relationship between chemical structure and reactivity, e.g. how the angle at which two molecules approach each other affects the rate of the subsequent reaction. Obviously, the angle can only vary between 0° and 360°. This is "quick check" question from a cautious non-statistician. I understand that in regression analysis, the dependent variable must be continuous and unbounded. I just wondered - do continuous predictor variables in regression need to be unbounded too? Instinctively I assume not.
