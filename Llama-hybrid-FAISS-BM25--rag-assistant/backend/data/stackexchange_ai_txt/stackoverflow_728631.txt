2 very flexible Php based CMS frameworks are Drupal and Joomla . Both are built upon plugin architectures where you can customize you application by downloading, installing and configuring the appropriate plugins for things like blogs, forums, search indexing, RSS, storing & playing video etc... Drupal refers to their plugins as Modules . There are thousands of modules available (over 700 in the Utilities category alone). Warning - the modules are version dependant and not all modules have been upgraded to run in the current production versions of Drupal so pay attention to the version support. Joomla refers to their plugins as Extensions . At time of posting, they had over 4500 extensions available. I haven't used Joomla myself so I can't talk to it's quality or ease of use, but it does seem to be another very popular, flexible product.
