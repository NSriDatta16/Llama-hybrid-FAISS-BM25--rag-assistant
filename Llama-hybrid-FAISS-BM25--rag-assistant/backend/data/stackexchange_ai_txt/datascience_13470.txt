Recurrent neural networks have different types of layers, Long Short Term Memory layers for example. Neural Turing Machines are even wilder. Another example is a non-square convolution layer, I was looking at writing a CNN reinforcement learning program that could learn how to play Abalone, which is played on a hexagon board, where similar patterns appear over the board in hexagon patches, so that is also a possibility.
