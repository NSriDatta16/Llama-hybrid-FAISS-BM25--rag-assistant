SIGABRT on any UIView touch

I'm afraid no amount of Googling has been able to save my hyde on this. I seem to be getting SIGABRT error anytime I touch the screen of the phone, on any UIView. The debugger console posts this error before the SIGABRT: .... [310:207] *** -[UIView _exclusiveTouchView]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x14c0c0 .... [310:207] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[UIView _exclusiveTouchView]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x14c0c0' (this is not my specific call to _exclusiveTouchView , of course.) I would gladly post some code, but the truth is I cannot find (or guess) where this problem may be coming from. This is not happening on any ONE UIView but on all the UIViews in my stack. I can summarize the display logic, though, perhaps that will shed some light. So the application is created and a UIWindow is alloc'd. A single viewcontroller is then alloc'd, which makes and adds its own blank self.view, to which the other UIViews, representing the different game states, are attached. Interestingly enough, this error is does NOT happen on the Simulator, but happens consistently on the device. And I should also mention that the application has yet to override/use any of the touchesBegan:/Ended:/Moved: etc... In other words, this error happens without these methods in the code. I'm really not understanding where this error is coming from... Any suggestions? EDIT for requested code here is a simplified state that still generates SIGABRT on touch: #import #import "WPGame.h" @class WPGame; extern WPGame *theGame; #import "WPGameState.h" @class IntroView; @interface IntroStateView : WPGameState { NSTimer *introTimer; } +(IntroStateView*)instance; @end . #import "IntroStateView.h" #import "StartMenuStateView.h" static IntroStateView *theOnlyIntro = nil; @implementation IntroStateView +(IntroStateView*)instance { @synchronized(self) { if (!theOnlyIntro) { theOnlyIntro = [[IntroStateView alloc] init]; } } return theOnlyIntro; } - (void)excuseYourself { [self changeStateOf:theGame toState:[StartMenuStateView instance]]; } - (void)startUp { [super startUp]; introTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:[theGame introLength] target:self selector:@selector(excuseYourself) userInfo:NULL repeats:NO]; } - (void)cleanUp { [super cleanUp]; } - (void)handleEvents:(WPGame*)game { [super handleEvents:game]; } - (void)dealloc { theOnlyIntro = nil; [super dealloc]; } @end and if you need to see parts of the WPGameState subclass of UIView, it can be found here to save some post length: http://tinypaste.com/732bb
