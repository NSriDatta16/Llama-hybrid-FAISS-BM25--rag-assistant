Breaking the string in certain number of characters

I am looking for the shortest, elegant way to break the unicode string in to certain number of character. I am having the div enter code herewith different language strings. I am breaking the string after certain number of characters. But for capital and small letters in English there was UI distortion. I am looking for some workaround to break the string uniform way for any Unicode or capital character or numbers so UI remains intact. test .contri-title { float:left; width:625px; background-color:#fff0f0; } } AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
