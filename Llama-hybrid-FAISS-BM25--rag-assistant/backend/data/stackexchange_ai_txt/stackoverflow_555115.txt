FormView equivalent for a WinForms application?

I'm trying to develop a small utility (a WinForms app) and I was hoping (to save time) to use a WinForms equivalent of an ASP.net FormView or DetailsView (to bind to) - i.e. for single objects (as opposed to multiple objects, which we could use a DataGridView for). It's been about three years since I did anything meaningful in the world of WinForms (and I'm not in a position to do this in WPF) - can anyone suggest a control or container which supports databinding and works in a similar way to the ASP.net's FormView implementation? The basic idea is to bind to either Plain Old CLR Objects (POCO) or DTO (Data Transfer Objects). However, I'm starting to feel like this is an exercise in diminished returns.. or perhaps I need a third party control..Infragistics? /R
