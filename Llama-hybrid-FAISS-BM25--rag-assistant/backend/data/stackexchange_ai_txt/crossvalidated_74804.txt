Logistic regression - the model is significant in predicting the DV, yet the percent correct decreases

How can this be? My thoughts are that while the percent correct decreased from 80.8% to 80% with the model, perhaps the model is regarded to be a significant predictor due to the specificity having increased. Any thoughts?
