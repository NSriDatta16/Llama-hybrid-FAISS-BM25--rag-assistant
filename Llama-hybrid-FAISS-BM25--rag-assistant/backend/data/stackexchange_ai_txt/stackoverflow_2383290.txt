Some hardware performs both switch and router services (eg if there's 4 ports, 2 of them are for one vlan and 2 of them are for the other, it acts as a router between the two vlans but it also switches between the 2 ports on the same vlan). It can be difficult to tell where switches are without physically inspecting the network, but a lot of routers identify themselves if you start traceroute ing across them. The IP headers of the packet received by google.come will be generated by a machine doing NAT somewhere on the edge of your network (more than likely your internet gateway machine). Thus the src address will be whatever public IP address the private address is mapped to in the NAT configuration. In the case of the two different vlans within your organizations LAN, your traffic will traverse them unmolested, except for a decremented TTL. In the case of traffic going to a different host on the same vlan, it will probably be unchanged all together. You cannot route between two different private LANs ove the internet directly. That's kind of the point of the private addressing ;). Any packets to/from a reserved private address range (eg. 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8) will be dropped on the floor by any respectable internet router. You can, however, create a tunnel between two private networks over the internet using any one of a number of VPN/tunneling solutions.
