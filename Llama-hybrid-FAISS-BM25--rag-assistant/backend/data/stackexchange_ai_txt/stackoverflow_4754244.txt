What you assumed to be one of Mercurial pros - revision numbering - is considered to be a disadvantage by many people. And what you assumed to be git disadvantage - staging area; being difficult concept - is considered to be advantage by many people. So this is not that simple. But if you ask me - Mercurial is James Bond, as one of the bloggers called it - it's elegant and higher-level than git, at least on the surface. Plus its commands are pretty much like subversion commands, therefore new users who are svn converts might learn Mercurial much faster than git.
