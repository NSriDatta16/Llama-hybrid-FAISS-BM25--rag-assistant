Basic question about cross validation

A very basic question about cross validation for Neural Networks. Do I have to create a new network for each fold or do I have to keep the network and incrementally train it with the k-th training set? http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part3/section-12.html says "You train the net k-times..." which let's me assume to use the same net every fold again. But when I don't create a new network for each fold, then I would use the k-th fold k-1 times. In this picture you see that without a new network, e.g. the first 4 data points would be used to train the model in the 2nd to 5th step. Can you give me a hint on the right interpretation?
