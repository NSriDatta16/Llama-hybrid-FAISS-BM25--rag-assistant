I think the biggest problem is that you're using GDI methods to measure a string that will be displayed in a PDF. That's just not going to be accurate enough. (Even if you get the fonts identical, they use different rendering techniques from what I remember.) So, you ought to try other forms of calculation. One simple first step would be to estimate the characters per line and then the height of each line as it would come out in the PDF. Then, just use those numbers. Once that is close, you can improve the technique for estimation by paying attention to specific characters. (You probably don't want to get to the level of calculating kerning.) Another technique could be to do something that I worked on in a past project. Using iTextSharp, we had to add hollow text diagonally across a page (as a sort of watermark). Since the text was unknown, we guessed at the original font size. Then the code went into a loop where it would measure the size of the rendered text, and adjust it up or down until it was just the right size to fill the page without clipping any of the text. (All of this guessing and measuring was done with iTextSharp.)
