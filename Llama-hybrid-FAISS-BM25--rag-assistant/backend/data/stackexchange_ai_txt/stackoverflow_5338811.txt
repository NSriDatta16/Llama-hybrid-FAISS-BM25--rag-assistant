Use FLAG_NO_CLEAR Just set it on your Notification instance before supplying it to the NotificationManager : notificaton.flags |= Notification.FLAG_NO_CLEAR; edit: I just noticed though that if you are using Notification.Builder (since Honeycomb) and make the notification "ongoing", it will also become immune to "clear all". See here . Appearently, this is supposed to discourage developers from using the FLAG_NO_CLEAR on a non-ongoing notificaton since this could confuse the user.
