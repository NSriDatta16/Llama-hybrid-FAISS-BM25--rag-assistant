Jurafsky and Martin's Speech and Language Processing http://www.amazon.com/Speech-Language-Processing-Daniel-Jurafsky/dp/0131873210/ is very good. Unfortunately the draft second edition chapters are no longer free online now that it's been published :( Also, if you're a decent programmer it's never too early to toy around with NLP programs. NLTK comes to mind (Python). It has a book you can read free online that was published (by OReilly I think).
