How to use a session variable in the RadioButtonList ListItem text

I am trying to create a Rediobuttonlist: In the options' text I want to insert a name of organisation which is logged in. I store the name in a Session variable. So if "A" is loggin in I want them to see: no longer a member of A but option1 no longer a member of A but option2 no longer a member of A but option3 If "B" is logged in they should see: no longer a member of B but option1 no longer a member of B but option2 no longer a member of B but option3 and so on ... How can I do that? Normally I use a label and than in the code I write behind (c#): label.text = "no longer a member of" + Session["name"]+"but option"; but I can not isert a label to the Radiobutton list text. Any ideas? Thanks.
