Interpretation of "virtual observations" in Bayesian inference

In the context of using a Normal-Gamma conjugate prior, scale $\eta_0$ can be interpreted as "virtual observations" which is a multiple of variance. Why then is the higher the "virtual observations", the higher the variance of $\mu$ ? I would have thought more "observations" will lead to lower variance? Is "virtual observation" a misnomer? See page 13 of this doc.
