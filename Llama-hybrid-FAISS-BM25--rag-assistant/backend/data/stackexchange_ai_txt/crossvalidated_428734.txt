Why do Uncertainty Quantification using a Bayesian Perspective?

Besides the reasons stated in this article, Stuart(2010) (chapter 2) - related to equivalence between using a certain prior on the observation error and defining which norms to use when doing a regularization - what other reasons are there for someone to use a Bayesian Perspective in the field of Uncertainty Quantification ? References would be very appreciated.
