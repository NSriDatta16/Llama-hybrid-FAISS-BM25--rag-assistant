Oddly, I found the solution was related to this . The application pool identity has a property called Load User Profile. When this value is false, you may receive the error shown above. To resolve this, open IIS Manager and navigate to your application pool identity. You will find the setting in the Advanced Settings window. Change it to true. I found that when I set it to true, the library began working again. When I flipped it back to false it continued to work even after service restarts and app pool recycles. So, strangely everything seems okay now.
