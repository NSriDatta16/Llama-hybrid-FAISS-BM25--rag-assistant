If the client is javascript, I think you'll struggle. There is (as you've stated) limited javascript coverage, but I'm not sure it will gain you a lot. To quote from Kenton Varda (who really knows protobuf): One problem with javascript and protobuf is that you need a lot of support code to parse the messages. Unless you end up sending quite a lot of stuff back and forth, making the user download a JS protobuf codec library may be a net loss. It may be better to use JSON or XML because browsers already have built-in support for those. That said, I think various people inside google have been playing with javascript + protocol buffers for awhile and if we end up with anything that works well enough, we'll release it. So maybe there is hope down the road. For now I would stick with json + deflate, or if your scenario allows it you could perhaps use a Silverlight applet embedded in the client? protobuf-net will work inside Silverlight.
