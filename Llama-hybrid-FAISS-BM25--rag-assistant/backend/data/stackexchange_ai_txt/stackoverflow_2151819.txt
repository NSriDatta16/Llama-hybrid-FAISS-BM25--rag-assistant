Did you click on "Character Embedding" and selected Uppercase, lowercase, numerals and punctuation. I've found that his problem occours when only a set amount is selected. This should work without any other embedding code, and should not need any library. Try having just the dynamic textfield on a new flash file and try that only, it should work. A good way of seeing if they embedded properly is when you rotate the text field, as un-embedded will not show up. Also try this: Under publish settings -> Flash tab, set Generate size report, and it will show you the fonts and the characters that have been embedded. if they're showing up there, there's something else you're doing or not doing that's causing this
