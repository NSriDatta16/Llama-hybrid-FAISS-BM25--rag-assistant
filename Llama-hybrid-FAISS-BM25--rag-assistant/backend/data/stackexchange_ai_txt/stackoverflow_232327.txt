Well, it sounds like the cure for that is for some smart person to introduce a regex tool that annotates itself as it matches. That would suggest that using a tool is not as much the issue as whether there is a big gap between what the tool understands and what the programmer understands. So, documentation can help. This is a real trivial example is a table like the following (just a suggestion) Expression Match Reason ^ Pos 0 Start of input \s+ " " At least one space (abs|floor|ceil) ceil One of "abs", "floor", or "ceil" ... I see the issue, though. You probably want to discourage people from building more complex regular expression than they can parse. I think standards can address this, by always requiring expanded REs and check that the annotation is proper. However, if they just want to debug an RE, to make sure it's acting as they think it's acting, then it's not really much different from writing code you have to debug. It's relative.
