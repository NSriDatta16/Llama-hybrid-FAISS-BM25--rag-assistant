A/B testing randomization step

Let's say I want to measure a medicine’s impact on height. So I randomly broke down my user base into two groups (control and experiment, obviously). I calculated the average height for both groups before experiment and found out there’s a 2 cm difference. Then, after the medicine is applied to the experiment group, I found a 4 cm difference. If I recall correctly, the t-test doesn’t handle selection bias, is there a test I can do to put the initial 2 cm difference between group into consideration?
