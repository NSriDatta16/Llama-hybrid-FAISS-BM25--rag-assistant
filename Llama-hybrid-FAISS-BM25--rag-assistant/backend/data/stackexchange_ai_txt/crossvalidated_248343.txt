How to predict an outcome based on a multi-variable linear regression model?

I should start by saying that I'm really new to machine learning so please bear with me if I may not understand some simple concepts. I have a small dataset of people with diabetes, something like this: Age Mbi Glucose 50 70 148 34 60 100 ..etc And I tried to apply linear regression on R with lm() function and assigned it to a variable called MyModel so I can predict Age having Mbi and Glucose as independent variables . And I get different plots when use the show() . But what I cannot do (even after searching for some hours) is to use that model for a real case scenario, for example to predict the age if the level of glucose is 145 and mbi is 65 . Should I use a specific function for this?
