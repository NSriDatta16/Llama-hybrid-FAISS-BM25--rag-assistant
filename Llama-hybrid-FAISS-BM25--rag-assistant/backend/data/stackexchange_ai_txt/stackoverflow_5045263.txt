Sort Data when not using a for-each loop

I want to sort my XML in a specific order based of the value of the node "Reason" I have my XML MEYER RICK Talking Out Undefined 29:09 BALENTINE JAMES Talking Out Undefined 16:07 SHOEMAKER ERIC Talking Out Undefined 08:21 HARVEY MICHAEL Talking Out Undefined 02:11 MORRIS BRANDEN Talking Out Undefined 02:05 FORER DAVID Talking Out Undefined 01:15 and here is my current style. All it does is ignores any AgentSales that has a State of "Talking Out" But then just goes down the line and shows the rest of the data as-is. I want to sort the data by Time while still not showing AgentSales with "Talking Out" and "Talking In" I am pretty sure I just have to update my select to: But how do I sort the rest of the data leftover? Agent Name State Time #cccccc
