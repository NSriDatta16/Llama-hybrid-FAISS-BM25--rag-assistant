Problems in building model predicting probablity of student's admission

I'm trying to build a model predicting the probability of a student's admission in Russian educational system. There are exams for every school subject. The student can take several of them. Based on the results of the exams, the student could be admitted to some faculty (for example, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Politics). I use scikit-learn to build the model. I tried Naive Bayes, Random Forest and another classification estimators, but there was no much difference. I used method predict_proba to get probabilities, and a dataset with scores for every taken exam as features and faculty as target (faculty is treated as class) The main problem is that when adding more taken exams, the probability of faculty decreases, while it should increase or not change. My guess is that the model gives the most popular faculties among students with such scores, not probability of admission. Is there something I can do to improve the model?
