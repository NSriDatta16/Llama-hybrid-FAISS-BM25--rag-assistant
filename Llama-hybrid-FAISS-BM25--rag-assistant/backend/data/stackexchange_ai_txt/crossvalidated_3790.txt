Denote $\mu$ the mean ($\neq$ average), $m$ the median, $\sigma$ the standard deviation and $M$ the mode. Finally, let $X$ be the sample, a realization of a continuous unimodal distribution $F$ for which the first two moments exist. It's well known that $$|\mu-m|\leq\sigma\label{d}\tag{1}$$ This is a frequent textbook exercise: \begin{eqnarray} |\mu-m| &=& |E(X-m)| \\ &\leq& E|X-m| \\ &\leq& E|X-\mu| \\ &=& E\sqrt{(X-\mu)^2} \\ &\leq& \sqrt{E(X-\mu)^2} \\ &=& \sigma \end{eqnarray} The first equality derives from the definition of the mean, the third comes about because the median is the unique minimiser (among all $c$'s) of $E|X-c|$ and the fourth from Jensen's inequality (i.e. the definition of a convex function). Actually, this inequality can be made tighter. In fact, for any $F$, satisfying the conditions above, it can be shown [3] that $$|m-\mu|\leq \sqrt{0.6}\sigma\label{f}\tag{2}$$ Even though it is in general not true ( Abadir, 2005 ) that any unimodal distribution must satisfy either one of $$M\leq m\leq\mu\textit{ or }M\geq m\geq \mu$$ it can still be shown that the inequality $$|\mu-M|\leq\sqrt{3}\sigma\label{e}\tag{3}$$ holds for any unimodal, square integrable distribution (regardless of skew). This is proven formally in Johnson and Rogers (1951) though the proof depends on many auxiliary lemmas that are hard to fit here. Go see the original paper. A sufficient condition for a distribution $F$ to satisfy $\mu\leq m\leq M$ is given in [2]. If $F$: $$F(m−x)+F(m+x)\geq 1 \text{ for all }x\label{g}\tag{4}$$ then $\mu\leq m\leq M$. Furthermore, if $\mu\neq m$, then the inequality is strict. The Pearson Type I to XII distributions are one example of family of distributions satisfying $(4)$ [4] (for example, the Weibull is one common distribution for which $(4)$ does not hold, see [5]). Now assuming that $(4)$ holds strictly and w.l.o.g. that $\sigma=1$, we have that $$3(m-\mu)\in(0,3\sqrt{0.6}] \mbox{ and } M-\mu\in(m-\mu,\sqrt{3}]$$ and since the second of these two ranges is not empty, it's certainly possible to find distributions for which the assertion is true (e.g. when $0 [0]: The Moment Problem for Unimodal Distributions.
