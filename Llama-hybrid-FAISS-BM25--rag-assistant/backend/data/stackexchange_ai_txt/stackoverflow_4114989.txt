Encode/Decode RTF data with PHP?

I'm writing a script that will convert one file type to another (for some song presentation software normally used by churches.) I can not extract all the song lyrics and relevant data from the one file type, now I need to convert it to the other. The other filetype is stored as RTFdata inside XML nodes. For example: RTFData="e1xydGYxXGFuc2lcYW5zaWNwZzEyNTJcY29jb2FydGY5NDlcY29jb2FzdWJydGY1NDAKe1xmb250dGJsXGYwXGZzd2lzc1xmY2hhcnNldDAgSGVsdmV0aWNhO30Ke1xjb2xvcnRibDtccmVkMjU1XGdyZWVuMjU1XGJsdWUyNTU7fQpccGFyZFx0eDU2MFx0eDExMjBcdHgxNjgwXHR4MjI0MFx0eDI4MDBcdHgzMzYwXHR4MzkyMFx0eDQ0ODBcdHg1MDQwXHR4NTYwMFx0eDYxNjBcdHg2NzIwXHFjXHBhcmRpcm5hdHVyYWwKClxmMFxmczEyMCBcY2YxIFdpdGggZXZlcnkgYnJlYXRoXApXaXRoIGV2ZXJ5IHN0ZXB9" So first, I need to be able to decode these strings so I can see how they are assembled, but once I figure that out I also need a way to convert strings into this format. I've searched around on google but found no good solution for encoding or decoding RTFdata with PHP. Any ideas?
