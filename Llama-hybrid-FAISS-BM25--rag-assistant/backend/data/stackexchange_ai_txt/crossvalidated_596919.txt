How to calculate the coefficient of absolute regularity?

I am reading the paper and try to understand the example solution in p. 14. In particular, if the Markov chain has stationary distribution $\pi$ and $a$ -step transition distribution $P^a$ , then $$β(a) = \int π(dx)||P^a(x) − π||_{TV}. \tag{18} $$ Consider first the two-state Markov chain $S_t$ pictured in Figure 2. By direct calculation using (18), the mixing coefficients for this process are $β(a) = \frac {4}{9} (\frac{1}{2})^a$ . Also, I cited the Definition 1 ( $β$ -mixing). For each $a \in N$ and any $t \in Z$ , the coefficient of absolute regularity, or $β$ -mixing coefficient, $β(a)$ , is $$β(a) :=||P^t_{−∞} ⊗ P^∞_{t+a} - P_{t,a}||_{TV} \tag{1}$$ where $|| · ||_{TV}$ is the total variation norm, and $P_{t,a}$ is the joint distribution of $(X^t_{−∞}, X^∞_{t+a})$ . A stochastic process is said to be absolutely regular, or $β$ -mixing, if $β(a) → 0$ as $a → ∞$ . My question. How to obtain the $β(a) = \frac {4}{9} (\frac{1}{2})^a$ ? My attempt is. library(markovchain) P = matrix(c(1/2, 1, 1/2, 0),,2) # transition matrix MyStates
