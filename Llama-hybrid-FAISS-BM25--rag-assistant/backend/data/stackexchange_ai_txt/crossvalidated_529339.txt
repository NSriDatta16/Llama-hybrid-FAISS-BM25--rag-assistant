Aperiodicity or the absence thereof is a minor nuisance: when a chain is periodic, it does not converge to the stationary distribution, strictly speaking. This does not prevent Birkhoff's ergodic theorem to apply of course and most Monte Carlo applications of the MCMC principle still apply. Furthermore, periodicity can be avoided by looking at the skeleton kernel $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty (1-\varepsilon)\varepsilon^{i-1} K^i\qquad\varepsilon>0$$ which consists in subsampling randomly the Markov sequence at a Geometric rate.
