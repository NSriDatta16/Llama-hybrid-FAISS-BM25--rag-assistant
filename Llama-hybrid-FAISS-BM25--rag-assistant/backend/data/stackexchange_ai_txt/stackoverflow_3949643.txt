Using Drag and Drop In Websites?

As i would now like to develop better webapps then the basic php and javascript ones that i currently create, i would like to know how web devs create some of the amazing websites that i have used over the past few years. For example, On some of the websites that i visit they have the ability to drag and drop items from a palette onto the webpage. I am thinking mostly about some of the online diagramming tools that i have seen. How do they do this because i am currently baffled. I would like to start creating these types of websites and currently i have no idea how to proceed. I first want to create some small tester websites that allow just very basic drag and drop use. If anyone could point me in the right directions in terms of links to tutorials or library's that have this feature then i would be most grateful. Cheers.
