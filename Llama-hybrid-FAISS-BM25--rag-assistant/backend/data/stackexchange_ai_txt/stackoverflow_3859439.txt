In the child's constructor you can probably overwrite or add array elements to $this->_rules , as it will already exist as soon as you create a Model_UserAdmin instance. Specifically, in Model_UserAdmin don't define a protected $rules so it gets it from its parent, and then in the constructor: $this->_rules['password']['max_length'] = 42 ; unset($this->_rules['password_confirm']) ; You can also add some sanity check right before to make sure those keys exist, in case you change them in Model_User and forget. It's not exactly elegant but it should work. I do suppose you can create some wrapper functions around it (probably in a class ORM extends ORM_Core so they're available when you extend ORM) that modify the rules in a more formal way. edit please look at biakaveron's answer for a tip on where to place the child rules ( _initialize() instead of the constructor)
