How to create a simple document assembly application for Word documents?

I need to create a simple document assembly application to create Word files. We work with multiple templates, some derivated from others. So, instead of having tons of templates I would like to create something that uses a standard template and allowes me to change the header, footer and different other sections in the document based on my needs. For example: I will choose a template, then a different introductory paragraph, then a secondary paragraph and so on. I tried a solution in Infopath, but not sure if this is the simplest one. If you have any suggestions please let me know! (and another thing I am new to this, so no programming clue, but learn quickly) Thanks,
