Synthetic data for PCA

I was trying to evaluate different algorithms for PCA like eigenvalue decomposition, SVD, Lanczos Algorithm, Power iteration. I also want to do some other analysis I could find any papers concerning this. What would be the best method to generate synthetic for PCA. Basically generate data with "principal components" and noise and find which method finds it optimally. Any reference would be appreciated. Edit : The goal is to find if PCs calculated from EVD are "better" than PCs caculated from other methods. Or in general which method works best in identifying PCS. I was thinking of generating synthetic PCs first then convert them to singular features and then apply each algorithm, but i am not sure how to proceed.
