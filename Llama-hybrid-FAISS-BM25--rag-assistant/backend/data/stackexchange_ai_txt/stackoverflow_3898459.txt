Try using something other than bloated Spring garbage and especially "AOP" trash. Use pure-Java PicoContainer and ditch all that ridiculous XML dependency injection config (convention over configuration? ...yeah right) AND the outrageous number of jar hell dependencies (such as the aopappliance junk that is giving you trouble now). Spring has had it's day, and won big championing a few good concepts like DI and TDD but the implementation of the concept sucks, at this point it's just an absurd number of sub-projects riding the Spring bandwagon. Now there are better alternatives out there which rely on actual Java programming rather than "XML programming". If you're new you'll be spending time learning anyway, and I guarantee the learning curve for constructor-based Pico dependency injection is easier. http://www.picocontainer.org/
