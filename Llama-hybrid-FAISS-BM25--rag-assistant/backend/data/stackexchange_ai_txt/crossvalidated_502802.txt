How to interpret a specific value

We need to make a prediction on a data set; we will use logistic regression. We have the following predictor variable: spezialiserung_schule (specialisation school); it is nominal and can take the values "art", "science" and "trade". If we run a simple logistic regression on it and check the results using summary() , we get the results shown below. We are particularly interested in the estimate and the p-value. We understand that for both values p is quite large and the estimates are not great either. If it were a simple binary variable I could multiply the estimate by 0 or 1 and then add the intercept and get the log(ratio). How exactly do I evaluate this if I am no longer using binary? What would be the next step that I take afterwards? glm(formula = job ~ (spezialisierung_schule), family = binomial("logit"), data = Trainingsdaten) Deviance Residuals Min 1Q Mean 2Q Max -1.5786 -1.5392 0.8237 0.8545 1.3018 Coefficients Estimate Std.
