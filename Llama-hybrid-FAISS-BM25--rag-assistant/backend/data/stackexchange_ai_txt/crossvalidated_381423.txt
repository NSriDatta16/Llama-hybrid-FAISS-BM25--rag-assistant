model selection for peak findings

I need to create a model, that finds when there will be a significant chance of occurring High peak in the signal. My data has N length of inputs and corresponding N length of outputs. For example, Input is [12398.2, 15031.89, 17760.46, 20489.03, 23217.6, 25754.98,.....,12456.9,....24567.98] corresponding output is [0,0,0,0,0,1,....,0,....1] . 0 represents No Peak and 1 represents Peak . So, I need to create a time series model to predict when the peak will occur. I explore more about the model selection. I came across a few links which give me a slight idea about generating the model. One efficient method is to come with window size and analyze its local mean to predict whether the peak will occur in a particular window frame. In this case using ARIMA model helps. But still, I hope that there will another easy approach to do this task. Any other possible method I could try to predict the peak? Finding Significant Peaks Evaluations of different method
