WORD VBA sorting words in paragraphs

Hi guys i am hoping that you guys can point me in the right direction. I am trying to come up with a macro that will sort words in ascending order for each paragraph. To make it clear i am giving an example below: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The output should show below the para/s right at the end of the docu already sorted. Any help or advice as to how i can go about it using Ranges, pls let me know. thanks!
