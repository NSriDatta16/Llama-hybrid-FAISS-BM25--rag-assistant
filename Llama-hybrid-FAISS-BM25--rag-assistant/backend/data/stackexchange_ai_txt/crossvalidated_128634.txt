Logistic regression and the 2 by 2, or 3 by 2 contingency table

I just have a question about logistic regression and the 2 by 2 or 3 by 2 or n by 2 contingency table: the table can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table My question is when I have a table like this: Right-handed Left-handed Total Male 43 9 52 Female 44 4 48 Total 87 13 100 if I want to know if gender is associated with a person being right-handed or left-handed, I can calculate the odd ratio as an indication of whether being male is more likely to be left-handed: (9/52) / (4/48) = 2.07 Then, I can also test using the Pearson Chi-square test to see if there is significant association? like p-value But I can also create an indicator variable with 100 people in the data set, 52 being male, 48 being females, and let 1= left-handed , 0= right-handed. Then get the odd-ratio from the output of the logistic regression. So my question is, I am not sure which is the right way to find out which group is more likely to be left-handed? Also is it possible to get some opinions about what is the differences between the two approaches? are they answering the same question? 1) Basically, I just want to know what is the difference between the two approaches here in answering questions? (what kind of question does each approaches designed to answer?). 2) What is the difference between the p-value given by say in this case the 2-by-2 contingency table and the p-value given by the significant test of the parameter estimate of gender(M,F) in the logistic regression? Could someone kindly explain?
