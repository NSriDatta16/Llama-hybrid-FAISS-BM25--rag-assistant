I don't quite understand still why the other choices don't show up in SSMS but ultimately what I did was just create a population schedule/job that performed a Full-Text Catalog REORGANIZE. I then scripted out this newly created job and changed the command to do a REBUILD instead. It works fine so I guess it solved my need but I would love to hear if anyone knows why it doesn't show up in SSMS properties window for the Full-Text Catalog.
