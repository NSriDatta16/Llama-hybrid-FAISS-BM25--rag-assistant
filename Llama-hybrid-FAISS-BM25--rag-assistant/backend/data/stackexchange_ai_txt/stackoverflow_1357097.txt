comparing/intersecting compare criteria

If there's any open source code that does this already I'm interested in hearing about it. But I haven't seen it yet so I'm trying to roll my own. Example: variable x = compareCriteriaBetween 3 and 6 variable y = compareCriteriaLesserThanOrEqual 5 The difficult part for me is finding an elegant way to compare the compareCriteria and create an intersection. In the example the intersection between the two is 'between 3 and 5'. How can I implement this in a 'tell don't ask' manner? Note that compareCriteria can be completely unrelated (eg startsWithLetter versus betweenNumber).
