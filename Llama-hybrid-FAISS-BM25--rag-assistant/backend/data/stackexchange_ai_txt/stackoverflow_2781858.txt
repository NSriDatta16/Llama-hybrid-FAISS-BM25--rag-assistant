Is there a more elegant/efficient way? No, not really. You could connect through a BindingSource and that has Filter and Sort properties, but that doesn't work for a simple List<>. So you would have to use something like a DataTable and that would not be an improvement. Your current method seems fine, especially if you can use LINQ to filter the list. But I hope you're not looping over the Items property each time, just assign the filtered list to Listbox1.DataSource.
