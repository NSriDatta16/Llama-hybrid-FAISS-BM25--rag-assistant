Applying EWMA to first difference of a time series

I am trying to fit an EWMA to the first difference but I am unsure how to properly fit the EWMA and how to assess if one model is better than another. I am trying to use the EWMA described in the forecast package: https://training-course-material.com/training/R_-_Forecasting The first difference occurs always at integer values, most of which are zero, i.e. $$x_i=1,0,0,0,0,3,-2,1,0,0,0,...$$ Are there any standard ways to modelling first differences with EWMA? When I try to auto-fit it, I get an extremely tiny $\alpha$. Also, if I wanted to determine if another timer-series variable is correlated with this EWMA, how should I compute this?
