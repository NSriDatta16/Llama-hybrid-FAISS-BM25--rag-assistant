I suppose you've used the template which implements the following method in the MainViewController : - (IBAction)showInfo:(id)sender { FlipsideViewController *controller = [[FlipsideViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"FlipsideView" bundle:nil]; controller.delegate = self; ... } As you can see it sets the delegate of the FlipSideController to the instance of the MainViewController. A way would be to put an action into your FlipSideViewController , something like this: - (IBAction)changeTextInMainView { [(MainViewController *)self.delegate changeText]; } which is triggered when touching your button on the backside. You've got to wire it in IB as well as add the method to the header. Then implement something like this in your MainViewController - (void)changeText { self.myLabel.text = @"text changed to this"; } Add this method to the header as well. Another more elegant approach would be to save the text of your label in a property(maybe in it's own model class) which can be accessed from any view, by passing it by reference down the controllers. Then add a Key Value Observer from each viewController to the property which should show the text and update the view.
