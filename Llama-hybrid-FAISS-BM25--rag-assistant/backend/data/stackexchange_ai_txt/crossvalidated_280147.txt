You should look at the H2O.ai package. It handles categorical variables out of the box without having to do any encoding (make sure the variables are factors). I particularly like their implementation of Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM) because you can then look at the variable importance after building the model. GBM's also have the nice feature of being resistant to overfitting. If you want to explore other models, they have: GLM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Deep Learning, etc. See: http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/gbm.html It's also easy to install (Windows, Linux, Mac) and easy to run with API's using R, Python, Java, and Scala. It can use multiple cores to speed things up. In the near future, they will support GPUs. It's also open source and free (There is Enterprise support).
