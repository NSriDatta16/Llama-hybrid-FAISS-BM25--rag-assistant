You can't really integrate LINQ into classic ASP unless you write your own interpreter for it, but then what's the point. Doing that would be the same as writing your own programming language. As Corbin suggests, try migrating the data access layer to .NET where you can then leverage it from classic ASP via a web service or something. You don't have to re-write everything all at once, but you will have to pull your db code out and re-write that in .NET if you want to leverage LINQ. Good luck. Here's hoping that your db code was separated enough to make this relatively painless.
