Which is the "most properly working" Bert-Ner repository

I am trying to find a repository in Github to get a Pytorch-reimplementation of the Bert model for NER task. So far, I found the following repos: https://github.com/kamalkraj/BERT-NER https://github.com/Louis-udm/NER_BERT_CRF https://github.com/sberbank-ai/ner-bert They are not exactly the same models (for example some use CRF as additionally), but for me the correctness is more important. When I check the issues, I saw that people were complaining about either mistakes in the evaluation or training procedures. So, my question, has anyone tried any of these repositories for Ner tasks before? If you know any other options, I'm open to hear.
