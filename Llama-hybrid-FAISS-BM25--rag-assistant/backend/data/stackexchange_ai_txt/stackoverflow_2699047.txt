How to include simple collections in ConfigurationSection

Is there a way for me to include a simple array of strings, or List on my custom subclass of ConfigurationSection? (Or an array or generic list of simple data objects, for that matter?) I'm becoming familiar with the new (and VERY verbose) ConfigurationSection, ConfigurationElement, and ConfigurationElementCollection classes, but I'm by no means an expert yet. It seems like ConfigurationSection should handle simple collections/lists on its own, without me having to create a custom ConfigurationElementCollection subclass for each and every one. But I haven't found any reference to this ability online. Edit: accepting Dan's response as the answer, since it's probably the closest thing I'm going to get to the "old style" configSections. I always found it easy, flexible, and elegant that any XmlSerializable object could easily become a configSection. I'm sure the new framework is more powerful; however it's sad that it is SO cumbersome for simple configuration contructs, that we're reduced to going back to String.Split().
