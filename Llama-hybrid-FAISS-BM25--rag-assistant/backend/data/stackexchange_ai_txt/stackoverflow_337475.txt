I believe that a varchar uses only the minimum storage required to hold the string. MSDN and books online seem to confirm this. However, the sum of stored data (including other fields) cannot exceed a certain length (which I think is 8K). I don't think you've got this problem, as I think it is flagged at creation time. more details are here: http://doc.ddart.net/mssql/sql70/ca-co_3.htm
