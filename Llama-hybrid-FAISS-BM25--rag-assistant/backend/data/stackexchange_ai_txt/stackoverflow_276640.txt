The mechanize main page says: mechanize.Browser is a subclass of mechanize.UserAgentBase, which is, in turn, a subclass of urllib2.OpenerDirector My understanding is that urllib2 is one of the sandboxed modules in GAE, with its functionality being replaced by the Google-provided urlfetch. You'd need to re-implement the mechanize.UserAgentBase class to use urlfetch, if that's at all possible.
