Yes, tree based methods are good at detecting interactions, but not always. For example, using $x_1\lessgtr0$ and $x_2\lessgtr0$ in subsequent levels of the tree would be equivalent to using $x_1x_2\lessgtr0$ on one level. That said, since you set a max depth hyperparameter in random forests, adding promising interactions will decrease your overall depth and paves the way for more performance via leaving the remaining levels for other features.
