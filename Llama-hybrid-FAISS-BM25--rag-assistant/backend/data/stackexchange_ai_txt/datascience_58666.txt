How to implement Classification and Anomaly detection (C++)

I am creating a system using C++(DX11) and i'm reading raw data into my program, i want to classify what the 3D data-set i'm reading in is and detect any anomalies it may have when compared to a database of the same types of item. I've not really done much in regards to machine learning aside from simple KMeans and linear regression solutions, what would be the best approach to implementing something like classification and anomaly detection in my program and what background reading/research might be required? Currently, the program can display the raw data as a 3D image.
