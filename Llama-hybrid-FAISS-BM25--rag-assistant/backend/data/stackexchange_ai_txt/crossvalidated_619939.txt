Random is such a non-specific term that even in common conversation it can cause confusion. You can look up the Webster definition and decide for yourself. Statisticians don't tend to use the word "random" in isolation - we randomize , we have random effects , we have random variables all of which have well defined mathematical meanings, but pedantic differences in the invocation of "randomness". In common parlance, the stock market is random, yet people still invest in it and on average earn something... on the other hand, independent pulls on the slot machine at the Casino are just as likely to be a loss, but Gambler's Fallacy suckers rubes into playing another game on the false belief a win probability is amassing beneath their feet. In discussing medical data, the fact that a person receiving superior treatment experienced a less favorable outcome seems to discredit the stochastic ordering of events entirely. I think a widely acceptable statistician's definition of random is: a set of outcomes that can be characterized by probability . As regards Bayesian vs Frequentist or the fact a deterministic outcome may just have probability 1, the best response is a cheeky grin. This is a dressed-down definition of a random variable and suffices to encapsulate systems that are completely random (memoryless, all noise no signal), systems that are chaotic, or systems that are somewhat predictable.
