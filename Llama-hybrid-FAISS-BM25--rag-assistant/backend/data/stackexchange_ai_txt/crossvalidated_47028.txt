Confusion related to modelling of temporal correlation

I was a bit confused about the modelling of temporal correlation in a certain paper. Lets say, I have vector $\bf{x}$ of dimension m, and a time series $\bf{x_1},\bf{x_2},...\bf{x_N}$. Now I want to model the temporal correlation of the data points. So if I define $\bf{x_n} = A\bf{x_{n-1}} + w_n$ where A is the parameter and $w= N(0,\tau)$, how does this model the temporal correlation of each dimension? This might be a very basic question. But I really want to know how this models the correlation.
