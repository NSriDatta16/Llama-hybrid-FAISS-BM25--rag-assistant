While this is not an academic definition, it might serve as a practical one. A data warehouse is a collection of datamarts and will combine datasets across the breadth of an organization. A datamart will contain datasets specific to certain portions of the business. In the datamart you will find fact tables, measurable pieces of information, along with dimensions, attributes of your measurable pieces. A true data warehouse will have conformed dimension tables that can be shared across datamarts. An example... Your company may build a datamart around sales. And another datamart around human resources. If the customer dimension table is shared across both these datamarts, it would be considered a conformed dimension. All three of these entities together would make up a data warehouse. As someone else stated you can find more detailed information by searching for Ralph Kimball's Data Strategies.
