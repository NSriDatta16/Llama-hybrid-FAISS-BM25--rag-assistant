Get the AVG of two SQL Access Queries

I'm trying to get the AVERAGE from the results of two separate sql queries built in MS Access. The first sql query pulls the largest record: SELECT DISTINCTROW Sheet1.Tx_Date, Sheet1.LName, Sheet1.Patient_Name, Sheet1.MRN, Max(Sheet1.) AS [Max Of FEV1_ACT], Max(Sheet1.FEF_25_75_ACT) AS [Max Of FEF_25_75_ACT] FROM Sheet1 GROUP BY Sheet1.Tx_Date, Sheet1.LName, Sheet1.Patient_Name, Sheet1.MRN; The second sql query pulls the second largest record: SELECT Sheet1.MRN, Sheet1.Patient_Name, Sheet1.Lname, Max(Sheet1.FEV1_ACT) AS 2ndLrgOfFEV1_ACT, Max(Sheet1.FEF_25_75_ACT) AS 2ndLrgOfFEF_25_75_ACT FROM Sheet1 WHERE (((Sheet1.FEV1_ACT) These two queries work great, I just need some help on pulling the AVERAGE of the results of these two queries into one. Thanks.
