The main problem with formats is the reliance on global variables. For other problems with formats, see pages 449 - 454 of Perl Best Practices . The modern solution would be Perl6::Form . This is a backport of what they are planning for Perl 6. What follows is a rough translation of your format code to Perl6::Form . I do not know Perl6::Form very well, so there may be ways to make it better or truer to your original example: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use Perl6::Form; while( ) { my ($aprille, $lorem) = split(/\|/, $_, 2); print form( "{>} {[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[} | {[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[}", $., $aprille, $lorem, " | ", ); } __DATA__ WHAN that Aprille with his shoures soote |Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, The droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote,|consectetur adipisicing elit, And bathed every veyne in swich licour, |sed do eiusmod tempor Of which vertu engendred is the flour; |incididunt ut labore et dolore Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth |magna aliqua.
