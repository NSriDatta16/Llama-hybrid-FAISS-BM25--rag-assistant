What are some good datasets to learn basic machine learning algorithms and why?

I am new to machine learning and looking for some datasets through which i can compare and contrasts the differences between different machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, Boosting, SVM and Neural Networks) Where can I find such datasets ? What should I be looking for while considering a dataset ? It would be great if you can point to some good datasets and also tell me what makes them a good dataset?
