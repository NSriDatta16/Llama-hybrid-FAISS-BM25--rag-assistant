Can supervised machine learning techniques infer the formula (if it exists) for a statistical model?

Suppose that we have response data $y_i$ generated by a specific mathematical function $y_i=\mathcal{F}(X_i)+e_i$ where $X_i$ is a vector of predictor variables with random error term $e_i$. Without any prior knowledge of the function that generates the response observations, is it possible to accurately infer the form and parameters of $\mathcal{F}(X_i)$ using supervised machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting, artificial neural networks, or other suitable techniques? For example, let's generate random observations according to a nonlinear function $\mathcal{F}(X_i)$ which would be difficult to infer with a parametric statistical models such as linear least squares regression: $y_i=\frac{\beta_1 x_{1i}+\beta_2sin(e^{\beta_3 x_{2i}})}{\beta_4^{x_{3i}}}+e_i$, where $x_{ki}\sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$ and $e_i\sim N(0,1)$. While building an accurate predictive model $f(X_i)$ would certainly be useful, are there machine learning tools that allow us to go a step further and accurately infer the actual function $\mathcal{F}(X_i)$?
