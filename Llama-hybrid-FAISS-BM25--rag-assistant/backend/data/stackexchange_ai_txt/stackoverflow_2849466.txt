Container/Wrapper Div does not contain all content?

Container/Wrapper Div does not contain all content (ie all the child Div's).I've tried overflow: hidden but still doesn't work. Can someone please tell me why this is happening and what are the possible solutions. Thank you in advance ;-) for some reason the whole code does not display?? #wrapper { margin:0 auto; width: 600px; background: yellow; } my beautiful site Home About Services Contact us subheading long paragraph copyright 123
