This might not be the most elegant solution and it might not work either but is is worth a try. Before you call the next animation in the onAnimationEnd() method try to set the ImageViews new position to the position where the animation ended using the setFrame() method. This might not work as I haven't tested it myself but give it a try and tell me the outcome.
