Beta distributions have support $(0,1).$ Here is the density function for $\mathsf{Beta}(2,4),$ which has $\mu=1/3,\sigma^2=2/63.$ [Using R.] curve(dbeta(x,2,4), 0, 1, ylab="PDF", main="BETA(2,4)") abline(h=0, col="green2") Averages of even small samples from this distribution are nearly normal. The boundedness prevents extreme values and so convergence of the Central Limit Theorem is relatively rapid. The simulation below shows the approximate distribution of samples of size $n = 20$ from this distribution (histogram). The red density curve is for the best-fitting normal distribution $\mathsf{Norm}(1/3, 0.03984).$ set.seed(2020) a = replicate(10^5, mean(rbeta(20, 2, 4))) mean(a) [1] 0.3331668 # aprx 1/3 sd(a) [1] 0.0398627 # aprx 0.3984 sqrt(2/(63*20)) [1] 0.03984095 # exact SD hdr = "n=20: Sample Means for BETA(2,4)" hist(a, prob=T, br=50, col="skyblue2", main=hdr) curve(dnorm(x, mean(a), sd(a)), add=T, col="red")
