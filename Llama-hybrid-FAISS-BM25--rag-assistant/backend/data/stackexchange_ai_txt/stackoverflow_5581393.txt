I'm not exactly sure what your trying to do with jaavascript because I don't think you can have javascript in an xml file but if you wanted to output the js with the xml here is what your could should look like $id = '1232'; $name = 'Christopher'; header('Content-type: text/xml'); header('Pragma: public'); header('Cache-control: private'); header('Expires: -1'); echo ' '; echo "\n \n"; echo " $id \n"; echo " $name \n"; ; echo " "; echo ' '; since you are outputing xml you don't want break elements in your xml instead you want new line characters to make it readable by source. I think what your really want for the js is to just give the link location in the xml but i'm not 100% on that I'm a little fuzzy on what your trying to do ohh and you don't need breaks in the header ** To answer your questions ** again I'm still not sure if your trying to execute javascript in xml or if you are simply trying to provided full link or relative line in the xml so if you wanted to have a relative link adding processing.js for a full link http://example.com/processing.js and if you want to execute the js I think you want to put this in the xml however I believe that will only work in firefox pleas see this blog for more detailson that
