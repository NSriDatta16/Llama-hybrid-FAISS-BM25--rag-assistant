Yes. I have no experience using PRIMER because I didn't want to pay for it, but I have used the vegan package in R extensively for cluster analysis, NMDS, perMANOVA, CCA and PCA. To give you some idea of what R is able to achieve (at least graphically) using this package, I've included a final image from my thesis (first image) and and alternative version I was playing around with that incorporated ggplot2 (second image but not finalized, I did this one differently and wrong in the early days!). As always with R, there is a load of flexibility that I think may be a bit more limited in PRIMER (just a guess).
