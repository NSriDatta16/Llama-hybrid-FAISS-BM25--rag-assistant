Can I perform typical Bayesian contrast analysis, if my data takes the form of quantiles?

I'm working with some data from a cell analyzer, which takes millions of measurements and returns mean, median and 5% / 95% quantiles for the distribution. Preliminary model comparisons have indicated good fit to the data for a gamma distribution. The experimental design is a straightforward ANOVA-type hierarchical model: $$ y_{ij} \sim Gamma(Sh, Sh/\mu_{ij}) $$ $$ log(\mu_{ij}) = \beta_{0} + \beta^{i}_{1}, i \in \{ 1, \dots 3 \} + $$ $$ \beta^{j}_{2}, j \in \{ 1, \dots 3 \}, + \beta^{i}_{1} * \beta^{j}_{2} $$ In the Bayesian context the $\beta$ and Sh variables would have some sort of uninformative hyperparameters. I want to investigate the contrasts between groups. I would prefer to do this in a Bayesian manner as I prefer my answer in the form of a probability mass. What I would like to do is Fit each group's mean and quantiles to a gamma distribution using, for example, get.gamma.par Draw samples from the fitted distribution for each group Evaluate contrasts by subtracting samples of contrast groups as described in, for example, the Kruschke textbook I am not sure if this procedure is legit because I am not generating posterior distributions using MCMC, but rather have essentially been given the posterior parametrization by this cell analyzer. Can I still run a Bayesian contrast analysis given data in this form?
