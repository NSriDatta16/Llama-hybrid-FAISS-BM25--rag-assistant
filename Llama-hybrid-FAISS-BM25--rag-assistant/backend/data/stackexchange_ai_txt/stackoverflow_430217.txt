This is one of those object-relational impedance mis match mofos. In OO, for sure the prefix of entity name seems not to fit. However, in an RDMBS the entity prefix uniquely identifies an attribute and is encouraged to avoid this: SELECT PostCode --OMG!!! Which table do I come from! C.PostCode or S.PostCode??!??! FROM Customer C INNER JOIN Supplier S ON C.PrefferredSupplierID = S.SupplierID My advice is to pick a convention arbitrarily and roughly stick with it. Its a convention to save time after all! Probably doesn't matter.. :)
