I have good news for all of you. There is an SSMS add-in for this. It allows to organize into custom folders all databases, stored procedures and other database objects as well. Just as if this was a native SQL Server Management Studio functionality. The tool name is SQL Handy Groupie and can be found at www.skilledsoftware.com . Have fun.
