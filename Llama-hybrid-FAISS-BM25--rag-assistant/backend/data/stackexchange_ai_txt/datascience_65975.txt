What are some resources to test your data science skills?

I can't get a job to save my life so I am guessing my lack of skills is an issue. I've been doing a lot of reading on statistics and I am getting antsy - I want to move from theory to application and test my skills to see how I measure up with real practitioners. Most books I have don't have solutions. They have questions and labs but without some semblance of an answer, I don't know if I am doing it right. I know when it comes to fitting models, there isn't a "right" answer, but there are definitely bad answers. I just want to make sure my answers are good enough. What are some resources where I can practice my data science, statistical inference, machine learning skills - with answers? I know of https://www.kaggle.com/competitions has tasks but those seem beyond my ability right now - and obviously won't come with right answers. Are there websites that test your ability to build a predictive model? Any suggestions?
