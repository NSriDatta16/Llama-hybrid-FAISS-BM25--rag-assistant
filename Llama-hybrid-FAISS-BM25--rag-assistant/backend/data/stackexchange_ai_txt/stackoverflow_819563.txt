How to split single quoted comma delimited values containing commas in Ruby

Say I have a string with comma delimited values enclosed in single quotes that may or may not include commas, like this: "'apples,bananas','lemons'" and I want to split that into an array ["apples,bananas", "lemons"] Apparently, if I split(',') the string I get [ "'apples", "bananas'", "lemons" ] which I don't understand. The only way to do this that I've come up with is a = [] s = "'apples,bananas','lemons'" s.scan(/\'([^\']+)\'/){|i| a But is there a more elegant way? Is there something with the split method that I don't get, which is causing the strange result?
