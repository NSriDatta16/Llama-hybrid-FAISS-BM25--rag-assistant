Detecting errors after moving SVN-backed files

I know how to move a directory locally in Windows Explorer, so that it gets moved in SVN too after it is commited with TortoiseSVN: How do you move a file in SVN? Use right-drag -> move Now my problem is that one may forget to do that, and move the directory directly: on my machine: everything looks fine for TortoiseSVN; all my builds and compiling uses the moved files. on the SVN repository: the move has not been done, everything stays as before on a fellow developper machine: after updating, the move is not seen, so the builds break. Question: how do you check that all directories and files below a parent directory have the same structure locally than in SVN?
