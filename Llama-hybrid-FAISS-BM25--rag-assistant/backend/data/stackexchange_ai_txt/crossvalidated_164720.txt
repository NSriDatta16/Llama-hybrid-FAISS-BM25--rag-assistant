How to apply distance-based clustering or dimensionality reduction for too many samples

I have a dataset with 200K samples (cases) and 30 variables. Every distance-based method for clustering or dimension reduction technique that I use, such as DBSCAN , Hierarchical Clustering , LLE , Isomap and ... fail to run on my machine (normally I get R Session Terminated error) due to the large distance file being generated. ( Distance calculation requires o(n^2) time and space ) Is there any solution to handle this problem? Is there any good package for the mentioned clustering or dimensionality reduction in R or Matlab that is suitable ?
