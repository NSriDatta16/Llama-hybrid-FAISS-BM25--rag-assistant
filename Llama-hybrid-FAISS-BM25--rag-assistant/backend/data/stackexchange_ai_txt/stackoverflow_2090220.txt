Start by plotting the leverage of the outliers and then go for some good ol' interocular trauma (aka look at the scatterplot). Lots of statistical packages have outlier/residual diagnostics, but I prefer Cook's D. You can calculate it by hand if you'd like using this formula from mtsu.edu (original link is dead, this is sourced from archive.org).
