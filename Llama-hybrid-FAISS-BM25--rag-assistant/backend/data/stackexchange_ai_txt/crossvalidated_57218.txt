Whether a variable is categorical depends only on the variable, not on any "sharing" of common values. In your case, LAW_FAM is categorical because it has four discrete categories: FRA, SCA, ENG, GER. In particular, LAW_FAM is nominal: the categories have no ordering. You could have several countries which happen to have exactly the same DEP_AVG, but that doesn't make DEP_AVG a categorical variable. I would suggest that you look at Multilevel/Hierarchical Models , since you have hierarchical data: country-level data and company-level data nested within countries. Your post is very good: you include enough details to help us help you. One more thing that would also help us point you in the right direction is to know what software you will be using for your analysis. EDIT: You ask about Generalized Linear Models, which are chosen for specific kinds of dependent variables. For example, if you were wanting to predict a categorical variable, you'd use Logistic Regression (which is done with a GLM).
