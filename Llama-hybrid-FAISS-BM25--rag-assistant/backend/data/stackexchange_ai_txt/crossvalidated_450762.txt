This is really more of an extended comment than an answer. First of all, it's not at all unusual for the first component in a PCA to capture a large percentage of the variance. Without rotation, this is a very common occurrence. That said, your question is concerned with one aspect of the multitude of subjective decisions required in producing a PCA, any PCA. There are many possible methods and rules for selecting components, here are a few. Your preference for using component 'interpretability' can be considered a sanctioned one as it prioritizes human judgment over machine curation and decision-making. A second approach is to use a graphical heuristic, the so-called scree plot, which involves visually identifying a cut-off in a plot of eigenvalues and retaining those components falling before that threshold. More machine or statistically curated rules are also used. For instance, retain those components with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, thereby ensuring that each component contributes at least as much as a single input variable. This rule is probably the most commonly used default on many software packages. Yet another is to examine the change or difference from one eigenvalue to the next, again with an eye towards choosing components whose difference vs the prior eigenvalue is greater than 1.0. This is my personally preferred rule as it minimizes noisy, irrelevant components. The point is that there is no hard and fast, cookbook best practice when it comes to choosing components in PCA. The choice is yours, just be ready to defend and explain the rule you choose.
