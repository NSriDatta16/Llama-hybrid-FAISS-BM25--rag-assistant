How to synchronize a Jframe show in others computer is same as host?

My project having a Jframe that showing some gui, the gui will represent a user or agent to move into the map. My Jframe will keep refreshing to make the user GUI moving on the map, and it have location to move with. Now I will need to implement the GUI to show in others computer. If i successfully send the information and create a new user to show in the MAP GUI of the host by just a button, any idea how I show the entire map of the host? I need to show the Jframe at host when user access. But i got no idea what kind of thing i need to use to keep synchronize and show it? If i not planing to use java applet, what others can perform this function?
