If this is your actual full dataset and you think it's important to account for subject effects, you're in real trouble, and whether or not to use K-R is the least of your problems. For most subjects, you have only one observation,so the subject effects seriously confound the time effects, and it's a fool's errand to try to sort them out. Your only reasonable option with this dataset is to fit a regular linear model. with time as the sole predictor. Get consulting help to design your next study so that it has a chance of providing useful information. There is a saying about trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear; it applies here. Follow-up I decided to see more specifically how four models compare -- (1) a simple linear fit, (2) the mixed model considered here, (3) the same model as (2), only with fixed subject effects, and (4) the first model with added indicator variables for the four subjects having repeat measurements.

Models (2) and (3) have similar predictions, with the one the last time way higher. As mentioned in the OP, the df for the comparisons in model (2) are near 1 -- really indicating that we can't do those comparisons. MIn model (3), the df are exactly 1. The SEs of the means are way low but with the small d.f., the CIs are actually wider than for model (2). In model (4), we account for the subject variations only where we can assess them -- which "costs" us 4 d.f. for error. We still have 10 df left. The tests of comparisons are similar to those of model (1), and the SEs of the comparisons are not too much higher. To be honest, I wouldn't attach a whole lot of meaning to these interpretations, but it seems to me that adding indicators only for subjects having repeat measurements is one way to account for subject variations in a situation like this.
