The wrong way to do it is create a Process object in the OnStart() method. Tie a method to the Exited event of the process object that restarts the object. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.onexited(VS.71).aspx has some information on the Exited event. The correct way to do it is create a Timer object. Every X amount of minutes, create a Process object, check for the handle ID, and see if it's running. If not, then create a new executable, similar to what you did on the OnStart() method. http://csharpstruggles.blogspot.com/2005/02/using-timer-in-windows-service.html http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vbgeneral/thread/bc175c60-f81b-4d1a-975d-717368468238 The elegant way is, as mentioned above, to do the work in the service itself.
