First of all, you cannot do this in general. Analysing general code to see if it will ever reach a certain point in its execution is undecidable, hence even if you syntactically detect calls to composite , you don't know if they'll be executed without actually executing the code. Now, in a practical sense, you might be able to get some leverage by loading the code as text, and examining it for calls to composite , but this will only be any use at all if you write the classes in a consistent fashion. It won't show calls hiding behind chains of function calls, will falsely flag conditionally guarded calls, and so forth. You're almost certainly better off using another method, such as PHP interfaces for static analysis like this.
