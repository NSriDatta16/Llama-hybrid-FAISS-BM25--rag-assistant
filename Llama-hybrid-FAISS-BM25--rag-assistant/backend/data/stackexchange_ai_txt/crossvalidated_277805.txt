I believe the equation you need to do is: You can find the formula on the "Geometric Brownian Motion" on Wikipedia. My formula matches the one on your video. The only stochastic term is the $W_t$ you will need to simulate with Gaussian. I will skip your calculation for average, variance etc because they are just parameters to Monte Carlo. The video has detailed instructions on how to estimate the parameters. Let's assume your parameters are good. Let's take a look at how you do the simulation: Possible return = Periodic Daily Return * exp(drift + standard-deviation * random(zscore)) This doesn't make any sense to me. Possible return is $S_t$ / $S_0$, right? So what's "periodic daily return"? You will need to simulate many paths. You only did one. You mention random(zscore) is something away from the mean. But this should just be a random sample from the standard normal. No you don't need two return terms. You already have a return in your calculation so you don't need another one. Please look at the equation again. It says the log of daily return is a drift plus a stochastic term driven by brownian motion.
