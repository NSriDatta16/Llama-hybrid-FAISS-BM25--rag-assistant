What does stata's laglimit mean?

I just saw an explanation to xtabond2 here xtabond2 depvar varlist [if exp] [in range] [weight] [, level(#) svmat twostep robust cluster(varname) noconstant small noleveleq orthogonal gmmopt [gmmopt ...] ivopt [ivopt ...] pca components(#) artests(#) arlevels h(#) nodiffsargan nomata] with the explanation in gmmstyle() : The optional laglimits(a b) suboption can override these defaults: for the transformed equation, lagged levels dated t-a to t-b are used as instruments, while for the levels equation, the first-difference dated t-a+1 is normally used. I am quite confused about this. Can anyone explain that with a concrete example?
