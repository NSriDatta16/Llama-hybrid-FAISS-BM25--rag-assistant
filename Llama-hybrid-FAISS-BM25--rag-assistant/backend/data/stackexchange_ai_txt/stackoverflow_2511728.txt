i think you'll have to roll your own. Not to worry though, it shouldn't be that hard. i say shouldn't because it's been a while since i've done .NET CF UI (shooting from the hip) but have implemented a custom scroller for a .NET 2.0 touch screen UI. That said, here's what you need to do: Hide the scroll bars in the grid view Create a custom control which hosts two buttons, one top, one bottom Handle the clicks on those buttons and forward them as scroll up/down calls to the grid view That's the simple way. You don't get the dragging and stuff but that's rarely useful in such a tiny UI anyway. You could also put in later if you want. Caveat: The grid view might not have ScrollUp/Down APIs exposed. In that case you'll need to overlay your custom control on top of the grid view which will have the scroll bars shown. You hide the built-in scroll bars with your custom control and instead of calling ScrollUp/Down you post windows messages to the area behind your custom control to "fake" clicks and get the grid view to move around the way you like. Hmm. i was assuming .NET Compact Framework since you mentioned it's for a mobile device... Is it CF? If not, everything ought to be a little easier. EDIT Basic sample of custom grid scrolling here!
