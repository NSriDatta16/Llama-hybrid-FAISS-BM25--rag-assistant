Storage became the issue for us when we were using Maven , Continuum and Clearcase and building hourly. The snapshot views were being left around after each build. We had a powerful enough box (Sun Fire V490) and used it for our development integration environment and Archiva repository. So we never really had any issues with performance and memory. In fact the only time we had a problem with PermGen memory it was building the Maven site target and that just meant using -XX:MaxPermSize=128m.
