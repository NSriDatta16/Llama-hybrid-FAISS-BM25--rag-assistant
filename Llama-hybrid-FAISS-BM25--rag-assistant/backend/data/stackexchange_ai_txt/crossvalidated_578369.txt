How to check stationarity in panel data?

Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with panel data methods (yet) but it seems important to check if my data display stationarity (aka time trends). Assuming that my regression function looks like this: $_{} = \alpha + X_{} + W_{} + \varepsilon_{}$ where: $i$ = country, $t =$ year, $Y =$ dependent variable, $X =$ independent variable of interest, $W =$ control variables, $\varepsilon =$ error term How should I check stationary? Only for $Y$ ? Or also for each individual regressor? By using the global mean of $Y$ for each year (i.e. the annual average $Y$ over all countries in the data set to see if there is a global trend) or should I been looking for a countrywide time trend by plotting the time evolution of $Y$ for each country individually? I really have no idea what the correct approach is.
