Web site aggregation with twitter widget SSL issue

I'm seeking for solution how to isolate widget included by partial to main site. Issue appear when user access site with https. Ie 6,7 shows security confirmation dialog (part of website resources are not in secure zone). First of all I download twitter widget on our side, also I download all CSS and pictures. Then I patched widget JS to point onto downloaded resources. But still has not luck with security warning :( I guess the reason of this issue is AJAX request to twitter, but there is no idea how to sole it. (Just to create some kind of proxy on our side). Thank you for attention.
