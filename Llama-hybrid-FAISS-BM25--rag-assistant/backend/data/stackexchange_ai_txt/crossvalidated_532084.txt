Typically what I see for time-series involving trees is two types of setups: Recursive Non-Recursive Where recursive uses past values of the target variable such as last period's sales, moving average of last 4 periods, etc. This does complicate the setup because now you have to predict the next period then recalculate everything and continue predicting. So that brings us to non-recursive which simply doesn't use these types of features. Therefore predicting is straightforward. Generally, recursive features from our target variable can help the forecast accuracy but lagging features such as last period price is less common. So I would stick with lagging your target and using a moving average/ moving std. In terms of differencing or something like that, I wouldn't do it initially. Just pass calendar features such as the period month or week or whatever frequency you are at. This is assuming you have no reason to suspect that the target isn't just crazily increasing or decreasing, for example if you selling something on e-commerce and because of covid things are just exploding way out of bounds of what they were before. Trees won't be able to pick up on that trend so then you may want to de-trend or something. Other features which can be used are things like product id and category. I have seen some neat features using average word vectors of the title but that probably is overkill. I think a great resource for this would be kaggle's m5 since tree models were pretty heavily used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/discussion
