Other posters have pointed out how to increase memory and that you could memoize calls. I'd suggest that for many applications, you can use Stirling's formula to approximate large n! very quickly with almost no memory footprint. Take a gander at this post, which has some analysis of the function and code: http://threebrothers.org/brendan/blog/stirlings-approximation-formula-clojure/
