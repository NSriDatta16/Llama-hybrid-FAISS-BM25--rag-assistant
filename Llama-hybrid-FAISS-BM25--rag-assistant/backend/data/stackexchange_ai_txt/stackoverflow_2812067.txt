I think the way to get this information in WPF is to use some attached events. You can get into the event handlers for PreviewMouseDown, PreviewMouseMove and PreviewMouseUp to get information about the mouse when it is over certain controls and the user is pressing/releasing a mouse button, moving the mouse, etc. There is a good practical example of this here: Generic WPF Drag-and-Drop Adorner
