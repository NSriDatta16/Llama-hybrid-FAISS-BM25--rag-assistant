It only speeds up those functions whose repeated applications "hop around" the fixpoint. Intuitively, it's like adding a brake to a pendulum - it'll stop sooner with the brake. But not every function has this property. Consider f(x)=x/2 . This function will converge sooner without the average damping (log base 2 steps vs log base (4/3) steps), because it approaches the fixpoint from one side.
