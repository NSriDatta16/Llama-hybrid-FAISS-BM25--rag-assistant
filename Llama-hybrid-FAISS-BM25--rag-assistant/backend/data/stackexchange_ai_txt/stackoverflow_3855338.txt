I ended up writing my own by drawing colored lines, circles and shaded elipses on a pre-loaded image of a body outline using mouse dragging events. Took a couple of days, but the users find it suits their needs perfectly. Even managed to get a bit fancy and throw in an undo, and marker labels for them. Their previous version (VB6) actually drew on the background image which was then saved as a bitmap blob, but my routine saves the markings as simple objects overlayed on any image that can be selected for relabelling or deleting, and saved in text as a structure of coordinates.
