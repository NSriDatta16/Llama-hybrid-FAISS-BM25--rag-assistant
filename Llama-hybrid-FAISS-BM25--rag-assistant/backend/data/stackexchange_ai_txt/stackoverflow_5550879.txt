Why not use an object database for this? You could store any object graph you wanted, and you'd get a search API with which you could do any relationship/retrieval mechanism you wanted. A simple collection could work, but it sounds like you want a more complex relationship than a collection would provide. Look into db4o (http://db4o.com) - it's very powerful for this sort of thing.
