A couple of points: The reason to use random effects is to account for the correlations in the measurements within in group. In your case, the repeated measurements within pigs. The use of random intercepts translates to constant correlations over time. That is, the correlation of blood pressure measurements of a pig between y1 and y2 is equal to the correlation between y1 and y3, and between y2 and y3. The interpretation of the fixed effects coefficients here is similar as to other regression models. For example, in your model the coefficient for behA will denote the difference in the average blood pressure between behA = 1 and behA=0 at the same time. Hence, the additive model postulates that the difference between behA = 1 and behA=0 is the same for all time points. If you would like to assess whether this difference changes over time, you could indeed do that by including the interaction term.
