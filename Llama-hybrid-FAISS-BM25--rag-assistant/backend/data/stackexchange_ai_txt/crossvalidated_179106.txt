Statistical assessment of people skills via PCA

I would like to assess the skills of a lot of persons on a few main axis. Let me explain my proposal. For each skills axes, I propose several questions. Each question gives a score from 0 to 10. Once data are collected, I perform a PCA and analyze the results. Variables space gives me the skills that may be contradictory or join. Rows space gives clusters of people, who have similar skills. What do you think of this approach? Any idea of something more academic? Thanks!
