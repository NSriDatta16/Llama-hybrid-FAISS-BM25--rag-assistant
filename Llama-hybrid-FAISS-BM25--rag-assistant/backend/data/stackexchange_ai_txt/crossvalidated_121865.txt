Comparison of machine learning algorithms

Suppose that I have taken 8 machine learning algorithms which are used by researchers most frequently. I have applied these 8 machine learning algorithms over 8 datasets which are publicly available on internet. I get results like: Random forest works well on 1 dataset. SVM performs better on 2 dataset. How can I conclude which machine learning algorithm among all performs best. Thanks in advance..
