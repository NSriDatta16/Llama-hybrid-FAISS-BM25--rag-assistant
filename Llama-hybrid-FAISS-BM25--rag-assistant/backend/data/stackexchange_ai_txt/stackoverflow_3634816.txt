FM has given an answer that works using split, but I wanted to point out that Perl makes this really easy if you're reading this data from a filehandle. All you need to do is to set the special variable $/ to an empty string. This puts Perl into "paragraph mode". In this mode each record returned by the file input operator will contain a paragraph of text rather than the usual line. #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use Data::Dumper; local $/ = ''; my @row = ; chomp @row; print Dumper(\@row); __DATA__ COMPANY NAME City Addresss, Address number Email phone number The output is: $ ./addr $VAR1 = [ 'COMPANY NAME', 'City', 'Addresss, Address number', 'Email ', 'phone number' ];
