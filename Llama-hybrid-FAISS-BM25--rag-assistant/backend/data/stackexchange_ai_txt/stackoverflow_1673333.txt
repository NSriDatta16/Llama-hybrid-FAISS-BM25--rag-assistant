if you don't want to pollute the namespace with extra functions and whatnot, this is the perfect situation for a do { ... } while (0); loop. do { // processing if (!check_file_size($image)) { echo 'The image is too big'; break; } if (!check_file_type($image)) { echo 'The image is of the wrong type'; break; } echo $image; } while (0); The do-while(0) loop is the unsung hero of getting conditional exits from some sort of processing without having to write a function and function call into your code. While the gains will be negligible, this will also prevent the PHP parser from having to create an extra symbol and then look it up again for little-to-no reason. EDIT: it also prevents you from getting into gigantic if-block pyramids when your conditionals get too large. If you wrap it in an if block, and each subsequent condition inside a dependant if-block, you eventually have this giant, hard-to-follow mess of indentation (assuming you format your code) with closing braces that can be difficult to trace to their opening blocks; using do { ... } while (0); keeps everything at the same logical indentation level.
