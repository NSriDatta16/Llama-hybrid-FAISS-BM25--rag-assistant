I've always used a folder under the root such as d:\DelphiComponents with versioning (if needed) organized within each individual sub folder. For example d:\DelphiComponents\MMTools have a Delphi6 and a Delphi7 folder. Since I do have some pretty old libraries in these folders, I avoid using spaces in the folder names.
