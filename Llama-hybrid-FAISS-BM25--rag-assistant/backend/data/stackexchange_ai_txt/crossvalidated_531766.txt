How do I deal with the dimension problem in hierarchical Bayesian model like $P(q, v, B|x) = p(x|B) p(B|q, v) p(q, v)$?

How do I deal with the dimension problem in hierarchical Bayesian model like this? $$ P(q, v, B|x) = p(x|B) p(B|q, v) p(q, v)$$ The likelihood function has a 1D and 2D component, and the prior is a 2D matrix. How do they produce a 3D posterior?
