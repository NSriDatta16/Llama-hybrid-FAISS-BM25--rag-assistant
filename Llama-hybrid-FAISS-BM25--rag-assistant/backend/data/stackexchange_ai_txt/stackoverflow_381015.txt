What about using #pragma to disable the warning around the specfic code? #pragma warning disable 0612 // Call obsolete type/enum member here #pragma warning restore 0612 A note to visitors, this only works with types and enum members. As far as I am aware, this will not work with other type members (e.g. methods, properties, etc).
