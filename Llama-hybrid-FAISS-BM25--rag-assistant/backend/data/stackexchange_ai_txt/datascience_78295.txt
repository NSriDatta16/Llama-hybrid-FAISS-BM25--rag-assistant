What should I start with first? Python for beginners or applied data science?

I am new to data science and I would like to go deep into it. I decided to start working with advanced competitions on kaggle, yet I should refine my knowledge in python and ML. I am an engineer, with 4 years of programming (basically php vanilla JS, and javascript based frameworks) I took a coirse on Udemy about ML with python. As I am already a programmer, I know most of the basics, I just need to familiarise with the script and how its written in python. I am desperate for a help from someone, who can help me with if I should take the Python for everyone or simply just dig in directly into Applies data science with Python from University of Michigan. I know sometimes I struggle writing a code with python but with a basic google search I can find an answer or figure out one of my own. I know that I can skip lots of weeks on coursera as I already knows the basics. But still confused.
