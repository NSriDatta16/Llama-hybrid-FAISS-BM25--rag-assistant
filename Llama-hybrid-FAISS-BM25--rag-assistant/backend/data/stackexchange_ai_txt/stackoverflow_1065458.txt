Inside of your parent div, if you set "float:right" on your blue div and play around with your height in percent (height:100%;), I think you should achieve what you're asking. Since the blue div is a child of your grey div, the maximum height of your blue div shouldn't exceed your parent div. Unless I'm missing something here... Also, if you are floating your blue div on the right, be sure to place it before the magenta div in your markup. Acorn
