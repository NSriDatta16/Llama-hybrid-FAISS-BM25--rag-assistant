To search people based upon likes or interests, use the new Graph API , and parse the JSON. For instance, this will search for anyone with an interest in Cheese: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=Cheese&type=user&access_token= YOURTOKEN This way you don't need any authentication, just an access token. The resulting PHP code would be something like: $accessToken = 'abcdefghijk'; $query = urlencode($_GET['q']); $graphUrl = 'https://graph.facebook.com/search?type=user&accessToken=' . $accessToken . '&q=' . $query; $results = json_decode(file_get_contents($graphUrl)); I'm off for a slice of Camembert.
