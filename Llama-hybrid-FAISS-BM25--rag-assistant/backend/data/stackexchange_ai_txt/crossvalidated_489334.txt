Meaning of two cointegrating vectors in a VECM

Given three I(1) time series, what does it mean to have 2 cointegrating vectors inside the error correction term? As mentioned in the below image, cant we merge ec1t-1 and ec2t-1 in a single ec term since it will just be like a sum of coefficients Also, what is the significance of the constant term inside the cointegration vector, and how does it make a difference if we put that outside the vector? ?
