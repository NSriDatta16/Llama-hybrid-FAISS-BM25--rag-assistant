You can get the location and size of each QWidget from geometry() , which returns a QRect . QRect has function intersects() , which will tell you if it intersects another QRect . After the drop is complete, iterate through all of the labels and check if any of them do intersect the new position. (This will be easier if you modify dragwidget to keep a QList of each label on the dragwidget.) QRect droppedRect = newLabel->geometry(); foreach(DragLabel* label, dragLabelList) { if (droppedRect.intersects(label->geometry()) { // Add to the list of covered labels that need to be moved. } } The harder part: If there is an intersection, move the old label out of the way. Maybe try the following algorithm: Move the offending label out of the way in the direction that takes the least movement. Now check it against all the other labels. Any of those that are covered should be moved in the same direction. Repeat until all the labels are uncovered.
