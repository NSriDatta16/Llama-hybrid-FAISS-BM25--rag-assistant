became discouraged about the lack of full support for CSS in the different Layout engines I think jQuery has some ways to make css more compatible across-browsers, i.e. if you specify some attributes using jQuery then it will try to make sure to use a work-around for browsers that don't support certain features. There's also a project called CleverCSS , you might want to check it out. It's not an alternative to it though, just a slightly different way to define it.
