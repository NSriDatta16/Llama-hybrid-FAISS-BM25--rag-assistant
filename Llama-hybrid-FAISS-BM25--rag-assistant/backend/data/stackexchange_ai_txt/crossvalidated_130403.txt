The problem I believe is that you want to forecast out the expected value for 48 half-hour intervals for some foreseeable period of time. I am currently working with a major fast-food franchise to predict 96 15-minute intervals by day for the next 30 days. Now each day can have it's own trend or expected value and holidays can have an effect along with price promotions and such. The tool for you in my opinion is a mixed-frequency time series model that would incorporate intra-day forecasts and daily total forecasts. Care has to be taken to deal with unusual values, shift/level changes and trend changes and to optimally develop a useful model. Excel won't cut it nor will most other solution providers. Why don't you post 48 historical readings per day for as far back as you have perhaps no more than 3-4 years. If the data is confidential simply scale it .In this way you won'have to assume any model ( as you probably would be very wrong ! ) and let good analysis sort out what is the best way to set expectations and confidence limits.
