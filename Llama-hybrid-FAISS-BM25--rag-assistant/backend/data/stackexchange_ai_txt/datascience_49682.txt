What techniques are used for machine translation besides RNNs?

I am doing a university report and it seems that encode-decode RNNs are optimal for machine translation. I would like something else to compare it to, but I can't seem to make a proper Google search for it. Can you recommend what else can be used for machine translation that I can compare RNNs to?
