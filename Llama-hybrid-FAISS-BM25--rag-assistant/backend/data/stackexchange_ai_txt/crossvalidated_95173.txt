You could compute sharpe ratio for stock returns, which is annualized return/annualized volatility i.e. does the investment return justify the risk Below computation is just an illustration: > ds.stat ds.stat$sharpe ds.stat factor_5 mean_return sd_return sharpe 1 0 0.163873 2.074606 0.07898993 2 1 4.636236 6.608111 0.70159769 If you compute sharpe ratio for longer time series, you could pick the series with greater sharpe ratio as better investment. You could also look at PerformanceAnalytics or quantmod packages which have many utilities for financial statistics
