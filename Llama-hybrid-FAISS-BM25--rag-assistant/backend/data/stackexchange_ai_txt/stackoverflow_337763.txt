LINQ to SQL: Multiple / Single .dbml per project?

I've read Rick Strahl's article on Linq to SQL DataContext Lifetime Management hoping to find some answers on how I would manage my .dbml files since they are so closely related to DataContext. Unfortunately, Rick's article seems to be focused on DataContext lifetime at runtime though, and my question is concerned with how the .dbml's should be organized at design time . The general question of 'Best practices with .dbml's' has been asked and answered here , and the answers have focused on external tools to manage the .dbml. I'm asking a more focused question of when and why should you not have a single .dbml file in your LINQ to SQL based project ?
