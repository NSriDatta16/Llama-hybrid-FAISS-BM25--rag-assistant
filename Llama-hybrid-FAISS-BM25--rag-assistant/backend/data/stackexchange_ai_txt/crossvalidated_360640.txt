What is the difference between survey errors in coverage vs. sampling?

I'm taking an online course in Usability Surveys. Both of these seem to be about missing some group from the sample. The example in the course is: You are surveying people about a new HR Form. You leave out the janitors. That's a sampling error. You email the survey but folks without email don't get it, that's a Coverage Error. But another definition I found suggests that sampling error is more like "the sample you surveyed wasn't large enough" (statistically valid). Which definitions should I use for coverage and sampling errors?
