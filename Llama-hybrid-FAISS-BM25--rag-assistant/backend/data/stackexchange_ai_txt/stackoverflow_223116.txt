Well, you could use a merging algorithm, like that used by source control software. You'd probably want to make it check for changes at the paragraph level, to help maintain readability. If there was a potential conflict (e.g. two users editing the same paragraph), you would probably need to simply present both versions with boilerplate text and/or notify the second and subsequent submitters that the contents of their post may have changed from what they submitted.
