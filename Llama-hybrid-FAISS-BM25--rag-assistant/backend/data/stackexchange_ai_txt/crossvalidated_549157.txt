Does averaging affect statistics?

I have an array that represents client's bills for a certain period of time. Each client has several values. I need to group data by week or month and calculate mean and variance. However, I have a question, is it correct and is there any difference at all, if I just take an average before calculating the statistics. I mean instead of getting 12 numbers for each month for the first used I get just one value, the average of these numbers. i understand that there's no difference for the mean, but what about variance? It changes a little bit in a short term, but in what about the long term? Thank you
