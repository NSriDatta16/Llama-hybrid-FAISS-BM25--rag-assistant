Principal components are the results of projections of your features on 3 directions that carry a lot of a variance and a minimum of information loss ( when you take a projection and reduce it from 3-D to 2-D for example, you lose a bit of information ). You could say ,in other words, that PC 1, PC 2 , PC 3 are somewhat a combination of all your features you used for PCA.
