Performing a time series ARIMA model on natural gas power demand using the forecast package from R

I've been attempting to forecast natural gas power demand and how it is affected by temperature and price. I'm not sure if I have done everything correctly (relatively new to R), but I do seem to get relevant data other than I can't seem to change my forecast period, nor am I sure this is an appropriate model for this data. Hopefully someone can provide me with some guidance. Data: demand.csv library(forecast) data = read.csv("demand.csv") # Create matrix of numeric predictors xreg Thank you for any help.
