Are single input single output neural networks possible?

This might be a weird question but I'm trying to have a deep understanding of how neural networks work theoretically. I was doing some tests with my perceptron and I decided to test it on a single input single output dataset. What I was looking for was 100% accuracy since what I was testing on was a trivial separable dataset with binary output. However, the accuracy was below 50% (it wasn't balanced). I realized that this is due to the fact that there is a single weight that when trained is either going to be =>0 or Does my explanation make sense? Are there any theoretical aspects I'm missing? Also, are neural networks useful at all for single input problems? They seems useless to me since we're basically classifying by putting a point or points (for multiclass problems) on a single line to separate outputs, which is a pretty simple problem that doesn't need the intricacy of neural networks.
