I think another factor worth considering when deciding to use inetd is how much memory the process handling the request consumes on an average? If this is fairly high, then under high load you risk running out of memory (since inetd forks). The same server might be implementable in a multithreaded or select-poll manner possibly allowing for higher load / less memory per connection.
