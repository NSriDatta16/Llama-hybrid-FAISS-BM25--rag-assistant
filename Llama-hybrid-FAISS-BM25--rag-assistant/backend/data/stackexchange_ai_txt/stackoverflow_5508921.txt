Generic code for storing files in IsolatedStorage

I have an html file containing images which are placed at local location.To read these images I am using Isolated Storage.But While storing the images in Isolated storage i need to specify the file name which makes my code specific to those filenames.For example : I have two images abc.jpg and xyz.jpg but when these names changes to abc1.jpg and xyz1.jpg the error occurs.What can be used to write a generic code not dependent on filenames?
