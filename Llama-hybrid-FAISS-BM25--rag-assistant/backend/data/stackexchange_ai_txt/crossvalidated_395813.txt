Modelling binomial outcome in repeated measures design using glmer

I have a complex dataset for a repeated measures design. Each participant (N=53) saw a total of 72 images that varied according to three different properties (2 categorical and 1 ordinal independent variables). The task was to make an estimate about an object depicted in the image on a scale from 1 to 6. The estimate was quantified as accurate if it was +1 or -1 of the correct number of the scale. Accuracy was created as binomial variable which terms are defined a follows: 1= within +1 or -1 unit from the correct response; and 0= more than +1 or -1 away from the correct response. I would like to predict the accuracy (binomial dependent variable) of participants' estimations, based on the three manipulated image properties (independent variables) and on participants' subjective ratings (treated as independent variable: e.g. computer expertise), taking into account participant identity, image identity and random order as nested random factor of the repeated measures design. I created a model using glm > model1 randomcount + > + DurationSec + ScreenSize + AttentionCheck > + CompExp1to4 + PalyingFreq1to5 + Knowledge3D1to4 > + Gender_0fem1male + Age + > + fov:NP + AttentionCheck:NP + ScreenSize:fov > + fov:NP:ScreenSize, > family = binomial (link = probit), > data = Dfnew) However it does not take into account nested random factors! So I am trying to use glmer, but I keep receiving the Warning message below: > model2c > + (PID|distimage), family=binomial, > data = Dfnew) Now I receive this warning message: > Warning messages: 1: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = > control$ checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = > 0.0341347 (tol = 0.001, component 1) 2: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : Model is nearly > unidentifiable: very large eigenvalue > - Rescale variables?;Model is nearly unidentifiable: large eigenvalue ratio > - Rescale variables? Any suggestion about how to improve the model or to address the warning message would be much appreciated!
