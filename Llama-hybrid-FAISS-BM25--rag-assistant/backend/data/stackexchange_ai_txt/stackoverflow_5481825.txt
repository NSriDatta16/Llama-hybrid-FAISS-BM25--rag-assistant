interactive component in Java Swing

I'm required to implement a map in Java Swing, which is connected with a spatial database to handle some queries. I used a jLabel to represent the map image. I need to drag an area and return all the possible elements within that area. Each return element should be shown on the map as yellow triangle or red circle and these polygons could be clicked to provide further information on somewhere else. Here is my confusion. Which component should I use to demonstrate the element on the image? It need to be interactive so intuitively I choose JButton , here is my implementation: Iterator it = al.iterator(); while (it.hasNext()) { JButton jButton1 = new JButton(); jButton1.setText("213"); jButton1.setBounds(325 + (int)it.next().getPoint()[0], 70 + (int)it.next().getPoint()[1], 30,30); jButton1.setVisible(true); getContentPane().add(jButton1); } But it doesn't show any button on the panel. I suppose both the jButton and the jLabel containing the image are on the same level, so there may be some overlap. How can I deal with that? Is there any better solution for this case?
