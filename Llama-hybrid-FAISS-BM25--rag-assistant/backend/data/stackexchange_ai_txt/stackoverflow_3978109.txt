How to mirror a GitHub SVN repository to SVN Repository hosted in other place

Scenario: I have a Git Repo hosted in GitHub: https://Nerian@github.com/Nerian/JPovray.git Which can be accessed by SVN clients at: http://svn.github.com/Nerian/JPovray.git And I have another SVN server hosted in school servers. I want this server to be a mirror from the repo at GitHub. It is a school requirement to use the SVN repo at school. Test: #Create the mirror repo svnadmin create dest #Make the hooks always pass echo "#!/bin/sh" > dest/hooks/pre-revprop-change echo "#!/bin/sh" > dest/hooks/start-commit #Make the hooks executable chmod +x dest/hooks/pre-revprop-change dest/hooks/start-commit #Initialize the mirror repo to mirror the github repo svnsync init file://`pwd`/dest http://svn.github.com/Nerian/JPovray.git It gives me this message : svnsync: Storage of non-regular property 'svn:wc:ra_dav:version-url' is disallowed through the repository interface, and could indicate a bug in your client #Start the mirroring process svnsync sync file://`pwd`/dest It gives me this message: svnsync: REPORT of ' http://svn.github.com/Nerian/JPovray.git ': 200 OK ( http://svn.github.com ) #Checkout the mirror repo. svn checkout file://`pwd`/dest client It gives me the message: Checked out revision 0. Currently, there are 6 revisions on the Github repo. The checkout say there are 0. So it means the sync didn't work. The client repo is empty, while the Github repo has 2 two files. Constrains: It is possible to run commands in the SVN repo at school, I just have to contact the SVN manager. The commit history of the GitHub repo must be keep. We are a team of 3 members and the professor needs to know who commit what. EDIT: I contacted GitHub about this, and they told that it is not possible to mirror a GitHub svn repo because they are not really subversion repos. It's just some sort of bridge. So I have started programming a solution: https://github.com/Nerian/github_subversion_converter This Ruby application will allow transferring commits from one SVN to another one. Currently, as of 23 october 2010 it do its job. But doesn't preserve Commit Author name. I am working in that. Should be feature complete in a week. For the current status, check the repo page.
