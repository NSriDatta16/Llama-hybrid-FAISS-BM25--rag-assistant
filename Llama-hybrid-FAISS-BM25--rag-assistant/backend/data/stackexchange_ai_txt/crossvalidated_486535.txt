timeseries anomaly detection: one model per series or group of series or a single big model to rule them all?

Context: I have thousands of IoT device time series. Multiple metrics are tracked per time period. In order to perform predictive maintenance, I need to detect anomalies. Problem: There are multiple categories of devices or devices from the same category with different firmware versions. I wonder if I should train one model per: time-series (find anomalies per device) group of time-series (figure out if one device behaves differently from its cohort) one single big model to rule them all (is there a strange cohort/category of devices) Or maybe even a combination of all of the above? I am particularly interested to get this question answered for models like https://matrixprofile.org/ or an autoencoder based approach.
