Ultragrid : how to best add a set of sub rows programatically?

I have an Infragistics Ultragrid that is being used to display a list of attributes. Sometimes the attribute is an array so I am adding a sub row for each element so the user can optionally expand the row showing the array attribute and see all the element values. So for each element I use: var addedRow = mGrid.DisplayLayout.Bands[1].AddNew(); which if I have 300 elements gets called 300 times and takes around 9 seconds (I have profiled the application and this call is taking 98% of the elapsed time) Is there a way to add these sub rows more efficiently?
