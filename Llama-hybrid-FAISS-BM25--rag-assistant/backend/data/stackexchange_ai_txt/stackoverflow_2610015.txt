It's not clear what you are expecting to see and what the problem you are experiencing is. Based on my deciphering skills, I think you're running into a paradigm difference. In unit testing, any failed test will often cause a hard error. The reason being that you're not expecting to fail, so when you do, you want attention called to the failure, rather than just a nice test failed message.
