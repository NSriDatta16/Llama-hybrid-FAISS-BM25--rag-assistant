It seems most of the answers on here are negative, and I'd say that it's always easier to blame a platform than it is to blame your own inexperience. There was a learning curve for me and it was frustrating (coming from a Java background). The syntax was similar but the paradigm very different. After battling it out for a bit I've managed to build apps used by tens of thousands of users that scale perfectly, are easy to manage and secure, and that incorporate almost all traditional programming architectures currently embraced including the basics of OOP, MVC and many of the other 'Gang Of Four' design patterns. If you'd like me to point you in the direction of example code, or grand applications built on the platform I'd be happy to help you out.
