Using acts_as_list with has_many :through in rails

I have a rails app I'm trying to set up with sortable lists using the acts_as_list plugin. The position field in the db is getting updated, but when the page is rendered, the order is not considered. I'm looking for some help, I guess. Here are my models... class QuestionMembership :question_memberships end class Question :question_memberships acts_as_list end And the sloppy view code that gives me the list... > true) %> The drag and drop works for the reordering. The position value updates in the DB for the QuestionMembership objects and the page actually shows the reorder correctly. The problem is that on a page reload, it defaults back to whatever order it feels like. I think it defaults to the question id for the order instead of the question_membership position, but I'm not sure. Any ideas on how I can make it actually order on the initial render by the position field of the QuestionMembership?
