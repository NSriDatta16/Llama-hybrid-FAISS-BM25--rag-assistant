Repeated measures regression or time series analysis?

I have managed to confuse myself again, so I hope you could give me some tips or point into the right direction. I have pesticide residue data in different plant matrices (e.g. flowers, leaves) from different experiments. Samples were taken on 5 subsequent days (DAA). Each day five repetitions were collected (from the same plants- repeated measures). I also have additional information like temperature or the applied dose rate which could affect the residues. A tibble: 6 x 9 # Groups: DAA, App [6] Repetition DAA Doserate AI App Site Temperature Flowers Leaves 1 1 0 0.5 Fludio Field_Fludio Field 16.9 22.3 80.6 2 1 0 0.75 Cyp Field_Cypro Field 16.9 31.0 52.7 3 1 0 0.75 Cyp Hand GH 20.5 89.6 306. 4 1 1 0.5 Fludio Field_Fludio Field 16.8 3.24 66.7 5 1 1 0.75 Cyp Field_Cypro Field 16.8 7.36 56.3 6 1 1 0.75 Cyp Track GH 20.5 5.42 280. I would like to run a regression and see whether I could predict residues in flowers from residues I found in leaves. From graphs I looked at I assume the sampling day (DAA) and temperature would affect the residues as well and could be included into the model. I thought I could do something like this: fit1 So far (in other analyses with lmer) I have used the sampling days (DAA) as a factor variable. But now I have read that I cant use a factor in regression. So either I would have to use DAA as numeric variable or instead I would have to introduce dummy variables. I think I am confused about whether DAA is a factor or a numeric variable. From this plot it looks like a factor: It would be ok to have 4 dummy variables for this data set, but I have another dataset with 12 sampling days. I also came across time series analysis to make predictions over time, but I dont think that would make any sense with only 5 days? So my questions: Is my variable day(DAA) a factor variable or a numeric one? How would I include it into my regression model? And in which circumstances/for which kind of analysis is it ok to have a factor in a lmer model? Many thanks for your help in advance!
