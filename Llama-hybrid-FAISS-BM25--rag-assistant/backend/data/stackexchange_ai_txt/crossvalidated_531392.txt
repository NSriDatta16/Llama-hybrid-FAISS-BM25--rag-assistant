Re-sample train data so it represents real-world data

I have a classification problem - will a student pass a course, or not. I have real-world data consisting of million of students enrolling in my course. In addition, I have 1,000 tagged students - train data - with a target value of "passes the course" or "doesn't pass the course". Each student has few features - such as average math grades, number of years studying, etc. I have a total of 8 features. My 1,000 tagged students don't represent the million real-world students I have and need to predict for. For example, the 1,000 tagged students have higher average math grades and more years of studying. So if I train my model on the 1,000 tagged students, it will have bad results. How can I select X tagged students from my tagged 1,000 so the X students will represent the million real-world students , with respect for all of the 8 features? My idea: I can re-sample the 1,000 tagged students based on 1 feature. But I that results in a different distribution for the other features, and I can't find a mechanism to keep the distribution of the train data and all real-world data the same for the 8 features. Thanks in advance!
