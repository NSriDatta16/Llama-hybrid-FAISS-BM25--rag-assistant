I'd phrase this as a logistic regression model, where the model is $$ \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon_i, $$ where $x_1$ is 1 if there is 1 risk factor present, zero otherwise, and $x_2$ is 1 if there are 2 or more risk factors present, and zero otherwise. Once the model has been fit (easy to do in R or Python), the coefficients can be interpreted as the difference in log odds between when the respective regressors are zero and one. Note that $p$ is the likelihood of disease, and the expression $log(\frac{p}{1-p})$ is known as the log odds of the disease.
