WP7 Isolated Storage

I'm trying to grab my files from isolated storage but unfortunatly it is pulling in all the files not just the specified ones from the pattern. I'm using: foreach (string fileName in storage.GetFileNames("*.item")) Is this a known bug or am I just doing something wrong? PS. The use of wildcards is essential Any help very much apprieciated, Thanks!
