If you have not specified that CampaignCoverage.CoverageID is a foreign key to Coverage.ID (I think that is what you are trying to say), then getting rid of the join should do the trick. i.e. Remove .InnerJoin(Tables.Coverage) That said, you probably do want to make a CampaignCoverage.CoverageID a foreign key to Coverage.ID. After you do that, you can get rid of the IsEqualTo clause. i.e. Remove .And(CampaignCoverage.CampaignIDColumn).IsEqualTo(campaign.Id)
