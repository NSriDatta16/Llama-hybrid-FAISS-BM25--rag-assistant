Save simple data in Magento's DB w/o Model

I'm looking to save some data in the Magento database without hassling with creating a new EAV object (or even a DB table if I can avoid it). Is there any place that you all know about that Magento will let you store serialized data? If it matters, the data is a serialized set of SKUs that I need to retrieve. I know that I could create a new model, or possibly even create an attribute as a flag on each product, but those are both really overkill for my purposes. Thanks, Joe
