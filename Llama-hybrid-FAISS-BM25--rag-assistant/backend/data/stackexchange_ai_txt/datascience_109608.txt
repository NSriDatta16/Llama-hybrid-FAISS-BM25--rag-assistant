How Logistic Regression nomogram is constructed from binary classifier?

I' ve been reading some scientific works and I don't understand how nomograms are constructed from logistic regression models. In the article: Development and Validation of an Early Scoring System for Prediction of Disease Severity in COVID-19 Using Complete Blood Count Parameters Source -> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34786318/ I also provide link to download from my Google Drive -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xEoYh6RZJ3bsqdaCbfE943E11xFtgmeP/view?usp=sharing In the article they work with COVID19 dataset describing two target values. Patient died from covid or survived. Along with preprocessing phase and feature selection as well as statistical characteristics they choose 10 blood parameters on which the algorithms will be trained and evaluated. [well not only blood as age is here too] After training it turns out that Logistic Regression model has the best results, so it is chosen for nomogram creation. So.. logistic regression model is used to create nomogram for covid19 mortality prediction. If the score there is low probability od death. If score > 0.5 there is high probality. The point I can't undestand is how they come up with Death probability and this: I get all the part conserning preprocessing, feature selection and statistical characterictics.
