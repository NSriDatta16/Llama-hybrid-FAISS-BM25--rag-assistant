Simple mean model for time series prediction

I have some historical dataset where I have the measure of a concentrate at different times of the day and I just want to create a simple model to predict the measure in the future. So, the measurements are done at 15 minutes interval and my dataset looks as follows: timestamp,concentrate 2019-08-01 00:00:00,872.0 2019-08-01 00:15:00,668.0 2019-08-01 00:30:00,604.0 2019-08-01 00:45:00,788.0 2019-08-01 01:00:00,608.0 2019-08-01 01:15:00,692.0 2019-08-01 01:30:00,716.0 2019-08-01 01:45:00,692.0 2019-08-01 02:00:00,672.0 2019-08-01 02:15:00,636.0 2019-08-01 02:30:00,596.0 2019-08-01 02:45:00,748.0 2019-08-01 03:00:00,424.0 2019-08-01 03:15:00,596.0 2019-08-01 03:30:00,936.0 2019-08-01 03:45:00,976.0 2019-08-01 04:00:00,912.0 2019-08-01 04:15:00,1100.0 2019-08-01 04:30:00,1312.0 2019-08-01 04:45:00,1904.0 2019-08-01 05:00:00,2232.0 2019-08-01 05:15:00,3104.0 2019-08-01 05:30:00,4100.0 2019-08-01 05:45:00,4836.0 2019-08-01 06:00:00,4476.0 2019-08-01 06:15:00,4032.0 2019-08-01 06:30:00,1744.0 2019-08-01 06:45:00,2416.0 2019-08-01 07:00:00,2396.0 2019-08-01 07:15:00,1400.0 2019-08-01 07:30:00,5336.0 2019-08-01 07:45:00,4872.0 2019-08-01 08:00:00,5820.0 2019-08-01 08:15:00,5376.0 2019-08-01 08:30:00,5528.0 2019-08-01 08:45:00,5344.0 2019-08-01 09:00:00,5356.0 2019-08-01 09:15:00,5036.0 2019-08-01 09:30:00,5116.0 .... So one thing I am doing is calculating the mean and variance at the different times of the day using this historical data and want to use this to do the forecast. I guess this assumes IID but let us not worry about that for the moment. My question is using this sort of model does one usually output the mean value as the prediction or should I sample from the distribution with this calculated mean and variance and output the sampled value as a prediction?
