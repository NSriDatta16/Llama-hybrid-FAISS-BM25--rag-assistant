Should Kevin Durant be benched?

Kevin Durant is a world-class basketball player. He averages roughly 2 fouls for every 40 minutes of game play. Per NBA rules, you must stop playing after picking up 6 fouls. Supposing Kevin Durant has 4 fouls with 20 minutes remaining in a game: a) if he tries to play all 20 remaining minutes, what are the odds he acquires two more fouls and has to leave the game? b) if he were to sit on the bench for 5 minutes (leaving 15 remaining), then what would the odds be? c) if not 5, is there an ideal number for B in generating a greater likelihood of attaining more minutes than A?
