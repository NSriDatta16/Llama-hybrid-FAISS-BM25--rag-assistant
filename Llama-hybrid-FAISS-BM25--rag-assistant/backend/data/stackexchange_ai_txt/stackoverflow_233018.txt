I had also misunderstood the question at first. I guess that with that data representation any other choice would be less clear than what you have. If we could change it to something else, for instance if we were to transpose the matrix and multiply the other way around, then it would be very easy to get a more succint and probably elegant way. $thisWeight) { $result[$i] += $thisWeight * $values[$index][$i]; } } print_r($result); $result = call_user_func_array("array_map",array_merge(array("weightedSum"),$values)); function weightedSum() { global $weights; $args = func_get_args(); return array_sum(array_map("weight",$weights,$args)); } function weight($w,$a) { return $w*$a; } print_r($result); ?>
