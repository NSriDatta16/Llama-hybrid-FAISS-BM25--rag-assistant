What is the intuition behind changing the dot product for another inner product in SVM?

I understand that, when classifying with a SVM using a non-linear kernel, we are basically changing the dot product for a "custom" inner product. Is there some reason for working with a different inner product other than just trying for some non-linear decision boundary? What are some desirable properties for an inner product for a given problem? Can someone give me an example of a problem in which a specific kernel is a better notion of inner product than the dot product?
