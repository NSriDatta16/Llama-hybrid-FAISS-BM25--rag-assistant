Lock event on mouse exit java

I wrote an application where you can drag left and right some timeline. When i do dragging i know that this is a mouseDragged event. Since i move mouse cursor outside component it stops dragging, but i don't want that. So i want to somehow lock mouseDragged event on that component, but if i move cursor outside component, i don't get mouseDragged event anymore. How can i solve that? My colleague tell me that there exists some function like captureMouse.
