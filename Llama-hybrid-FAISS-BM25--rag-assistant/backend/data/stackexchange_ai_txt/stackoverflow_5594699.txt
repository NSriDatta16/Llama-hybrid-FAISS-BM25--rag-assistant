This thread is way out of date. It is true that we haven't been able to convince Micro Focus to post prices out on their main web site, but you can get prices on ComponentSource, and we don't send out agents in dark suits and shades 8-/ Pricing depends on whether you are asking for a single user or multiple user license, and whether you want just BoundsChecker, or you want all of DevPartner Studio. See ComponentSource Listing for details. Anyway, we've not stopped working on the product. On February 4th, we released version 10.5, which (finally) supports 64-bit applications (AMD64,Intel64, not Itanium) on Vista and Windows 7. Quite a few old bugs were fixed along the way. The next update will include support for XP64 and Windows 7 SP1, as well as Visual Studio 2010 SP1.
