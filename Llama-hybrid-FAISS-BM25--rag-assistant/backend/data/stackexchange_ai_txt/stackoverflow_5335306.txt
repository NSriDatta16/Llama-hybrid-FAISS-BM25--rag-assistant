How can I get an event in Android Spinner when the current selected item is selected again?

I have written an setOnItemSelectedListener for spinner to respond when the spinner item is changed. My requirement is when I clicks again the currently selected item, a toast should display. How to get this event? When the currently selected item is clicked again, spinner is not responding. ` StorageSpinner.setOnItemSelectedListener(new AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener(){ @Override public void onItemSelected(AdapterView adapter, View v, int i, long lng) { Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), (CharSequence) StorageSpinner.getSelectedItem(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } @Override public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView arg0) { Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Nothing selected", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } });
