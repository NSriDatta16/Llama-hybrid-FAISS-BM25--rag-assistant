Check existence of a record before returning resultset in LINQ to SQL

I'm looking for a simple solution to replace my standardized junk way of validating whether a record exists before attempting to retrieve the data. Currently, whenever one of my methods are called, I do something to the effect of... private Record DoSomething(int id) { if(data.Records.Count(q=>q.Id==id) > 0) { return data.Records.First(q=>q.Id==id); } return null; } ...where I always check the count of the records to determine the existence of a record. There has to be a more "elegant" way of doing this, without calling the database twice. Is there a way?
