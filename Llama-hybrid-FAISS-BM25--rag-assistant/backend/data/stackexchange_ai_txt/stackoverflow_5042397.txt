Most projects keep the change log in a file called Changelog in the project root. Often this file is created manually: Developers are often ... "creative" when committing things and/or comments like "Reduced global variables", "Organized imports", etc. don't make much sense to the user. In your case, I suggest to put the file next to the class which displays it or in the root of your (re-)source folder. That way, you can easily load it using About.class.getResourceAsStream("Changelog") (relative to About ) or getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("Changelog") (relative to source root folder)
