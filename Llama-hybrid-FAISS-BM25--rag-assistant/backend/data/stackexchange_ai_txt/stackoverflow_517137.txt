Set variable on drop using jquery draggable/droppable

I am working on a proof of concept that makes use of the jquery ui draggable/droppable. I am looking for a way to set a variable equal to the index of a div that is dropped into the droppable area. (Say I have divs named "div0", "div1", "div2", etc...) So imagine the code would look something like this: some cotent more content yet more content drop it here $(document).ready(function() { $('.draggableDiv').draggable({helper: 'clone'}); $('.droppableDiv').droppable({ accept: '.draggableRecipe', drop: function(ev, ui) { ui.draggable.clone().fadeOut("fast", function() { $(this).fadeIn("fast") }).appendTo($(this).empty()); // function to set someVar = div[index]; } }); }); I am not sure how best to accomplish this, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate some guidance. Thanks!
