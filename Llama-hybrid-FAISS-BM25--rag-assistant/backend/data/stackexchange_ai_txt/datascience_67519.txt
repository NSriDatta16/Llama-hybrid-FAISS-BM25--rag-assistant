Determine model hyper-parameter values for grid search

I built machine learning model for Ridge,lasso, elastic net and linear regression, for that I used gridsearch for the parameter tuning, i want to know how give value range for **params Ridge ** below code? example consider alpha parameter there i uses for alpha 1,0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0001,0 but i haven't idea how this values determine each models.(ridge/lasso/elastic) can some one explain these things? from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge ridge_reg = Ridge() from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV params_Ridge = {'alpha': [1,0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0001,0] , "fit_intercept": [True, False], "solver": ['svd', 'cholesky', 'lsqr', 'sparse_cg', 'sag', 'saga']} Ridge_GS = GridSearchCV(ridge_reg, param_grid=params_Ridge, n_jobs=-1) Ridge_GS.fit(x_train,y_train) Ridge_GS.best_params_
