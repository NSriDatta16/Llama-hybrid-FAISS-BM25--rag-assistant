Is PCA appropriate for comparing subsets of panel data?

I have a large panel (5000+ subjects, 4 variables over 182 periods), and I've identified particular Granger-causal relationship in a large subset of those subjects (30% or so). I would like to somehow characterize the subjects that exhibit the Granger causality and parsimoniously compare them to the subjects that do not. Would PCA be an appropriate way to do this? I like PCA in particular because I like the idea of being able to describe the reduced coordinate system in terms of the original variables, but I'm worried that my time dimensions will not be sorted so cleanly. Or is this a good thing in that it will help identify fundamental features of each time series? I know there are various decomposition techniques available as well, but I would also like to apply whatever method I choose to a much shorter panel (26 time points) and I don't think decomposition would be appropriate there. I think this question was asked before , but in imprecise terms, and it didn't get a real answer. This paper was linked in the comments and it's interesting, but I'm not sure how I could apply it to make comparisons.
