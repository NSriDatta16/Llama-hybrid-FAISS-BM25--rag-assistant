how to record both success and fail in SQL Server Agent Job

I am using SQL Server 2008 and I am writing a SQL Server Agent Job. In my Job, there are 3 steps and in each step I will execute a store procedure. I noticed that in default Notification setting, it write information to Windows event log only when it fails. My question is, any easy solutions to write both success and fail information of each step to windows event log or somewhere to easily monitored? My job runs daily and I need the information for both success and fail to ensure my job runs. thanks in advance, George
