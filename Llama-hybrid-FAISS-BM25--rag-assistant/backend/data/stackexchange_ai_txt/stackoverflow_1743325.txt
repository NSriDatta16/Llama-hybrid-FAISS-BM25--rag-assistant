Can't use "Skip" in LINQ query

I have a linq query in which I need to specifically do a left join. However when I attempt to commit a lambda Skip function on the query it errors and says that the skip cannot be performed on a linq query with a join. Here's the query (the skip variable is a parameter into the function and clientDB is the datacontext): Dim questionsQuery = From helpQuestion As HelpQuestion In clientDB.HelpQuestions _ Group Join helpCat As HelpCategory In clientDB.HelpCategories _ On helpCat.ROW_ID Equals helpQuestion.CATEGORY_ID Into helpGroup = Group _ From helpCategory In helpGroup.DefaultIfEmpty() _ Where helpQuestion.DISPLAY_DESK _ Order By helpQuestion.ROW_ID Descending _ Select helpQuestion.ROW_ID, helpQuestion.EMAIL, helpQuestion.FIRST_NAME, helpQuestion.LAST_NAME, helpQuestion.QUESTION, helpQuestion.CREATED, helpQuestion.RESPONSE, helpCategory.CATEGORY_NAME If skip > 0 Then questionsQuery = questionsQuery.Skip(skip) End If
