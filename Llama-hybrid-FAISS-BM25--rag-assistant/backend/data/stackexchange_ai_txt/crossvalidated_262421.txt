treatment effect in instrumental variables regression

I'm designing a randomized encouragement trial in which half of the sample will be randomly assigned to receive a special invitation to try a new intervention. This design will likely result in two-sided non-compliance with respect to random assignment: Everyone randomized to the encouragement arm will receive a special invitation to try the intervention, but only a subset of people in this group will take up this offer. People randomized to the control arm will NOT receive a special invitation to try the intervention, but some will learn about it through other channels and try it out on their own. Encouragement designs account for this non-compliance by estimating the local average treatment effect (LATE). LATE is the effect of the intervention on 'compliers'â€”those who tried the intervention because they were randomly encouraged to do so but would not have tried if not encouraged. I simulated a basic dataset that mimics the planned study, and have a question about interpreting the treatment effect. # setup library(dplyr) library(arm) library(AER) library(ivpack) library(stargazer) n The coefficient on use is 0.43. This is the effect on the 'compliers'. The outcome y is binary. I want to be able to say that the intervention increased y by 43% points from a to b. How do I get a? The proportion among the control group is 0.03, but this includes compliers and never-takers .
