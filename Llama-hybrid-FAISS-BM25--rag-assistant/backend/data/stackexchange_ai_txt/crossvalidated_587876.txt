No, there is no assumption of the inputs being deterministic. We always assume that the data are random variables, so are "noisy". Regression models aim at making predictions as close as possible to the labels, so in the regression case, the prediction would lie somewhere in between the two identical points with different labels, where the meaning of "in-between" would depend on the loss function you used. In the classification case, the model returns a score and minimizes the loss between the score and the labels. The score could be probability than it is easier to interpret, but also can be something else like in your example. As you noticed, there are ways to turn those scores into values between zero and one that can be interpreted as probabilities. When doing hard classifications, you would also have a decision rule (the sign function in your example) that turns the score into discrete labels. While with soft classifications the model could accommodate contradictory labels by predicting the "undecided" score when doing hard classifications you might need to make an arbitrary decision and pick one of the labels. I know there are ways to convert svm scores to probability values, but the original formulation is based on function estimation. Yes, so what? You need to distinguish between a mathematical model and its implementation. The mathematical model assumes that we are dealing with random variables, etc. The implementation of the algorithm deals with numerical data and doesn't know, nor care, if it is deterministic or "random". You can use least squares to fit a regression line to a set of deterministic points, or you can use it as a statistical model. It would work the same in both cases, but the interpretation of the results would be different.
