Android: Seekbar doesn't scroll all the way to end

Hi I have a seekbar in my app that i need to snap to 7 positions. To achieve this I set the max property of the Seekbar to 7. NOw, to be aesthetically pleasing, i need to be able to drag my seekbar all the way to end of the bar, but when I set a value to the max property, the scroll won't drag all the way to end. Why does this happen and how can I get around it?
