If you already have a basic knowledge of Javascript, you should continue in this direction rather than picking up a totally different language like Ruby or PHP. Javascript has a lot more in common with Objective-C in how it's used than RoR or PHP. Server-side languages run small programs from start to finish in a split second, whereas Javascript or Objective-C programs run for an indefinite amount of time. Both types of programs require a different mindset, and object oriented programming makes a lot more sense when you actually have a bunch of objects that interact with each other over time and that the user can interact with. Objects in PHP are mainly a way to organize code, they don't teach you a lot about object interaction. Since there's going to be a learning curve no matter what, you may as well dive right into Objective-C, but learning Javascript first is the next best thing if you really don't want to. Since you can play around with it in your browser's console it offers a great interactive way to learn. The problem with Javascript is the lack of good material, but Crockford and the Mozilla Reference are probably the best places to start. Programming in Javascript usually means manipulating a browser's DOM, which is another concept you'd have to learn. It also means having to deal with browser quirks, which is best dealt with by using a Javascript framework/library like jQuery, MooTools or Prototype, which is yet another technology. To avoid these additional learning curves, you can use Javascript in a bunch of other scenarios , including desktop widgets / gadgets . These work a lot like mini-Cocoa apps in terms of user interaction and might be a good starting point.
