Why we use Pickle instead of saving the weights in HDF5 format in Deep Learning

I have read that, Pickle library is used to save trained model into a .pkl file to use it later. Also, we can save the weights of a trained model into a hdf5 format using model.save() and use those weights afterwards. So why we use pickle instead of hdf5 files?
