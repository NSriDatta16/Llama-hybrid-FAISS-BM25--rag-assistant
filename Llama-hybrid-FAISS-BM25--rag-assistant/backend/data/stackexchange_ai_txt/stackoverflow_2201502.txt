Have you tried to copy the files with the old fasion way of drag and drop? I would do this once, to make sure its not your network failing. Make sure that works, and then try look at other solutions. 1) Make sure your destination drive, is NTFS and NOT Fat32. 2) Check when its failing to copy, is it always at the same point? ( IE if it always failing after 2gb )
