GWT Framework

As I use more and more the GWT framework, I face the need to create a custom code for some basic GUI tasks like screen transition, code organization and transmission of data between widgets. Some GUI frameworks, as the JSR-292 for Swing, resolves theses issues for specific plataforms. Do exist any framework like that for GWT?
