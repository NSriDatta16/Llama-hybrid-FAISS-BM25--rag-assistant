Does anyone still hide JS from old browsers?

Does anyone still use the old trick? As I recall, this was targeted at people who used Netscape, or IE4. I just checked out our stats and in the last month we had more people visit the site using "Playstation Portable " (4 visits) as their user agent than we had using Netscape (1 visit). Is there any point in me even having the "hide" thing in my javascript?
