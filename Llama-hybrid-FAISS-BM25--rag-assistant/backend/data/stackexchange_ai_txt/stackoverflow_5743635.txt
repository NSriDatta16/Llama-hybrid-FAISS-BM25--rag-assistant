java paint problem - black components

I am having a weird java problem - For some reason quite often when I open a dialog it becomes black. When I force a repaint (for example, draging it out and into the screen again) it draws itself normaly again. The problem seems to occur only on my computer (The same code works for a friend), and its not just one class - it seems that almost every dialogs I open (on different projects) gets this problem. Even JOptionPane.showMessageDialog() gets this problem. Even weirder, it even happens when I am opening the java control panel! What can I do? It drives me crazy! If it matters I am running on windows 7, My GPU is ATI HD4800 with the latest CATALYST driver installed. Thanks in advance! An example of the problem: http://img233.imageshack.us/i/javablackscreen.png/
