Terminal in Emacs in Windows - Error message: "Spawning child process; invalid argument"

I'm trying to start a cmd terminal in Emacs 23.2 (latest version) in Windows. According to the Manual , I can enter in terminal mode (starting a new buffer for the terminal) in Emacs by typing M-x term . When I do this, I get prompted for: Run program: path_to-emacs/bin/cmdproxy.exe When I type RET , I get the following error message in the minibuffer: Spaning child process: invalid argument Any ideas how to make it work?
