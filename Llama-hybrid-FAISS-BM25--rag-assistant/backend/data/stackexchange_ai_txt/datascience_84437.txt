How to achieve better accuracy of 90+ on a 3 class highly skewed dataset?

I have a 3 class dataset with very high imbalance classes: class 1: 75000 class 2: 27000 class 3: 3000 With simple learning algorithms, accuracy is 84.6% but as expected mostly predicts class 1 , few class 2 and no class 3 . With techniques, like oversampling , SMOTE , undersampling , XGBoost , Adaboost , showed some increase in F1 score, but the accuracy overall either stays at ~84% or drops. Any promising technique that I can explore for improving accuracy atleast above 90% ? I am not bothered about improving the accuracy of only class 3, but the accuracy of the overall classifier. thanks.
