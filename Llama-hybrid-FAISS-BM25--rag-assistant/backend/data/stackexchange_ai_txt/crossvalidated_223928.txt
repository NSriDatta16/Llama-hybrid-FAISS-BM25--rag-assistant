Unless you are using your predictors as categorical variables, like in a contingency table, you wouldn't look at cell counts. Perhaps I am misunderstanding you. But multimomial regression seems appropriate here. Also you can find references, including discussions here on CV, on the equivalency of multinomial regression and a series of binary logistic regressions.
