If possible I would show a plot of the distribution, rather than just some summary statistics, since it is more informative. Alternatively, if some summary statistics are required, I would use a five-number summary or similar, rather than trying to find a distribution which fits the data. Fitting a distribution might look like a more elegant solution, since you can then only show the parameters of the distribution, but in all likelihood the fitted distribution will not be a great fit, and so the results will be misleading.
