Iteratively Reweighted Least squares for logistic regression when features are dependent?

I was solving logistic regression using IRLS ( wiki ) described in the wiki link. Now I have a doubt, if $X$ has dependent features then $X^TS_kX$ will not have full rank and thus will not be invertible in that case will solving $$argmin_w \| S_k^{1/2}Xw -(S_k^{1/2}Xw_k + S_k^{-1/2}(y-\mu_k)) \|$$ which is least squares formulation of the update equation, be the right thing to do. By right I mean the update moves in the descent direction. Also, if not then how should we handle such cases?
