I thought iTunes/Xcode Organizer did this already for some reason (at least I seem to remember it correctly identifying my old iPod Touch as a 1st gen), that's definitely not the case for my iPhone 3GS. Nor does the iPhone Configuration Utility help. So I fired up System Profiler to see if the device shows up on the USB list; it does. It also shows the "Product ID" (in my case, 0x1294). I typed that into Google and came up with this: http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Normal_Mode Device IDs It appears that it uses different device IDs: iPhone - 0x1290 iPod touch - 0x1291 iPhone 3G - 0x1292 iPod touch 2G - 0x1293 iPhone 3GS - 0x1294 iPod touch 3G - 0x1299 iPad - 0x129a iPhone 4 - iPod touch 4G - 0x129e Apple TV 2G -
