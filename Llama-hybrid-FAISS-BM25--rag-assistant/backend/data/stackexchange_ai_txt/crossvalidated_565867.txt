Problems regarding ARMA models and non stationarity

I am struggling to find in easy terms what is the problem regarding nonstationarity of a time series and using ARMA models on it (excluding "I"). If we assume that the series is indeed a nonstationary AR(p) process would I get bad results if i just simple fit the time series using a AR(p) model ignoring the nonstationarity ?. Would the fit give bad point estimates or just not trusty variances and other stuff that may impact in prediction intervals for example, since stationarity does not hold (and MLE or OLS might need that assumption)? Finally can the model be good regarding its forecast power (withut prediction intervals) ? Thanks in advance
