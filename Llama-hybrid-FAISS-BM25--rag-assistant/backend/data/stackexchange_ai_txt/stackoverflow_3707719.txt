XtraGrid. apply filter by enter key

I use devexpress XtraGrid and auto-row feature. At documentation I see: "You can also specify whether filtering should be applied immediately after changing a value or only when end-users press the ENTER key." I would like implement second behaviour, but I don't find any properties for this. So how can I achieve this behaviour? Thanks
