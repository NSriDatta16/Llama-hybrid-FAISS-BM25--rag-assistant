Let's look at it: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/magento(.*) So we're saying the condition is anything that is not /magento(.*), so everything but that directory? This would redirect everything, including your blog, assets, and any other directories. Without specifying each and every file that needs to be redirected to the magento directory, there really is no easy way of doing it. I suppose you could redirect any file that does not contain a "/" in it and ends with the extension .php to the magento directory. That way only files in the root web directory will redirect to magento, but if you used other directories inside the magento directory you'd still need to add separate rules for them.
