When is my Wasserstein GAN-GP overfitting?

I have a hard time interpreting the WGAN-GP losses attached. At which epoch is D and/or G overfitting? The quality improves a lot overtime, yet the generator loss at later epochs does not appear on par with what I observe from generator samples (truncation trick) at later epochsâ€¦ The data is 3000 images of one class.
