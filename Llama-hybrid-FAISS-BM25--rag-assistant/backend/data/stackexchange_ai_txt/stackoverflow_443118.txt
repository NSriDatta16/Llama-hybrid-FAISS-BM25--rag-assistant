I would suggest that, rather than having your test run against the code producing the gaussian distribution, you create a Monte Carlo-type algorithm that runs the Method many times and then test the overall distribution of results using the appropriate distribution model. If it is an average, for example, then you will be able to test against a firm threshold. If it is more complex, you'll need to create code that models the appropriate distribution (e.g. do values Keep in mind that you aren't testing the number generator, you are testing the Unit that generates the values!
