How do I implement a dynamic 'where' clause in LINQ?

I want to have a dynamic where condition. In the following example: var opportunites = from opp in oppDC.Opportunities join org in oppDC.Organizations on opp.OrganizationID equals org.OrgnizationID where opp.Title.StartsWith(title) select new { opp.OpportunityID, opp.Title, opp.PostedBy, opp.Address1, opp.CreatedDate, org.OrganizationName }; Some times I have Title and sometimes I don't. And also I want to add date in where clause dynamically. For example, like this SQL: string whereClause; string SQL = whereClause == string.Empty ? "Select * from someTable" : "Select * from someTable" + whereclause
