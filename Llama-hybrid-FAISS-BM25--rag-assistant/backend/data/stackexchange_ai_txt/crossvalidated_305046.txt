Best way to evaluate a random forest model accuracy on continuous data?

I have a random forest model that predicts a variable. This variable is not a categorical class but rather a number from 0 to 1. What is the best way to evaluate the accuracy of the generated models in this case? Should I split the training and test parts and then simply calculate linear correlations between predicted and observed values in the test class? Is there a more elegant solution? If so, is there an R package that implements this?
