How to determine what method is being used?

I was wondering what time series model would forecast future values in such a static but decreasing manner? ( I'm talking about the values around where the circle appears, as apparently, the data set that I have does that, judging from the graph, but I'm a beginner and not sure what model would do that? though I think it should be a simple one). I just need reasonable ideas :) Thanks!
