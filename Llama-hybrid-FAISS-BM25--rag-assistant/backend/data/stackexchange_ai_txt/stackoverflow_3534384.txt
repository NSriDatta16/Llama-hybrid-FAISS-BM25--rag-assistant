How to enable remote debugging in JBOSS 5?

How do you enable remote debugging in JBoss 5? The usual line from JBoss 4: set JAVA_OPTS= -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n %JAVA_OPTS% As can be found in other answers like this do not seem to work. The server never suspends. Googling "jboss 5 remote debug" doesn't bring up anything in the JBoss docs. Did something change from JBoss 4? How can I remotely debug my JBoss 5 server from eclipse?
