Uncertainty when substracting average from the same data set

I have a data set with its own measurement uncertainties. Then I do averaging of the population and use standard error of the mean as the uncertainty for the average. My question is, I need to substract this average value from the data. But I'm confused whether to use the previous uncertainty value for the final result (because the average doesn't contribute to measurement error). Or to use quadrature to calculate new uncertainty for the data. Any help is appreciated! Edit: I think context is important here. I have velocity data for several object. But all of these objects have a motion relative to a reference point and I just need internal relative motion between them. So what I need to do is to find average motion relative to the reference point and then subtract them from the data. Hence my question, when calculating uncertainty of internal motion, how I incorporate the uncertainty in mean calculation...
