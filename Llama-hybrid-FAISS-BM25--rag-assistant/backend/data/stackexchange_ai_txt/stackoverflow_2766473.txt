Cocoa : Scale Image dragged into an ImageWell

I am working on application to keep a comic book collection in order. The user should be able to drag an image of the cover artwork into the program via an ImageWell. Since it is not possible to drag the image out of the application again I don't need to save the picture in it's original size. An image at the size of the ImageWell would be just fine. The question is how do I rescale the image with my application? To make things even more complicated the ImageWell is bound with Core Data. So I need to rescale the image before Core Data will save the picture in its original size.
