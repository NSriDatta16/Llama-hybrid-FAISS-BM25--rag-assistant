You can't pass posts in a redirect - only GET vars. Also cookies do not work across domains - however there is nothing to stop you from passing the session id as a get var then creating a new cookie on the second vhost which references the same session: if ($_GET['sessid_from_remote']) { session_id($_GET['sessid_from_remote']); } session_start(); But this is only going to work if both vhosts share a session storage substrate. Personally I wouldn't type my credit card details into any site other than one which I know well and trust (amazon, paypal, worldpay...) and these guys don't use shared hosting accounts. So I'd recommend using paypal or worldpay to do the secure part and not bother with a dedicated SSL cert. C.
