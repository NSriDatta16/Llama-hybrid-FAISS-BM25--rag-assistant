Averaging multiple distributions

Suppose I have $X_1 \sim N(\mu_1,\sigma^2_1)$ and $X_2 \sim N(\mu_2,\sigma^2_2)$ (where the distribution is empirically estimated). I believe that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are actually drawn from the same distribution $N_(\mu^*, \sigma^{*2})$. I think the MLE is just to say $\mu^*=\frac{\mu_1+\mu_2}{2}$ and similarly for variance, right? Context: I want to do a back-of-the-napkin calculation to combine multiple reported statistics. E.g. we have several reports of meat consumption; if I believe they are all drawn from the same underlying distribution I would like to know the best estimator. I've been trying to read some basic tests on meta-analysis as I assume this is a standard procedure, but I can't find anything about this.
