C++ and gnuplot

This is my first post and I'm quite a novice on C++ and compiling in general. I'm compiling a program which requires some graphs to be drawn. The program create a .dat file and then i should open gnuplot and write plot ' .dat'. That's fine. Is there a way to make gnuplot automatically open and show me the plot I need? I should use some system() function in the code to call gnuplot but how can I make him plot what I need? Sorry for my non-perfect English :s Thanks for the attention anyway!
