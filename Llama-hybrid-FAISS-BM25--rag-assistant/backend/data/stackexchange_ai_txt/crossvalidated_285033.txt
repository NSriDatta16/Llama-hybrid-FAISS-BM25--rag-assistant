Regression and time series. As it is called?

A long time ago I was studying time series, and I found something like this: $Y_{t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1}+\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Y_{t-1}+\alpha_{2}Y_{t-2}+\epsilon$ i.e. $Y_{t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1}+AR(2)$, combining a regression model and a T.S. model. (Sorry, maybe there was some mistake at my expression or I've misunderstood something) Do you know what is the name of this topic? Can you recommend some book or examples? All kinds of help/ideas/advice needed and appreciated! :)
