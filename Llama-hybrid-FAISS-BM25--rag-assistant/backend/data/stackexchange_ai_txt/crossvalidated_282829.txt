In you example, A and B had lower probabilities than X and Y. Therefore the denominator of lift is small and the lift may easily get high. In an extreme case, if C and D occurred on just one row both, but together, the lift would be maximal possible, N (the data size). So the pattern would appear very strong but it could well be just noise. However, if you measured the strength with leverage (P(CD)-P(C)P(D)), you would get quite a different result, leverage In general, lift measures dependence between two variable-value combinations (events), while leverage measures dependence between the corresponding binary variables. It depends on your modelling purposes which one you want to measure. Leverage tends to be more robust in the sense that the patterns with highest leverage tend to have approximately the same leverage in future data, while lift values may vary a lot (a pattern with highest possible lift may actually express negative dependence in future data). On the other hand, leverage favours patterns where marginal probabilities P(C) and P(D) are near 0.5 and you may miss interesting but less frequent patterns. If you use lift to measure the strength, I suggest to evaluate also statistical significance of the pattern. Fisher's exact test is reliable even for infrequent patterns.
