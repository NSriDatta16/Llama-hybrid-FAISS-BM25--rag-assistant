Fluent nHibernate some kind of flat table

i have one problem (obviously :) ) Is it possible to make dynamic queries in nHibernate in that way... I have many tables (let we say: User, City, Country, Continet,...) is it possible to flaten this data so i do not need to know joins between this tables (get continent for user, without making join user.city, city.country, coutry.continent)? The point is i want to some kind flatten data, so user can dynamically select data on user interface without knowing data model behind application? It will be great that someone gave me at least idea how to make this, or if it's possible... One example on web is GoogleAnalytics Custom reports (you can drag dimensions and metrics on UI and get results)
