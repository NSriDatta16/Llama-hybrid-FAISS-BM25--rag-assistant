JQuery/JQueryUI hortizontal divider

recently for a website I am working on I wanted to create a horizontal divider capable of resizing two elements on a page using jquery. Basically: Content ___ Divider _ __ _ _ Content When: the divider is dragged, it should resize the "Content" elements either side of it to the users desired size. Here is what i have so far. And the script: var totalHeight = $("#Divider").parent().height(); function ResizePage(divPosition) { var validDrag = true; // Math var minPercent = totalHeight * 0.25; var minBuffer = totalHeight * 0.05; var topHeight = divPosition.top - $("#content").position().top; var bottomHeight = (totalHeight - divPosition.top); // Check Drag if (topHeight However when I drag the divider it simply jumps around and locks at either extremity, I have tried many different calculations etc, but I am afraid I just simply do not understand the factors in resizing both elements. So does anyone know a jquery plugin that will do this for me, or how i can fix my attempt? Thanks, Alex.
