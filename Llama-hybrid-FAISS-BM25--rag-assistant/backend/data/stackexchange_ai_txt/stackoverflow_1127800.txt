I just started experimenting with Qt/C++/Qt Creator and I must admit I was surprised that this "little cute bastard" was just below my nose for some many years and I pay attention to it just now. It (the framework) looks neat, feature-complete (even was stuff that .NET lacks such as inbuld XQuery support). Seems that most of the Qt applications written are dealing with 2D/3D/Games. I believe the downsides are only: having to know C++ and the lack of DevExpress goodies like QuantumGrid. I am seriously considering porting one of my simple applications (a picture viewer like ThumbsView). And it REALLY runs from same codebase. FOR REAL! Forget about Kylix, Mono, Lazarus, Free Pascal. This Qt thing beats them all in 10 times. Qt Creator is far from IDE. But I hope in the future they will add a more powerfull debugger, code insight and refactoring (at least the "Rename" one) and more meaningful compiler errors. I would seriously recommend to someone without experience in Pascal/C++ to take the Qt learning curve.
