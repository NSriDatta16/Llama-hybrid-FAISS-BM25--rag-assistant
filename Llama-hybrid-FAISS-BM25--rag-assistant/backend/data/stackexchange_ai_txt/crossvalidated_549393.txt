Can I use a continuous version vs a bucketed version of the same field in Machine learning?

I am training a classification model using tree based algorithms. I have a feature which is the price of an object. I'd like to check if the I keep the price as it is (as a continuous variable) & I also create price buckets (and then one hot encode them) and keep that has a feature too is a problem? The results are better with both variables included in training in terms of accuracy and F1 score. Also, no sign of overfitting are observed.
