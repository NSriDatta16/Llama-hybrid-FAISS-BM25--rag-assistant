Perhaps your design is OK, but the implementation/code is wrong. Some thoughts: Are all your ID columns GUID? Not recommended Kimberley L Tripp article Indexes on all foreign keys, perhaps with other columns in key or INCLUDE Regular maintenance? eg fragmented indexes, stats ot of date etc Are all datatypes matching (assumes no FKs): datatype precedence and implicit conversion errors may creep in Some more schema info and examples of poorly performing code may help
