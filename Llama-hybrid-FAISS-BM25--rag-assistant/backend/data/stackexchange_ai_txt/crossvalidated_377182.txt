Regarding the first point, you can either use linear methods that are more explanatory. For example PCA, to visualize and see what feature leads to the increase in variation. Or alternatively a linear model which each coefficient corresponds to each feature. The value of each coefficient is an indicator of how much they are influential. Regarding the second point, you can use pruning strategy to pin point which layers, inputs are most influential. For example you can use the the prune function. So at every step you remove a node you can calculate the MSE or the loss and see which node in each layer causes the most lost. Alternatively, you can use a linear model like Lasso , as a linear approximation to the Neural Network fit.
