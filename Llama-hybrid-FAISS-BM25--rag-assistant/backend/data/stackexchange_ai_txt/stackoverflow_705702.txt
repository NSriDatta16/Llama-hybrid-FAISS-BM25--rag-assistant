Have a look at ASP.NET MVC. It addresses the concerns of your management in three areas: It drops the used of webforms, arguably the biggest reason for ASP.NET's bulk. Without webforms you are coding "closer to the metal" and so you have tight control over your code and user interaction while still having a framework in place for state management. It uses a well defined, easy to follow, folder structure to enforce the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model. Unlike webforms, which was supposed to separate business logic from user interaction, the MVC model strongly encourages the developer to make that necessary separation. It is the separation, more than just about anything else, that keeps your code from becoming cumbersome. It is well integrated with jQuery. On the view side, with the exception of some helper classes to get your data into your view efficiently, you're working with pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript. ASP.NET MVC officially supports jQuery and is the preferred way of integrating JavaScript.
