You should check out Image Lists which implement dragging effects . The Win32 API includes functions for dragging an image on the screen. The dragging functions move an image smoothly, in color, and without any flashing of the cursor. Both masked and unmasked images can be dragged. Of course the user don't actually have to drag the image. You do that by changing the image position.
