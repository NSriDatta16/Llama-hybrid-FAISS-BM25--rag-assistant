How can an untrusted feature value affect the accuracy of a machine learning model?

I'm building a language detector model to classify between 2 languages given text image. The input will be the image, but I have another feature that can tell somehow the language (between 0,1) confidence, so if it's 1 or near its language 1, if it's 0 or near language 2. The problem is this feature is not accurate all the time, about 20% time of its value might be wrong. So would it be better if I added this feature or it will degrade the model accuracy? Is there info about which model expected to perform well on such a problem? and which optimizer? Does it need to be a deep network or a shallow one will perform well?
