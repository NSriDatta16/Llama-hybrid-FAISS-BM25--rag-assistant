On the Wikipedia page that you linked to, the average case performance is O(n lg n) with a citation to this Stack Overflow page. Which is weird because nowhere on this page does it say that. Anyway, to further what Ulrich was saying, average-case analysis is complicated because it has to take into account how the data is represented on average, which is not trivial. From Wikipedia: Determining what average input means is difficult, and often that average input has properties which make it difficult to characterise mathematically (consider, for instance, algorithms that are designed to operate on strings of text). Similarly, even when a sensible description of a particular "average case" (which will probably only be applicable for some uses of the algorithm) is possible, they tend to result in more difficult to analyse equations.
