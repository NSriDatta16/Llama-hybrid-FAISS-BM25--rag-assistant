How to limit SQL queries CPU utilization?

After a large SQL Query is run that is built through my ASPX Pages I see the following two items listed in sql profiler. Event Class TextData ApplicationName CPU Reads Writes SQL:BatchCompleted Select N'Testing Connection...' SQLAgent - Alert Engine 1609 0 0 SQL:BatchCompleted EXECUTE msdb.sbo.sp_sqlagent_get_perf_counters SQLAgent - Alert Engine 1609 96 0 These CPU is the same as the query so does that query actually take 1609*3=4827? Same thing happens with case : Audit Logout Can I limit this? I am using sql server 2005.
