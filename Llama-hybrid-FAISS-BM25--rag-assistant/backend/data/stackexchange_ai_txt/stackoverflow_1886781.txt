Populate plugin not working correctly

Hi i'm trying to retrieve and populate a form. The following link with username Testing and password test123 . The page is returning a correct JSON object (I tested it by putting on screen between paragraph tags) but the populate plugin is not populating. In firebug it show "no such element as" without displaying the element's name. The input field names are exactly the same is in the DB. any ideas?
