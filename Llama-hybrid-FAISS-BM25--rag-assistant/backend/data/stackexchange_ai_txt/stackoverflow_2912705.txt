Without knowing the precise application it's quite hard to give a definite answer for your needs, but in general and if I understand you correctly then as a SuperColumn has no timestamp data, I believe you would need to key each of your SuperColumns with perhaps a timestamp or other numerical key, and then define a CompareWith="LongType" (or similar, check documentation) in the storage config XML. This would result in each of your SuperColumns within the scope being sorted by ascending key. To retrieve the most recent, then, you would need to set the reversed attribute on your SliceRange to true (how exactly this is done will depend on the language/library you're using). See http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/API#SliceRange Hopefully this will be a point in the right direction :). James
