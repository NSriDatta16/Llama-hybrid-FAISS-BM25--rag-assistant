You could implement a response filter. Here is a nice sample that processes the HTML produced by ASP.NET. In addition to the HTML being sent to the client you should be able to also write the HTML to a database or other suitable storage. Here is an alternate and IMO much easier way to hook the filter into your application: in Global.asax, place the following code in the Application_BeginRequest handler: void Application_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e) { Response.Filter = new HtmlSavingFilter(Response.Filter); }
