Fixed-effects are not consistently defined . I guess you mean with fixed-effects binary indicators ( dummy variables ) in a panel setting which are either time-invariant (constant across individuals) or which take the same value for all observations within a certain time period (constant across time periods). Fixed-effects can be under mild assumptions used to control for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity in linear models. This however does not translate to non-linear models (due to the so-called incidental parameter problem ), see for example this 1948 Journal of Econometrics publication or here (or CrossValidated ). Usually, machine learning models such as tree-based methods are not linear (additively separable). This is why the do not behave as the linear fixed-effects model in econometrics (meaning that they will not automatically take, for example, time-invariant heterogeneity into account).
