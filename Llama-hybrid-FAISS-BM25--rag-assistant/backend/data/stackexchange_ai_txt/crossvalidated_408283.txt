(Something Bayesian about this?) No. A large number of experiments, eliminates randomness , which is the measure of uncertainty of an outcome. So, essentially randomness at play is reduced and the rating of the restaurant becomes more reliable with more votes. How can a third metric (rating) be derived that combines score and number of votes to order restaurants not only by score but also by how trustworthy that score is? The metric will largely depend on the objective for deriving the metric. One metric could be -- that takes into account the number of votes -- could be $(n_+/N)\ln{N}$ where $n_+$ is the number of positive votes, $\ln{}$ is natural log, $N$ is the total number of votes, $N \geqslant1$ .
