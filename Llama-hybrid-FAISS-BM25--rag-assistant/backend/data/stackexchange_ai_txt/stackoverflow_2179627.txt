Help on implementing how creatures and items interact in a computer role playing game

I am programming a simple role playing game (to learn and for fun) and I'm at the point where I'm trying to come up with a way for game objects to interact with each other. There are two things I am trying to avoid. Creating a gigantic game object that can be anything and do everything Complexity - so I am staying away from a component based design like you see here So with those parameters in mind I need advice on a good way for game objects to perform actions on each other. For example Creatures (Characters, Monsters, NPCs) can perform actions on Creatures or Items (weapons, potions, traps, doors) Items can perform actions on Creatures or Items as well. An example would be a trap going off when a character tries to open a chest What I've come up with is a PerformAction method that can take Creatures or Items as parameters. Like this PerformAction(Creature sourceC, Item sourceI, Creature targetC, Item targetI) // this will usually end up with 2 null params since // only 1 source and 1 target will be valid Or should I do this instead? PerformAction(Object source, Object target) // cast to correct types and continue Or is there a completely different way I should be thinking about this?
