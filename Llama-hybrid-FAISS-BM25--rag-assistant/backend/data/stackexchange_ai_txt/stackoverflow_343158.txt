I truly believe that nowadays (and probably, before) software value is based more on the support and agregated services than it is on the code itself. It may very well deppend uppon the kind of software you are building so, if your piece of software is mainstream (read: Operative System, Design software etc.) chances are that your software will be used ilegally more than a specialized accounting application or an e-government software. For companies like Microsoft, Autodesk, Adobe etc its harder because there are tons of forums, pdf's, screencasts, ebooks and videos (sometimes "pirated", too) that you can rely on to make good use of the software so you might not need "the support" of the company. In the case of ISV's and small software companies the software is very specific for a market and most of the times crackers and people in general who make a living of ilegal software won't care too much of your application since users are more akin to look for, say, windows vista, than for your "x-company accounting software" therefore, they won't spend time to crack your software because 99.8% of the market just would not care. As for the "big" companies I think they live from the "real" customers. The average user, the one that surfs the web and download stuff will probably be using unlicensed versions of a plethora of software because... well they just don't care, they use the computer as amusement but for someone that uses the software as a tool in order to generate revenue they will see this software as an investment and they know for sure that they better pay their licenses so the day the server goes down they have someone to call instead of waiting for a cracked patch while you loose customers/sales. It may very well deppend on the budget of your company, most companies don't have the time or resources to create anti-piracy solutions or buy them, but I guess that for ISV's it may be safe to ship your product without it, at the end, if someone's want to use your software without paying they will, on the other hand, those who understand that your product is a tool and not something you download from cnet know that the added value (support number, manuals, updates, etc) is what the human resources of your company can do for them that, for me, is the 50% of the final product.
