Given the conversation in the comments, I gather this is a study to examine if a new procedure will reduce bleeding following hip replacement and knee replacement surgeries. The patients will differ, and it is believed that the efficacy of the procedure will differ between the two kinds of surgeries, but it isn't reasonable to imagine that the null is true for one surgery but not the other. As a result, it is desired to allow the effect to differ between the surgeries, but to get a single test of whether the procedure helps. At the same time, it is of secondary interest to estimate the two levels of efficacy. I am thinking that I would fit a model with an interaction between surgery (population) and treatment (arm). I would test the full model (controlling for whatever covariates you believe are appropriate a-priori) against a nested model that drops both the interaction and the treatment dummy. That gives you a two degree of freedom test of whether the procedure helps. This is a single testâ€”no correction for multiplicity is needed. Following that, the model will afford two estimates of efficacy for the two surgeries. I would probably use 'least-squares means' to compute these estimates for a constant, idealized population, with special attention paid to confidence intervals for the estimates, not p-values.
