How do I get a scrollbar in a scrollviewer to focus the scrollviewer when clicked?

Currently with a scrollviewer, clicking the scroll bar contained in it to pan the content around it will not focus the viewer (or anything for that matter). I wish to have it so when you scroll by dragging the scroll, or even clicking the scrollbar will focus the parent (scroll viewer). I achieved this somewhat by attaching a ScrollChanged handler on the scrollviewer and calling sender.focus(). Unforutnally ScrollChanged is called on initialising the scrollviewer and so on loading the I also tried attaching event setters with still no luck. Ideally I would like it on some sort of style or something which allows me to apply it to all scrollviewers across the entire application. Edit: Just for futher clarification, if I use this xaml and click on the scroll bar it will not turn the background blue (gotfocus event). When I click inside the scroll viewer or the button it will.
