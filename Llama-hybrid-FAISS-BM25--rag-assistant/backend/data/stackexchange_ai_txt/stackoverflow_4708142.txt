There's library ruby library over at GitHub: https://github.com/gshutler/useragent I use it myself, and it's working as advertised so far. For your use case, you could probably call the library from within a helper method in your Rails project or something similar. That said, I'm not completely sure if the HTTP_USER_AGENT is exposed to Rails helper methods. In case it isn't exposed, you could always expose a controller method as a helper (by using AbstractController::Helpers::ClassMethods#helper_method ).
