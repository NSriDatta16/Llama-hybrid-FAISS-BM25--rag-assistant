After almost a month, I found that there is no way to get the rho or SVs from the svm_model so generated. If somebody came looking to find one, use scikit-learn which gives you the support vectors, the dual intercepts, and rho value without any hassle. Additionally, it is faster than python implementation of libsvm and support numpy arrays and matrices.
