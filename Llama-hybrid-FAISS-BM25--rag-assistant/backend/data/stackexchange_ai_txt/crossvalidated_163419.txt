Single artificial neuron easily extendable to neural network

I'm working on implementation of artificial neuron which be extended to neural net. I want do implementation by myself to fully understand how it works. I start with perceptron with threshold activation function: and then questions come along can implementaion be change to operate with more than 2 classes? if I build network with few layers, first (and nexts) layers should return predicted class or value from first layer? Is better artificial neuron to build neural net than perceptron?
