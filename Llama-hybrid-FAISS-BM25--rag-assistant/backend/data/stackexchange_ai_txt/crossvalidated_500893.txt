Firstly, the exercise has a negative reward I think the copy action miss the minus symbol The whole exercise is： Exercise 2.2: Bandit example Consider a k-armed bandit problem with k = 4 actions, denoted 1, 2, 3, and 4. Consider applying to this problem a bandit algorithm using ε-greedy action selection, sample-average action-value estimates, and initial estimates of $Q_1(a) = 0$ , for all a. Suppose the initial sequence of actions and rewards is $A_1 = 1, R_1 = -1, A_2 = 2, R_2 = 1, A_3 = 2, R_3 = -2, A_4 = 2, R_4 = 2, A_5 = 3, R_5 = 0$ . On some of these time steps the $\varepsilon$ case may have occurred, causing an action to be selected at random. On which time steps did this definitely occur? On which time steps could this possibly have occurred? Here is the table: Time Action ( $A_i$ ) Reward ( $R_i$ ) 1 1 -1 2 2 1 3 2 -2 4 2 2 5 3 0 My explanation: First, convert Reward to Q: $${Q_t}(a) = \frac{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{t - 1} {{R_i}{1_{{A_i} = a}}} }}{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{t - 1} {{1_{{A_i} = a}}} }}$$ Iteration = Time Q(1) Q(2) Q(3) Q(4) 0 0 0 0 0 1 -1 0 0 0 2 -1 1 0 0 3 -1 -0.5 0 0 4 -1 1/3 0 0 5 -1 1/3 0 0 So at time1 & time3 there are more than one max action (possible occur) time2,4,5 we have the max Q value which response to action 2 But I still have problems with time 4 since I found other blog which said time 4 does not definitely occur, and also about the $\varepsilon$ case it's about the probability what's the meaning about the question must occur?
