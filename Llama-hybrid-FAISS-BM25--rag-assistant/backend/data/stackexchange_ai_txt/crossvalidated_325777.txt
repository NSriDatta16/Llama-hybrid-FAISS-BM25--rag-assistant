How to do hypothesis testing on two samples with multiple attributes

Example: Given two groups of people (considerably large, and sampled independently and randomly), with the following individual attributes: Age Height Weight Education How to test if the two groups are drawn from the same population? For example, consider the following proposal: Null hypothesis: the two groups are from the same population. Add a label group_id = {0, 1} as the response variable, perform a logistic regression group_id ~ Age + Height + Weight + Education . If any of the regression coefficient is significant, then reject the null hypothesis. Would this be correct? What if more indepedent variables are added to the regression, e.g. log(height) , Height/Weight , etc.?
