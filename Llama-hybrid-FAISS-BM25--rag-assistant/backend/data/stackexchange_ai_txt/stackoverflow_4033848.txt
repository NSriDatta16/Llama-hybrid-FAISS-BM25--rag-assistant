How to pass the JQuery "this" selector as a parameter

For a class, I have to make a Drag and Drop interface using only CSS, HTML 4.01, and Javascript with the JQuery library; no plugins allowed. I figure the best way to do this was aler the CSS position of the div I'm supposed to drag on mousedown and then on mouseup $(document).ready(function(){ $(".draggable").mousedown(Dragging(this)); function Dragging(draggableObject) { draggableObject.live("mousemove", function(){draggableObject.css(/*alters the position of the div*/)}); }; }); My trouble is that draggableObject doesn't seem to have any CSS properties, I tried calling up an alert with its properties and apparently they're null. What am I doing wrong with passing the object, or anywhere else?
