In our organization, we use the following: Subversion, with AnkhSvn VS 2008 is our IDE (SPD for Development is bad) and Scrum/Agile. For builds/deployments we use WSPBuilder and SharePoint Installer Be careful with SPD. In our organization, we restrict who is even allowed to download and install it. Use SPDisposeCheck to double check your code to avoid disposing of objects when not needed, or to double check that you did dispose of what needs to be disposed of. We have configured a separate IIS website on the the SharePoint WFEs to host custom web services that use the object model. Those that don't use the object model are hosted elsewhere.
