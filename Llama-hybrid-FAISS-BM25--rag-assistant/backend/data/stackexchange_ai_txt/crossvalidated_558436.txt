Covariance of sums of time series random variables

I find the following in my Cryer and Chan Time Series Analysis with application in R textbook: Let $c_{1}, c_{2},\ldots, c_{m}$ and $d_{1}, d_{2},\ldots, d_{n}$ be constants and $t_{1}, t_{2},\ldots, t_{m}$ and $s_{1}, s_{2},\ldots, s_{n}$ be time points. Further let $Y$ be a random variable indexed with the previously mentioned time points. Then: $$ Cov\:\left(\sum_{i = 1}^{m}c_{i}Y_{t_{i}} \:,\:\sum_{j = 1}^{n}d_{j}Y_{s_{j}}\right) = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \sum_{j = 1}^{n}c_{i} d_{j}\:Cov(Y_{t_{i}} \: Y_{s_{j}}) $$ How is this be proven? The book says that it follows from the linear properties of expectation, but I'm not sure how this was used here. Further, the book states: $$ Var\:\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}c_{i}Y_{t_{i}}\right) = \sum_{i = 1}^{m}c_{i}^{2}\:Var(Y_{t_{i}}) + 2 \sum_{i = 2}^{m} \sum_{j = 1}^{i - 1}c_{i}c_{j}\:Cov(Y_{t_{i}} , Y_{t_{j}}) $$ Which is a special case of the first result. Why is this a special case of the first result?
