I think I am confused by the way you are using the word bias. Seems like they adjusted the HCV by head size by fitting a linear regression model. So for people with above average head-size they artificially reduced HCV and with below average head size they increased (adjusted) HCV, in order to reduce the variance caused by head size. Then they used HCVadj as a factor to model dimentia status. The reason they adjust before hand is because they want to compute the Cohen's D which uses the mean HCVs in the demented and non-demented population (no room for head-size or external factors in this model). So now they have a Cohen's D adjusted for head size. I see no problem here but I am no expert in Cohen's D. If you have a categorical predictor you can accomplish the same with unbalanced effect coding. (see here: What is effect coding? ). Include the 4-level class variable in the model using 4 dummy variables(x_21, x_22, ....) coded as shown on that page. Fit the model y = B_1*(x_1 - X_bar) + B_2*x_21 + B_3*x_22 + B_4*x_23 + B_4*x_24. Calculate the Ya's for each individual as you have in your equation (1) (without the intercept). Then use your Ya's to calculate your Cohen's D. If you are not calculating Cohen's D or something similar that requires 2 groups then you don't need this method. Maybe you can find some other way that takes into account the other factors?
