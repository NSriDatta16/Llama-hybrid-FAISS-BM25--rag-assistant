I think what you're mentioning can not be implemented or even if it can, it would be rather hard to implement and it'd have few advantages. Modularization can be good, but there are limits. Of course, you can design your system so that some parts depend on APIs, but not specific implementations, and I'd encourage that, but "absolutely no dependencies" is an illusion. "communication" would most likely create dependencies. It is good to try to modularize software, but you're going too far.
