Windows equivalent of OS X Keychain?

Is there an equivalent of the OS X Keychain, used to store user passwords, in Windows? I would use it to save the user's password for a web service that my (desktop) software uses. From the answers to this related question ( Protecting user passwords in desktop applications (Rev 2) ) and the multitude of third party password storage tools available, I assume that such a thing doesn't exist-- Am I stuck with either asking for the password each time I access the web service, or just storing it obfuscated?
