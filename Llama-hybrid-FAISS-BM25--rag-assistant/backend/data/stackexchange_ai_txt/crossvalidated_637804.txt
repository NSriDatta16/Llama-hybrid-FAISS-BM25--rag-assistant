Adding and interpreting covariates in logistic regression

I have a dataset and I want to do a logistic regression between the continuous variable "A" and the categorical variable "B". However, I also wanted to include "age" and "sex" variables as confounders in my statistical analysis. Could you please explain how can I do this in R? And also, how can I obtain the adjusted odds ratio for each variable while accounting for the effects of the covariates? Is this a correct statistical analysis? should I also include any interaction between these variables? model Afterwards, how can I interpret it correctly? Thanks
