Edit: is your question just about returning two variable? If so, just separate them with a comma, and they will be returned as an array: return min_value, max_value To add to what has already been written (yes, use the built-in libraries), it is generally a bad idea to modify variables outside of the method they are being used in. Note that in framework call, new values are being returned. This lets the person calling the method decide what to do with those values, rather than this method assuming that the variables exist and then changing them all the time. If I had to write it (and I'm new to Ruby so I might not be doing this as elegantly as possible, but it should be easy to follow), I would write it something like this: def find_min_max(list) if (list.nil? || list.count == 0) return nil, nil end min = list.first max = list.first list.each do |item| if item.nil? next elsif item max max = item end end return min, max end list = [1, 439, 2903, 23] min_max = find_min_max list p min_max
