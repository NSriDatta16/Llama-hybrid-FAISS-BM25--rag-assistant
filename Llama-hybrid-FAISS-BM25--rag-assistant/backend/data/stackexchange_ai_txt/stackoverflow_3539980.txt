Ok. This is what I have found so far: Go to the wiki: http://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/deployment/JOGL-DEPLOYMENT.html it indicated that there is a demo directory: http://jogamp.org/deployment/webstart/ There are a number of JNLP files here. Pick one at random: http://jogamp.org/deployment/webstart/Gears.jnlp Open it in the browser. The browser starts up webstart, and webstart installs the 3d extensions and runs the demo. It works, so clearly the libraries are being downloaded - somewhere. Fine. Let's try it from the command line: $ curl http://jogamp.org/deployment/webstart/Gears.jnlp > Gears.jnlp $ javaws Gears.jnlp Also fine. Great! The trick now is to work out how to link to those libraries that jws has downloaded. Well ... as far as I can tell they simply get put in /System/Library/Java/Extensions, and ... drat: "Access restriction: The type DirectionalLight is not accessible due to restriction on required library /System/Library/Java/Extensions/j3dcore.jar" okeydoke, more to figure out yet.
