Specifically you can: Admit that your code sucks Start asking others, preferably others with more experience, to review your code Implement a continuous build server - you have to be the one who uses this first Have courage because this can be difficult Be humble Read Code Complete Use a software development methodology that encourages team work. Some of the agile methodologies are really good at this Read development blogs Get involved in a user group Change is hard and you have to be the one who changes first.
