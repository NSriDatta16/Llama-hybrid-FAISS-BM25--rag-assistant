Our biggest performance improvement when running CC on several active projects was to install an MPX cache agent on the same machine and make sure it was storing file attributes and contents. (Well, that and making sure to use ccache in the builds.) The idea of triggers exists in the StarTeam SDK, but I'm not sure how integrated it is with CC. To check if a build is required, we keep the last pull from the server in a clean directory and use stcmd list to compare for changes. This is very speedy.
