Although not stated explicitly, the statistical analysis is presumably to see how your independent variables (predictors) are associated with your dependent variables (outcomes). Some of your categorical outcome data (e.g., the Likert items) are ordinal : the categories have a natural ordering from lowest to highest, even if the differences between levels aren't evenly spaced. You can take that ordering into account with ordinal logistic regression. Non-ordered multi-category outcomes can be handled with multinomial logistic regression. This UCLA web page has links to explanations of how to do both types of analysis with 5 different statistical software packages. In terms of independent variables (predictors) in regressions of any type, it's possible to incorporate combinations of continuous, binary, multi-level unordered, and ordinal predictors. Other UCLA web pages accessible for the one I linked above describe how to do that. There are some cautions. For one, as you have multiple outcome variables, you might need to take multiple comparison into account. If you do enough tests of statistical significance, some results can appear "significant" even if they really aren't. The analysis must address that possibility. For another, your sample size might be too small. To avoid overfitting* , you typically need to have about 10-20 cases per predictor variable. For categorical variables, each level beyond the first counts as a separate predictor in the model. On that basis I count 21 such predictors in your description. Some of those numbers come from your breaking down continuous predictors like age and hours worked into categories. That's a poor idea in general and increases your predictor count in this situation. But even if you cut down to only 15 predictors, your 130-140 responses would be barely adequate. Finally, there's the big problem of whether your sample will be representative of the underlying population of interest. That might be the biggest problem of all in carrying out surveys. *In overfitting, you might fit your data sample very well but get a result that doesn't generalize well to other samples from the same population.
