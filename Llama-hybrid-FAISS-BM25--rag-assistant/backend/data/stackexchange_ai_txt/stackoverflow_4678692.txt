It seems like this is a bug in VS2010. I just encountered this problem and the workaround provided by a member of the Microsoft Web Development Tools team provides this workaround: 2 workaround proposed: Change the installed template file by: a. find the template: e.g. C:\Users\UserName\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual Web Developer\CSharp\club_rtm_v1_cs.zip b. Extract the file ProjectName.webproj from the zip file c. Edit this file, remove the 1 null byte from it to make it totally empty d. Update this file for the zip file (e.g. in windows 7, you can just drag/drop the new file to the zip folder Create the website in VS2008, then open it using VS2010.
