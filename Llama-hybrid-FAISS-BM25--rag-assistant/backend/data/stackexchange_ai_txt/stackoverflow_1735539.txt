GDB debugger problems - No source file named

For some reason I can't get gdb to recognize the files in my project when debugging. I've tried a variety of things, including downloading different version, etc. and the last thing I did was completely overwrite all of MingW with Twilight Dragon Media's Bundle Package. Does anyone know how to solve this issue? The odd thing was that when I first started using it, it was working fine, and then it suddenly stopped working. I'm using Code::Blocks and I have the -g checked for the debug version of the project. I'm running on Windows Vista.
