get word click in paragraphs

I have an HTML document with about 30,000 words in it. I'd like to be able to do something when a user clicks any word. For simplicity/concept right now, I'd just like to alert() that word. For example, in the paragraph about, if I were to click on "have" it should run alert("have") . I'm using jQuery.
