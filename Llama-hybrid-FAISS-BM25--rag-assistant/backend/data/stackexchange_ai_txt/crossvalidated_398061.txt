A minimum False Discovery Rate of 0.8 when doing multiple hypothesis testing on Logistic Regression Coefficient p-values?

I currently have 8,000 predictor variables and a binary indicator response variable. I then did a logistic regression on each of the predictor variables, i.e., response regressed on predictor variable 1, response regressed on predictor variable 2, etc. This gave me 8000 p-values associated with each predictor's estimated slope $\beta$ coefficient. I then tried to control the FDR using Benjamini-Hochberg, but realized that unless I set my FDR to be 0.8, I could declare none of them significant. What is the interpretation of why this is so? Thanks.
