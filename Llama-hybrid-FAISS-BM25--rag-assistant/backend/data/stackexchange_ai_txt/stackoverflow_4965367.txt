That table doesn't produce any s when formatted using the redcloth.org "try it" box on their homepage. However, something like this: a |cat|yeah|what| |beery|true|fly| |baru|false|mirror| produces: a |cat|yeah|what| |beery|true|fly| |baru|false|mirror| So I would guess that you have a paragraph right before the tables without a blank link separating them. Adding an empty line: a |cat|yeah|what| |beery|true|fly| |baru|false|mirror| Produces what is probably the desired result: a cat yeah what beery true fly baru false mirror
