Assuming the existing code has a build system like Make or CMake etc., you probably want to use the "External Build System" template under "Other" in the projects pane. If you want to incorporate the existing code into a new application/framework/etc., create a template for the type of product you want to eventually build, then add a "Run Script" build phase to call your external build system. MacResearch.org has a tutorial on using the Xcode Organizer to build external targets that you may also find useful.
