If you're using the Flash IDE, embedding it outside the stage (anywhere - it just need to be on your project) is, indeed, the best way to do it. Basically, if you have a TextField with font embedding set, Flash only embeds the basic font, ignoring the rest - so if you want text with somewhere in there, the bold font has to be embedded. You probably do have Verdana bold in your system, maybe you just can't see it (depends on your system). Just try creating a Verdana TextField and enabling bold. You can also have it added to the library as a font asset, but it has problems of its own. Feature wise, the hidden textfield trick works best. You can also embed fonts with the [embed] meta tag, but that's a bigger can of worms for you if you're working with the IDE (since it means to start using the Flex SDK from it).
