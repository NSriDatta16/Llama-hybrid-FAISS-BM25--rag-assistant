How to demonstrate amount of virus required to lyse all cells using Poisson distribution?

In a seminal article in virology ( 'Sur l’unité lytique du bactériophage' Comptes rendus des séances de la Societé de biologie et de ses filiales, 1939, 130, pp. 904-907 ) the Nobel prize winner Salvador Luria applied the Poisson distribution to demonstrate that one bacteriophage particle was sufficient to lyse a culture of 80 million bacteria. He defined the probability P that the actual number of virions in a tube was x as: P = (nˣ/x!)e⁻ⁿ where n is the average number of virions in a series of tubes. He then defined the probability Q that x would be less than m as the sum between x=0 and m-1 of P. For m=1: Q = e⁻ⁿ He then provided a set of numbers of virions x and the corresponding set of Q probabilities experimentally determined: N = c(1, 2, 4, 8, 15) Q = c(0.736, 0.586, 0.357, 0.135, 0.022) However, I do not understand what actually goes into the P equation and how to derive Q. I have defined a Poisson function, considering the number of particles x as a success, but I do not understand where to get the number of trials (Luria used 100 tubes, but pois_f(X, 100) does not work either). I used a function to get a vector of probabilities: pois_f = function(x, n) { p = ((n^x)/factorial(x)) * exp(-n) return(p) } p1 = pois_f(N, length(N)) I tried to get a Q by exponentiating the negative number of particles found, but the slope is off: p2 = exp(-N) If p1 is wrong because I am measuring the poison distribution (assuming that I have used the function correctly, perhaps I need to invert the terms...) instead of Q; p2 should be Q, but it is also off the target. How do I correctly calculate Q? What measurements are required to define Q? Is Q 1-P?
