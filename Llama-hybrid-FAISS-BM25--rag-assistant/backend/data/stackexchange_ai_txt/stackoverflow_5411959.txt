Short answer: Multi-column foreign keys naturally refer to multi column primary keys. There can still be an autogenerated id column that is part of the primary key. Philosophical answer: Primary key is the identity of the row . If there there is a bit of information that is an intrinsic part of the identity of the row (such as which customer the article belongs to.. in a multi customer wiki) - The information should be part of the primary key. An example: System for organizing LAN parties The system supports several LAN parties with the same people and organizers attending thus: CREATE TABLE users ( users_id serial PRIMARY KEY, ... ); And there are several parties: CREATE TABLE parties ( parties_id serial PRIMARY KEY, ... ); But most of the other stuff needs to carry the information about which party it is linked to: CREATE TABLE ticket_types ( ticket_types_id serial, parties_id integer REFERENCES parties, name text, .... PRIMARY KEY(ticket_types_id, parties_id) ); ...this is because we want to refer to primary keys . Foreign key on table attendances points to table ticket_types . CREATE TABLE attendances ( attendances_id serial, parties_id integer REFERENCES parties, ticket_types_id integer, PRIMARY KEY (attendances_id, parties_id), FOREIGN KEY (ticket_types_id, parties_id) REFERENCES parties );
