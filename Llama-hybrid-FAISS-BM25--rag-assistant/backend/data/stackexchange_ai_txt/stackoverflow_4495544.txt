This is one idea: Normally, Block Storage volumes are seen as extra 'Drives' that you attach to a Virtual Machine. You could then use this but as if it was a metaphorical 'USB flashkey' that you would share with the other person. Create the storage volume Attach it to your VM and copy your data-to-be-shared on it Detach the volume from your VM Your Buddy, attaches it to his VM He then copies the files and voila! All this could be done through a web interface and you wouldn't have to do any networking steps. All you need now is a capable Cloud Geek, a pot of coffee and some convincing.
