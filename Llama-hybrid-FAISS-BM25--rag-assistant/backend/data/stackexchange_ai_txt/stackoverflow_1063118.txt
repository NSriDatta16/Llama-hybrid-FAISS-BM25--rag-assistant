Why can IE 8 display compressed CSS but other browsers can't display?

I use IIS web server 7.5 on Windows 7 for hosting my project. I try to create Javascript & CSS handler that can optimize and compress both Javascript & Css file size. But I found some problem. Please look at the following request & response of Test.css file which I found at Firebug on Firefox 3.0.11 browser. Response Headers Cache-Control : private Content-Type : text/html Content-Encoding : gzip Server : Microsoft-IIS/7.5 X-AspNet-Version : 2.0.50727 X-Powered-By : ASP.NET Date : Tue, 30 Jun 2009 10:46:15 GMT Content-Length : 197 Request Headers Host : localhost User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 4.0.20506) Accept : text/css,*/*;q=0.1 Accept-Language : en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding : gzip,deflate Accept-Charset : ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive : 300 Connection : keep-alive If-Modified-Since : Tue, 30 Jun 2009 10:41:00 GMT If-None-Match : "1C9F96F41F48600" Cache-Control : max-age=0 Moreover, I opened response tab of test.css file and I found that CSS file is loaded successfully. I try to open the same page in other browser like Chrome 3, Safari 4.0, Opera 10.0. But all browser can't display a correct web page except IE 8. Why? body{margin:0;padding:0;background:#f7f7f7 url(Photoes/bg.jpg) no-repeat center top;} PS. I try to disable compressor and all browser can display correctly.
