There are different approaches that you can use. I will list some here. For example, you can decide to go with a SARIMA model. This is an extension of the usual ARIMA models that take into account the seasonality effect. Here seasonality effect means the effect of month. Another method is to consider a naive model called " Time series regression ". In this case, to test the effect of month, you can define some dummy variables (specifically since you have 12 months or 12 levels, you should define 11 dummy variables) and include the time (year) effect as well. The model in R may look like the following: M.1=lm(airquality~as.dummy(month)+year) But most probably, if you fit the model M.1 in above, you will end up with serially auto-correlated residuals, which is not good! So you need to correct it and take into account that correlation. One way to fix it is to use a model called Generalized Least Square . But to fit this, you need to first model the auto-correlation among the residuals properly. Off course you can fit above models and then compare them based on some criteria to select a reasonable model.
