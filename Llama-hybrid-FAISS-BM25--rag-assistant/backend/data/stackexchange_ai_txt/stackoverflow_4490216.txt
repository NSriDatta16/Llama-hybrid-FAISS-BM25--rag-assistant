Problem when using JXL Formula like SUM() AVG() STDEV() returns #VALUE! when it refers values from another sheet

I want to populate some values in a sheet and then use jxl Formula to get the values from that sheet and write it to another sheet... When I try to run this sample code String filename = "C:\\input.xls"; WorkbookSettings ws = new WorkbookSettings(); ws.setLocale(new Locale("en", "EN")); WritableWorkbook workbook = Workbook.createWorkbook(new File(filename), ws); WritableSheet s = workbook.createSheet("Input", 0); WritableSheet s1 = workbook.createSheet("Output", 1); s1.addCell(new Number(3, 0, 5)); s1.addCell(new Number(3, 1, 6)); s1.addCell(new Number(3, 2, 1)); s1.addCell(new Number(3, 3, 6)); s1.addCell(new Number(3, 4, 1)); Formula formula = new Formula(3,5,"AVERAGE(Output!D1:Output!D5)"); s.addCell(formula); I am getting the last value in the AVG list has the output =AVERAGE(Output!D5) JAR Used : jxl 1.0.jar.... Solution tried : 1) Instead of giving it has a formula I gave it has label Label label = new Label (3,5,"AVERAGE(Output!D1:Output!D5)"); I got the entire text in the cell and gave '=' before the cell.. It worked like a charm. But I want this to be done with JXL API 2) Changed the JAR to jxl 2.6.jar Now I am getting #VALUE! when I try to run the same. The cell content is =AVERAGE(Output!D1:Output!D5) but still I get #VALUE!. JAR Used : jxl 2.6.jar This error is getting solved only when I go to that cell and press tab key or F2 key. Please provide some solution Regards N.S.Balaji
