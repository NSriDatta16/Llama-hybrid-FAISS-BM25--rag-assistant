The answer by Henry +1 (and others as well) is much simpler. However, the method below is more general. If the problem is changed slightly, for instance that the probability of a coin landing heads becomes dependent on the number of coins being flipped, then the simple answer does not work anymore. I would model this with a Markov chain . Giving a matrix to get from state $i$ to state $j$ (let the $n$ -th state mean "there are still $n$ coins left"): $$M_{i,j} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{8} & \frac{3}{8} & \frac{3}{8} & \frac{1}{8} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{2}{4} & \frac{1}{4} \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ and solve for 3 turns (that is you compute $M^3$ ) which answer is $$(M_{i,j})^3 = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{512} & \frac{21}{512} & \frac{147}{512} & \color{red}{\frac{343}{512}} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{64} & \frac{14}{64} & \frac{49}{64} \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{7}{8} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ Another related problem (for the interested) is to compute the expected number of turns. To do this you can equate the expectations for the number of steps neccesary in the $x$ -th state by means of the other $0$ -th to $x$ -th state. E.g. $$\begin{array}{} E[T_3] &=& \frac{1}{8} (E[T_3]+1) &+&\frac{3}{8} (E[T_2]+1) &+&\frac{3}{8} (E[T_1]+1) &+& \frac{1}{8} (1)\\ E[T_2] &=& &&\frac{1}{4} (E[T_2]+1) &+&\frac{2}{4} (E[T_1]+1) &+& \frac{1}{4} (1)\\ E[T_1] &=& &&&&\frac{1}{2} (E[T_1]+1)&+& \frac{1}{2} (1) \end{array}$$ Which can be solved as a problem with 3 linear equations and 3 unknowns. This variant of your question is similar to the frog problem . (I imagine that the simpler method by Henry to compute the probability to still be in the game after $n$ turns with $m$ coins as $P(turns>n) = 1-\left(1- {1}/{2^n} \right)^m$ allows an alternative computation of the expectation. And to do it without Wolfram Alphha you would have to split it up into different terms. $P(turns>n;m=3) = 8^{-n} - 3 \times 4^{-n} + 3 \times 2^{-n} $ where the sums of the individual terms can be solved as sums of geometric series )
