Evaluating the variation in the power of a known periodicity

Consider the following example: t = 1/24:1/24:365; x = cos((2*pi)/12*t)+randn(size(t)); % if you have the signal processing toolbox [Pxx,F] = periodogram(x,rectwin(length(x)),length(x),1); plot(F,10*log10(Pxx)); xlabel('Cycles/hour'); ylabel('dB/(Cycles/hour'); This demonstrates the dominant periodicity in the data set. However, if I have a time series for one year worth of data, similar to that shown above, is it possible to look at how a specific frequency changes through time. For example, the time series above shows the hourly variation of a given variable throughout the year. Therefore if we knew that the dominant period was driven by a diurnal cycle (i.e. once per day) then we would know that the dominant periodicity would be 1/24. So, if we know the dominant periodicity to be 1/24, is it possible to see how the power of this specific periodicity changes in time (i.e. throughout the year)?
