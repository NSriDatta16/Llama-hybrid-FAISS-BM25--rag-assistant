As phalacee above said: "MS-DOS doesn't exist in modern Windows". The Command Prompt in Win2K/WinXP/Win2003 is different with original MS-DOS. I think MS-DOS is almost (if not absolutely) antiquated and unworthy to learn, unless for someone who wants to understand the Microsoft OS evolution path. However, for Windows users, the cmd still should be learnt. Following are the reasons in my opinion: Command Prompt is the basic CLI shell on Windows. Many utilities (e.g. ipconfig/ping/netstat/sqlcmd for SQLServer, etc) can only be used in command line. Batch(.bat) or CMD(.cmd) script is useful to lots of simple automatic jobs -- although its functionality and syntax are both unly. Some additional toolkits can be used to enhance the ability of cmd, such as Cygwin, Sysinternals, Windows Resource Kit Tools, etc. They need knowledge on cmd. The section 15 (Tip 21) in the famous book The Pragmatic Programmer explained why command line should be learnt. On Windows 7, PowerShell seem to be a better choice than cmd.
