How to temporarily hide UIPopoverController

I have a UIPopoverController which i want to drag items from it and drop them on another view. I implemented the mechanism for Drag & Drop from a popover but i want it to be even better: while you dragging, i think the popover should be hidden so you could drop items right underneath it. Since UIPopoverController is not a "Classic" view controller i dont know how to hide it temporarily without dismissing it irreversibly. BUT since UIPopoverController presents something on the screen, there got to be a "View" somewhere inside that popover controller that i can hide and show... Any suggestions?
