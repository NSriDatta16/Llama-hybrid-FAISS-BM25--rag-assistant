How safe is information contained within iPhone app compiled code?

I was discussing this with some friends and we began to wonder about this. Could someone gain access to URLs or other values that are contained in the actual objective-c code after they purchase your app? Our initial feeling was no, but I wondered if anyone out there had definitive knowledge one way or the other? I do know that .plist files are readily available. Examples could be things like: -URL values kept in a string -API key and secret values
