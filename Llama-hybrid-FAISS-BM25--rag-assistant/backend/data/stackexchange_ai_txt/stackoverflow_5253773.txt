Convert list of dicts to string

I'm very new to Python, so forgive me if this is easier than it seems to me. I'm being presented with a list of dicts as follows: [{'directMember': 'true', 'memberType': 'User', 'memberId': 'address1@example.com'}, {'directMember': 'true', 'memberType': 'User', 'memberId': 'address2@example.com'}, {'directMember': 'true', 'memberType': 'User', 'memberId': 'address3@example.com'}] I would like to generate a simple string of memberIds, such as address1@example.com, address2@example.com, address3@example.com but every method of converting a list to a string that I have tried fails because dicts are involved. Any advice?
