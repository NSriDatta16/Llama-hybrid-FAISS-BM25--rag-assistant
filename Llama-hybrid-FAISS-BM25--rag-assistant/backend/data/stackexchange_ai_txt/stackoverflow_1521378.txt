Query String for pre-filling html form field

I manage a website for an organization that has separate chapter sites. There is a membership signup form that is on the main website that each chapter links to. On the form there is a dropdown box that allows a person to choose the chapter they want to join. What I would like to do is have each chapter website use a specific link to the form that will preselect their chapter from the dropdown box. After searching the web, I found that I will probably need to use a Javascript function to utilize a Query String. With all my searching, I still can't figure out the exact code to use. The page is a basic HTML page...no php and it is hosted on a linux server. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
