Your loop isn't actually executing 11 times - it's only executing 10 times, but i == 10 by the time some of those tasks execute. It's the normal problem - you're capturing a loop variable in a lambda expression. Just take a copy of the counter, and capture that instead: for (int i = 0; i { this.Authenticate(new HighFragment(leastAbstractions[copy])) .Reactivate(); }, TaskCreationOptions.PreferFairness); } That way, when your task executes, you'll see the current value of the "instance" of copy that you captured - and that value never changes, unlike the value of i . See Eric Lippert's blog posts on this: part 1 ; part 2 .
