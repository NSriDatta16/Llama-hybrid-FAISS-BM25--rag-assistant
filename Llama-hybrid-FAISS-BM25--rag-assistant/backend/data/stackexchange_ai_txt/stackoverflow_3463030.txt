Magento use own handle in widgets doesn't work

I find that I can add own layout handles with this script: $this->getLayout()->getUpdate()->addHandle('myhandle'); Then I checked Alan Storm Layout viewers: http://alanstorm.com/2005/projects/MagentoLayoutViewer.tar.gz ?showLayout=handles Handles For This Request default cms_page STORE_default THEME_frontend_default_default cms_index_index page_two_columns_left customer_logged_out myhandle There was my handle, but my custom layout xml didn't used. Here is my xml: test/your.js This works fine, so the xml file is loaded: test/your.js What's wrong? Why doesn't work this solution? If it's not the right way, how can I add custom css and javascript for the page where the widget used? Update: Here is something which maybe get close to the solution: If I add this code after I add the new handle to the page: $this->getLayout()->getUpdate()->fetchPackageLayoutUpdates('myhandle'); $this->getLayout()->generateXml(); After this the "index.php?showLayout=page" call writes handle code in the xml, but the page don't use it.
