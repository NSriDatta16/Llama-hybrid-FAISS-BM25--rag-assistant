I think you just need to call: this._engine.Runtime.IO.RedirectToConsole(); Otherwise have a look here for a similar question about redirecting. About python class instantiation in C#, your code seems to be ok, as shown in this question (look at the 3rd answer) EDIT: Sorry I didn't read your question with enough attention... Anyway, to look for available classes in Python, just do as you said, i.e. something like: var availDynClasses = items.Where(x => x.Value is IronPython.Runtime.Types.PythonType);
