Welcome to the site! In order to prevent from falling into common data science traps, I would encourage you to think about the following: You should never take data at face value. You should be thinking about the transforms that you could be doing to your data to get more insights. For example, from the fields you have, you can also determine the time in between visitors, right? Can you determine the number of visitors per day? Also, what other datasets are out there that you can be tying together with your data? You shouldn't be thinking about the business value of the data until you figure out what the data is telling you. This is where exploratory data analysis (EDA) comes in. You should explore your data and let the data speak to you (not the other way around!) so that you can be in a better position to think about your entire project. Remember, the entire point of data science is to enable you to ask smarter questions. So, take the time to explore your data and figure what else you need. That will enable you to ask smarter questions and then declare some use cases for your business/client.
