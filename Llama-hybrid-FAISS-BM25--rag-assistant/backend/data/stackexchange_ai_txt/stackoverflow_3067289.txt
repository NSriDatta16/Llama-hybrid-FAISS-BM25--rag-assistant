That's not really how scrolling works on trackball BlackBerry devices. It's always based on the change of focus from one field to another. The only time the whole screen may scroll "smoothly" is when there are no fields that accept focus (or on touchscreen devices such as the Storm). To use an analogy: just think of each focusable field on the screen as being like a line of text in a text editor. Just by moving the cursor with the arrow keys, you can get the screen to scroll but only when the cursor hits the edge of the current visible screen, and then only to the next line in a one-line increment. On trackball BlackBerrys, the trackball is the equivalent of the arrow keys -- and unfortunately there isn't an analog to "smoothly dragging the scrollbar with a mouse" in the text editor. Hope this makes sense!
