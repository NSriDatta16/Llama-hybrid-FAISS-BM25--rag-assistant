How to Remember Storage Size of .NET Data Types?

In .NET framework, Knowing how much each data types consumes memory is useful, but it's so forgettable. Is there any way to remember it? If I know for example, that the int data type consumes 4 bytes, it's useful. But this kind of data are so forgettable specifically when I use other software such as SQL Server that memory consumption there might be so different from the .NET framework. Is there any way to remember them instead of seeing documentations?
