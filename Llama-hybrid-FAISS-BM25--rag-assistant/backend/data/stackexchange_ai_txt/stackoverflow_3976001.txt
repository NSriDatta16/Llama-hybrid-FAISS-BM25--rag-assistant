C# XNA Ball Moving

I have the ball in the very right bottom side. When I click somewhere, I want to be able to figure out the direction I clicked and once the user starts to drag, I will calculate the distance. Once the user lets go of the mouse, I want to give the ball some velocity and have it move towards the direction it was first clicked. I don't know the formulas to compute these things. Any help with explanation is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
