First, PCA is not factor analysis. PCA is a method of data reduction. Factor analysis is an attempt to uncover latent variables. There is a lot of confusion around this, mostly terminological. e.g. In SAS, you can do PCA in PROC FACTOR. Also, the two methods often give similar results. Second, what book did you get? Third, if you want to see which variables correlate with each other, you can simply run a correlation analysis and get a table. Fourth, I am not sure what you mean by I would like to find a typology of my variables (and why not after find clusters among subjects) and have a summary view of all variables giving a good idea if relations are hidden in the amount of data. What sort of typology? What cluster analysis? Cluster analysis answers a different question: Whether there are clusters of subjects on the variables - subjects that are "close" to each other in some multi-dimensional (number of dimensions = number of variable) way. There are many methods of cluster analysis. What "summary view"? A typical summary view is means, sds, possibly interquartile ranges etc. Bivariately, you can do a scatterplot matrix, possibly adding some sort of smoother. Fifth what "summary graphs" are they proposing? Finally, perhaps taking a look at my blog post How to Ask a Statistics Question would help you formulate your question in a way that would get more useful answers.
