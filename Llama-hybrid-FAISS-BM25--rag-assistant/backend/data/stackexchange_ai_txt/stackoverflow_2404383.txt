How should I design my iPhone app's storage architecture? Small lists, dates etc

I have an app in dev that involves a small list of people, a small list of places, and dates and times. What is the best way to save this data? People - list will be Dates - What is the best way to manage dates with associated information? Places - Simple list - should I save this as a property list file? Same as people information? Also I will be cross referencing this data so it wont be just a simple storage / retrieval of it. Any tips on achieving this sort of thing would be very helpful. Cheers,
