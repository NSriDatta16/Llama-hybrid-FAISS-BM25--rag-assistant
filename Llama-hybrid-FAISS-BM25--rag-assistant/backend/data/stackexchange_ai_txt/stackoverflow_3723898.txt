WPF How to Scroll ListView embedded in Grid

I am trying to scroll a listview control in WPF which is embedded in a Grid layout control. I can't seem to achieve this. Any ideas anyone? By the way i have set the following properties on the list view in the xaml markup: Sell Share Buy Share Target Trigger Traded Price Ratio Bid Price Ask Price Market Trigger Traded Volume Ratio Bid Volume Ask Volume Traded Spread Traded Amount Ratio Total Sell Volume Total Buy Volume Total Sell Amount (ZAR) Total Buy Amount (ZAR) Average Sell Price (ZAR) Average Buy Price (ZAR) Number of Unfilled Orders Slippage (ZAR) Any help would be much appreciated.
