As Timo Geusch said: the #pragma message directive is used for that. As an exotic side effect of template metaprogramming, it's also possible to use the compiler as a calculator :) template struct Message; template struct Fac { static const int v = i * Fac ::v; }; template<> struct Fac { static const int v = 1; }; Message ::v > m; will result in the output message Line 10: error: aggregate 'Message m' has incomplete type and cannot be defined
