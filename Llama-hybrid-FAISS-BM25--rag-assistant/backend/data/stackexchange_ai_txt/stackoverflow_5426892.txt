Trouble Installing Ruby 1.9.2 with RVM Mac OS X

I apologize for my ignorance - I'm very new to this - but I have tried everything and cannot get 1.9.2 installed using RVM. I believe I have installed RVM correctly, and when I go to install 1.9.2 I get the following error in my make log when ruby tries to compile: ld: in /usr/local/lib/libz.1.dylib, file was built for unsupported file format which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64) for architecture x86_64 collect2: ld returned 1 exit status make[1]: *** [../../../.ext/x86_64-darwin10.6.0/digest/md5.bundle] Error 1 make: *** [mkmain.sh] Error 1 Some other information: I was running OS X in 32 bit, and received a similar error - replace the (x86_64) with I believe (i36). I am now running in 64 bit. *Update*: I have done everything TinMan has asked me to do, and still no avail - Just want to point out that I can install 1.8.7 just fine. Attempting to install 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 gives me the following error message: `Installing Ruby from source to: /Users/tl/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180, this may take a while depending on your cpu(s)... ruby-1.9.2-p180 - #fetching ruby-1.9.2-p180 - #downloading ruby-1.9.2-p180, this may take a while depending on your connection... % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 8609k 100 8609k 0 0 655k 0 0:00:13 0:00:13 --:--:-- 939k ruby-1.9.2-p180 - #extracting ruby-1.9.2-p180 to /Users/tl/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p180 ruby-1.9.2-p180 - #extracted to /Users/tl/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p180 ruby-1.9.2-p180 - #configuring ruby-1.9.2-p180 - #compiling ERROR: Error running 'make ', please read /Users/tl/.rvm/log/ruby-1.9.2-p180/make.log ERROR: There has been an error while running make. Halting the installation.` Additionally, I have upgraded my autoconf, automake, m4, and libtools. Lastly, my path and .bash_profiles respectively look like: PATH `/usr/local/upgraded/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /usr/local/bin` .bash `export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/local/share/man export INFOPATH=$INFOPATH:/opt/local/share/info [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"` *Update 2* I updated my autoconf, automake, m4, and libtools following the instructions here: http://tom.meinlschmidt.org/2010/11/22/upgrade-autoconfautomake-in-osx/ RVM Info: `system: system: uname: "Darwin Tam-Les-MacBook-Pro.local 10.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 10.6.0: Wed Nov 10 18:11:58 PST 2010; root:xnu-1504.9.26~3/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64" bash: "/bin/bash => GNU bash, version 3.2.48(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin10.0)" zsh: "/bin/zsh => zsh 4.3.9 (i386-apple-darwin10.0)" rvm: version: "rvm 1.5.2 by Wayne E.

When RVM has been initialized it will put its path to your ~/.rvm first. How do you do that? I'm really new to this, and have gotten this far through sheer guess work. Inefficient I know. *Update 3* Hi all - it's been a while since I've given up on this, but I am going to try again this weekend. Thanks for all the advice and I'll let you know what happens from there. For a newbie such as myself, I severely underestimated how difficult just installing something is.
