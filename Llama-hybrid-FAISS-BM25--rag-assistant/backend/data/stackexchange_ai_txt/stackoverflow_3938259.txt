Although your question is very vague, this guide should point you in the right direction. Android has several methods of persisting data, namely using SQLite, internal storage, external storage, or network storage. There are others, but these are the big ones. It's hard to know what you're trying to do, but I would start by looking into SQLite. If you're unfamiliar with it, you should check out this very simple Notepad tutorial . It will teach you the basics of storing and reading data from an SQLite DB. Again, if you could be more specific, I might be able to give you more specific advice, but I think this should put you in the right direction.
