There is not much choice nowadays, so you can do your own research and read licenses for currently used browsers. If you don't want to pay any license fees, you should take a look on Mozilla's Firefox licensing: http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/licensing.html In general, yes, you can redistribute Firefox, under certain conditions. Also see Licencing FAQ: http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/mpl-faq.html Or, take a look on Chromium licensing: http://code.google.com/intl/en-EN/chromium/terms.html Also, you might want to embed browser's engine in your application (For Mozilla's Gecko read: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/embedding/ , for WebKit, consult your UI widget library, it might have it already; if not, take a look here: http://trac.webkit.org/wiki )
