This is yet another example where Project managers fail to understand their role. Scrum is not an answer, nor any other doctrine. Why on earth would you, in any organization and to better support or be part of a decision, need hourly reports? are you workers fish? do they have no more than 60 minutes of recollection, needing you to troll on by "hey Jeff... how is it going?"... completely mind-exhausting line of thought killer forceps-driven pause "wazup patcouch22?... whom I seen 59 minutes ago..." And what if you understood, to the infinitely detail, what went wrong with the last slip... will the exact same derailments happen on your next project? Even if it did, do you understand the robotization required to avoid all forms of slipage/error/progress? Be humans... be helping humans, for crying out loud! there are no miracle mathematically structured ways to achieve high-levels of productivity... just heuristics. Read The Mythical Man Month and others... it's not so much on poor management techniques, it's about accidents and because we're dealing with humans. The best and team-productivity enhancing thing I've done (when I'm "just" a PM): keep my staff well fed, well slept, with regular schedules, and offer them my "ask me your dumbest question, I'll only answer IFFFF I'm 10000% sure of the answer". Shield them from the pressures above, solve for them the problems below, make sure they know you're there for punching-bag duty.
