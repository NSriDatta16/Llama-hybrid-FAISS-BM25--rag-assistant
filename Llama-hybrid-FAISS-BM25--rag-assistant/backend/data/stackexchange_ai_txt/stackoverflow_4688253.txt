Java Web Start Not Launching Problem

I've just install New OS windows 7 64bit, After installed java. I couldn't launch any Java Web Start application from my browser (by downloading and launching a *.jnlp file). When I try to launch an app, the loading cursor spinning for 10-20 seconds then nothing happen. I am getting frustrated with this issue! Does any one know how can i fix it ?
