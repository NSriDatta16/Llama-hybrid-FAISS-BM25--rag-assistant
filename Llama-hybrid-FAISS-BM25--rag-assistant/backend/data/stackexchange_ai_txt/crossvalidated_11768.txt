Which distribution to use with MCMC and empirical data?

In class, we've been learning a myriad of really interesting techniques to sample from a given distribution, filter online data, particle filters, etc. My issue is that when I take some real-world data and plot it, the distribution is clearly not Gaussian. So, I need to estimate some distribution. Or, in the case of an online filter (particle, etc.) I need to estimate some form of transition kernel. How do people normally do this? What would be considered "best practices" for developing some distribution to fit empirical data? What are some reliable "goodness of fit" tests?
