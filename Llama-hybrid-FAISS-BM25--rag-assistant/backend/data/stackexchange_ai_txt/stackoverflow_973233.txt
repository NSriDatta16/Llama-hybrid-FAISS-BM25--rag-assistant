Serializer library for Silverlight

I'm developing a modular app using prism in SL3, one of the modules is responsible for persisting the application settings in the isolated storage (so that when you open the app next time, you continue where you were). It works perfectly, except that I don't like the way dependencies are wired now. I want to have a type-agnostic settings manager that has a generic store and then I add custom data from each module, some thing like this: AppSettings["OpenForEditEmployees"] = new List (); AppSettings["ActiveView"] = ViewsEnum.Report; I have implemented this part, but serialising that dictionary to xml proved to be harder than I suspected. I was wondering if there is an easy way to serialise a Dictionary into XML.
