Predict length and width of an object (NLP/Tabular Data)

I need to do a model that predict the dimensions (length and width) of an object, given some inputs. The input are not important for my question, but are not images. Should I just do a double regression ? Can I use somehow the fact that I work only on a "half dimension", as I know (by definition) that length > width ? For now I've got two ideas: to predict the length, and then the width (but I'm not sure it would be so usefull) to make a custom loss to adjust the prediction (e.g. if X=2,Y=3, predX=3, predY=2, the loss should be 0) But I'm not sure any of them is good.
