Think about a regression of sales of ice cream on advertising, where the error comes from the effect of weather, which is unobserved to you, but not to the ice cream man or his customers. You care about what advertising does to sales. Assume for the sake of simplicity that weather has no persistence across days, nor was it recorded to be included in our model as a control. The concern is that the ice cream man uses advertising to smooth the effect of weather, so days with high advertising are also cooler days and low advertising days are hotter, so the coefficient that comes from comparing days with more marketing to less marketing will be contaminated by that relationship. Advertising will look less effective than it really is since we don't know what the weather was. That is the most basic kind of endogeneity. The weak version says advertising today cannot respond to today's weather. In other words, knowing the advertising level today tells me nothing about the weather today, on average. That might seem reasonable, since advertising takes time to roll out. Flyers need to be designed and printed and someone must be hired to hand them out. But advertising tomorrow could be correlated with today's cool weather. You can also have advertising today correlated with tomorrow's weather (or beliefs about it). The strong version says that in addition to today, advertising yesterday and tomorrow does not tell you about weather today, so the ice cream parlor cannot select advertising tomorrow to compensate for the effect of cool weather today. That is a much more restrictive assumption, since it also rules out compensating behavior across time in addition to within each day.
