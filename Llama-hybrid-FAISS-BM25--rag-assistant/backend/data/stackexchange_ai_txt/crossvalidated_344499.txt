For random forests, Hemant Ishwaran ( https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5PSPBOEAAAAJ ) has published a few interesting papers with theoretical treatments of random forests, take this for example, on the consistency of Random Survival Forests: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167715210000672 I would also recommend looking into these: Lucas Mentch, Giles Hooker (2016) Quantifying Uncertainty in Random Forests via Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests ; Journal of Machine Learning Research 17(26):1âˆ’41. G. Biau, L. Devroye, G. Lugosi (2008) Consistency of random forests and other classifiers Journal of Machine Learning Research, 9, pp. 2039-2057
