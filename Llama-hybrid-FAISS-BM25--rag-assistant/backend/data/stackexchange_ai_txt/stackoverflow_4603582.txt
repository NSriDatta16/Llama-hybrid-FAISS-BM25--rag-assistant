Breaking up large DataGridView for printing

I've got a single-row, 40 column-long DataGridView that i need to print. Since i can neither print it directly (because A4 sheets won't cut it ;)) nor adjust its width to the width of the page itself (because the headers look terrible), i wanted to break the DataGridView to 4 separate pieces and display 10 columns per row (imagine: column 1 to 10 in the first line, column 11 to 21 four or five lines below, etc...). Is there an easy way to do this? I was leaning towards a more manual approach (using fors), but i'd love to know if there's a more elegant way. Cheers
