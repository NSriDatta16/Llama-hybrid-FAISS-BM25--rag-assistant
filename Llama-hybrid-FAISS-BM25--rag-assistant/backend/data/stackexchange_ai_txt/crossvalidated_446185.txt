Post hoc comparisons following nparLD

I would like to compute post hoc tests to follow up on results from the nparLD package. In my sample dataset, I have two conditions, "drugA" and "drugB". There are 6 animals A-F and the weight of each animal has been measured 3 times under the influence of each drug. id $id id) df $drug drug) df $time time) library(nparLD) stats $Wald.test stats$ ANOVA.test What do you recommend for post hoc testing? Individual comparisons, where I compare subsets of the data using nparLD? Or is there a more elegant way of doing this? Also, the results of the Wald and ANOVA-type tests differ, especially regarding the factor 'time'. What do you recommend?
