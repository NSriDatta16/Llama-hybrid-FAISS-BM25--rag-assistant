Compare odds ratios that are above and below 1

I am testing a logistic regression model that has two continuous IVs in SPSS. The DV is of course binary. IV-1 has an odds ratio above 1 and IV-2 has an odds ratio below 1. I understand what these mean, but how can I statistically compare the strengths of the influence of the two IVs? I understand that if both of the odds ratios are on the same side of 1, I can use the CIs to make the comparison. But I'm not sure what to do with my current situation. Thank you very much!
