Statistics approach to describe difference in proportion

I have 11 different dates and for each date i have two random sample where group A got specific treatment while the control didn't. i want to measure the difference in proportion between those samples for the entire period of time which means - some kind of an average change between group A and control. Example of my data - Month p_groupa p_control 2019-1 4.32% 54.07% 2019-2 4.40% 66.28% 2019-3 9.56% 58.04% 2019-4 5.30% 53.97% 2019-5 8.92% 51.66% 2019-6 7.72% 49.26% 2019-7 8.18% 50.91% 2019-8 15.85% 53.79% 2019-9 22.39% 54.23% 2019-10 8.47% 59.27% 2019-11 7.18% 51.28% In addition, how to treat to the numbers for Aug and Sep ? Thanks
