What configuration of output neurons to use for detecting bias

I am trying to make a deep learning model that detects political bias in media articles for my local community. There are two political parties here and I have a dataset of biased articles from both. I do not have a dataset of unbiased articles. Can I implement a neural network with 2 output neurons for each party, and if the accuracy of the prediction is under some value (let's say 0.7) predict it as unbiased and otherwise as biased? Or do I explicitly need to have unbiased articles in my dataset and one neuron would be biased articles and the other unbiased?
