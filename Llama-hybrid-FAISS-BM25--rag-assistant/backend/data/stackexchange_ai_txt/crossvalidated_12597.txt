Mean when computing correlation between samples of unequal size

This question is in some way similar to this one , but about another nuance. I have two time series (update: stationary - with both mean and variance equal over time) with missing values in one of them, such as 1,2,3 1,Absent,3 (in reality I have many more observations). I want to compute their correlation, so I will not use the 2nd time-point in these data. But should I use it for computing the mean of the first series? I think that including this point in computing the mean will lead to a more precise estimate of the population mean for the first variable, but don't know whether it is correct though.
