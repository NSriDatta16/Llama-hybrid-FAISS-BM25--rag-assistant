Is it possible to control the false discovery rate without applying some such correction? Yes. This is what a threshold on p values does: it sets the rate of false discoveries to that threshold. In the long run, on all tests run on true null hypotheses, only $100\,a$ percent will have a p value below $a$. Remember that (frequentist) error rates do not concern at all any probabilities about a hypothesis tested by any individual test, but as methods for conducting tests with guaranteed long term failure rates. Correction for multiple comparisons is another method for guaranteeing long term failure rates: one for constructing compound methods which contain multiple tests so that some guaranteed long term failure rate for the compound holds. If you conduct a single experiment with 100 tests and report that 5 of them spoke against the null, thus claiming that you have observed some real result, nobody will be impressed, knowing that on average, amongst 100 tests of true nulls, 5% will reject; the method you have employed, "conduct 100 tests and report if any of them meets the 5% threshold", has a higher failure rate than 5%. Thus, you may chose to control for multiple comparisons and report that e.g. 2 out of 100 tests had p values lower than (5 / 100 == 0.05) %. Now you employ a method which has again a guaranteed failure rate (for the error of reporting at least one significant test even though no hypotheses are false) of 5%. That is, FWE/Family-wise error correction controls the global error rate; that if you do n tests, only $a$ times will you find a significant effect if all your tests are of true hypotheses. That is, if literally every single hypothesis anyone ever bothered to test was true, and everyone always did >1 tests per study, and everyone applied study-wise FWE control, 5% of studies would report significant results (and 5% of all individual tests would be significant under their original , uncorrected thresholds). In contrast, if everyone always tested 100 true hypotheses per study and did not apply FEW, the number of experiments reporting significant effects would exceed the guaranteed error rate of 5%. (Contrast with FDR/False Detection Rate, which is not a method that guarantees the rate of reporting any significant test in a study of multiple tests of true hypotheses.)
