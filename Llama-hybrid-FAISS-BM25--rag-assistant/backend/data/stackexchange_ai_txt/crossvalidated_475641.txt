Causality in correlations between multiple variables

Let's say I have 4 or 5 variables of interest which I measured for each of about 500 people. So, imagine a 500x5 matrix. Because of the nature of these variables, it is obvious that there must be (and indeed there is) a correlation between each possible pair of these variables, i.e. columns of the matrix. Is there any way of testing the causality? I used to think no, but then I heard something about Structural Equation Modelling, which to me sounded like a claim that there may be a way. But I really don't have a clue about this topic, and I don't know how and where to begin. To make my question more concrete, I have a hypothesis that variables A and B determine variable C to a large degree, and variable D is largely determined by variable C, and this is why they are all correlated (because A depends on B as well). An alternative hypothesis might be that variables A, B, and C all determine variable D directly and that is why they are all correlated (because A and C depend on B as well). Obviously, none of the correlations are perfect, and there's always some statistical noise in each relationship. For clarity, I made a sketch of the two competing hypotheses (models) in my example. Is there a pragmatic way (SEM or other) to show whether the data favours one of these models over the other? If yes, what's the best or most pragmatic way to implement this procedure, e.g. in R?
