Editing text as a li in an unordered list

So I got all excited to be able to position list items absolutely within an relatively positioned unordered list so I could add embedded media players and the like without questioning if they would appear in the right place on the page. But I'm wondering if I've painted myself in a corner, because now I have a list item positioned where I want to edit text. So I have a few lines of text in one list item, and want to take ONE LINE of that text and make it a hyperlink but when I go to add a link to it and preview it in a browser, the link doesn't appear to be active. Is there a way to edit paragraphs in a list item, or a more efficient way to absolutely position text on a page?
