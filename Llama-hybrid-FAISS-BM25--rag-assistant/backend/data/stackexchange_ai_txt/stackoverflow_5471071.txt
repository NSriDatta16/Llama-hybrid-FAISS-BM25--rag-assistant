ASP.NET compiler fails with an XmlSerializers error, during web-deployment project

We're using Visual Studio 2010 Web deployment projects to compile web-application websites during our build. Visual Studio 2010 is not installed on our build-agents. We get an error (see below) during the build relating to the automatically-generated Foo.XmlSerializers.dll being built with a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded by aspnet_compiler.exe. We're targeting .NET Framework v3.5 in our project files. Here's the error (reformatted for long lines): "C:\BuildAgent\work\3836706d661b8a05\project\src\Foo.FrontEnd.WdpSite\ Foo.FrontEnd.WdpSite.wdproj" (Build target) (1) -> (AspNetCompiler target) -> ASPNETCOMPILER : error ASPCONFIG: Could not load file or assembly 'Foo.FrontEnd.Site.XmlSerializers' or one of its dependencies. This assembly is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded. [C:\BuildAgent\work\3836706d661b8a05\project\src\Foo.FrontEnd.WdpSite\ Foo.FrontEnd.WdpSite.wdproj]
