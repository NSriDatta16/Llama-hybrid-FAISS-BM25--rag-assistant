Is the number of cells in a keras LSTM or RNN layer equal to the number of time steps?

Say I have the following code to create a LSTM layer: lstm_model = Sequential() lstm_model.add(LSTM(128, batch_input_shape=(BATCH_SIZE, TIME_STEPS, FEATURES)) Lets say, I plan to train a model where there are n tanks. for each tank the pressure and temperature are recorded at an interval of 1 hour, a total of 5 times everyday. The data is recorded for a year. Thus I will have batch_size = 365, time steps equal to 5 and number of features = 2. So my input shape will be (365,5,2). So will the code mentioned earlier create an entire LSTM layer with total number of cells just equal to 5?
