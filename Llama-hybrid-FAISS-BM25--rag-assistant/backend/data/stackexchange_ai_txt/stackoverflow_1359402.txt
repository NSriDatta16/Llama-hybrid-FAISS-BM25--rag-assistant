You mean like Checkout ? :-) I only mention it because Checkout is gorgeous and written with PyObjC... Your concerns are valid, although probably not as much of a potential showstopper as you'd think. Using PyObjC still requires you to learn some Objective-C, and definitely requires you to understand at least some of the Cocoa frameworks, since you need to call into the Cocoa frameworks whenever you need to do some sort of Cocoa-specific task. I recommend you read and consider the SO question "Why is the PyObjC documentation so bad?" and "PyObjc vs RubyCocoa for Mac development: Which is more mature?" before you completely convince yourself that "just PyObjC" will make things much easier. I refuse to disparage PyObjC because it is quite powerful and incredibly useful, but realize that nothing is a silver bullet, and no language or technology is best for all problems. The Objective-C language is simple and pretty straightforward. The Cocoa frameworks generally dominate the learning curve for new Cocoa programmers. Plus, you have StackOverflow and lots of other resources to help answer your questions. (Judging by the activity of the "pyobjc" tag , you also stand a better chance of getting good Objective-C help on SO.)
