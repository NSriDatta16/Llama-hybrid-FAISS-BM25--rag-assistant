I solved the above problem for SQL breadcrumb using below query SELECT c.Name + ' >> ' + b.Name + '>>' + a.Name AS breadcrumb FROM tblOrganisation AS a LEFT OUTER JOIN tblSubGroup AS sg ON a.SubGroupID = sg.SubGroupID LEFT OUTER JOIN tblOrganisation AS b ON sg.RAOID = b.RAOID LEFT OUTER JOIN tblRAO AS rao ON rao.RAOID = b.RAOID LEFT OUTER JOIN tblOrganisation AS c ON c.RAOGID = rao.RAOGID WHERE (sg.RAOID IS NOT NULL) AND (a.OrgID = @ORGID) UNION SELECT c.Name + ' >> ' + a.Name AS breadcrumb FROM tblOrganisation AS a LEFT OUTER JOIN tblRAO AS rao ON rao.RAOID = a.RAOID LEFT OUTER JOIN tblOrganisation AS c ON c.RAOGID = rao.RAOGID WHERE (rao.RAOID IS NOT NULL) AND (a.OrgID = @ORGID) UNION SELECT Name AS breadcrumb FROM tblOrganisation AS a WHERE (RAOGID IS NOT NULL) AND (OrgID = @ORGID) Cheers!
