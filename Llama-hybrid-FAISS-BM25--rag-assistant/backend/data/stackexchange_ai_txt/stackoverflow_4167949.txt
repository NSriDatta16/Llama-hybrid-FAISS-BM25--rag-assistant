want to make a project that evidentiates the real utility of functional programming. If you could just give me some ideas I will be very grateful. Alright, then let me tell you something. Programming is about expression. Functional languages let you express things differently. What are the benefits of the expressions made possible with functional programming? Infinite lists and recursion can be expressed very simple. Recursion is functional programming done right. Try to implement algorithms and datastructures that use it. Balanced trees, fibonacci, euclidian algorithm, all that will benefit from it. Really, anything that features a tree can be expressed very elegantly in functional languages. Give mathetmical problems a try, try to solve the Euler Problems with Haskell.
