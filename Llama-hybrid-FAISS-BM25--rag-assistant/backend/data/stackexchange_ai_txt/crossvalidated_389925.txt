First of all, the mean is not exactly the mean of the means. But, considering $N=n_1+n_2+n_3$ the population (that in this sense is the union of the the three groups) average is $\mu=\frac{n_1\mu_1+n_2\mu_2+n_3\mu_3}{n_1+n_2+n_3}$ . Thus, you have a set of averages in a simplex generated by the constraints $N=n_1+n_2+n_3$ and $n_1,n_2,n_3>0$ . For the variance ( $\sigma^2$ ), you can use a similar approach. The population variance is the sum of the Between Group Variance and the Within Group Variance as follows: $$N\cdot \sigma^2=\sum\limits_{g=1}^3 n_g(\mu_g-\mu)^2+\sum\limits_{g=1}^3 n_g \sigma^2_g$$ Also in this case, considering that $$\sum\limits_{g=1}^3 n_g(\mu_g-\mu)^2=\sum\limits_{g=1}^3 n_g\mu_g^2-N\cdot\mu^2$$ your solution is one of the possible inside the simplex. But remember that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ depends both on the choice of $n_1$ , $n_2$ , and $n_3$ . In your case, $n_1=n_2=n_3$ the total variance is $$\sigma^2=\frac{1}{3}\sum\limits_{g=1}^3 \left[(\mu_g-\mu)^2+\sigma^2_g\right]$$
