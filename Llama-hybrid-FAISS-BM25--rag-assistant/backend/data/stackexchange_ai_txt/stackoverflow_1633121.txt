You can use anonymous Diffie-Hellman key agreement with SSL. This provides privacy on the channel, but no authentication. Of course, without authentication, you really can't have privacy, because your private channel could be connected to a "man-in-the-middle". That's why the anonymous DH cipher suites are discouraged. If the lack of a certificate is stopping you from using SSL where it's really needed, get a free one from startcom.org.
