A (real) dashboard gauge needs to be: 1) physical, and 2) read quickly under circumstances that disturb concentration. In that sense, you want a low data-to-area ratio. Not to mention that when physical gauges were invented, digital (numeric) displays didn't exist so there was no real choice. A software dashboard is not physical, and is not generally looked at in a pitching, moving vehicle with other vehicles whirring around it. So the effect of imitating a physical device doesn't buy you much. EDIT: I'd also add that a physical dashboard only has a couple of key attributes to get across to you at (literally) a glance. A corporate dashboard needs to make a lot more detail visible, though of course things should be drawn/coded/organized in a way to also give a quick status. That's part of the Tufte philosophy of dense detail in presentations that allow a broad view but also allow you to drill down. You car's dashboard doesn't let you drill down, basically because there's no need to.
