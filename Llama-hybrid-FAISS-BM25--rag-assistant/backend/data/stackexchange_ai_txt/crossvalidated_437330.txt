Does my evidence against the $H_0$ increase with increasing power but fixed $\alpha$? (e.g. with increasing sample size)

Let's say I test $$H_0: \theta \in [-1,0] \quad vs. \quad H_1: \theta \in (0,1]$$ where $\Theta = [-1,1]$ and let's say I get a p-value $ p\leq \alpha$ . My question is whether the evidence this result yields against $H_0$ changes with increasing power if I employ the Frequentist perspective ? From the Bayesian perspective it does. Let $\pi$ be my prior over $\Theta$ and let $\beta(\theta)$ denote the probability of a type two error of my $\alpha$ -level test (let's assume for simplicity that the probability of rejecting $H_0$ is a constant $\alpha$ for all $\theta\in [-1, 0]$ The we can caluclate: $$P(\theta= \theta_1|p \leq \alpha)= \frac{\int_{(0,1]}(1-\beta(\theta))\pi(\theta)d\theta}{\alpha\int_{[-1,0]}\pi(\theta)d\theta+ \int_{(0,1]}(1-\beta(\theta))\pi(\theta)d\theta}$$ This formula shows that with a decreasing $\beta$ the probability of my alternative being true increases independent of my prior (as long as $\int_{[-1,0]}\pi(\theta)d\theta>0)$ However from a frequentist stance I am not so sure whether I can say the same as the evidence against $H_0$ is contained in the p-value for whose calculation we assume that $H_0$ is true and I am not allowed to put a prior over my parameter. Also taking the interpretation of the p-value being a continuous meausure of evidence against the $H_0 $ does not speak of power at all and seems to suggest that the p-value alone is the measure of evidence against the $H_0$ . Also the answer by Harvey Motulsky in this post claims that a power analysis does not influence the interpreation of a non-significant result. The problem seems to be that if we assume $\lim_{\theta\to 0^+}\beta(\theta)=\alpha$ the "worst case scenario" does not change even if $\beta(\theta)$ increases for every $\theta \in (0,1]$ e.g. with increasing sample size. I am somewhat confused and not quite sure how I would anser the question: "does the interpreration of a siginficiant result change with increasing power(and constant alpha)?" (especially in the case of multiple testing where I can be fairly certain that some $H_0$ s will be correct and some won't.)
