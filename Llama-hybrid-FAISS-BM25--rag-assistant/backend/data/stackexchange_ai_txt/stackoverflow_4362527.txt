Do requests in UIWebView use sharedHTTPCookieStorage?

From googling a bit, the answer to my question is "yes". But how do I test that? I tried to inpsect the HTTP request headers (i.e. [request allHTTPHeaderFields] ) in webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType: , but none of the request has the "Cookie" entry, even though cookies are successfully stored in [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] .
