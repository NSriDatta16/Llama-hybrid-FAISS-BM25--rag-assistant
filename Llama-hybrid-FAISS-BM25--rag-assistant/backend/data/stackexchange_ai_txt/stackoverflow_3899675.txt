I had the same problem, the process described in this post from the Apple developer forums solved it for me: Remove any versions of the application from iTunes. Drag the mobile provision file to iTunes (it seems like nothing happened but continue on) Sync the iPhone (again nothing should appear any different) Drag the app to iTunes Sync the iPhone a second time. Good luck!
