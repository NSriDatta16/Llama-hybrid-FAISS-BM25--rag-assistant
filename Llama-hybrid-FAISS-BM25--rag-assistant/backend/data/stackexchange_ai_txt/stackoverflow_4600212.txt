html table to excel with PHP

I have looked for answer to other similar questions but couldn't see useful.. I have an html table generated with php from mysql db. I use this fragment in my php file to save as excel $file="program.xls"; header('Content-Type: text/html'); $table = $_POST['tablehidden'];//i get this from another php file.It is HTML table header("Content-type: application/x-msexcel"); //tried adding charset='utf-8' into header header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$file"); echo $table; Till this time everything is ok. But when I save this i get character problem and tried to add charset='utf-8' into my header, I don't know but It does not work. I have my table with style in HTML but when it comes to excel it lost the style which is implemented in css. How can I solve the charset and styling problems? I have looked at phpexcel but couldn't see a method to include a table directly.
