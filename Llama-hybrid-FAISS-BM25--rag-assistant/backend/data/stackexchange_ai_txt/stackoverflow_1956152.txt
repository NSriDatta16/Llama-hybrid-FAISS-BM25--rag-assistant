I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it's not always the destination, but the Journey. If you're going to set out to do this, I recommend using a language you are comfortable. Personally, this would be C#/.net for me, but from your tagging, I'll assume PHP would be the Serverside scripting language you would choose. I would layout how I wanted my application to behave. If there is going to be a lot of data, you should consider (as dlamblin mentioned) an DB of some sort for lookup and retrieval. (Light Blog, not so much data... 1000 users can edit? maybe you should consider a DB.) Once you've decided how to store the data, decide how to present it. Write some proof of concept code for each of the features you want to implement (blog templating, bbcode, user authentication, text searching...) and start to work them all together.
