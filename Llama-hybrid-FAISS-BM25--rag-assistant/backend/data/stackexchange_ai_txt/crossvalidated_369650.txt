Based on the comments above, it seems that you are more interested in the agreement between Score1 and Score2. Note that correlation and agreement are not the same things. For example, if Score1 and Score2 perfectly agree, and you create a new variable Score2*, which is Score2 + 10, then Score2* and Score1 do not agree anymore. However, the correlation between Score1 and Score2 equals the correlation between Score1 and Score2*. If you're interested in the agreement between two continuous variables, you could use the Bland-and-Altman Plot that lets you investigate how well the two Scores agree, and whether the differences between them are affected by the level (average) of the score (e.g., that the agreement is better for low scores than for high scores). You could also do it differently per condition. The fact that you have repeated measurements means that you will need to calculate the limits of agreements based on the results of a mixed models analysis of the differences between the two scores in which you include as a fixed effect the average of the two scores.
