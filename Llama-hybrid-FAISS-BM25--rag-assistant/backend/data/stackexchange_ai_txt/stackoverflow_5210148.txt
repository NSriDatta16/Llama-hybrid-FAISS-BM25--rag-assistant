jQuery UI revert events

I'm looking for a way to revert an element to its original size and position as soon as it leaves a certain droppable. Essentially, what I have is selection of images that you can drag into a droppable area and resize, but I want to be able "put back" the images in their original locations by moving them off the droppable area. Thanks!
