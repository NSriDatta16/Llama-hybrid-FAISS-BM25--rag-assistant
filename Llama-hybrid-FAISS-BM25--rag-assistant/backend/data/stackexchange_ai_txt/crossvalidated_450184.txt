It is not true. There's similar number of regression algorithms as classification algorithms in machine learning. Most of the classification algorithms have their regression counterparts: there's $k$ -NN and $k$ -NN regression, SVM's and SVR's for regression, random forest build of classification, or regression trees, XGBoost can be used for both tasks, there's an infinite number of regression neural networks, etc.
