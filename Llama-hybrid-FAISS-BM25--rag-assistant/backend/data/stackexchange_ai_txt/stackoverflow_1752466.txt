I think google images is based on associative text searches. Most attempts to do recognition on image content have way to poor accuracy today to be useful. If you are sincerely interested to develop such algorithms, first target an easy problem, where the number of possible objects, and nature of photos are somewhat controlled. You want to look into: Computer Vision : how to retrieve useful information from digital images, first hand primitive information like color distribution, edges, circles etc. Object recognition : how to detect objects. Machine learning : make your application to self-improve. ImageJ , a computer vision open source app may be a good place to start.
