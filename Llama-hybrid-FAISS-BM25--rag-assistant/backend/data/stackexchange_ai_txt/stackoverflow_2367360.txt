J2ME applet - run Java in a mobile's web browser

I'm looking to embed a J2ME application as an applet in a web page to be accessed via a mobile phone web browser. Every major web browser supports the embedding of Java applets - does an analog exist for cell phone web browsers? If not, does there exist a cross-platform way of launching a J2ME application from a mobile web browser?
