Understanding 'latent' output of princomp() in Matlab

I have a feature vector containing 17 features. I need to take only features containing 98% variance. So I did principal component analysis (PCA) in Matlab like this: [COEFF,SCORE,latent] = princomp(X); cumsum(latent)./sum(latent) and got this: 0.9082 0.9824 0.9999 0.9999 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 [...] The first value 0.9082 indicates the variance value of the first principle component, is that correct? Now if I need to select features containing 98% variance, do I select only those: 0.9824 0.9999 0.9999 What does 1.0 mean? Does this mean 100% variance?
