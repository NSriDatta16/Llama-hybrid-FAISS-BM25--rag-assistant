How dynamic is the data set? If it's reasonably static, and you want to "zoom", then you should consider consolidating the data in to a scaled subset. Contrived example: if you have 100,000 pts (say advancing on the X axis), then, clearly, in a 1000 pixel image, you're only going to be, inevitably, plotting 1000 pts of that 100,000. So, you can do that in advanced (1000 pts, 10000 pts, raw data of 100000pts) and select from the appropriate set based on the "zoom" level that you're displaying. As for what value to select when the points overlap, you can do min, max, median, average, etc.
