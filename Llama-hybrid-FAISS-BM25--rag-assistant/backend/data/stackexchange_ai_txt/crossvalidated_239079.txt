1) The features extracted using CNN are scale and rotation invariant? A feature in itself in a CNN is not scale or rotation invariant. For more details, see: Deep Learning. Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. 2016: http://egrcc.github.io/docs/dl/deeplearningbook-convnets.pdf ; http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/convnets.html : Convolution is not naturally equivariant to some other transformations, such as changes in the scale or rotation of an image. Other mechanisms are necessary for handling these kinds of transformations. It is the max pooling layer that introduces such invariants: 2) The Kernels we use to convolution with our data are already defined in the literature? what kind of these kernels are? is it different for every application? The kernels are learnt during the training phase of the ANN.
