LINQ to SQL without VS 2008

In response to one of my previous questions, I was encouraged to check out LINQ to SQL. I like what I see, but I'm struggling to get going with it. I wrote the necessary classes for each database table, but I'm not sure where I'm supposed to put the code. I've been searching the Internet for tutorials, but they all seem to be assuming that Visual Studio 2008 is being used to generate the files. Our company doesn't have Visual Studio 2008 and this is not an appropriate time to be purchasing it, especially since the application works just fine using regular ADO.NET connection and command objects. Can somebody explain how to get LINQ to SQL up and running manually, or point me to a tutorial that explains it? I'm coding in VB.NET
