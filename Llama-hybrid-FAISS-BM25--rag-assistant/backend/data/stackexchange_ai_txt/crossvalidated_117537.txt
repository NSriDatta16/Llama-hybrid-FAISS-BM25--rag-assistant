Another appealing way of handling variables of mixed types is to use the proximy/similarity matrix from Random Forests: http://cogns.northwestern.edu/cbmg/LiawAndWiener2002.pdf . This faciliates a unified way of equally treating all variables (nevertheless, be aware of the variable selection bias issue). On the other hand, there is really no gold universal way of defining distance for variables of mixed types. It all depends on the application contexts.
