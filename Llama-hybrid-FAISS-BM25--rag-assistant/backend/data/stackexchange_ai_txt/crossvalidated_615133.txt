You have been given two good answers. I thought it might be instructive to come at this from a different angle, and suggest how one might realise themselves that the statement is false, by finding a counterexample. It can often be useful to run simulations (in say R or Python), to test our understanding of things or in this case look for counter examples . The Python code below took very little time to write (minutes), and gave me a counter example almost immediately. import numpy as np for i in range(1000): data = np.random.randint(-100,100,(3,3)) cov = np.cov(data) sum_diag = np.diag(cov).sum() sum_all_elements = cov.sum() sum_off_diag = sum_all_elements - sum_diag if sum_off_diag > sum_diag: print('Data:' ,data, "\nCovariance matrix: ", cov, "\nSum diag:", sum_diag, "\nSum off diag", sum_off_diag) break; Having a counter example(s) means you can focus your attention in the right place, perhaps if you had a few counter examples you may have then have observed that highly correlated variables seem to violate this, such as pointed out in Michael M's answer.
