There are a couple of issues: To get your own top level identifier I think you actually have to request it somewhere (and probably pay money?) however there is an experimental range that you can use to test. (this is not a php issue, it is an snmp issue/feature) As far as I know the protocol assumes a process to listen on a port that is totally different from the http port, and also not using TCP but UDP. Just creating a php page the usual way is not going to work. A possible solution might be to use a snmp module in apache (or whatever webserver you are using) that allows you to program the response logic in php. My feeling is that most of the snmp php stuff that you encounter on the web is not about the agent part but about the manager part.
