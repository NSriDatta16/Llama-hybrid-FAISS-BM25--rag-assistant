I've just answered in the WinMo 5.0 question, but it works for 6.0 too, so I'll repost it: Under http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=549675 you will find a driver for the emulator that sets up a RAM Disk, that for the emulator is seen as an external storage card but doesn't suffer from the issues with mapping a folder. I've checked with SQL Compact sdf file stored in the RAMDisk and it works like a charm. I've used it as a 64MB drive but supposedly it can handle up to 256 MB.
