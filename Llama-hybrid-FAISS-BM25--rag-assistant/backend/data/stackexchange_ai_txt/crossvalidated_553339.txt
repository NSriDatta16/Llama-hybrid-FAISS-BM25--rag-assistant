Predicting average detention using Bayesian Statistics

I am complete beginner in Statistics and I've been having trouble with Bayesian inference. It will be great if anyone can help me with this question (it's a question from final preparation but due to covid, the professor is impossible to reach). Schools in State A have been struggling with the number of detentions being given out. To properly assess how many detentions are being given out, the board issued a statistician to look into the numbers. It is formerly believed that the schools in average gave out 128 detentions with variance of 16. 50 schools were selected in random from 3 major cities to check this assumption. The results are as follows: City A: 152 detentions in average with standard deviation of 10 City B: 137 detentions in average with standard deviation of 7 City C: 171 detentions in average with standard deviation of 14 Use bayesian inference to Calculate the new expected average of detention being given out in State A What is the probability of schools having a detention average of greater than 160? We also use R, so if using R is easier to explain (or calculate) then please do so.
