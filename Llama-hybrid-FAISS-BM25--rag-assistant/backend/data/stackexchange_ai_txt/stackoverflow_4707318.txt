Problem with python cgi in Firefox

I have written an html form and am trying to incorporate a python cgi script with it. I have already configured my apache server to execute cgi scripts from the cgi-bin directory. Here's the html form: And here's the test2.py cgi script: #!c:/Python27/python.exe -u import cgi import cgitb cgitb.enable() form = cgi.FieldStorage() qry = form["qry"].value print "Content-Type: text/html" print print " " print qry print " " print " " The html page is located in my htdocs folder and the cgi script is in the cgi-bin directory. However, when I enter something into the form and submit, firefox returns an error message saying: "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (c) isn't associated with any program". Why is this error occurring? Does it have something to do with my path to the cgi script in my html page? Thanks in advance!
