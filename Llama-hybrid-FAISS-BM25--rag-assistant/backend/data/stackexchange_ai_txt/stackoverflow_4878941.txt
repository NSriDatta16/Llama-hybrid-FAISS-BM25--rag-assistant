HOG descriptor is very easy to implement. You can write your own code to do it. Look at http://smsoftdev-solutions.blogspot.com/2009/08/integral-histogram-for-fast-calculation.html . It is fast implementation of HOG. Once you get HOG features of all the training images.You can train an SVM in OpenCV. Training with Gaussian Kernel has produced good results.
