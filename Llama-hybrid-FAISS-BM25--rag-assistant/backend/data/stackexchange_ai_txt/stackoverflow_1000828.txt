Are you required to serve files using Tomcat? For this kind of tasks we have used separate download mechanism. We chained Apache -> Tomcat -> storage and then add rewrite rules for download. Then you just by-pass Tomcat and Apache will serve the file to client (Apache->storage). But if works only if you have files stored as files. If you read from DB or other type of non-file storage this solution cannot be used successfully. the overall scenario is that you generate download links for files as e.g. domain/binaries/xyz... and write redirect rule for domain/files using Apache mod_rewrite.
