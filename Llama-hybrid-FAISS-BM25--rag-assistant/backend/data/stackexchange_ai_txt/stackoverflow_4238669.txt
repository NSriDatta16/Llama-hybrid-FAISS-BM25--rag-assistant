It would be easier if you had some notion of the absolute values to expect, but I would suggest: find the lowest (weakest) value first. It is your noise level. compute the average level, it is your signal strength define some function to decide the noise threshold. This is the tricky part, it may require some experimentation. In a bad situation, signal may be only 2 or 3 times the noise level. If the signal is better you can probably use a threshold of 2xnoise. Edit, after looking at the picture: You should probably just start at the left and find a local maximum. Looks like you could use 30 dB threshold and a 10-bin window or something.
