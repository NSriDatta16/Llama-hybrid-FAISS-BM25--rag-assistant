TableLayoutPanel Controls - Lock Column from Horizontal Scroll?

I'm using a TableLayoutPanel in a Windows Forms application to organize a set of controls in a grid-like fashion. I'd like to lock the TableLayoutPanel's first controls column so that it remains fixed when the user applies the horizontal scrollbar. Any guidance is appreciated.
