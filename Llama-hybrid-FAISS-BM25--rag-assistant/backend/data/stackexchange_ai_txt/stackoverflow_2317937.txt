Given that automatic refactoring was invented in a dynamic language (Smalltalk), I would have to say "Yes". In particular, John Brant, Don Roberts and Ralph Johnson developed the Refactoring Browser which is one of the core tools in, for instance, Squeak. My Google-fu is weak today, but you could try find this paper: Don Roberts, John Brant, and Ralph Johnson, A Refactoring Tool for Smalltalk, "The Theory and Practice of Object Systems", (3) 4, 1997.
