Making a JPanel manually resizable

I have a JFrame with BorderLayout as the layout manager. In the south border, I have a JPanel , I want this JPanel 's size to be adjustable by the user, i.e. the user can click on the edge of the border and drag it up to make it larger. Is there any way you know that I can do this?
