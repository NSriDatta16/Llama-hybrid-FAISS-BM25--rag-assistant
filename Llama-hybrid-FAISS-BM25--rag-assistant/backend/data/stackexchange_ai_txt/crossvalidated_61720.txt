I think re-working the dependent variable and model can be fruitful here. Looking at your residuals from the lm() , it seems that the major issue is with the players with a high career WAR (which you defined as sum of all WAR). Notice that your highest predicted (scaled) WAR is 0.15 out of a maximum of 1! I think there's two things with this dependent variable that is exacerbating this issue: Players that simply play for longer have more time to collect WAR Good players will tend to be kept around longer, and will thus have the opportunity to have that longer time to collect WAR However in the context of prediction, including time played explicitly as a control (in any manner, whether as a weight, or as the denominator in calculating average career WAR) is counterproductive (also I suspect it's effect would also be non-linear). Thus I suggest modeling time somewhat less explicitly in a mixed model using lme4 or nlme . Your dependent variable would be seasonal WAR, and you would have a different number $j=m_i$ of seasons per player $i$. The model would have player as a random effect, and would be along the lines of: $ sWAR_{ij} = \alpha + \sigma^2_i + \text{ } + \varepsilon_{ij}$ With lme4 , this would look something like lmer(sWAR ~ + (1|Player), data=mydata) You still may need to transform on $sWAR$, but I think this will help out on that feedback loop.
