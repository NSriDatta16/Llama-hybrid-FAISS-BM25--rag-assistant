There are two fields where randomized experiments are almost always impossible: they are social sciences and economics. In these instances you can only do "quasi experiments". Try searching with keywords quasi experiments, observational studies and social sciences ; you will get some good text books. I can recommend two excellent books on this subject: the second book by Shadish and Cook is a classic: Counterfactuals and Causal Inference: Methods and Principles for Social Research By Morgan and Winship Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference by by William R. Shadish and Thomas D. Cook A classic paper that uses a technique called "propensity score matching" in non experimental setting for causal inference by Dehejia and Wahba is highly recommended as well. Additional recommendations: Design of Observational Studies by Paul R. Rosenbaum. Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction by Imbens and Rubin. IF you are looking at time series quasi experiments, the above books have some chapters devoted to them, but a dedicated book is by Gene v. Glass Design and Analysis of Time-Series Experiments and I would check his article Interrupted time series . Trivia: Gene V Glass coined the term " Meta Analysis ".
