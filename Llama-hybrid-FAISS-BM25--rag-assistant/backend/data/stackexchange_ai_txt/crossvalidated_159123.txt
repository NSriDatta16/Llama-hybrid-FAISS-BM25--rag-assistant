If you are going to use edge detection, you will have to use distance transform to do the kind of classification you are thinking of. Once that is done you need to create a distance matrix between the test image(s) (ones without the label) and the training image(s) (ones with the label). But may I suggest using HoG transform instead, or at least a Sobel filter instead of an edge detector. The Sobel filter at least is simple to implement in Matlab and I'm sure someone has implemented the HoG filter. The reason is simple: the edge detectors give you binary features and this in my opinion makes it harder to compare since it is not scale and position invariant. Once the feature vector is done, choose a classifier (SVMs, CART, NN etc.) to classify into the classes.
