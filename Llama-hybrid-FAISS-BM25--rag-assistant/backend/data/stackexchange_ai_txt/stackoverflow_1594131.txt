The argument that all lower case is the 'best practice' would easily vindicate using all CAPS as best practice as well. I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of users don't operate in multi-platform environments, or at least not in a manner that's likely to cause them to encounter the issue raised here. The issue is really only a problem when copying from a case-sensitive environment to a non-case sensitive one where you have multiple variants of a filename within a single directory (somewhat unlikely). The idea that a file reference would be the crux for me falls down when you consider that directory structure variation is likely to be an equal issue in such situations. At the end of the day, in a corporate environment, there should be a published standard for such things that everyone is at least encouraged to follow, that for me is best practice. Those that follow the standard don't only have themselves to blame.
