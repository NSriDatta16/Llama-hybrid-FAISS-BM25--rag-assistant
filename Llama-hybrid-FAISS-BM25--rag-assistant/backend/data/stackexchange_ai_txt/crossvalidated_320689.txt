You can cross-correlate the two time series by merging the monthly counts for either measure and calculating a correlation between their logged values. If You must, of course, know which month and year either aggregate data has. If they do not overlap, then such data cannot probably be analyzed this way (or any way). This is an ecological design, poorly controlled, so very little information if any can be attained from such an analysis.
