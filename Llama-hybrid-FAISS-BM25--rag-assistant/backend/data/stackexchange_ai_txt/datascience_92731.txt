Suitable CPU with RTX3070 GPU for deep learning

I am trying to get a GPU for my deep learning research. Due to stock limitation, I can only get a RTX3070. In my lab, there's some PC/workstation whereby I can install the RTX3070. However, I wonder if the CPU is suitable. Will it cause bottleneck with the GPU. I used the bottleneck calculator to check. but it's more suitable for games. They mention that 1 and 3 below are not suitable but I'm not sure how accurate it is. Does anyone have experience how to check? The CPUs I have are: i7-4770@3.4ghz PC 32gb ram xeon 4216@2.1ghz 192 ram xeon e5520@2.27ghz 64gb ram RAM, PSU and SSD can be upgraded so it's not a big problem. The main task is deep learning.
