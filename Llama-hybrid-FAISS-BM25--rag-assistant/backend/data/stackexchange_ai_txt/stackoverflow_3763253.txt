Is there a limit to how many times FBML.XFBML.parse() can be called per page?

I have the following code to dynamically load a XFBML fragment into an Facebook IFRAME application. The HTML: The jQuery code: function loadFragment() { jQuery.ajax( { url: "xfbml_fragment.php", // contains the type: "POST", dataType: "html", cache: "false", success: function (data) { jQuery("#fragmentfbml").html(data); FB.XFBML.parse(); jQuery("#fragment").css("display","block"); } }); } The jQuery AJAX call works every time but the FB.XFBML.parse() call only works once. I've added a callback to FB.XFBML.parse() with console.log() (see below) and verified that it only executes the first time it's called. FB.XFBML.parse( document.getElementbyId("fragment"), function( { console.log("parse called"); } ) ); Is this a known behaviour of FB.XFBML.parse() (certainly doesn't say so in the FB Javascript SDK docs ) or am I just doing things wrongly here?
