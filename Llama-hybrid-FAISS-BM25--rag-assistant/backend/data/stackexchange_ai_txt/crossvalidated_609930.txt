This is "multiple instance learning"; the wikipedia page has a good introduction. Your examples sound like they don't conform to the standard assumption , so you'll need some "metadata-based" algorithm. At the simplest, you engineer metadata features from the bags and fit a traditional model to the result. More complex algorithms try to automatically find good metadata definitions; neural networks seem like a natural candidate for that, but I'm not familiar enough to give approaches. Still, armed with the search phrase "multi-instance", you can find e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11132
