How to get full path of the selected node in the package explorer from an Eclipse plugin?

I am attempting to get full path of a selected node in the package explorer which is a folder or package not a file in my Eclipse Ganymede plug-in. I tried the way that is mentioned at How to get the selected node in the package explorer from an Eclipse plugin page, but whenever i use the following line in my code, IFile file = (IFile) structured.getFirstElement(); (This one) IPath path = file.getLocation(); plugin does not work and does not respond also it gives no exception warning. When i changed IFile declaration to Object declaration it is fine. But i need to get file or folder to get full path for my operations. Any help will be appreciated...
