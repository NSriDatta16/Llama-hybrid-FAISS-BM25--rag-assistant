Storing Uploaded Images Without Running Out of Space

I currently run an outdoor site and people have been asking me to add the ability to add photos from their hikes. And it is an important feature for an outdoor site. But I am afraid they will start uploading 100s of large images and I will quickly run out of space. Is there a common and free solution to letting people upload images without having to buy a tonn of server storage space? Thanks, Alex
