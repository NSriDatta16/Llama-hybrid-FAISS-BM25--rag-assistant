jquery draggable: how to limit the draggable area?

I have a draggable object (div), and some droppable ones (table TD's). I want the user to drag my draggable object to one of those droppable TD's. I enable draggable and droppable this way: $(".draggable").draggable(); $(".droppable").droppable(); The problem is that with this the user can drag the div anywhere on the screen, including out of the droppable area. How can I limit the boundary area for the draggable object?
