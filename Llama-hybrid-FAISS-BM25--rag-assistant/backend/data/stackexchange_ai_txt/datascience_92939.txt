How to add epoch in sklearn LinearSVC?

I have a model that i need to train multiple times using epochs, i tried adding this code clf_svm.fit(train_features, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=64) and it didn't work. how to add epoches in skleran linear svc? training that model several times and save the model here is the code am working with # empty list to hold feature vectors and train labels train_features = [] train_labels = [] # loop over the training dataset print ("[STATUS] Started extracting haralick textures..") for train_name in train_names: cur_path = train_path + "/" + train_name cur_label = train_name i = 1 for file in glob.glob(cur_path + "/*.jpg"): print ("Processing Image - {} in {}".format(i, cur_label)) # read the training image image = cv2.imread(file) #resize = ResizeWithAspectRatio(image, width=1250, height=1000) # Resize by width OR # convert the image to grayscale gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # extract haralick texture from the image features = extract_features(gray) # append the feature vector and label train_features.append(features) train_labels.append(cur_label) # otherwise create the model, train the model and save the model if os.path.exists("D:/ai training/aphids/joblib_model.sav"): print("Loading Trained Model") clf_svm = joblib.load("D:/ai training/aphids/joblib_model.sav") else: # have a look at the size of our feature vector and labels print ("Training features: {}".format(np.array(train_features).shape)) print ("Training labels: {}".format(np.array(train_labels).shape)) # create the classifier print ("[STATUS] Creating the classifier..") clf_svm = LinearSVC(random_state=9, dual=False, max_iter=1000) # fit the training data and labels print ("[STATUS] Fitting data/label to model..") clf_svm.fit(train_features, train_labels) #savemodel joblib_file = 'D:/ai training/aphids/joblib_model.sav' joblib.dump(clf_svm, joblib_file)
