Showing NTFS timestamp with 100 nsec granularity

I understand that the FAT file system stores its time stamps for files (modify date, etc.) with a 2 second granularity, and NTFS stores them with a 100 nsec granularity. I'm using VBScript with FileSystemObject to show file details. The function file.DateLastModified shows me the date with a 1 second precision (on NTFS). Is there a way to show the time stamps with a precision according to the internal storage granularity of NTFS. I'm imagining something like 8/9/2010 14:40:30,1234567 And if not with VBScript / FileSystemObject, would there be any other way?
