Functions vs OOP question

I have just started studying OOP and I am a little confused of the benefits of doing either functions or OOP. I understand OOP is much more versatile in organizing your code, but for example, I have 50 lines of code, that occur on 7/10 pages of my site. Is it better to create a file and put a function in the file, and then use an include, or do the same with a class? Furthermore, is it better, to mass classes into one file and include it? If anyone has a bit of insight that may help clear up my confusion, I would really appreciate it.
