How to apply Neural Network to time series forecasting?

I'm new to machine learning, and I have been trying to figure out how to apply neural network to time series forecasting. I have found resource related to my query, but I seem to still be a bit lost. I think a basic explanation without too much detail would help. Let's say I have some price values for each month over a few years, and I want to predict new price values. I could get a list of prices for the last few months, and then try to find similar trends in the past using K-Nearest-Neighbor. I could them use the rate of change or some other property of the past trends to try and predict new prices. How I can apply neural network to this same problem is what I am trying to find out.
