Make the hypotheses is that the person behind a curtain is a woman. We area given 2 pieces of evidence, namely: Evidence 1: We know the person has long hair (and we're told that 90% of all people with long hair are female) Evidence 2: We know the person has a rare blood type AX3 (and we're told that 80% of all people with this blood type are female) Given just Evidence 1, we can state that the person behind a curtain has a 0.9 probability value of being a woman (assuming 50:50 split between men and women). Regarding the question posed earlier in the thread, namely "Would you agree that the answer must be GREATER than 0.9?", without doing any Math, I would say intuitively, the answer must be "yes" (it is GREATER than 0.9). The logic is that Evidence 2 is supporting evidence (again, assuming a 50:50 split for the number of men and women in the world). If we were told that 50% of all people with AX3 type blood were female, then Evidence 2 would be neutral and have no bearing. But since we're told that 80% of all people with this blood type are female, Evidence 2 is supporting evidence and logically should push the final probability of a woman above 0.9. To calculate a specific probability, we can apply Bayes' rule for Evidence 1 and then use Bayesian updating to apply Evidence 2 to the new hypothesis. Suppose: A = the event that the person has long hair B = the event that the person has blood type AX3 C = the event that person is female (assume 50%) Applying Bayes rule to Evidence 1: P(C|A) = (P(A|C) * P(C)) / P(A) In this case, again if we assume 50:50 split between men and women: P(A) = (0.5 * 0.9) + (0.5 * 0.1) = 0.5 So, P(C|A) = (0.9 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.9 (Not surprising, but it would be different if we didn't have 50:50 split between men and women) Using Bayesian updating to apply Evidence 2 and plugging in 0.9 as the new prior probability, we have: P(C|A AND B) = (P(B|C) * 0.9) / P(E) Here, P(E) is the probability of Evidence 2, given the hypotheses that the person already has a 90% chance of being female. P(E) = (0.9 * 0.8) + (0.1 * 0.2) [this is law of total probability: (P(woman)*P(AX3|woman) + P(man)*P(AX3|man)] So, P(E) = 0.74 So, P(C|A AND B) = (0.8 * 0.9) / 0.74 = 0.97297
