The other answers have already given some useful hints about techniques you can consider, but nobody seems to have pointed out that your assumption is wrong: the lines shown in blue on your schematic picture are NOT local maxima of the variance. To see it, notice that the variance in direction $\mathbf{w}$ is given by $\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{w}$, where $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ denotes covariance matrix of the data. To find local maxima we need to put the derivative of this expression to zero. As $\mathbf{w}$ is constrained to have unit length, we need to add a term $\lambda(\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{w}-1)$ where $\lambda$ is a Lagrange's multiplier. Differentiating, we obtain the following equation: $$ \mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{w} - \lambda \mathbf{w} = 0.$$ This means that $\mathbf{w}$ should be an eigenvector of the covariance matrix, i.e. one of the principal vectors. In other words, PCA gives you all local maxima, there are no others.
