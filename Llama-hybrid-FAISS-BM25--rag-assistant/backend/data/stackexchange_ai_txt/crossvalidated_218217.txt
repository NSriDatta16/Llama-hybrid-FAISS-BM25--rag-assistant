Excluding a level in your categorical variable to fit your hypothesis

I have a categorical variable with 3 levels: Attention Deficit, Other Types of Deficit, No Deficit. My hypothesis is only interested in comparing Attention Deficit and Other Types Deficit using regression. Is it right to exclude the subjects with no deficit from my sample when I run the regression? Meaning I will have only one dummy coded variable in my regression?
