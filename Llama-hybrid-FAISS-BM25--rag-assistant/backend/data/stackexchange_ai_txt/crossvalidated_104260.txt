ROC and false positive rate with over sampling

I'm modelling a rare event (say 1 in 10000) and I'm using an over sampled train set to cross validate and train my model. I'm using ROC as a global performance metric but there are business reasons for which I want to be able to communicate the false positive at a certain cutoff specified by our business folks (say 0.95). Based on my over sampled train set my model produces an ROC of 0.97 (5 folds cross validation). If I look at the curve I can determine that the False Positive rate at cutoff 0.95 is 0.0003. Give that, when I score a test set and take all observations with a probability of 0.95 or greater, can I state that on average 0.0003 of those will be false positives? Or do I need to adjust 0.0003 to account for the true class distribution of my rare event?
