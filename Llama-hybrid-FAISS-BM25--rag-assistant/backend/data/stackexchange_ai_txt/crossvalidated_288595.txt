Why is this expression so common in statistics and machine learning?

I am talking about the expression $x^{T}Ax$. And, this is usually followed up mostly with some relevance to eigen values and eigen vectors. I have seen it in several problems, theoretical discussions and a whole lot of other places. Can anyone give an insightful explanation about this?
