You're using embedded fonts, and the Gotham-Book font isn't properly embedded. Gotham-Bold is, which is why only the text with the .gbold shows up. To test if this is the problem, just set "embedFonts = false" and you should see your text show up. For the font embedding problem, I wrote a long ass blog post on this not so long ago: http://divillysausages.com/blog/as3_font_embedding_masterclass I have to update it with embedding using Stylesheets in Flex, but there should be what you need in there. At the very least, there's some really useful links at the bottom of the post which will give you what you need.
