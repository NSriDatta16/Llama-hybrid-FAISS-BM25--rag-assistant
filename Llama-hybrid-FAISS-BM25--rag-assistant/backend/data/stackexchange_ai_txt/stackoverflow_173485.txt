WPF leverages XAML for the design/visual experience this is the same technology that Silverlight uses and in the future will be leveraged heavily by other aspects of .NET 4.0, specifically, WCF (web services) and WF (workflow). I would highly recommend learning it if you have the cycles, however for certification purposes it might be easier to just go ahead and do the WinForms exam as WPF is quite different and in my experience had a bit of a learning curve (because of how different it is from WinForms).
