Another way of doing parallel (multi-threaded) PL/SQL is shown here: http://www.williamrobertson.net/documents/parallel-plsql-launcher.html The disadvantage of using dbms_job or dbms_schedular is that you don't really know when your tasks are finished. I read that you don't bother but maybe you will change your mind in the future. EDIT: This article http://www.devx.com/dbzone/10MinuteSolution/20902/0/page/1 describes another way. It uses dbms_job and dbms_alert . The alerts are used to signal that the jobs are done (callback signal).
