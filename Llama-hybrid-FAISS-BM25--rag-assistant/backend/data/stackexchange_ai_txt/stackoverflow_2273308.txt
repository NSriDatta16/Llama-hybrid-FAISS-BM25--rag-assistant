Okay. I think I have nailed it with the help from you guys. Some "self-defined" facts about dialog that I know now (Please correct if I am wrong): When a is initialized as a dialog, it is removed from its original location and moved to the element in a . So it 'naturally' disappears. To select the dialog, you now need a unique identifier. It can be the id in most cases, or some other attributes on that div which makes it unique on the page. The dialog markup is created every time the dialog is initialized. So, in case of AJAX calls if an already existing dialog is initiated, you will get the popup more than once (as many times it was reinitialized). To solve this, I deleted the existing dialog markups before reintializing. I had to do this because my AJAX response may have some dialogs that need to be initiated. function InitializeConfirmationDialog() { $('div.confirmation-dialog').each(function() { var id = $(this).attr("id"); if ($('div.ui-dialog-content[id="' + id + '"]').length > 0) { $('div.ui-dialog-content[id="' + id + '"]').parents('div.ui-dialog:first').html("").remove(); } $(this).dialog({ bgiframe: true, modal: true, autoOpen: false, closeOnEscape: false, draggable: true, position: 'center', resizable: false, width: 400, height: 150 }); }); }
