Same problem here as well; have been wrestling with this off and on for over two weeks! I'm no ROR expert, but from other more knowledgeable people who found a solution, the problem seems to point the Ruby Gem for mysql which, apparently, incorrectly installs itself on the Mac. I will continue to investigate at the Ruby Forge site, and see if any Ruby Gem gurus can correct this horrible bug....I need my Rails working! Time is money! So I reported this bug over at the RubyForge Mysql developers bug tracking page . I sure hope they can help, as this is crippling my current project. And if anyone else can support my bug report over there, perhaps it will get more attention; please chime in!
