Eclipse: Make Tabs visible, Spaces invisible

Usually I'd like to edit files with Spaces only . But when I open files with Tabs , I'd like to see them (for example as arrows -> ). With such files I do my edits careful, so not to destroy the original authors coding style -- usually I insert tabs by hand when needed. So, I want to see Tabs all the time , but using the General, Editors, Text Editors, Show Whitespace Characters option, I get distracted by all the whitespace-dots. How can I reduce this distraction by Spaces, but at the same time see the Tabs? Can I change the font color for the visualized whitespaces to a brighter color? currently they are medium gray, but I can not find an option to change that. Or can I choose different setting for Tabs and for Spaces (and Paragraph signs, for that matter)? The way I used to have it in my goo' ol' editor would be: Change the background color of Tab to light-yellow (without display the -> for tabs or the dots for Spaces). This makes Tabs wuite visible, without harming my "normal" source visualization. This would be my favorite. I did that by adding the Tab to be a keyword in all languages, and then change the keyword background color to a bright yellow.
