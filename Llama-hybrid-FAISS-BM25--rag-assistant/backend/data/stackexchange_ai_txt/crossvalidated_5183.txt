If you have very little data, it is not that the distance estimate is wrong, but that your estimate is uncertain. A Bayesian approach would seek to determine the posterior distribution of the distance between the arbitrary point and the multi-variate distribution, rather than a single point estimate, and then marginalise over that posterior in reaching your conclusion. This posterior distribution reflects the uncertainty in estimating the mean and covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. I would be wary of using an informative prior. In a Bayesian analysis, the conclusions are only as strong as the prior assumtions on which they are based; if the prior is questionable - so is the posterior. Without more information about the problem it is not possible to determine if such a prior is reasonable.
