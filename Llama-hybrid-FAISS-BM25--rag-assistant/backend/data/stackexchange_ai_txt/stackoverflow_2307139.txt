I just compress my entire project into a zip whenever i reach a milestone. Then if i need to go back and reference it or run it i can just extract it and compile and i have two separate versions i can switch between. This isn't the most elegant solution but it is fairly easy to do and you can throw all your backups onto and external harddrive for safe keeping.
