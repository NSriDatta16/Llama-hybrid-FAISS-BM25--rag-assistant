From the JavaDoc: The annotation can be specified on the bean class and/or it can be specified on methods of the class that are methods of the business interface or no-interface view. Specifying the TransactionAttribute annotation on the bean class means that it applies to all applicable business methods of the class. Specifying the annotation on a method applies it to that method only. If the annotation is applied at both the class and the method level, the method value overrides if the two disagree. http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ejb/TransactionAttribute.html I also recommend reading the Java EE Tutorial: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bncih.html
