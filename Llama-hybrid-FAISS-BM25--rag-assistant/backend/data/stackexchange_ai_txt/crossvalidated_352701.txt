Not long ago, I had an interview task for a data science position. I was given a data set and asked to build a predictive model to predict a certain binary variable given the others, with a time limit of a few hours. I went through each of the variables in turn, graphing them, calculating summary statistics etc. I also calculated correlations between the numerical variables. Among the things I found were: One categorical variable almost perfectly matched the target. Two or three variables had over half of their values missing. A couple of variables had extreme outliers. Two of the numerical variables were perfectly correlated. etc. My point is that these were things which had been put in deliberately to see whether people would notice them before trying to build a model. The company put them in because they are the sort of thing which can happen in real life, and drastically affect model performance. So yes, EDA is important when doing machine learning!
