I currently run things as Shiraz describes. I have a ServiceCaller class and a Call method which wraps a delegate that is the actual call on the service. Before invoking the delegate, I can do some other things as well as wrap it in a try catch and centralise the error handling. http://www.lukepuplett.com/2010/07/adding-useragent-to-wcf-clients.html In the future I plan to use NLB or MSMQ. Why? Well, failover is very closely related to load balancing, and so I'd start with NLB. Try these articles; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730128.aspx http://www.devproconnections.com/print/net-framework2/load-balancing-and-scaling-your-wcf-services.aspx Good luck, let us know how you get on.
