I believe the answer to this question can be expressed in more elemental terms. Beginning with the formula for the sample standard deviation $$ s_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \overline{x})^2} }{n - 1}}, $$ I want to draw your attention to the expression $(x_i - \overline{x})$ in the numerator. Ignore the summation notation for the purposes of this answer. Note, we decrement the sample mean (i.e., $\overline{x}$ ) from each realization of $x_{i}$ . If we were to increase or decrease each $x_{i}$ by the same amount, the mean will change. However, the distance of each realization of $x_{i}$ from that central tendency remains the same . In other words, each deviation from the mean is the same. Subtracting each $x_{i}$ from a constant (e.g., $100 - x_{i}$ ) flips the vector of values to its mirror image, then slides it along the number line by a constant amount. Suppose the first realization of $x_{1}$ = 20 and $\overline{x}$ = 4. In keeping with the foregoing expression, $$ (20 - 4) = 16, $$ which is the deviation from the sample mean. Now, assume we don't move along the number line just yet and we simply put a negative sign in front of each $x_{i}$ , such that we have $-(x_{i})$ ; this flips the sign of the mean as well. The first realization, $x_{1}$ , is now $-20$ . Again, substituting $-20$ into the expression, $$ (-20-(-4)) =-16, $$ which is the same number of units away from the mean. Note, squared deviations result in a positive number, so the numerator remains the same. You can run this code in R which builds upon @knrumsey's insightful response, but breaks it down further: x The first row of plots shows how the realizations translate when we negate each $x_{i}$ . The second row shows what happens when each $x_{i}$ is subtracted from 100; the translation first flips then slides across the number line. The spread of the distribution is unaffected by this.
