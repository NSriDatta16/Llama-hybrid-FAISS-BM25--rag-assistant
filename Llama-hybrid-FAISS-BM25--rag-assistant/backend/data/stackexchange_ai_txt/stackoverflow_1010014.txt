eclipse can help you organize imports for a project. go to source/clean up.. and then use the configure button. this will bring up a filtered preferences dialog. click on enable project specific settings and then the edit button. change the profile name on top to something descriptive like 'organize imports' and then go to the code organizing tab. choose the organize imports checkbox. you can go through the rest of the tabs and deselect the other options. once you save all of that, go back out to the clean up... dialog and click finish . edit: if you are using the eclipse route, dont forget that you can order your imports (com before org,etc) if you'd like, as well as setting the 'Number of imports before needing .*' property.
