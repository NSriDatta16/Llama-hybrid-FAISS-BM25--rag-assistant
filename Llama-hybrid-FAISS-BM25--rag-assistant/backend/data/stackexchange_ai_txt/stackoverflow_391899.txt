Create an __init__.py file in your projects folder, and it will be treated like a module by Python. Classes in your package directory can then be imported using syntax like: from package import class import package.class Within __init__.py , you may create an __all__ array that defines from package import * behavior: # name1 and name2 will be available in calling module's namespace # when using "from package import *" syntax __all__ = ['name1', 'name2'] And here is way more information than you even want to know about packages in Python Generally speaking, a good way to learn about how to organize a lot of code is to pick a popular Python package and see how they did it. I'd check out Django and Twisted , for starters.
