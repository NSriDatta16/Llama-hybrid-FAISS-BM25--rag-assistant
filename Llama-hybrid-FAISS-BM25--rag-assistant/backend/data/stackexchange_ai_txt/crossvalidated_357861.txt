Test to detect trend in time series data

I have time series data for a 3 month period and need to determine the presence of any statistical trend over time. I thought about dividing the data by month and then testing the hypothesis H0: av.M1=av.M2=av.M3 is this a valid test to determine the presence of a trend? y-axis would be price and x-axis time so i cannot examine a beta coefficient. Are there any statistical tests to determine a lack of trend in time series data (constant prices over time in this context)?
