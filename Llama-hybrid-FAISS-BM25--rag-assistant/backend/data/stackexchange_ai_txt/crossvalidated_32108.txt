I can give a partial solution and show an answer for your second paragraph third question, relating to whether the new data is correlated. The short answer is no, the data in the new space is not correlated. To see, consider $w_1$ and $w_2$ as two unique principle components. Then $Xw_1$ and $Xw_2$ are two dimensions in the new space of the data, $X$. $$ {\rm Cov}( Xw_1, Xw_2 ) = E[ (Xw_1)^T(Xw_2) ] - E[Xw_1]^TE[Xw_2] $$ As $w_i$ are constant, the second term is 0 (as you said we demean $X$ prior). The first term can be rewritten as $$ w_1^TE[X^TX]w_2 = {\rm Var}(X)w_1^Tw_2 = 0$$ as $w_i$ are orthonormal to each other, so the whole term is zero, assuming $Var(X)$ is finite. This was all independent of any assumption about normality. I think the reliance on normality boils down to the whole debate over variance. Here's a intuitive argument: First, note that variance is a really good measure of "spread" for symmetric distributions. But it can fail when we consider skewed or asymmetric distributions. Now recall that PCA tries to maximize the variance in the projected dimension. If $X$ is normal, then $Xw$ is still normal, i.e. still symmetric and variance works well. But if $X$ is not normal, like Poisson, the variance of $Xw$ need not be very descriptive. To give an example where variance (and standard deviation) break down, consider the pareto distribution . The variance drops quickly as $\alpha$ grows, but only because the data starts to group around the small mean. But we know that we can easily see large swings with the pareto distribution, something that a small variance would not describe well.
