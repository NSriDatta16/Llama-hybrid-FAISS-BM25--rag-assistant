Subjects in machine learning

I'm in the second year of my mechanical engineering bachelor and I've recently started exploring the field of machine learning online. My question is this: which specific subjects do people learn, and in what order, when they study machine learning in college? Also, which books would you recommend? I'm NOT asking which online courses to take, I just want to know which SUBJECTS you were taught in college. For example, I've been doing a lot of reading lately, and it was only yesterday that I came across discriminative/generative networks, yet it seems important to me. I'm nearly done with prof. Andrew Ng's course on Coursera, but I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of details and concepts. I'd like to hear which subjects you studied (and perhaps in what order).
