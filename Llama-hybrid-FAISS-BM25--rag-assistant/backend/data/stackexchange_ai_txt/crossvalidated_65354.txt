It sounds like you are looking for something quite pragmatic to help analysts who probably aren't professional statisticians and need something to prompt them into doing what should be standard exploratory techniques such as looking at qq plots, density plots, etc. In which case why not simply do a normality test (Shapiro-Wilk or whatever) on the original data, and one on the log transformed data, and if the second p value is higher raise a flag for the analyst to consider using a log transform? As a bonus, spit out a 2 x 2 graphic of the density line plot and qqnorm plot of the raw and the transformed data. This won't technically answer your question about the relative likelihood but I wonder if it is all that you need.
