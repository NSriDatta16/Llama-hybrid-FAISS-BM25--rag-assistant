Pickle is not the best method for storing large amounts of similar data. It can be slow for large data sets, and more importantly, it is very fragile: changing around your source can easily break all existing datasets. (I would recommend reading what pickle at its heart actually is: a bunch of bytecode expressions. It will frighten you into considering other means of data storage/retrieval.) You should look into using PyTables , which uses HDF5 (cross-platform and everything) to store arbitrarily large amounts of data. You don't even have to load everything off of a file into memory at once; you can access it piecewise. The structure you're describing sounds like it would fit very well into a "table" object, which has a set field structure (comprised of fixed-length strings, integers, small Numpy arrays, etc.) and can hold large amounts very efficiently. For storing metadata, I'd recommend using the ._v_attrs attribute of your tables.
