Is qooxdoo a good choice for this use case?

I would like to take a simple web page, and allow non-technie administrators to modify content simply by logging in, browsing to the page that is to be changed, and clicking on text to change things, or drag simple lists to re-order them. My question is whether qooxdoo would be a good choice for this use case. I would want the text to display as it normally does, with magic htmlarea appearing on click, and similar features that don't disturb the visual layout.
