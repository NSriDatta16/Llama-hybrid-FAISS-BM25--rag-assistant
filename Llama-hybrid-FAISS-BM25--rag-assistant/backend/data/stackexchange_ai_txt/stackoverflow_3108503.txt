I am using PHP and I am looking to create links within my text to other sections of the site so for example: I fell into the media industry aged 30, when David Mansfield, now on the board of Ingenious Media, gave me my first break at Thames TV. From there, I worked at the (now-defunct) Sunday Correspondent and IPC, before joining TDI, which became Viacom and then CBS Outdoor. After 12 years in outdoor, I spent a year out doing overseas outdoor consultancy work in Russia, Dubai and Spain, as well as launching the media CRM business, Media By Permission. I have been lucky enough to work across a range of media, but outdoor would definitely be my specialist subject on 'Mastermind'. I would want to link Ingenious Media To a page all about Ingenious Media but I would also like to link all mentions of Media to a media related page. Obviously I don't want to link the word Media inside Ingenious Media How could I go about doing this without double linking some words? Thanks in advance
