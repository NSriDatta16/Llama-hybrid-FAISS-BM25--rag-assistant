Ummm... SVM is a linear model, so if you average the predictions of several models with different regularization, what you get is the same result of another model which uses a different regularization. Regarding the intent behind your question: there's more methods than SVM and SVDD. You can check the PyOD package for ensemble models for outlier detection.
