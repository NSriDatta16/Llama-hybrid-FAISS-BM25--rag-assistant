Generally speaking, models that answers scenarios are not 100% reliable, is it your case? In that case, one good solution is to have a training data set, in which you know the best values the model has to reach. In your decision tree, you set random weights that you can modify through the training process (thousands of iterations), until reaching optimal values that would reach the maximum score possible. An even better option is to use a random forest classification because all scenarios would be explored thoroughly, even the ones that you couldn't have prepared. However, exploring many scenarios could require a lot of processing: in this case, it is possible to start with a small set of data and models to see if this solution works well. https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashant111/random-forest-classifier-tutorial/notebook
