Mixed-effects logistic regression is an extension of the simple logistic regression model used in the context of grouped/clustered data. Two typical examples of such data are, (i) longitudinal data in which you measure the same dichotomous outcome over time for some subjects, and (ii) multilevel data in which sample units are organized is some nested or crossed levels; for example, students within the same class, classes within the same school, schools within the same district. The challenge with such grouped/clustered data is that measurements coming from the same group are often correlated. Mixed-effects logistic regression is used for such data to account for these correlations. On the contrary, the simple logistic regression model assumes that all observations are independent.
