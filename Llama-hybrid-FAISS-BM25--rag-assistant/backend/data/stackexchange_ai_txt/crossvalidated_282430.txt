Best way (program/statistical DSL/library) to curve fit data containing multiple y-values for some x-values

My data is as follows: X1 Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 Y6 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.33333 - 1.22222 - 1.2 2 - 1.90909 2 - 1.8 3 - - 2.6 - 2.2 4 2 - 3.51111 2.1 3.2 5 - - 4 - 4.6 6 2.33333 3.09091 5.28889 2.9 5.6 7 2.53333 2.81818 5.37778 3 5.8 8 2.23333 3.27273 - 3.2 6.4 9 2.56666 4 - 4.1 8.4 I currently have the above data. As you can see I have multiple Y values for some X values. This is because each Y column represents data from a different source. What I want is for a program (like SciDavis, which I am currently using) to curve fit a function to all of this data, not just one X-Y column combination like SciDavis is doing when I (in other words I want to see a nice curve in between the light blue and the red/dark blue graphs, an average curve so the speak). I have tried numerous search terms to find a way to do this in SciDavis, and to find other programs to do this, but to no avail. I am hoping that someone experienced in this can give me a good suggestion for a program that can do this (or a domain specific programming language/statistical package combined with a library if need be. I can program as well, in fact I am trying to find a function that I can use as a part of a model that I will be using in a simulation that I am coding)
