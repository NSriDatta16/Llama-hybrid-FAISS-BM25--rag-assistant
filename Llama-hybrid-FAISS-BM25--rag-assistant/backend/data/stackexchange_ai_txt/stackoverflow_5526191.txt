There is no dedicated tool for migrating an on premise organization to Dynamics CRM Online. The first step of such a migration would be an upgrade of your local system to Dynamics CRM 2011. This ensures that you are on the same customization level. For the migration itself, you could use for example Scribe or you could script it by yourself. This should be rather "easy" as you only have to transfer the data. The data structure itself, remains the same.
