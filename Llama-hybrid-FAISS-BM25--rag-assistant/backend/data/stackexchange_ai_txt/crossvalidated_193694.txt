The setup: Fill one envelope with some amount, then pair that envelope with each of two other envelopes, one having half and the other twice the amount of the first envelope. I’ll call the amount put into the first envelope the “starting amount.” Using this method, there are 2 ways to proceed: 1) Pick starting amounts from a finite range. In this case, a possible starting amount X will be separately paired with 2X and .5X. For each pair of envelopes, the player will have an equal chance of choosing either the larger or smaller amount. That means that, on average, the player will choose the larger amount half the time and the smaller amount half the time from every combination of amounts. Consequently, by trading every time, the player will win, on average, the same amount that is lost for each pair. So, trading every time doesn’t improve the odds of increasing your money. This seems counterintuitive when thinking about an actual amount like 20D because it will likely be traded half the time for 10D and half the time for 40D, so on average the player will make money when she sees 20D. In fact, the player will never lose money, and will usually win money, by trading any amount equal to or less than the highest starting amount. That’s because, on average, the player will make twice the amount once but often lose only half the amount once, and at most twice. However, for amounts that are greater than the starting amounts, the player will always lose when trading every time . For example, suppose I use starting amounts of 10, 20, 30, and 40 dollars. Some envelopes will contain 5 (half of 10), 15 (half of 30), 60 (twice 30), and 80 (twice 40) dollars. If I always trade, I will always lose when I choose a 60 or 80-dollar envelope because neither is paired with twice its amount, and I will always win when choosing a 5, 10, or 15-dollar envelope because none of these is paired with half their amounts. For the 20D and 40D amounts, I will win twice the amount half the time and lose half the time half the time for an overall gain. For the 30D amount, I’ll trade for 60D once and for 30D twice on average and will, therefore, break even. On average, the total losses and total gains are equal , which must be true because of the logic of the preceding paragraph. Thus, trading every time confers no advantage. Notice that the logic that leads to the conclusion that trading every time is beneficial, which is, “I’ll win twice the amount half the time and lose only half the amount half the time if I always trade” is incorrect because I’ll never win twice the amount of any amount larger than the largest starting amount . Just for fun, I did this on a spreadsheet and saw the results for starting amounts 10-50 by 10D increments. Each envelope contained one of these amounts: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 dollars. The 60, 80, and 100-dollar envelopes lost money when traded, as expected. All the rest except for 40D made money on average. The 40D amount broke even. Of course, the overall amount gained by always trading was zero. This logic must hold true for any combination of amounts chosen because of the logic of the paragraph 1) above. Here are several somewhat random pairings of amounts: 10-20, 10-20, 10-20, 20-40, 30-60, 50-100. I will randomly pick each listed amount once and always trade. That is, I’ll pick 10 3x’s and earn 30, pick 20 4x’s and lose 10, 30 1x and earn 30, 40 1x and lose 20, 50 1x and win 50, 60 1x and lose 30, and 100 1x and lose 50. That totals 30-10+30-20+50-30-50=0. Notice that if you correctly guess the range of starting values used, you can then correctly decide whether or not to trade. For instance, you might correctly guess that the person doing the game will use values up to 20D or more. If you then see 4D, then each possible pair of amounts [(2D and 4D) or (4D and 8D)] will be equally likely, in which case you should trade. I think that this fact contributes to the confusion of the paradox. Upon seeing 20D, it is natural to think that it is in the range of starting amounts, in which case always trading will increase the chance of winning. As I mentioned above, this thinking leads directly to the faulty reasoning that 20D will always be in the range of starting amounts, and thus to the faulty conclusion that trading every time will increase the chance of winning more money. Conversely, if you think that the chance of twice the amount you see being included in the game is less than 50%, then you should not trade. In other words, if you do this with a person you know, and you choose an envelope with 40D, you might think to yourself, “she would not likely put 80D into an envelope for this game, so I won’t trade.” If you’re right more than half the time, you’ll win money. This logic counteracts the logic of the last paragraph that suggests that trading every time will be beneficial. 2) Pick starting amounts from an infinite range. Using this method, it is difficult to know exactly how the game is actually played. How is a number randomly chosen from an infinite set of numbers? I don’t know. How likely is it that some particular number is chosen? That probability is zero. These difficulties make the problem impossible for me to fully conceptualize. However, when I try to conceptualize the problem, it goes something like this: I choose an envelope and it has 2^50D. I trade and get half the amount. I’m losing. Suppose the next envelope I choose has 2^100D. I trade and get the larger amount. Now I’m winning. The next envelope contains 2^150D. I trade and get the smaller amount. I’m losing again. That process goes on indefinitely, and I can never know whether I’ll win or lose because each subsequent envelope can decide my entire fate.
