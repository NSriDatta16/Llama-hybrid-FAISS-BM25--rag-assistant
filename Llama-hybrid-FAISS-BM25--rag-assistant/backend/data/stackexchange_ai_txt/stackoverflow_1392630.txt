I believe that the temporary black background is a WPF issue related to the fact that WPF uses DirectX as rendering mechanism, and when you resize the windows it has to synchronize drawing with the windowing system. This may also explain why the button is misplaced in relation to the window while dragging the window border. Drawing the non-client area of the window is much slower than drawing what's inside the window, and if you move the mouse fast on a slow computer the discrepancies between the border end the internals of the window will probably be more noticeable. Supposedly this only happens on Vista with Aero enabled, and it should have been fixed in Vista SP1. However, I just tested on SP2, and I did still see a little bit of black background, but only when Aero was enabled. My graphics card is pretty fast so it was hardly noticeable. If my analysis is correct the only way you can fix your problem is to getter a faster graphics card or turn off Aero.
