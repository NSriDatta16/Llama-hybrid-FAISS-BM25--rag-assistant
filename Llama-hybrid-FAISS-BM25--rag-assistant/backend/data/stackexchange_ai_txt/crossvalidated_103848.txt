Some very good books: "Statistics for Experimenters: Design, Innovation, and Discovery , 2nd Edition" by Box, Hunter & Hunter. This is formally an introductory text (more for chemistry & engineering people) but extremely good on the applied side. "Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models" by Andrew Gelman & Jennifer Hill. Very good on application of regression modelling. "The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition" (Springer Series in Statistics) 2nd (2009) Corrected Edition by Hastie Trevor, Tibshirani Robert & Friedman Jerome. More theoretical than the two first in my list, but also extremely good on the whys and ifs of applications. -- PDF Released Version "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (Springer Series in Statistics) 6th (2015) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani -- PDF Released Version Working your way through these three books should give a very good basis for applications.
