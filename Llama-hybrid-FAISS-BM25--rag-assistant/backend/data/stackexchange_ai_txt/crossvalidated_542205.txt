Efficiently find the group with largest effect on standard deviation

I have some "groups" of measurements with varying numbers of items, for example: Group 1: { 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.1 } Group 2: { 2 } Group 3: { 2.1, 1.2 } etc ... (Any single item within a group I'll refer to as a measurement ). I'd like to find the group with the largest adverse effect on the standard deviation of all the measurements. My current approach is the following: Find the standard deviation of all measurements Remove a single group Find standard deviation with all measurements except those in the removed group Return the removed group Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each group Report the removal that caused largest reduction to the standard deviation This approach works for what I'm doing, but it's very computationally expensive. I'd like to know if there is a more efficient way of calculating which group will have the largest adverse effect. My first guess is maybe a weighted average would work, but I don't have a ton of faith in my guess. EDIT: Second, more educated guess (based on the actual formula for standard deviation): For each group: Sum of (measurement - mean_of_all)^2
