I haven't seen an answer include Eric Sink's Source Control HOWTO , but it's a valuable reference. I haven't seen any formal white papers on version control, but I'm not sure the argument about "validity" is your strongest one. The problems you describe in your question indicate some pretty serious drawbacks with the current approach. If "the powers that be" in your environment aren't convinced by that, change the argument entirely. If you make it a question of quality control, and point to continuous integration as a practice that encourages it, then the zip file approach to version control isn't a "not fully valid form of version control", but an obstacle to implementing continuous integration as a practice. Your question doesn't indicate whether or not the end product "under control" is tested in any automated fashion (in addition to being reviewed). If the process you describe would prevent that from taking place as well, certainly add that to your argument too.
