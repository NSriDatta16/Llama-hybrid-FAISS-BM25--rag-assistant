Regular Expression to Extract HTML Body Content

I am looking for a regex statement that will let me extract the HTML content from just between the body tags from a XHTML document. The XHTML that I need to parse will be very simple files, I do not have to worry about JavaScript content or tags, for example. Below is the expected structure of the HTML file is that I have to parse. Since I know exactly all of the content of the HTML files that I am going to have to work with, this HTML snippet pretty much covers my entire use case. If I can get a regex to extract the body of this example, I'll be happy. Example paragraph content &nbsp; &nbsp; Header 1 Conceptually, I've been trying to build a regex string that matches everything BUT the inner body content. With this, I would use the C# Regex.Split() method to obtain the body content. I thought this regex: ((.|\n)* )|(( (*|\n)*) ...would do the trick, but it doesn't seem to work at all with my test content in RegexBuddy.
