This really depends on how the company views its paid API and associated charges - as a product in itself, or as a way to recover costs of providing the API. If it's a product in itself, it's just like pricing any other product (e.g. charge what the market will pay, etc.) There's no formula - it really depends on what you're selling through the API. If it's just a way to do cost recovery (e.g. of running the API servers), you determine the average relative costs to you of each call. For example, if you know that a certain call would usually consume 10 times the CPU resources of another call, and if you know that CPU utilization is the bottleneck in your system (i.e. the thing that may force you to buy more servers), you price that call at 10 times the other call.
