pub/sub nservicebus beginner

I am trying to get a simple NServiceBus pub/sub working. Here is what I am trying to do. I am trying to read a message from msmq, and pub publishes the messages to sub, and the sub will insert the messages to sub's queue. (right now, there are all on same computer). I have a pub and a sub (there are Written as console apps). I also have a Message class, and here it is. [Serializable] public class Message : IEvent { public string name { get; set; } } public interface IEvent : IMessage { string name { get; set; } } And, this is my pub IBus bus = NServiceBus.Configure.With() .DefaultBuilder() .XmlSerializer() .MsmqTransport() .IsTransactional(true) .PurgeOnStartup(false) .UnicastBus() .ImpersonateSender(false) .MsmqSubscriptionStorage() .CreateBus(). Start(); sub looks same execpt that it has .LoadMessageHandlers(). I understand that you have to handle the message, where do you put the Handle() on sub side? I want to read them and put them into sub's queue. Thanks.
