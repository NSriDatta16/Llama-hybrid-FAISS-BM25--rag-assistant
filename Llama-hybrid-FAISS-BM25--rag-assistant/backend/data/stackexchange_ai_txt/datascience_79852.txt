Getting 0 accuracy and NaN mae for all epochs training my NN

Background: I made a simple game using python library 'Turtle' in which there is a long plank with a ball balanced on top of it. I can press right or left arrow keys to rotate the plank (either clockwise or anticlockwise) which makes the ball roll to the either side. Issue: I wanted to train a neural network to make this whole process automated(to balance the ball on plank). So I myself played the game and recorded the states(conditions) and my corresponding actions(buttons pressed) for a period of 2 minutes in the form of a csv. At the end, I got a dataset of 1300 conditions( eg. velocity of ball, direction of velocity, inclination of plank, etc) and the corresponding 1300 actions i took to balance the ball on the plank. Now when I try to train my neural network on this data, I get 0 accuracy and 'nan' mae for all the epochs. How do I resolve this? I've attached the code below #all necessary imports df=pd.read_csv('train.txt') model= Sequential([ Dense(units=16,activation='relu',input_shape=(5,)), Dense(units=32,activation='relu'), Dense(units=10,activation='relu'), Dense(units=1,activation='softmax') ]) model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001),loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',metrics=['accuracy','mae']) X_train=df[['x','y','theta','u','v']] Y_train=df['action'] X_train= X_train.astype('float32')/10 Y_train= Y_train.astype('float32')/10 model.fit(X_train,Y_train,batch_size=40,epochs=20) And this is what I'm getting for all the epochs : loss: nan - accuracy: 0.0000e+00 - mae: nan
