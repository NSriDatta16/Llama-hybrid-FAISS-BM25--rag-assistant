Which version of Rails are you using? You might want to upgrade, if your on an older version. (the .rxml extension is old afaik) That looks like a bug to me. I remember having similar problems two years back (IE says it accepts XLS, but it doesn't mention HTML). I believe it was fixed in recent versions. I used to work around it by modifying the HTTP_ACCEPT header for IE. (digs up some old code) request.env["HTTP_ACCEPT"] = "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8" if request.env["HTTP_USER_AGENT"].include?('MSIE') But I wouldn't recommend doing something like this before you tried the more sane options.
