Statistical Model for multivariate timeseries

I'm new to timeseries prediction and I would like to try several classical methods before getting into more complicated model. Concretely, I have a multivariate timeseries of 552 datapoints. Each datapoint is a vector of 4223 entries. I found in statmodels several multivariate models including VARMAX and Dynamic Factor. My questions are: Are they good models for multivariate timeseries forecasting? Are the better models? (not deep learning, please) Can I use SARIMAX model for multivariate forecasting? I've tried the VARMAX model with my data but it doesn't work. Following is the code: # vector moving average model (VMA) mod = sm.tsa.VARMAX(x_train_no2, order=(0,2), error_cov_type='diagonal') res = mod.fit(maxiter=1000, disp=False) print(res.summary()) # # VARMA # mod = sm.tsa.VARMAX(x_train_no2, order=(1,1), enforce_stationarity=False) # res = mod.fit(maxiter=1000, disp=False) # print(res.summary()) The fitting throws the error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "test_varmax.py", line 62, in res = mod.fit(maxiter=1000, disp=False) File "/home/tiendh/deeplearning_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/statsmodels/tsa/statespace/mlemodel.py", line 432, in fit start_params = self.start_params File "/home/tiendh/deeplearning_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/statsmodels/tsa/statespace/varmax.py", line 358, in start_params raise ValueError('Non-invertible starting moving-average' ValueError: Non-invertible starting moving-average parameters found with `enforce_stationarity` set to True. I tried to set enforce_stationarity=False but nothing changes. One reason I can think about is the sparsity of my data. For one datapoint (4223 dimensions), there are just several values and the rest is zero, but I'm not sure. Could you please give some suggestions? Thanks.
