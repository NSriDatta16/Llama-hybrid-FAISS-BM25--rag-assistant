Write Oracle Procedure To Accept List of Items used in Select

There have been a couple of hints that seem to have gotten me close here, but with some unique issues, I'm hoping this question is distinguishing enough to merit its own posting. For starters here's what I have. I have an Oracle procedure that returns a standard REF CURSOR , and this REF CURSOR is passed back to my application. The REF CURSOR is a list of lookup IDs. I then want to take this list and bring it to another data store and use it in a select statement. It will absolutely be possible to accomplish this by looping through the REF CURSOR, but I'm hoping to avoid that. I would much rather be able to write a SELECT...WHERE lookup_id IN result_ref_cursor OR SELECT...WHERE EXISTS... First is this possible or should I just try a less than elegant solution? If it is possible, any hints as to where I should get started looking? I'm relatively new to Oracle, but fairly experienced in RDBMs in general, so feel free to just through some links at me and I can study up. Much appreciated
