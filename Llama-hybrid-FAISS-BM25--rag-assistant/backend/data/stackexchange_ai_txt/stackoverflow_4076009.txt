Regex filtering Japanese

I want to allow A-Z, a-z, and Japanese kanji, hiragana, and katakana and nothing else. So far I've come up with this: $pattern = '/[^\w\x{3041}-\x{3094}\x{30A1}-\x{30fA}\x{30fC}\x{4E00}-\x{9FFF}_\-]+/u'; preg_replace($pattern, '', $string); I'm not sure if this form of regex is PHP specific. I'm accepting a string in the URL and want to filter out quotes and other "dangerous" characters. The odd thing about the above "pattern" is that with or without "d", digits are not matched. So the following does the same thing: $pattern = '/[^\d\w\x{3041}-\x{3094}\x{30A1}-\x{30fA}\x{30fC}\x{4E00}-\x{9FFF}_\-]+/u'; I'm interested in any improvements or corrections - not being a regex wizard myself.
