What does it call in GWT to make 2 UI consistent?

I saw a video of Google I/O and found an example of GWT UI being very consistent between clients. Which you can save, add, drag and drop in almost real time between clients. I currently don't understand the basic of this (In GWT, i think it implement Comet), so is there anyone can give me a term or definition for this? so I can get it on Google for more information? Thank you very much
