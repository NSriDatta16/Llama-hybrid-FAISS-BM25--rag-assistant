I wouldn't underestimate the value of embedding one of them in a large application. I've used Ruby's meta-programming capabilities to modify an app's internals on the fly to hook into things it would usually be difficult to access (this is especially true for events; I can easily add a temporary external hook to manually raise an event for testing instead of actually modifying and recompiling the C# source). This has let me hunt down bugs and reproduce tricky scenarios more easily. It has also let me prototype various code that I would later make into a unit test or new classes. In addition, it can be useful for QA manual testers. Common tasks can be incorporated into automated scripts they can run.
