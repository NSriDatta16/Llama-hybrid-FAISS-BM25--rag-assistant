The f1-score gives you the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The scores corresponding to every class will tell you the accuracy of the classifier in classifying the data points in that particular class compared to all other classes. The support is the number of samples of the true response that lie in that class. You can find documentation on both measures in the sklearn documentation. Support - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_fscore_support.html F1-score - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html EDIT The last line gives a weighted average of precision, recall and f1-score where the weights are the support values. so for precision the avg is (0.50*1 + 0.0*1 + 1.0*3)/5 = 0.70 . The total is just for total support which is 5 here.
