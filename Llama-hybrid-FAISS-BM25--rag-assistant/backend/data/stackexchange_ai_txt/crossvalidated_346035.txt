Cross product of two vectors of unequal length

I am trying to teach myself Bayesian statistics using the book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis by John Kruschke. In the chapter on categorical variables in generalized linear models, the author explains that we get the interaction coefficient by multiplying the two coefficient vectors that pertain to predictor variables in the model. He then proceeds to combine the vectors (-1,1) and (3,-2,-1) into a vector (-1,+2,-1, 1, -2, 1). I suppose this is a 'cross product' as opposed to a 'dot' product, but I really have no idea how it came to be. Could anybody explain to me on how such a combination happened? If it helps, here is a link to the book . If the link doesn't work, please see the following pictures: So, in summary, I am interested in how was the cross product of the vectors $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ created.
