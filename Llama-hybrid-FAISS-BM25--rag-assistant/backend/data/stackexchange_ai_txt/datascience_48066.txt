Normal distribution instead of Logistic distribution for classification

Logistic regression, based on the logistic function $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-x)}$ , can be seen as a hypothesis testing problem. Where the reference distribution is the standard Logistic distribution where the p.m.f is $f(x) = \frac{\exp(-x)}{[1 + \exp(-x)]^2}$ and the c.d.f is $F(x) = \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-x)}$ The hypothesis to test is $H_0: x \text{ isn't positive} \hspace{2.0cm} H_1: x \text{ is positive}$ The test statistic is $F(x)$ . We reject $H_0$ if $F(x) \geq \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is the level of significance (in terms of hypothesis testing) or classification threshold (in terms of classification problem) My question is that why they don't come up with the Standard normal distribution, which truly reflects the "distribution of nature", instead of Logistic distribution ?
