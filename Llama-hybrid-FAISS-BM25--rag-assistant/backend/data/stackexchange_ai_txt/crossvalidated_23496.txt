Based on Andrew Ng's ml-class.org and Tom Mitchell's "Machine Learning" book I think they will be called Training example Feature value Training set Output/target variable But naming will depend on the algorithm, I believe. Say, if you use Decision Trees then your training examples would become instances and your features would become attributes .
