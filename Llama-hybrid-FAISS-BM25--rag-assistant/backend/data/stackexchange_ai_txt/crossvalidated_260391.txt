Probabilistic vs. other approaches to machine learning

I'm taking a grad course on machine learning in the ECE department of my university. On the first lecture my professor seemed to make it a point to stress the fact that the course would be taking a probabilistic approach to machine learning. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that I think back on it, what does this really mean? What other approaches are there to machine learning that I can contrast this against?
