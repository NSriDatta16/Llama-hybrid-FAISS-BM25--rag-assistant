https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/249520/7828 is an excellent general answer. I'd like to focus a bit more on your problem. You apparently want to see how your samples relate with respect to your 7 input variables. That is something t-SNE doesn't do. The idea of SNE and t-SNE is to place neighbors close to each other, (almost) completly ignoring the global structure. This is excellent for visualization, because similar items can be plotted next to each other (and not on top of each other, c.f. crowding). This is not good for further analysis. Global structure is lost, some objects may have been blocked from moving to their neighbors, and separation between different groups is not preserved quantitatively. Which is largely why e.g. clustering on the projection usually does not work very well. PCA is quite the opposite. It tries to preserve the global properties (eigenvectors with high variance) while it may lose low-variance deviations between neighbors.
