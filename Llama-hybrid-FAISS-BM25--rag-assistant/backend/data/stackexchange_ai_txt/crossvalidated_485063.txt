Finding correlation between binary and numerical variable in Python

I need to investigate the correlation between a numerical (integers, probably not normally distributed) and a binary (1,0) IV in Python. The dataset has 200 samples and we cannot count on the distribution of the numerical IV to be normal. I googled and found out that maybe a logistic regression would be good choice, but I am not interested in predictions, only in the "correlation" and I couldn't find out how to extract this information from a Log. regression. I was considering also the Point Biserial correlation but that assumes normal distribution of the continuous IV (which I can't guarantee and I suppose it is not). Anyway I tried scipy's pointbiserialr but the output of that function includes a p-value. An example output I got is PointbiserialrResult(correlation=0.12455029647882072, pvalue=0.07099850817142403) but I don't know how to interpret said p-value (what does it say or to what Null hypothesis is it related?). What would be the best way to reason about a correlation in this situation and if for example that point biserial approach is correct, how could I interpret the result?
