Yes $g(\mu)=X\beta$ holds regardless of what $g$ is, because that is what you are postulating as the model. You call it the canonical link when $g$ is the mean-canonical parameter transformation of the exponential family (you are also postulating the family). There are nice properties associated with the canonical link, like that the family parametrized by $\beta$ is also an exponential family. By contrast, if you use something like the identity link $\mu=X\beta$, you will usually have a curved exponential family (exception is when you're in a gaussian family). The most common non-canonical link in my experience is the probit link. Instead of using the inverse of a logistic variable CDF as in usual logistic regression, you use the inverse of a normal CDF. That said, I seem to remember most of the asymptotic theory working out the same with reasonable non-canonical links (McCullagh & Nelder is the reference I learned glm's from).
