You can model your longitudinal with standard machine learning methods by just adding features, that represent the longitudinality, e.g. by adding a feature that represents the time. Or a feature that indicates the membership to a group, person etc (in the panel data case). If you are creative with feature creation/extraction you can model anything with ML-algorithms.
