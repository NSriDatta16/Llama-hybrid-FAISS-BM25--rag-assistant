How to optimize the data model for an event calendar?

I'm building an event calendar. The basic functionnality is like this: There are 3 states for each day, "available", "unavailable" and "confirmation needed". Each day can be set to a single state (i.e., an event). Each event can be set to be recurring either weekly or monthly, or not at all. Each calendar is specific for an object (each object has its own calendar). The calendars don't have an "end date": there can be an event at any given date in the future. The data model I imagined was this: Table: Calendar id user_id Table: Status id label Table: Event id calendar_id start_date status_id recurring -- enum type: NULL, W, or M for weekly or monthly This seems to be a fairly elegant way to store the data, but I'm worried about retrieval: it would be fairly complicated to get the status for a given day. Is there a better or standard way to do this ?
