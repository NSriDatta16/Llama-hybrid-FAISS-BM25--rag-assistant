How to re-translate a forecast I wrote in R run on a dataset I downloaded from Tableau back into a SCRIPT_REAL function in Tableau

I want to add a SARIMA forecast of the next two days onto each line in the following Tableau graph: But Tableau only does Exponential Smoothing forecasts and if I create a moving average table calculation, then I can't add a forecast on to that, so I downloaded the data from this graph into Excel, cleaned it up a tiny bit, loaded it into R, then wrote the following code which works to create SARIMA forecasts (after converting that Excel file I created by clicking Worksheet+Export+Crosstab to Excel to a csv file named ts_flights): ts_flights $Date Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y") TS_flights All of the above creates a 2-day SARIMA forecast using the prior 7 days, so: > sarima_forecast(ts_flights[,2]) Point Forecast Lo 80 Hi 80 Lo 95 Hi 95 316 16.42007 6.392889 26.44725 1.084821 31.75532 317 17.17526 -1.455819 35.80634 -11.318518 45.66904 > sarima_forecast(ts_flights[,3]) Point Forecast Lo 80 Hi 80 Lo 95 Hi 95 316 20.14386 16.65176 23.63597 14.80315 25.48458 317 20.48233 14.20151 26.76314 10.87665 30.08800 > sarima_forecast(ts_flights[,4]) Point Forecast Lo 80 Hi 80 Lo 95 Hi 95 316 60.34350 51.31253 69.37447 46.53183 74.15517 317 60.46693 43.95295 76.98090 35.21098 85.72287 But only after I had completed all of this in RStudio did I find out about the SCRIPT_REAL() function in Tableau where I could have tried to do all of this in Tableau from the start! So now I am trying to figure out how to replicate all of that within a SCRIPT_REAL() function in Tableau, this is what I have so far: SCRIPT_REAL("library(forecast); TS_flights I just don't know what to put for the dataset name I called arg1 as a placeholder. What can I put as the name of the dataset here and am I on the right track besides that?
