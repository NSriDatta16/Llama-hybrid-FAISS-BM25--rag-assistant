'Counting' the number of records that match a certain criteria and displaying the numbers (using PHP and MySQL)

I have a MySQL database containing a user's country and whether they are an individual or an organisation. The field names are 'country' and 'type'. Using PHP, I'd like to 'count' the number of countries, the number of individuals and the number of organisations in the database and then display the numbers in the following example format: So far, 500 individuals and 210 organisations from 40 countries have registered their support. I am currently listing the total number of records using the below code if this helps: My PHP / MySQL skills are very limited so I'm really struggling with this one. Many thanks in advance! Ben
