Probably you should use jQuery.getScript to loading some javascript from the server and execute it. UPDATED: In the most cases one load only the pure HTML fragment with respect of jQuery.ajax . Binding of elements to some javascript functions one do inside of success handle. All functions which one use in any event handler one loaded before (with in the block) on the main page (on the page which call jQuery.ajax ). Then all look very clear and dynamic loading of any scripts is not needed.
