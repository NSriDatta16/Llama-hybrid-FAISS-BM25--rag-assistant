This is a fragment of code, which may be why f2c didn't work. Plus, as already pointed out, most likely the "end if" should be "end do". If you have Fortran subroutines that are tested and do the calculation that you need, you can call them from C. You declare the arguments of the Fortran subroutine using the ISO C Binding of Fortran, then the Fortran compiler will use the C API so that the routine is callable from C. This short code block is easy to translate; something long and complicated might be better to reuse.
