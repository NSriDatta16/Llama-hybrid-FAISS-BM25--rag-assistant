Yes I worked for an organization that used this: http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/english_country_names_and_code_elements.htm for countries; there are other sources too that are valid that I can't currently find. There are state code lists but I haven't seen city. I've not seen any web services offerings; the one listed below was news to me... We typically attempted to standardize with these codes, loaded them into a database, and even had a central database with these values that other DB's referenced too. HTH.
