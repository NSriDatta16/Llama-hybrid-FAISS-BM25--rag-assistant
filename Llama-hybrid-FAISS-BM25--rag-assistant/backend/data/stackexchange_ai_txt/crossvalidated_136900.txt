markov chain with probability trends

I have clients with debts that can pass from states own 1 bill, own 2 bills, own 3 bills, leave the service, new debtors and owe nothing. So I could calculate the probabilities of being in state 1bill and going back to own nothing, and all the rest transition probabilities. Until here I though I could you markov chains. But then, I see that for example those "transition" probabilities have trend, because the company buys new technology for the call center, or invest in training. Also there are seasonal effects (like Christmas or holidays that make those rates change). So my question is how can I represent the trend and seasonality in this case using a markov chain. If I fit the trend with a linear regression (just to be simple, with dummies for seasonality), how can I get the parameters considering the result of each trend must match the original transition probabilities? At this point I've read about hidden markov models, but I'm not sure if this would be the proper model. So, my question is what model would you use to solve this and how would you fit it?
