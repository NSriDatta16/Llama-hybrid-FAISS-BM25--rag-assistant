I totally agree with the answer provider as comment by Michael Mayer. Another option which should work is to use only $obs$ value as a dependent variable and $trials$ as a weight for observation. I do not know scikit learn, and, because I do not know python either, I was not able to understand if they weights the values when averaging at the leave nodes. As far as I was able to understand, however, it seems that Weka implementation does that. Finally I suggest to ask yourself why did you try to work with ratios anyway. Usually working with ratios is not straightforward. But the main problem I see is that ratios loose a lot of information for what I think you want to know. There are zeros which gives you trouble. I think however a bigger problem is the ratio itself. What I mean is $1/2$ is not at all the same with $50/100$. The ratio is the same, however, if you think about how confidence you have in each observation is not. $50$ observations from $100$ trials is much more evidence than $1$ observation from $2$ trials, even if the expected value is the same. Using ratio you loose one dimension of your data for nothing but getting meaningless results.
