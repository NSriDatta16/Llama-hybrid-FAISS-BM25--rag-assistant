Short answer is that there are lots of ways to do it, ranging from any kind of interpolation you fancy (linear, cubic, cubic spline, piecewise cubic Hermite, ...) to something more statistical. Time series modelling could range from any purely statistical model for the data as a single time series to something based on least in part on meteorological inputs. Personally, I would not want to try the former without much more data, and the latter surely requires expert input. In principle, it is important to try different methods and check whether they agree.
