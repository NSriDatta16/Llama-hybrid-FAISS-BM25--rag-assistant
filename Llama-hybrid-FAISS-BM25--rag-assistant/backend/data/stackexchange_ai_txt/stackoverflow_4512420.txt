You may still indent your selectors according to your document structure: body { font-size: 1.4em; color: #666; } #Header { /* stuff */ } #Header ul { /* stuff */ } #Header il { /* stuff */ } #Content { /* stuff */ } Other than the sporadic background-image: url(''); properties generally don't run very long, and during development this might help you keep organized. I personally prefer unindented CSS because I often let Textmate reformat my stylesheets.
