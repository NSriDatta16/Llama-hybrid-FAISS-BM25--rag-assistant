Page breaks are very much a thing of layout, and HTML isn't designed to describe layout, so you aren't going to find anything that is semantic for this within the language. The best you can hope for is some sort of kludge. Since a page break can occur in the middle of a paragraph, and elements can contain only inline elements you can eliminate most of the options from the outset. The two possibilities that suggest themselves to me are and . The former has no semantics, that latter is designed to be linked to (with a name attribute) or from (with an href attribute), and you could consider a page from an original document something that you might wish to link to. No matter what element you use, I wouldn't include a marker in it and then hide it with CSS. That sort of presentational flag is something I would consider adding via :before in a stylesheet (combined with a descendent selector for a body class that can be toggled with JS since you want the toggle) Alternatively, if you want to take a (very) broad view of the meaning of "HTML" you could consider the l element (from the defunct XHTML 2 drafts) and markup each line of the original document. Adding a class would indicate where a new page began (and you could use CSS counters and borders to clearly indicate each page and number it should you so wish). Pity the browser vendors refused to get behind a real semantic markup language and favoured HTML 5 instead.
