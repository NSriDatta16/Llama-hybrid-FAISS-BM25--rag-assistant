How many parameters are estimated in a 2PL model?

I'm familiar with 1PL IRT models, where you have some data matrix, and you model the latent factors, theta (the trait/ability) and (item) difficulty. data = np.array([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,0], [1,1,0,0], [1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]]) theta = [t1,t2,t3,t4,t5] difficulty = [d1,d,2,d3,d4] Consider a linguistic test for children, where each row represents a different child and each column represents a different question. So the data matrix at a specific row/col captures the response of a given child on a given question. The 1PL model sigmoid(t-d) learns these latent features, such that you can quantify the difficulty of each question and the ability of each child. Note there are 9 parameters in the 1PL model (5 children, 4 questions.) Now, the 2PL model takes a slightly different form, sigmoid(a(t-d)) , where a is the discrimination factor. I'm not sure if a is: A scalar value, which is the same, regardless of child/item pairing. (10 total parameters) An array of length 5, one element per child. (14 parameters) An array of length 4, one element per question. (13 parameters) A matrix, one element per each child/item pairing. (29 parameters) Q1. which of the above is the canonical form of the 2PL model? (or if it is some other configuration not listed above.) Q2. What is a good choice of prior for a? (I've used a normal distribution on interpretation 2 above to unstable results using MCMC methods for Bayesian approach.) Thanks!
