You pretty much have the solution there. Communication is a very important part of version control systems and with binary files you need to be a lot more mindful of it. Unfortunately a lot of people just assume the software is the end all solution and team communication goes out the window. I have made the mistake of evangelizing SVN to a client with a very large Flash codebase. I don't know if they will ever let me into that building again. Where I failed was that I was unable to change the culture of the organization so that there was more communication between people working on a project and as a result there was more yelling about who conflicted the .fla's. Maybe adopt a daily scrum meeting ( some call it stand up ). Every morning have a five minute meeting and mention what you will be working that day and which files you may touch. If there is any probability that there will be conflicts be sure to communicate throughout the day while you work. This way no one is in the dark as to why svn is saying there is a conflict on a fla file. I hope this helps.
