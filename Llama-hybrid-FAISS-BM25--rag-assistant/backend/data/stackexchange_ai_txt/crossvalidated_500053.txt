Using Generalized Mixed Models In R

I'm trying to run a logistic regression but for a within-subject design so I ended up using a genearlized mixed model (glmer and lme functions in R). There is one predictor (with 3 conditions) and a binary outcome coded as 0 or 1. I was wondering if anyone had advice on which model is better to use and why. I'm also having trouble interpreting the output, and the summary seems to be leaving out one of the three conditions in my predictor. When I run the code below: D1_data The summary of only includes the first 2 conditions (in both instances) for example: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 40.03 427.04 0.094 0.925 condition1 -39.63 427.04 -0.093 0.926 condition2 -37.07 427.04 -0.087 0.931 Even though there should be a 3rd condition. Could someone please help me to find out what the issue is and provide some advice on how to get the 3 conditions to be shown! Thanks in advanced I'm very new to R so please excuse me if I'm asking a simple question.
