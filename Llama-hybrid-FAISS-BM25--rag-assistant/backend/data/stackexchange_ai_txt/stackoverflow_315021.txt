You can include files from anywhere on the server (depending on file access privileges and security restrictions, of course). Using an includes directory helps keep things well organized, but is not required. If a file contains PHP code, it should be saved as a .php file - otherwise if it is called directly the code will not run. This leaves you with a file which behaves differently depending on how it is accessed, which is probably not what you wanted and could be a security threat. To get around this, I have seen some people override file-types so the server treats all .html files as PHP scripts - I do not recommend this, as it will slow processing of all files even if they do not include any PHP. Follow the Principle of Least Surprise - let your HTML files be .html and your PHP files be .php - and everyone will be happier.
