What is the purpose or benefits of fully connected layer at the middle of Convolutional Network?

Is there any benefits to have FC layer at the middle of CNN network? For example, in this network , FC7 has kernel size is 1. What is the benefits of using kernel size 1 in this use? Those inception net, kernel size 1 is used for lower down the computation. Is that same purpose or for different advantages?
