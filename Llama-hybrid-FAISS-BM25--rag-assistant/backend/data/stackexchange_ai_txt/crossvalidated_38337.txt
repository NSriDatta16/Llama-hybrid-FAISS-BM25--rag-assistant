How to calculate the confidence interval of a regression prediction given a particular value for a binary predictor?

I have a regression predicting wage (dependent variable) from whether the participant is a college graduate (dummy variable, independent). I have the regression coefficients and their standard errors, the R-squared of the regression, and the covariance between the intercept and the coefficient on the dummy variable. How do I calculate a confidence interval for the average wage of a college graduate (given that dummy = 1)?
