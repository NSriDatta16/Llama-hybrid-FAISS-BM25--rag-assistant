More tools are better than less tools. Is programming becoming too fragmented because there are so many programming languages? Choice is a great thing. You aren't required to know the whole suite of tools. If you do .NET desktop development, you can choose between WinForms or the newer WPF. WPF skills can transfer over to Silverlight web development. WinForms users can learn WPF. Two technologies is hardly a major concern, especially considering many of the skills (libraries and language) are nearly 100% transferable. WebForms are fairly dated, and ASP MVC is a completely new direction for the .NET stack which is very encouraging. I'd be worried if nothing new was coming out. Microsoft is ensuring that the skills you currently have with .NET will still be relevant in quite a few years. If nothing new was coming out, someone else would do it, and you'd have to learn new tech from the bottom up. I learnt enough WPF to get by in about 2 to 3 weeks. I felt comfortable with ASP MVC in all of 3 days. I think .NET is hitting the sweet spot with most of their new(er) tech.
