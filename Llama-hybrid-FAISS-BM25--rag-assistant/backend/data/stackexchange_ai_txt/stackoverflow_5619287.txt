I am using SMTPclient to send mail with attachment. When the attachment is more than 2mb, I am getting the below error: ** "Exceeded storage allocation. The server response was: 4.3.1 Message size exceeds fixed maximum message size". ** 1) Can i send email ** using smtpclient with attachment size >2mb. ** If yes, What is the limit of attachment. 2) How can i fix the above error? Please give me an idea,if you have the solution.
