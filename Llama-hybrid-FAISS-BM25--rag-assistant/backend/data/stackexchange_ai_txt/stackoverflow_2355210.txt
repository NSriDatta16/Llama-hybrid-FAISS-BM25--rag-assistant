If you using Eclipse for BB development, you must use Plugin for Eclipse and BB simulator . In this way you just build your application and run/debug it from IDE. IDE automatically run simulator and deploy your cod to simulator. In other cases, there are 3 ways to run your *.cod application on BB device: Using javaloader Using DesktopManager Directly from simulator (only for simulator!). File\Load Java Application\Choose your cod, and your application appears in Downloads directory. Using OTA (Over-The-Air) installation(for web-installation). Note, that if you use for, example, Crypto API or Persistent storage API, before install your application on real device , you must sign it with SignatureTool .
