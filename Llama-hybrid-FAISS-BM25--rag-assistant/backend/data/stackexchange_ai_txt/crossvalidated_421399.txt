How to score/measure the change in a time series from t-x,...t-1 to t0 (Relative change)

I think about having data such as: Time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... n Set1 12 13 13 23 26 27 40 13 13 Set2 2 3 4 2 4 3 10 12 11 . . . Setn ... All datasets are equivalent in terms of the meaning what a sudden (relative) change in values indicate. Means when in set1 is a change from 13 to 23 it indicates the same as when there is a change from 3 to 10 in set2. It only depends on the relative change of the actual t0 to the average of the past x periods. My question is what is the best way to quantify such change? My goal is to have a value in each period for each dataset that indicates the change. This value should be comparable to the other datasets. Means when I have a change from 13 to 23 the value should approximately similar to a change from 3 to 10.
