Observer doesn't save order

I've build an observer which listens on the sales_convert_quote_to_order event. The event is triggered and I just want to add a value to an attribute of the order. The attribute is set - as printed in the log - but magento doesn't save the order. What I'm doing wrong? Observer.php public function addLangToOrder($observer){ Mage::log('catching convert_quote_to_order_after'); $order = $observer->getEvent()->getOrder(); $order->setCustomerLanguage(Mage::app()->getStore()->getCode()); $order->save(); Mage::log($order->getCustomerLanguage()); } config.xml singleton Ac_Customer_Model_Observer addLangToOrder I've added the attribute customer_language through an install script $customer_lang = 'customer_language'; $installer->addAttribute('order', $customer_lang, array('type'=>'varchar')); The customer_language column is present in my sales_flat_order table. But it doesn't get saved. I'm using Magento 1.4.1.1
