Hmmm I've used a code where I had to split the copy entered by a WYSIWYG and wanted to retrieve the first paragraph from it. Its little dodgy but did the trick for me. If you wanted to add in show "n" then you could add that to the "intro" var using substr. Hope this starts you off :-| function break_html_description_to_chunks($description = null) { $firstParaEnd = strpos($description," "); $firstParaEnd += 4; $intro = substr($description, 0, $firstParaEnd); $body = substr($description, $firstParaEnd, strlen($description)); $temp = array("intro" => $intro, "body" => $body); return $temp; }
