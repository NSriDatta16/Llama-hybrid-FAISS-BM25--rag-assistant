How to reuse logic in a context sensitive way in ASP.NET MVC

Trying to figure out the best way to organize a ASP.NET MVC site. Take a very simple 1..N relationship: Company can have many Contacts, Contacts must have exactly one Company. I have your typical routes: Company/Index (list all companies) Company/Details/{int} (details of Company {int}) Company/Create (create new company) Contact/Index (list all contacts) Contact/Create (create new contact, company is selected from drop down) Now if I wanted to create a page that created a Contact in the context of a Company (from the Company detail page) so that the required company is filled in/not editable), what would be the best route of going about that, while not duplicating code where possible. Not sure if I can leverage the Contact/Create logic/view from the Company controller (and be able to route back to the Company Details page when complete), or mess with the routes to do something like Company/Details/{int}/Contact/Create (not even sure if that makes sense or would work)? There has got to be a better way then me adding my logic and view for adding a Contact into my Controller view and having it duplicated.
