Its probably device specific as devices has a different amount of memory available for application. ref http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/18cbb2404778618e?pli=1 Its application dependant. The developer may state that the app should be preferrebly install on internal memory, the SD-card, or to let the user choose from SD-card and memory. This is only supported on Android 2.2. On older version of android, version android:installLocation element. It supports the values internalOnly , preferExternal or auto . But again, only supported on Android 2.2. ref https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.2.html I tested on my HTC Desire with more than 500 MB of memory. With almost none apps installed I can install an apk that is 43MB, but an apk that is 57MB is too large, even i got plenty of available memory... it fails with Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE] The "File Manager" application tells me that im using 60/147MB (40%). The limit seems be 147 MB, but in practice, as i have tested, this is not true... Update: I did some testing, and published the results here : ::Edit:: I never changes the any thing in this answer just update this. Update size by Developer blog please refer this link about the updated answer.
