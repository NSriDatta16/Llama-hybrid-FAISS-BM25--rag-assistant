TFS build cannot publish test results if TFS server is in domain different from drop location

I have the problem with failing TFS build if my drop location is in domain different from TFS server. The error I get is Results file: C:\TestResults\CPU_Release.trx Test Settings: Default Test Settings Waiting to publish... Publishing results of test run buildAgent@computername 2011-01-03 15:31:38_Any CPU_Release to http://tfsserver:8080/... .....................The drop share directory "\\computername\Builds\projectName\CI_1.0.193.0" could not be accessed. The drop share directory "\\computername\Builds\projectName\CI_1.0.193.0" could not be accessed. 1:6>C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\TeamBuild\Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.targets(1403,5): error MSB6006: "MSTest.exe" exited with code 1. [C:\Users\BuildType\TFSBuild.proj] How can at least I skip publishing test results? I tried to set up property false but it does not help. I use TFS server 2008.
