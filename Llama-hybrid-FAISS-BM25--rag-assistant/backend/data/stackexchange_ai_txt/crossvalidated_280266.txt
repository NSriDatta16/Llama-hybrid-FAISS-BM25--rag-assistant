Interpret regression with Heteroskedasticity Corrected Standard Errors in R

In my data I have problems with heteroscedasticity as indicated by the Breusch-Pagan test and the NVC test that are both significant. Therefore, I would like to follow the method posted by Gavin Simpson here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4385436/regression-with-heteroskedasticity-corrected-standard-errors I used the one-liner he suggested. This seems to work but now I have troubles interpreting the results as they look very different from my original multiple regression results. mySummary(model_maineffect, vcovHC) t test of coefficients: Estimate Std.
