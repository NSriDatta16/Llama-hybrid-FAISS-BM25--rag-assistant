Trying to run a kaggle notebook

I'm found an interesting problem on kaggle and more or less solved it with my limited knowledge of machine learning. I was curious how other people solved and checked the solution with the highest vote. The solution includes a line where is implementing and training a model. params = {'num_leaves': 8, 'min_data_in_leaf': 42, 'objective': 'binary', 'max_depth': 5, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'boosting': 'gbdt', 'bagging_freq': 5, 'feature_fraction': 0.8201, 'bagging_seed': 11, 'reg_alpha': 1, 'reg_lambda': 4, 'random_state': 42, 'metric': 'auc', 'verbosity': -1, 'subsample': 0.81, 'num_threads': 4} oof_lgb, scores = train_model(X, y, params=params, folds=folds, model_type='lgb', plot_feature_importance=True) But it is nowhere mentioned what kind of model he is using, which causes the error. NameError: name 'train_model' is not defined Does someone of you know which model he is using, so that i can run his notebook on my computer.
