Somewhat late, but nevertheless maybe this will save someone a few hours of head banging. This is probably only relevant to sending emails from gmail. First, in order to help debugging the situation, set the following line in development.rb to true (assuming you're in development mode): config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true This will make ActionMailer not to silently ignore errors. When I did that, I realized gmail is refusing my username and password. I then went to my configuration file where I put all the Action Mailer config directives (for me it was in development.rb, there is probably a better place to put it), and noticed that :user_name was set to "admin" rather than "admin@thedomain.com". Changing it solved the problem. Here is my corrected part of development.rb: config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address => "smtp.gmail.com", :port => 587, :domain => 'thedomain.com', :user_name => 'admin@thedomain.com', :password => ' ', :authentication => 'plain', :enable_starttls_auto => true } References: http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/43/topics/541 http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html
