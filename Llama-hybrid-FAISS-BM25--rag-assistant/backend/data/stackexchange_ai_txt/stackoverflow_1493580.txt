What does __forwarding__ in the stack trace mean?

(gdb) bt #0 0x302ac924 in ___TERMINATING_DUE_TO_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION___ () #1 0x92077e3b in objc_exception_throw () #2 0x302d6ffb in -[NSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector:] () #3 0x3026e056 in ___forwarding___ () #4 0x3024a0a2 in __forwarding_prep_0___ () #5 0x00004ae9 in -[GameObject doesTouch:] (self=0xe893a0, _cmd=0x643ee, obj=0xe82e20) at /Users/aaa/Desktop/CPT/Game/Classes/GameObject.m:220 #6 0x00006e05 in -[StaticGrid checkTouchNearest:] (self=0xe82f20, _cmd=0x64ec3, obj=0xe893a0) at /Users/aaa/Desktop/CPT/Game/Classes/StaticGrid.m:62 #7 0x0000a393 in -[EAGLView touchesBegan:withEvent:] (self=0xe8dad0, _cmd=0x3199fa3c, touches=0x632c0b0, event=0xe14590) at /Users/aaa/Desktop/CPT/Game/Classes/EAGLView.m:459 #8 0x30910f33 in -[UIWindow _sendTouchesForEvent:] () #9 0x308faecb in -[UIApplication sendEvent:] () #10 0x309013e1 in _UIApplicationHandleEvent () #11 0x32046375 in PurpleEventCallback () #12 0x30245560 in CFRunLoopRunSpecific () #13 0x30244628 in CFRunLoopRunInMode () #14 0x32044c31 in GSEventRunModal () #15 0x32044cf6 in GSEventRun () #16 0x309021ee in UIApplicationMain () ... Currently I have a rare occuring error that I do not know the cause yet. I am not sure where to look at, so what I want to ask is what do the first five lines (#0 to #4) mean? I know that it claims that there are some errors, but what are those things like " ___forwarding___ "? If you have some knowledge in this, please help. Thank you very much.
