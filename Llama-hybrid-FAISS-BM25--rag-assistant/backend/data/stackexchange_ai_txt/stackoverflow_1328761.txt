Considerations when making a java application into a web applet

I am in the process of turning my java application into a web applet. So far I can export the jar, sign it, and apparently launch it. The Java loading image plays endlessly and my application's JFrame window pops up and connects to my application's server. Unfortunately, as an applet, the JFrame seems to be frozen. It never renders anything and the window's content is merely the shadows of the frame buffer of objects dragged across it. The application version runs fine, and the applet version runs fine through Eclipse's applet player. It's only on the web that the rendering craps out. I thought that signing the applet would let it work as it did as an application. It seems that making an application into an applet is a bit more complicated than I first anticipated. What considerations should I make when making this conversion?
