JQuery draggable - The opposide from connectToSortable

i can drop a draggable element into a sortable list. $( ".selector" ).draggable({ connectToSortable: '#myList' }); But how can i drop the element back? The sortout event works only with a second list :/ kind regards Peter EDIT: working example http://www.jsfiddle.net/V9Euk/114/
