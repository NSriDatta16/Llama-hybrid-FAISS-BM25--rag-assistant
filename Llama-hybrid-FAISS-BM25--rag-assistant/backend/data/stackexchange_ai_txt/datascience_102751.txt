Use Pivoted / Filtered Data as the basis for a Report?

I have a worksheet in Tableau that is organized into rows and columns and filtered on an aggregate calculation just the way I want it. I'd like to make a report based on this workbook's results but I need it to show more fields than those in my worksheet. The problem is that if I add more fields to the "Rows" section, it changes the groupings and my filter based on the aggregation calculation doesn't give the same results anymore. Is there a way for me to use the filtered results on a worksheet to pull in only the rows from my dataset that are not filtered out in my worksheet?
