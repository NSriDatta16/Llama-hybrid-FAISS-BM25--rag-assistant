The easiest way is to use WMI to get the required information. Take at look at the documentation for Win32___DiskDrive in MSDN, which contains a variety of standard drive properties. You can also try using the MSStorageDriver_ATAPISmartData WMI class, which I can't find any docs for at the moment, but should have all of the SMART data that you're looking for. Here's some basic sample code to enumerate all drives and get their properties: ManagementClass driveClass = new ManagementClass("Win32_DiskDrive"); ManagementObjectCollection drives = driveClass.GetInstances(); foreach (ManagementObject drive in drives) { foreach (PropertyData property in drive.Properties) { Console.WriteLine("Property: {0}, Value: {1}", property.Name, property.Value); } Console.WriteLine(); }
