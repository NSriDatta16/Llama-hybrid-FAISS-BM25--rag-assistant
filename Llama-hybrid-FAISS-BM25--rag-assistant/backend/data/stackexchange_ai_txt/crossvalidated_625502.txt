Addendum to Original Question I was at the beginning of my statistical knowledge when I first posed this question and since have been exposed to quite a variety of topics. Revisiting this question, I felt the answers here were good, but wanted to add that there is an entire paradigm related to this called n-of-1 designs. As mentioned by others, this involves measuring the same person or a small number of persons several times versus what is typically done by measuring a large sample once or a selected number of time points. What is quite fascinating about this in relation to my own work is that psychology was originally built off these types of experiments. B.F. Skinner, for example, built the entire theoretical underpinnings of operant conditioning based on the many observations of individual rats. Skinner once noted that: “It is more useful to study one animal for 1000 hours than to study 1000 animals for one hour.” The merits of that statement are certainly debatable. In any case, that spirit of experimentation died with the adoption of large sample testing in the 1960s in lieu of NHST-focused results. What that means from an inferential standpoint certainly changes as noted by some already here. The notion of a p-value, for example, changes when we are focusing on an individual, as a sample from a population is supposed to infer upon a population as a whole, whereas if we are only concerned with an individual , the "population" here is the person alone. Thus a p-value means different things here contingent on what you attempt to extrapolate from it. Some may wonder what the utility of studying one person may be. From a research standpoint, rare populations are already difficult to study (such as those with brain injury), and so applying an n-of-1 design provides a wealth of information that would otherwise not be available for understanding these people. From a practical standpoint, it can greatly inform us of a person's behavior in an applied setting. For example, if a teacher wants to know if a given reading intervention works on a single student who has struggled in her classroom, she can apply an n-of-1 approach and uncover a wealth of information on the actual effect this intervention has over many time points. Reading through this topic has been interesting, and so I have included some relevant works at the end of this answer for anyone who chances across this question and is interested in learning more someday.
