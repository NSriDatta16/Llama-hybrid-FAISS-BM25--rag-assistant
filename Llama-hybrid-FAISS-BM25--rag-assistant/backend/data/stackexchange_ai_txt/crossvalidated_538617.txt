You'll typically need an array/tensor/"whatever else you call" it that has dimensions of patient by timepoint by variables of interest. E.g. with 1000 patients, 10 timepoints and 10 variables being measured, it would by a 1000 by 10 by 10 array (if there's just one input [or output], you can omit the last dimension). In fact, the second dimension would be the maximum number of visits you ever have to deal with. Each batch that the NN gets would be a subset of this along the first dimension (e.g. taking 128 of the 1000 patients for one batch) - of course that's the thing you'll need in the end, so if the whole array for all patients does not fit in memory, you can create a batch at a time without ever creating the full thing for all patients. You will have to decide on some reasonable thing for dealing with times, at which there's no data (e.g. is it reasonable to interpolate, have some special value for missing such as -1 when values are otherwise >=0, set to some average/median value + having a flag for missing etc.).
