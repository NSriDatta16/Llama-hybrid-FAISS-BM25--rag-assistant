In fact, you have a binary integer with 900 digits. There are lots of ways you can hold that "number" depending on the what do you want with it and how fast. Ask yourself: do I need fast set function ( arr[n] = something ) do I need fast retrieval function ( val = arr[n] ) do I need iteration of some kind, for example find next n for which arr[n] is 1 and so on. Then, ask again or modify you original question. Otherwise, BitArray EDIT: Since we found something (a little) I would suggest rolling your own class for that. Class would have a container such as byte[] and methods to set and unset a item on some position. Checking common 1s from two arrays would be as simple as &&-ing an array on byte to byte basis.
