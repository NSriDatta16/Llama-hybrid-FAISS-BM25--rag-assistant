One solution would be to cache the page, but include a javascript snippet that will make another small request just for the section you want to be dynamic. So the user will download the page fully, and then when javascript executes, it will pull down the dynamic page element. I wrote a short blog post about this a while back. http://chase.ratchetsoftware.com/2008/12/rails-caching-dynamic-fragments/ Also, Greg Pollack of RailsEnvy did a screencast where he focuses on having dynamic data in cached pages. http://railslab.newrelic.com/2009/02/05/episode-5-advanced-page-caching Hope this helps, Chase Gray
