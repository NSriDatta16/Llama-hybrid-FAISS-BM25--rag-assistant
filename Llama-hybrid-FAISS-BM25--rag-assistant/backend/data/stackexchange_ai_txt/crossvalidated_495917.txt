When will point ($\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$) not go through the regression line?

It is understood that the estimated ordinary least squares (OLS) regression line will pass through the average $x$ and $y$ , but if there is no intercept it will no longer pass through ( $\bar{x}$ , $\bar{y}$ ). May I know what is the explanation for that?
