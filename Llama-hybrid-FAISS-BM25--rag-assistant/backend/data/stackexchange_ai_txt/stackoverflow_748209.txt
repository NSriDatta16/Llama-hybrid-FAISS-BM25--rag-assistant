To answer your questions: Q: What software do I need to download and install? Server? Client? A: There are a number of Subversion clients for Windows, including AnkhSVN that integrates with VisualStudio and one that is very popular with our clients, TortoiseSVN , which integrates with Windows Explorer. On the server side, I'd recommend going with a hosted solution if your corporate policies allow. Just put "subversion hosting" into Google and compare the available providers. If not, I recommend installing the Windows binaries from the Subversion site . Q: What do I need to install the software on? Windows 2003? A: Subversion is available for all major platforms from the above link, so if you're a Windows shop, sure, Windows 2003 is fine. If you are heterogeneous, you may have a bit of an easier time configuring it behind Apache on Linux. Subversion is well-documented and has instructions for configuration on all platforms though. Q: Should I have a dedicated server or is an existing file server adequate? A: Again, I recommend hosting externally over hosting it yourself. Any hosting provider worth using will provide the following advantages: *Accessible securely from anywhere via HTTPS (no need to configure corporate firewalls to work from home or a client site) *Offsite backups (no need to set up new backup procedures for that dedicated server or file server in your office) *Uptime (no need to worry about the box melting down or having some other issue that your team will have to deal with directly) *Configuration (UI-based setup rather than having to learn server side configuration procedures) If your company requires hosting it yourself, and there is sufficient space carved out on the file server, I would say it's not a problem to use an existing server. If you have a dedicated server handy, that will be better just from the perspective of not having to "bump heads" with other parts of the organization assuming it's a shared resource. Q: How quickly will developers get up to speed? Is the integration similar enough to just carry on as normal? A: There is a slight learning curve for Subversion, but Chapter 2 of the Red Bean book as well as the documentation for the clients explains how a regular work cycle goes. If your developers are familiar with CVS they'll be up to speed in no time. If they aren't, it may take a little while to get used to the notion that you don't have to lock files to work on them (Subversion has a locking mechanism but it's not designed to be part of the standard work cycle). Definitely feel free to contact me directly if you have any other questions.
