vb.net class organization

I've been struggling to get my mind around classes. Even after reading several websites and books, I still don't feel like I really 'get it'. The application that I'm working on has a sub that will control a few different pieces of test equipment over a USB to GPIB interface. So, I have: Laptop USB - GPIB Interface Power Supply (Device Address 5) HP34970 Datalogger (Device Address 6) In my sub I would like to Open the GPIB device, send a few SCPI commands to turn on the power supply, send a few more to the HP34970 to switch relays or measure voltage. Seems simple enough and I can easily make everything work in the same module. However, I think I it would be much better to have a separate class for the GPIB Interface, Power Supply, and HP34970. If this was the case, I could very easily reuse the code in other projects. Here is where I just can't get a mental model- If I create an instance of the GPIB class and have a method to 'open' a channel to the GPIB bus, how can I allow methods in other classes (like power supply) to use the open channel created in the GPIB class? For example, a method in the power supply class to set voltage. If someone anyone could take a few minutes to post pseudo code and a little explaination to illustrate how I could / should organize this, I would greatly appreciate the help! Thanks
