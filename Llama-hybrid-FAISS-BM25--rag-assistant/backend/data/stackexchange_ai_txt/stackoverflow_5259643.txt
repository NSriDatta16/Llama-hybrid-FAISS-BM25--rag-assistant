I am not sure that I understand you correct, but it seems to me that you want to have trimming of the cell text correspond to punctuation-trim CSS3 style which currently not supported in any web browsers. Of course you can try to simulate the behavior, but it will be not easy and is it really required? I recommend you to be more pragmatical and to use just the features existing "out-of-the-box". The dotted trimming is not such feature.
