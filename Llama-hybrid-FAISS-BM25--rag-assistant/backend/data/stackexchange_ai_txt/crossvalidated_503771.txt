Continuous transition between additive and multiplicative operator?

Question What is the best way to create a function/operator which can smoothly transition between addition and multiplication? More specifically, is there an alternative to just calculating the results of both addition and multiplication operations, and weighting between them with a parameter? Are there considerations with regards to parameter estimation, e.g. via MCMC or SGD? Motivation In time-series models, there are two ways to move between additive or multiplicative model specifications: Whole series transformations on $y$ : Taking the log of the data. This changes the interpretation of every additive operator in the model-specification, into a multiplicative one. The continuous equivalent of this would be the Box-Cox transformation, providing a parameter to weight between the two extremes. Component Operators : On a per-component basis, changing the operators in our model specification, either $+$ or $\times$ . This allows us to, for example, have an additive trend, multiplicative seasonality, and additive errors. I would like the best of both worlds; a continuous transition between additive and multiplicative assumptions, but on a per component basis. Is this possible without estimating both additive and multiplicative terms, and then estimating a parameter to weight between them? For example, let's say my seasonality component is $20$ parameters; would I need to calculate additive and multiplicative terms and then a parameter to weight between them ( $20 \times2 + 1$ parameters), or is it possible to just fit my parameters with a weight on the operator itself ( $20+1$ parameters)?
