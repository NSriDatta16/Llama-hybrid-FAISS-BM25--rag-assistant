Add this in your controller class's awakeFromNib : - (void)awakeFromNib { [tableView setDraggingSourceOperationMask:NSDragOperationEvery forLocal:NO]; // [tableView setDraggingSourceOperationMask:NSDragOperationEvery forLocal:YES]; } (This is assuming you have an IBOutlet hooked up to your tableView named tableView ). Be sure to do this in awakeFromNib or later. (For example, if you were to try to do this in your controller class's init methods, your nib files wouldn't be fully loaded yet, and your IBOutlet 's would all be nil and the message would have no effect). By default, most drag operations will be limited to the local application rather than all applications. The forLocal: parameter specifies whether you are referring to drag operations that are local to the application (within the same app), or non-local, meaning all applications. The line that's commented out is basically what you already have the tableView doing.
