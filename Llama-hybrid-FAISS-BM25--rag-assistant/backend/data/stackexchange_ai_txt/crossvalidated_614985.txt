Classificatsion tree, random forest output and negative values

I am doing a random forest and classificatsion tree. I only have numeric variable, no factors, so I have some questions regarding the output. Background of the variables: Prob_1 are values between 0-1 (I devided the real values with 100, to have values between 0-1), all of the other variables used for the are between 1-100 First question is regarding this output: Regression tree: tree(formula = Prob_1 ~ ., data = P14_Q1_2, subset = train) Variables actually used in tree construction: [1] "Flowers" "Herbaceous_area" "Woodland" Number of terminal nodes: 4 Residual mean deviance: 0.06002 = 3.301 / 55 Distribution of residuals: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -0.63250 -0.12570 0.03416 0.00000 0.14140 0.59530 I can see residual mean deviance is 0.06002, but when I did tree with values (1-100) [Prob_1 are just the real values devided by 100), I got the residual mean deviance over 600, which seems a lot? How to tell if the residual mean deviance is good, if it too high what are the solutsions? I calculated the MSE: > mean((yhat - boston.test)^2) [1] 0.1234633 What are considered to be good values of MSE, when can I say the tree is predicting correctly? Lastly: > RF1 RF1 Call: randomForest(formula = Prob_par ~ ., data = P14_Q1_2, ntree = 50000, mtry = 1, importance = TRUE, subset = train) Type of random forest: regression Number of trees: 50000 No. of variables tried at each split: 1 Mean of squared residuals: 0.08347299 % Var explained: 0.69 The % Var explained= 0.69, which is quiet low, and when changeing the mtry, the value is some times even with a - sign (for example -3.22). What are the solutions?
