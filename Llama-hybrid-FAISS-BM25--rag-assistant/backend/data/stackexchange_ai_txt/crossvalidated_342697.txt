What to do when adjusted $R^{2}$ is infinity?

I am calculating Adjusted $R^{2}$ from an $R^{2}$ value in Python. The code is like below: def adjusted_r2(r2, X, y): p = X.shape[1] n = len(y) r2_adj = 1 - (1-r2) * float(n-1) / (n-p-1) return r2_adj While running this I have the following warning for a single case. RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in double_scalars #r2_adj = 1 - (1-r2)*float(n-1)/(n - p - 1) For this specific case n=27 , p=26 thus (n-p-1) becomes zero. So the divide by zero warning results. I am doing this to evaluate the accuracy of my machine learning model (26 predictors and 1 target). I can twist the training, test set split ratio of the train_test_split() function to avoid this error. But is it necessary? What should be the most meaningful thing to do in such a case? Edit: - I am using Random Forest and Decision Tree ML algorithms.
