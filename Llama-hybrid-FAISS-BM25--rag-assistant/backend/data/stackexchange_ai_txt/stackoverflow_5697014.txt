Vim Be sure to look at C++ Omni Completion ctags and TagList I use ctags --exclude=packagedir -R --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q . cscope ( here and here ) Simply the best editor and will work anywhere - including in your remote terminal under screen :) Eclipse CDT Eclipse can import existing makefile projects and will not clobber the makefile :) Eclipses intellisense is nice I use Eclipse HELIOS on linux. It supports profiling, memchecking with valgrind GDB debugging, remote debugging call graph visualization, comprehensive symbol XRef (the usual eclipse shortcuts apply), simple refactorings coverage GCov oprofile ... It should be portable so I expect most of this to work on windows.
