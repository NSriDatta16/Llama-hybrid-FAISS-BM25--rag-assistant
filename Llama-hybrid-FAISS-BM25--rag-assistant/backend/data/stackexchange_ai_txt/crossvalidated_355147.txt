It is the sum of the covariance of the vectors, this is a measure of how strongly two vectors share their pattern of values. So in your final question the answer is that the two vectors share variance (covary) with a total magnitude of 10. If the vectors are identical every value is squared, if they differ the result will be smaller than the square of the larger value. This means that the resulting value is useful for measuring how similar two vectors are. If the two vectors are orthogonal they share no common variation and the sum of the products cancel out resulting in zero. If the two vectors are unit vectors the maximum possible value is 1, the minimum is - 1,and it is the Pearson correlation coefficient for those two vectors. If one vector is a unit vector then the result will be the magnitude of its contribution to the other vector. This is the basis of applying many modelling methods such as PCA and regression methods that use unit vectors as their core.
