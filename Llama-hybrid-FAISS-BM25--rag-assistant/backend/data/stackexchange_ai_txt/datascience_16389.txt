KMeans clustering to help label Multi-class Supervised model

EDITED: Is it accepted practice to be able to use a KMeans clustering algorithm to help label data fed into a supervised model? (Unsupervised --feeds-> supervised)? The reason being, relabeling millions of records is not possible and it is a class imbalance problem, where that historical minority class is very useful. I feel like this is a reinforcement learning problem, but do not know enough about it to say so. If none of the above, what is a good approach for an imbalanced fraud detection model? Where Precision and recall are better measures than Accuracy.
