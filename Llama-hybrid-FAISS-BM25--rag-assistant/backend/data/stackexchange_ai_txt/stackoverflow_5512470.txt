There is not much harm in letting each team use the technologies that work best for them. In fact if you restrict teams to the "standard" way of doing things you'll stifle innovation and have bad morale. But you don't want things to diverge too much. There a few things you can do to prevent libraries and tools getting out of hand. The first thing is to have regular rotation of each member through the teams to cross pollinate ideas. In this way the best ideas will spread through the teams. You can also enforce a "rule of 3", which simply says it is ok to introduce a second library, tool, logging approach, whatever. But as soon as you want to introduce a 3rd one, you have to remove one of the first two. In other words it is ok to have 2 competing logging frameworks but if there are 3 logging frameworks, choose one to kill. A 3rd idea is to let developers run regular presentations to the entire developer group to demonstrate the pros and cons of each idea or approach. Encourage lots of discussion and constructive criticism. The purpose is to try many things and let everyone find the best way as a group. Finally, Management 3.0 talks a lot more in depth about how teams make decisions. Well worth the read.
