When you use images, you have to put them with different dimensions into the related folders in your project-directory. example: - you use 100dip width for an imageview - in folder "drawable-mdpi" you should put .png with 100px width. - in folder "drawable-hdpi" .png with 150px width - in folder "drawable-ldpi" .png with 75px width
