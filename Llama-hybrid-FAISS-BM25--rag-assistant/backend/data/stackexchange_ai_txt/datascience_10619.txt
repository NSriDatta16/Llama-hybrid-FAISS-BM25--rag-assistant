Importance/intuition behind stacking RNNs

Nowadays there's a trend towards using architectures of "deep" RNNs i.e. vertically stacked RNNs. RNN chapter from Bengio's book These networks seem to work well in practice. What's the intuition around using vertically stacked layers of RNNs (beyond the obvious fact that they increase the capacity by increasing the # parameters)?
