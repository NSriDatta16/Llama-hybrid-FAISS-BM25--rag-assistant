Yes, it's definitely possible. Since you mention generated code, I'm guessing that you're using service references in Visual Studio. If so, you can simply edit the generated interfaces and classes to omit the operations you wish to exclude. However, you will need to perform this edit each time you update the service reference in your client project, so it's probably not an approach you would want to adopt unless the service interface is not expected to change. Regardless of how often the service might change, a somewhat more elegant approach would involve creating your own adapter with which all your service client code can interact.
