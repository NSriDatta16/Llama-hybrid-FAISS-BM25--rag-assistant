Replacement language for C++?

When working on hobby projects I really like to program in low-level languages (in the sense that C and C++ are low level). I don't want to work with managed languages with garbage collection and whatnot that takes all the fun away (yeah, we're all different ;-) ). Normally I use C++ for these type of projects. C++ is rather complex and not so elegant so I have been looking for a language to replace it. Anybody can give me suggestions? Preferences (not requirements): should be low-level (like C and C++) compile to native code (kind of follows from the above but no harm in being explicit) preferrably target win32/win64 object oriented statically typed I have looked at Objective C but I don't like it.
