If you like boxplots, you can as readily show a single boxplot with a line or other reference showing your hypothesised value. (@Glen_b posted an answer with an excellent simple example precisely as I was first writing this.) It is arguable that boxplots, now very popular, are massively overused for one-sample and two-sample exploration. (Their real value, in my view, is when you are comparing many sets of values, with number of samples or groups or variables more like 10, 30 or 100, and there is a major need to see overall patterns amid a mass of possible detail.) The key point is that with just one or two samples (groups, variables), you have space on a plot to show much more detail, detail that could be interesting or important for comparison. With a good design, such detail need not be distracting in visual comparison. Evidently, in most usual versions the box plot suppresses all detail in its box, showing the middle half of the data, except in so far as the position of the median inside the box conveys some information. Depending on the exact rules used, such as the 1.5 IQR convention of showing data points individually if and only if they are 1.5 IQR or more from the nearer quartile, it is even possible that the box plot suppresses most of the detail about the other half of the data. Often, and perhaps even usually, such detail may be irrelevant to something like a Wilcoxon test, but being prepared to see something illuminating in the data display is always a good idea. A display that remains drastically underused in many fields is the quantile plot, a display of the ordered values against an associated cumulative probability. (For other slightly technical reasons, this cumulative probability is typically not $1/n, \cdots, n/n$ for sample size $n$ but something like $(i - 0.5)/n$ for rank $i$, 1 being the rank of the smallest value.) Here are your example data with a reference line added for 1.1. In other examples, key points include For two-sample comparisons, there are easy choices between superimposing traces, juxtaposing traces, or using related plots such as quantile-quantile plots. The plot performs well over a range of sample sizes. Outliers, granularity (lots of ties), gaps, bi- or multimodality will all be shown as or much more clearly than in box plots. Quantile plots mesh well with monotonic transformations, which is not so true for box plots. Some will want to point out that cumulative distribution plots or survival function plots show the same information, and that's fine by me. See W.S. Cleveland's books (details at http://store.hobart.com/ ) for restrained but effective advocacy of quantile plots. Another very useful plot is the dot or strip plot (which goes under many other names too), but I wanted to blow a small trumpet for quantile plots here. R details I leave for others. I am focusing here on the more general statistical graphics question, which clearly cuts across statistical science and all software possibilities. Incidentally, I don't know the background story but the name wilcox.test in R seems a poor choice to me. So, you save on typing two characters, but the name encourages confusion, not least because of past and present people in statistical fields called Wilcox. Lack of justice for Mann and Whitney is another detail. The person being honoured was Wilcoxon.
