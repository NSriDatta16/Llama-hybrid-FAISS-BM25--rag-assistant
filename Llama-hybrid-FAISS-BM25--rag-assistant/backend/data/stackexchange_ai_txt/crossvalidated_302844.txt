Dissimilarity Matrix - Number of cluster

I currently try to figure out if a method like elbow-method, silhouette average or gap statistic can be applied to a dissimilarity matrix. My matrix contains 100 x 100 objects and it satisfies the triangle inequality. So it has a metric but the distances are not Euclidean. My question is, can I use one of these mentioned methods or is there another method how I can determine a number of cluster with my matrix. I don't have any other data available. I'm using R for the clustering. Thanks a lot!
