You have huge standard errors in these interaction groups: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) CONSTRUCTIONpassives:PHASEpretreatment -18.0473 1319.5225 -0.014 0.98909 CONSTRUCTIONpassives:PHASEposttreatment -17.8300 1302.0983 -0.014 0.98907 This usually happens when there is not at least one positive outcome and one negative outcome in each group (passives + pretreatment observations, and passives + posttreatment observations). It is called separation and prevents the model from converging. One way to fix this is just to take that interaction out. You can also use something like Firth logistic regression, which will converge even when there is separation.
