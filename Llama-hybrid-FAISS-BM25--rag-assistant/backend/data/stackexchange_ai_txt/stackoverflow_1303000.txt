It's all about money! VM's are usually also on a SAN with several cluster nodes as well, if you have, say, an ESX server with a lot of VMs. So, if you have a 4 node VM cluster with a SAN backend, you might be able to fit 40 VMs on there. You're still fault tolerant, etc. BUT, having gone through virtualization of SQL Server, it was slow, pure and simple. We weren't getting the IOPS or enough memory and CPU. If you need decent performance, say, for high volume stress testing, go for the cluster. Keep in mind that you need 2 servers, SAN storage plus SQL/Windows licensing, so you have an uphill battle. :-( I guess I'm torn on the subject. As a DBA, I like my servers to perform. Our test servers still need this, but our dev servers aren't usually too busy. Do you need the performance? (Granted, who would say no)
