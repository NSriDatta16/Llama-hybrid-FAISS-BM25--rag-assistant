First, focusing on your code: I think it's fairly correct and it should do the job. After all you are just putting a string in the localStorage and getting it back. Now, some thoughts: What's the "html" of "#container"? If it's just a bunch of strings, ok. Otherwise, at every "restore" you are rebuilding that branch of the DOM. If this is "heavy" or not, it's up to what exactly are you doing. Why do want to use localStorage? What's in the localStorage is local to the browser in which it's created. This means that your UNDO functionality will not "be possible" if the users opens the same page from another browser instance. Are you sure the default UNDO of the browser is not enough for you? But I guess not, and I assume you are NOT undoing stuff that simply involves some " " or " " Are you going to implement a "stack" of UNDO-able operations? If you do that would be cool ;)
