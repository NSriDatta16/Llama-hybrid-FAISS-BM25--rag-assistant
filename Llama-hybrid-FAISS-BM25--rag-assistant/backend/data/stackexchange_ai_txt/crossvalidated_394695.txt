As Firebug notes , time series forecasting algorithms can only predict signal or patterns . Patterns that are unpredictable in timing can, by definition, not be predicted. And so they will not be. Let's turn the question around: you expect the forecast to contain large peaks and troughs just like the past observations do. When do you expect them? Why do you expect them at some specific point in time, rather than, say, half a year earlier or two years later? If you can answer these questions, then you can start looking for a prediction algorithm that incorporates this kind of information. ARIMA, incidentally, won't. It only looks back a short number of periods. It does include the possibility of large peaks and troughs by having large prediction intervals (not shown on your plot) - larger ones than if your series did not have these strong fluctuations. You mention that your series is one of ships arriving in ports, and I notice that the big drop is apparently in 2008. This looks like it was driven by the Great Recession . If you can predict the next similarly strong downturn with any kind of accuracy, then you should not be forecasting ship arrivals, but earning tons of money by shorting stocks. (This is shorthand for: many extremely smart people are trying to predict exactly this kind of pattern, and unsuccessfully so, so it's not realistic to expect a dumb algorithm to manage it.)
