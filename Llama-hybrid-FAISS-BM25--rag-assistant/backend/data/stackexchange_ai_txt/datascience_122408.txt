how to select number of number of layers and neurons in neural network(RNN) in standard way?

For example, i have a 4000 samples/data points and we have to categorize them into 4 classes. while building MLP RNN multi-class text classification model, which has 4 classes. For building model, 1.initially how many neurons should we take in input layer? 2.how many hidden layers & number of neurons in each layer should we consider initially? 3.how to take decision about activation functions (i.e) what functions to add at what layer or at neurons? how to decide the threshold for multi-class classification in this use-case? what is the basic approach or assumption to consider the initial values?
