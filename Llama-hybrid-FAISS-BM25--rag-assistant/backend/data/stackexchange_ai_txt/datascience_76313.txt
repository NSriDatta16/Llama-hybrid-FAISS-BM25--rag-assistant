You can definitely use GridSearchCV with Random Forest. In fact you should use GridSearchCV to find the best parameters that will make your oob_score very high. Some parameters to tune are: n_estimators : Number of tree your random forest should have. The more n_estimators the less overfitting. You should try from 100 to 5000 range. max_depth : max_depth of each tree. You should specify certain max_depth so that your model don't memorise train examples. min_sample_split : the minimum number of samples to have before splitting into new nodes. and many more... But these are the main hyperparameters we tune to get a forest that works well.And to get these hyperparams you should use GridSeachCV.
