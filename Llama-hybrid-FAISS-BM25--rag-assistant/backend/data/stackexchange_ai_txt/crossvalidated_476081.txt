Limitations of K-Means Clustering

I was going through a document of Western Michigan University to understand the limitations of K-means clustering algorithms. Below is the link: https://cs.wmich.edu/alfuqaha/summer14/cs6530/lectures/ClusteringAnalysis.pdf On slide no 33 its mentioned that K-means has problems when clusters are of different Sizes Densities Non globular shapes Since we explore our data and try to figure out the different groups that are present in our data through the k-means clustering algorithm, how would we know that the size of the clusters is different beforehand? We can visualize it if we have two-dimensional data but how it can be done if the data is n-dimensional? Is there any way to examine the data before proceeding to apply k-means. Also, the explanation for the limitation is: if we have different sizes of clusters, k-means will not give the desirable clusters as it tries to partition the clusters equally. But I don't think its always the case. I had applied k-means on the following dataset with k-means++ initialization https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail It gave me clusters with highly uneven distribution of 4346, 23, 3. I think I am missing some prerequisite steps before proceeding. Please help me clear my doubts. Thanks.
