Continuous predictor variable has non-linear association with log odds of response

I'd like to know if a continuous predictor variable (sal) predicts a binary response (empty) in a logistic mixed effect model, but discovered there is a non-linear relationship between the predictor variable and the log odds of the response. My understanding is if this linearity assumption of logistic regression isn't met it means I can't use this predictor in the model, but is there an alternative? # Station = location of data collection # CYR = Calendar year # Sal = Salinity # Empty = Fish caught had empty stomach or not (empty=1) # Salinity variable centered logmod The binary response is independent of time (so survival analysis wouldn't work). Would a GAMM with a binary response work ? Something like this? gamm Data (random sample of 10 rows): df
