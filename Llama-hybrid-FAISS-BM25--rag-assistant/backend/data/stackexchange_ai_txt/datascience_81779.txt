Input : 52 playing card deck images as .jpg,.gif,.tiff Output : Detecting the playing card names. For example : Spade Ace, Three diamonds, Jack of Hearts, King of Clubs. All the playing cards names should be detected by inputting playing cards images. If no, what are the limitations? Do the 52 playing card images have to be modified? One can also add one more playing card as "Joker" to the existing 52 playing cards added as a image as input.
