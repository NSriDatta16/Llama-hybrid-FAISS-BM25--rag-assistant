You've got some problems with counting starting with zero and multiply before addition rules. Well, let's get on the first. Most commonly, when you start counting from zero, you do it like this: for(i=0; i If you start counting from 1, you do it like this: for(i=1; i If you mix those, you get the same result, but it can confuse yourself, and others reading the code: for(i=0; i In the code calculating the average, you had two bugs. First, you should use parentheses, because of math: avg = total / (size-1); /* there is still one bug */ And second, you have size elements. So you have to divide by size , and not by size-1 : avg = total / size; /* right ! */
