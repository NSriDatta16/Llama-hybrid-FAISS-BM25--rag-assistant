You have to specify a different near-far clip plane when you render close objects, such as a weapon hold by a character. This would cause the window-space depth values of the fragments to be invalid with respect to your other scene elements, so you have also have to modify the target depth range by calling glDepthRange. This will give you increase precision in camera near objects. As you have mentioned, only modifying the near-far planes of your general scene frustum is not a solution, nor moving the gun forwards/backwards, since they introduce z-fighting issues.
