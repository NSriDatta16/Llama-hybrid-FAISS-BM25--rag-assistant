For a script in a file use exec For a script in a string use eval !!! But !!! before you use strings passed in from an external source, sanity check them! Otherwise you expose the ability to execute arbitrary code from within you program, so range check your variables! You do not ever want to be asking the question: "excuse me mam, did you really name your son Robert'); DROP TABLE students; -- "? If you dont understand the reference - see this quick cartoon... http://xkcd.com/327/ but when you EVAL - you are taking full responsibility for the instructions that you are eval'ing.
