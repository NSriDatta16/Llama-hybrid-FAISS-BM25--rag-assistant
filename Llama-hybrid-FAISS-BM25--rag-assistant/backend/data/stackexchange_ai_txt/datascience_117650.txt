Who the article is about

I have a problem that I need to solve. It involves articles about football. I have to determine who is the main protagonist in the article. I already have a solution that I have implemented. Its good enough. But I need to improve it further by using latest NLP solutions. The current solution is, use coreference resolution to replace the pronouns with their actual coreferents. Then the output article/text is then passed to NER model to get the entities extracted. Then I simply count for either PER or ORG. Then take the entity with the maximum counts. Any more ideas?
