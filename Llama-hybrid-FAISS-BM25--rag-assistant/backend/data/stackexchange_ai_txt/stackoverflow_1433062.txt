First, the XML example you've posted is invalid. It lacks a root element (or has multiple root elements, depending on your point of view). Also, the element is never closed. I think these might be typos in your example? I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to be able to extract distinct fields here." Can you give an example of the output that you are after? Without more information, I can suggest trying some variation of this: Dim NodeList, Node, SubNode '' # Note: Replace [root] with your actual root level element Set NodeList = objXML.documentElement.selectNodes("/[root]/agents/agent/properties/property") For Each Node In NodeList '' # Do something useful... ?? Distinct fields?? Set Node = Node.selectSingleNode("address/street/text()") If Not Node Is Nothing Then Response.Write Server.HTMLEncode(Node.nodeValue) & " " End If Next Does this help?
