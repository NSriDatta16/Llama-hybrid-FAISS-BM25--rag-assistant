I took your 350 observations into AUTOBOX piece of software specifically designed for time series analysis . After incorporating the deterministic input series AD the following acf was computed A (1,0,0)(1,0,0) 7 arima model was identified along with a level shift DOWN at period 127 and a number of pulses . Shown here and here with the following stats with Actual,Fit and Forecast here . Look closely at the L at period 127 and Actual/Forecast here The Cleansed series is here with model residual plot here with acf here The residuals from the model are here with acf here enter image description here Your 330 values are indeed non-stationary BUT there is more than 1 remedy for non-stationarity. Your series has a deterministic level shift at period 127 . Some software doesn't examine the need for level shifts , seasonal pulses or local time trends and instead often incorrectly suggests an incorrect differencing as the remedy because that is their only option. To answer your question there is no need for any differencing as the non-stationarity is remedied/accounted for by the shift in the mean at period 127. If differencing is needed and you are using a regression approach then one needs to individually select and use the required order of difference for each input series . The citation you quoted is only valid if there is differencing is needed . Transfer Function software can use common differencing when appropriate or not. See my answer to How to use Dynamic Regression models in R to forecast future sales for a broader discussion of Transfer Functions
