The program simply dummy coded your categorical variables. Let's say the variable "read" represents pages read that year. According to your model, on average people read 74.2627484 pages, but in countryNZL they read 6.27 more pages than your reference category, whereas on countryIDN they read -18.8697943 less. Same with the year.
