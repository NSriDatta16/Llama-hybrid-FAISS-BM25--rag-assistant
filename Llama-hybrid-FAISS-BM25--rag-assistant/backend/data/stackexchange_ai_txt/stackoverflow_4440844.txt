Is Google Native Client expected to have Mozilla's and Microsoft's support?

Personally I think that Google Native Client is an amazing technology, but has no future without the support from major browsers. Is Native Client expected to be standardized, just like HTML? Would major organisations like Microsoft and Mozilla (expected to) support it, or only Chrome will support it? Is there any chance one day we could develop cross browser, no plugins web apps with Native Client, along with HTML5?
