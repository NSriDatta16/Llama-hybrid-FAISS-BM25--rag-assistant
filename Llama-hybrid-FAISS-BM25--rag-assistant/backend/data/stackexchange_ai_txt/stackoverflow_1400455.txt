JOIN/query across separate entities.

What are the current options for querying and joining two different Entity Data Models? I've seen that it's possible to share a single model schema between multiple mapping and storage schemas, but it seems clunky and not encouraged. The other option I can think of is to query the entities separately and then join the linq objects, but I'm not sure how I feel about dumping all of that into memory. Does anyone have any better solutions?
