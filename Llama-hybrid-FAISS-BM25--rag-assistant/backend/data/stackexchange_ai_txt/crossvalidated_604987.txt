R - Power analysis for logistic regression

I have written an R code for a logistic regression, which is as follows: # creating the model model $fish ~ df1$ Temperature, family="binomial", data=df1) options(scipen=999) summary(model) # McFaddenâ€™s R2 to test if model fits library("pscl") pscl::pR2(model)["McFadden"] # make predictions predicted 0.5) confmatrix # percentage accuracy (confmatrix[[1, 1]] + confmatrix[[2, 2]]) / sum(confmatrix) #find optimal cutoff probability to use to maximize accuracy library(InformationValue) optimal I found the script for this code here https://www.statology.org/logistic-regression-in-r/ . Because my data is so small, I didn't split it, but that is another topic. Where I am stuck right now is finding a good way to make a power analysis for my model. I would like to know what sample size I need to see a statistical effect of temperature on the finding of fish. Alternatively or additionally, find out how high the probability of a significant effect is for the sample size I have (ideally also get a plot of probability (y) over sample size (y)). One way that I suspect will get me closer to my goal, I found here: https://rdrr.io/cran/WebPower/man/wp.logistic.html . wp.logistic(n = NULL, p0 = NULL, p1 = NULL, alpha = 0.05, power = NULL, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"), family = c("Bernoulli", "exponential", "lognormal", "normal", "Poisson", "uniform"), parameter = NULL) Edited: Can anyone tell me if and how I can apply this power analysis to my current model/code? I would like to know how to get p0 and p1: I found that those are the probabilities that the outcome equals 1 when the predictor x is at the mean, or one standard deviation above its mean, respectively. How can I get these values from the regression analysis?
