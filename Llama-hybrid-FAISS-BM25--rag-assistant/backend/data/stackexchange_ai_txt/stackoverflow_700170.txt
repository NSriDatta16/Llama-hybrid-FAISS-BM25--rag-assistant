Depending on the proxy, there may be little that you can do. If the Proxy is designed to block all traffic that it does not directly handle, then you have to either go through the proxy, somehow working with it, or you have to find a way to sneak through the proxy. For example, many applications are built on top of HTTP precisely because it is commonly allowed through firewalls and is commonly proxy-friendly. Thus, it's a pretty safe way of communicating when you know that you'll be installing the application in environments where proxies may exist. In your case, it depends on what port(s) your application uses, on whether these ports are commonly handled by a proxy for any existing protocol, on whether or not you're using a standard (commonly known) protocol or have invented your own, and so on. Is this proxy a transparent proxy? (That is, do web browsers have to be configured to see it, or not?) The kind of proxy it is determines part of how your application needs to work with it. Is the proxy controlled by your organization? You say you are using port 5018. Just as an experiment, can you try using port 80? Just because you're using port 80 doesn't mean you have to use HTTP. This is worth a try to see if it helps.
