Pull notification requires the user to be running your app, and your app to be wasting battery power constantly polling some server (or waiting on some network socket in another thread , or using the new background services). Push notifications, when enabled by the user, and if the phone has a network connection, allows a message to be sent to a phone even when it's not running your app, prompting the user that your app wants some attention. It uses a much lower power network connection than any frequent polling method.
