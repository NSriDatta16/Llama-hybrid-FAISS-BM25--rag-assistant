AFAIK, if you're not doing anything "fancy" (which includes but is not limited to: creating threads, locks, DB connections, using COM objects), nothing terrible will happen. But as Earwicker says , you don't know what OS-wide stuff a DLL is doing, and you certainly don't know if that will change in the future, so relying on this is very fragile. Aren't you curious to know why this access violation is occurring? It may well be the sign of something that became corrupted much earlier on. Please at least confirm that the bug is caused by this 3rd-party library, e.g. by writing a program that links with the library but whose main() does nothing, and confirming that this causes the same crash.
