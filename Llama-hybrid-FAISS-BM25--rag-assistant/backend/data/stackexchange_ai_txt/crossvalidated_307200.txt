Prediction by looking at correlation is a bit vague I think, and correlation in time series is a tricky concept. Let $N_i$ be the yearly number of losses each year. Then applying a linear regression is assuming the model $N_i = a N_{i - 1} + b + \text{error}_i$, where the errors are assumed to be normally distributed and independent. This is equivalent to a $AR(1)$ model, an autoregressive model with order $p$. Now if $N_i$ is a sum of many different products, then it can be a good idea to model those separately. This is especially true if you have additional information on discontinuations and introductions of products, as you are now catching all these effects into a single error term. As an example, say you are modelling the number of apples sold and the number of pears sold next year. If you know that pears will not be continued next year, you take that into account in your forecast. This will get more tricky in particular if the different products affect each other (growth in one will imply growth or decline in another), in which case you cannot assume independent errors. In the case above, if apples have a bad year, it is likely that pears will also have a bad year and vice versa, so you get more extreme outcomes. You are always making simplifications, and figuring out which are working well are mostly part of the job!
