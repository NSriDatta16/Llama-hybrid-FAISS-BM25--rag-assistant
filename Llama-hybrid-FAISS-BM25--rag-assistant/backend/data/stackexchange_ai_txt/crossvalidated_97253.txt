Firstly if you are measuring your data in percentages your outcome variable must be measured in 0s and 1s. (perhaps did pick up an M&M vs didn't???) In this case your data is binary and based on the binomial distribution. Strictly speaking should be using logistic regression, or a chi squared test not ANOVA. there maybe cases where using ANOVA is permissible with binary data (e.g where N is high enough) but this is a separate question.... My advice is to consider logistic regression analysis instead or chi squared test. You can measure the same things as ANOVA using these tests - but they are specifically designed to deal with data measured in 0s and 1s, rather than data collected with continous measures. if you need further help with these tests then you can post questions on this site.
