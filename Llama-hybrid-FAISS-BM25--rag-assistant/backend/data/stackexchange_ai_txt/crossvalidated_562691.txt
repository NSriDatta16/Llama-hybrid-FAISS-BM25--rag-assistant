If you don't have any reason to believe each of the probabilities is more likely to be correct than the others, I think a simple average would work. This would be similar to how a random forest classifier works - a bunch of (hopefully not too correlated) probabilities that an instance belongs to a class, averaged over the group of probabilities.
