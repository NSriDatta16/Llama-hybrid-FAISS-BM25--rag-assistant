Non-square images for image classification

I have a dataset of wide images: 1760x128. I've read though tutorials and books, and most of them state that input images should be square and if not, they are transformed to square in order to be trained in already trained (on square images) cnns. Is there a way to train cnn for non square images, or should I look for another option as padding?
