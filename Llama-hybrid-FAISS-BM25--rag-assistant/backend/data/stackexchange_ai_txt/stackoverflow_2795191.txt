If it is exactly twice the average it should be '==' instead of bigger then twice the avarage. Aslo why are you outputing maxv ? Try to use more meaningful names. Shouldn't you print ary[i] instead? Also, why aren't you looping the array again with a for loop? Shouldn't you iterate all over it to find all outliners or should only the last element be checked for an outliner.
