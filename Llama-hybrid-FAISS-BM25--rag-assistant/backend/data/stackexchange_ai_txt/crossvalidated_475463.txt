Why do we need to make a distributional assumption on the innovations $(\varepsilon_{t})_{t}$

Why do we need to make a distributional assumptions on the innovations/white noise $(\varepsilon_{t})_{t}$ for linear forecasting of a time series $(y_{t})_{t}$ . In a lecture, we introduced a white noise process $(\varepsilon_{t})_{t}$ as a process that is of mean $0$ , constant variance $\sigma^{2}$ and pairwise uncorrelated between white noise terms. There are of course 'stricter' white noise assumptions, such as the variates $(\varepsilon_{t})_{t}$ also being IID or furthermore that the variates $(\varepsilon_{t})_{t}$ follow a normal distribution. It was stated in a lecture that in order to do meaningful forecasting, we need to assume some distributional properties of the variates. My question is why? My naive view would be that, forecasting under the assumption that $(\varepsilon_{t})_{t}$ is not normal would mean that we cannot conduct 'typical' statistical tests on estimators/forecasts $\hat{y}_{t}$ since it does not necessarily follow a t-distribution since $(\varepsilon_{t})_{t}$ is non-normal. Is this basically, the idea behind the statement? Or am I missing something more important
