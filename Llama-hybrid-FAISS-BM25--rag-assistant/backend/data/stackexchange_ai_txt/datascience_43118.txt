There are many solutions for this task. I suggest one of them. As you know, words have relation and if you choose to give each word a special code, you can't have this relation. Consequently, first try to use an embedding network in order to assign each word a code. Then assign each article a label. Next, for each article, you have a sequence of words, codes, which are now embedded. You can employ LSTM networks for classification. If you are not very familiar with the concepts I referred to, you may want to look for Word2Vec .
