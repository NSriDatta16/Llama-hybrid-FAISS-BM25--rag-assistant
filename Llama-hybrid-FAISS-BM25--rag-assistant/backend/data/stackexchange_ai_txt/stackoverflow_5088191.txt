WebPage Maker online?

Is there an existing CMS similar to what the WebPage Maker software can do? For those who don't know what WebPage Maker is, it's a webpage authoring software that features drag and drop functionality which allows users with minimal to no knowledge about HTML, to easily create webpages and publish it to their sites. I want to know if there's a CMS that does the same as this software already? WebPage Maker's website is http://www.webpage-maker.com/ P.S. I'm looking for something that I can implement on websites that I make.
