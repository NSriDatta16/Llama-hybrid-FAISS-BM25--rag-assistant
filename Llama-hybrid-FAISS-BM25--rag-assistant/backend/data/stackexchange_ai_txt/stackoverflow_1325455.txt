If the data volumes are small enough, I'd go with the following CREATE DATABASE LINK A CONNECT TO ... IDENTIFIED BY ... USING ....; INSERT INTO COPY SELECT * FROM table@A MINUS SELECT * FROM COPY; You say there are about 20,000 to copy, but not how many in the entire dataset. The other option is to delete the current contents of the copy and insert the entire contents of the original table. If the full datasets are large, you could go with a hash , but I suspect that it would still try to drag the entire dataset across the DB link to apply the hash in the local database.
