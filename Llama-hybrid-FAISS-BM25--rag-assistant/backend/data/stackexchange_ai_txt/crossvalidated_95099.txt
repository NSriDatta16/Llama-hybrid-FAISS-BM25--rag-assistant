R: result of Levene test correct?

I want to use the Levene test to quantify the homo/heterogeneity of the variances of two samples. The density plot looks like this: But the Levene test for the data [ hov(average~window,data=df) ] yields 1.531-e13, i.e. the probability that the variances are not equal is very high. But given the density plot, is this result reasonable or have I used the function incorrectly? To me the samples look identical, thus the variance should not be so different.
