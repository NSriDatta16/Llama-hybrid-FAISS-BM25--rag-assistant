Are there ORM (OKM) for key-value stores?

Object-Relational-Mappers have been created to help applications (which think in terms of objects) deal with stored data in a more application-friendly way like every other class/object. However, I have never seen a OKM (Object-Key/Value-Mapper) for NoSQL "Key/Value" storage systems. Which seems odd because the need should be far greater given the fact that more value-relations will have to be hard-coded into the app than a regular, single SQL table row object. four requests: user:id user:id:name user:id:email user:id:created vs one request: user = [id => ..., name => ..., email => ...] Plus you must keep track of "lists" (post has_many comments) since you don't have has_many through tables or foreign keys. INSERT INTO user_groups (user_id, group_id) VALUES (23, 54) vs usergroups:user_id = {54,108,32,..} groupsuser:group_id = {23,12,645,..} And there are lots more examples of the added logic that an application would need to replicate some basic features that normal relational databases use. All of these reasons make the idea of a OKM sound like a shoe-in. Are there any? Are there any reasons there are not any?
