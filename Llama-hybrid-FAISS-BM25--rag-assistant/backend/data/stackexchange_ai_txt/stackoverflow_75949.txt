Typecasting using "as" is of course much faster when the cast fails, as it avoids the expense of throwing an exception. But it is not faster when the cast succeeds. The graph at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/csharpcasts.aspx is misleading because it doesn't explain what it's measuring. The bottom line is: If you expect the cast to succeed (i.e. a failure would be exceptional), use a cast. If you don't know if it will succeed, use the "as" operator and test the result for null.
