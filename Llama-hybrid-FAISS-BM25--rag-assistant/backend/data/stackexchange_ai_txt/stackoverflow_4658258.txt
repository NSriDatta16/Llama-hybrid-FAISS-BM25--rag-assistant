Excel multi-column averages

I need to take the value in two data columns A and C, get a percentage by dividing the current value of columns A and C by the top value (which is a total), and then average the two percentages and spit them out in column D. For example D2 should be (100(226/508)+(100(218/490))) / 2). I'd prefer to do this with one equation - is it possible? A B C D 1 508 490 2 226 44.49% 218 3 229 45.08% 221
