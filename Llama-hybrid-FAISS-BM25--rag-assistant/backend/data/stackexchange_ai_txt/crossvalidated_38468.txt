I agree that the example is weird. I meant it to be more of a puzzle really. (The example is actually due to Ed George.) It does raise the question of what it means for something to be "known". Christian says that $c$ is known. But, at least from the purely subjective probability point of view, you don't know it just because it can in principle be known. (Suppose you can't do the numerical integral.) A subjective Bayesian regards everything as a random variable with a distribution, including $c$. At any rate, the paper A. Kong, P. McCullagh, X.-L. Meng, D. Nicolae, and Z. Tan (2003), A theory of statistical models for Monte Carlo integration , J. Royal Statistic. Soc. B , vol. 65, no. 3, 585â€“604 (with discussion) treats essentially the same problem. The example that Chris Sims alludes to in his answer is of a very different nature.
