Since you have time series data, your data is auto-correlated thus this means you have violated the independence assumption underlying the t test. I suggest that you build an ARMAX model at a higher level of aggregation say monthly. Use Intervention Detection schemes along with an ARIMA structure to identify to test for a possible mean shift or change in trend over the 48 months.
