How could I confirm if the time series is stationary?

I'm using KPSS method to check if the time series is stationary, but I would also like to use another test to confirm the hypothesis that the time series is stationary. I'm already using Unit root tests as ADF or PP, but I need a more specific test to check the stationarity. What method should I use?
