How to initialize UITableView? Both from XIB and programmatically?

I have a simple request that I have spent much time on (embarrassingly).. I have sub-classed a UITableView to add some functionality. These new features require things like NSMutableSet which require allocation/initialization. I have put my object's initialization routine in - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame style:(UITableViewStyle)style { which I understood from the apple docs to correct - but this doesn't get called (determined by break-pointing on the code). I am using IB, and have dragged a UITableView onto the view, and changed it's class to my new sub-class. There is no UITableViewController . I have also tried: - (void)loadView { - (id)init { - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { with no success. I would like to have this class work both with IB, and programmatically in the future. Everything works apart from the location of this initialization..
