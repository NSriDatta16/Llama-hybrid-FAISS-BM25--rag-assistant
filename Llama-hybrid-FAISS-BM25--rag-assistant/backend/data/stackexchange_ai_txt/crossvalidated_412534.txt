I'm an ecological parasitologist. The way you should handle this is by cbind -ing the hosts that were parasitised and the ones that were not, and then using a binomial distribution. Let's say you want to look at parasitised larvae: you would have n. of larvae that were healthy, and n. that were parasitised. For example, given Lh and Lp: parasitizedL=cbind(Lp, Lh) hist(parasitized) I'm guessing you can just use a regular binomial distribution with glm() , and might not need neg.binomial model. PLarvae1=glm(parasitizedL~B.type+Month+Season, family=binomial,data=MI.df) Then do stepwise model reduction to see which of your factors significantly effect parasitism: see this link . However it looks like you need to have random effects to account for repetitive sampling, so likely your random effect will be (1|Season/Month) , but it's hard to tell without knowing your data.
