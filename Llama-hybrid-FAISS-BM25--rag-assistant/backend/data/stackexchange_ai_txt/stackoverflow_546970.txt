How to quickly organize functions in source code (c#) to order by alphabetical order?

I'm doing some class clean to organize the functions in cs file in alphabetical order. I'm using Visual Studio 2008. When writing them, I just put them arbitrarily, but it now looks quite messy. Is there some easy way to organize them automatically? Better to have a tool because there're quite a lot files to clean up.
