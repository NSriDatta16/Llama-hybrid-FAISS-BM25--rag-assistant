I'm a little torn on helping on this question because I think that you're being given good advice above about modifying your question and using this site in a better way. But at the same time, I hate when questions are closed so quickly on here because the people with those votes just do a terrible job with that privilege (a privilege that I have but rarely use because nothing should be closed here). So, I'm going to choose to help here but please use the feedback you're being given when posting here in the future. When I interview most data scientists, I am looking for understanding of concepts and rationale. With this particular question, I don't think they are looking for deep detail; a smart scientist starts by getting a high view into the project. So I think that with this question, they want to see how you walk through the analysis. I would reply with the following, roughly in this order: What is the business case the algorithm is trying to solve? Is this algorithm predictive or is it doing categorizations? How many factors are in the complete dataset? How many factors are actually used? Is it a neural network or does it use "traditional approaches" like regression, decision trees, etc, etc? Can you show me a confusion matrix for the results? What is the accuracy? What is the recall? What is the precision? Can you show me an ROC curve? I think that at this point, once you are given the information and have time to analyze it, you will be in a much better position to make statements about a particular model. Good luck!
