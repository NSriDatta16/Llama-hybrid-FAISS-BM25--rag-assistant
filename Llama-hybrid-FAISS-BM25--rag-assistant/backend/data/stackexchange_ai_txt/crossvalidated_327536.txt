Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) For GBM, I would suggest any reputable textbook on quantitative finance, such as Joshi or Shreve Vol. II . In fact, finance is where this concept was originally developed mathematically . Let's say we wish to model the price of a stock by Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), also known as a "random walk". This model can be represented by the following Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE): $$ dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t $$ Some key points are as follows: This is a stochastic process. Although the drift/growth term $\mu S_t dt$ is deterministic, the diffusion/volatility term $\sigma S_t dW_t$ is random. The increments $dW_t$ are stationary, independent & normally distributed It is relatively simple to see that GBM is both a Markov process and a Martingale . We can gain insight into where the "Geometric" in GBM comes from by rewriting the SDE as $ \frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \mu dt + \sigma dW_t $. By interpreting $\frac{dS_t}{S_t}$ as the percentage change in price (i.e. the return) we can see that movements in the stock price are proportional to the current stock price. The famous Black-Scholes pricing model, among others, is based on asset price movements following GBM. Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm) fBm is a more advanced topic. Shevchenko's lecture notes and the Wikipedia page are a good place to start. The original Mandelbrot (1968) paper summarises the idea best. With a slight change of notation: We propose to designate a family of Gaussian random functions defined as follows: $B_t$ being ordinary Brownian motion, and $H$ a parameter satisfying $0 So we are no longer assuming that increments are independent of one another across time; rather, they are related by a covariance function parameterised by the Hurst exponent $H$: $$ E[B_t^H B_s^H] = \frac{1}{2} \big( t^{2H} + s^{2H} - |t-s|^{2H} \big) $$ The Hurst exponent $H$ is the key parameter of this stochastic process: Setting $H>\frac{1}{2}$ is appropriate for modelling "slow" processes like interest rates. Setting $H=\frac{1}{2}$ recovers GBM, Setting $H (image from Shevchenko) I think it's difficult to "get" fBm and the purpose of the covariance function without understanding Gaussian Processes , of which it is an example. Luckily, many machine learning textbooks now cover this topic, including MacKay and Rasmussen .
