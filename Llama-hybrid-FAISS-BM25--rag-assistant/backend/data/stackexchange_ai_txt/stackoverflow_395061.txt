There is a Software Engineering Radio interview with Jim Hendler dating from early November, 2008, that discusses the state of the art in that area. His book, Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist: Effective Modeling in RDFS and OWL , has gotten high marks for its practical coverage of the area. Chasing links from that interview led me to Protege , an active open-source project at Stanford University.
