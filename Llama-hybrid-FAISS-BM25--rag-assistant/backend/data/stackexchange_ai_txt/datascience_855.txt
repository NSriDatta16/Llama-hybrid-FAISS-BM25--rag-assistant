Below you can find a copy of my answer to a related (however, focused on data cleaning aspect) question here on Data Science StackExchange ( https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/722/2452 ), provided in its entirety for readers' convenience. I believe that it partially answers your question as well and hope it is helpful. While the answer is focused on R ecosystem, similar packages and/or libraries can be found for other data analysis environments . Moreover, while the two cited papers on data preparation also contain examples in R, these papers present general workflow (framework) and best practices that are applicable to any data analysis environment. R contains some standard functions for data manipulation, which can be used for data cleaning, in its base package ( gsub , transform , etc.), as well as in various third-party packages, such as stringr , reshape , reshape2 , and plyr . Examples and best practices of usage for these packages and their functions are described in the following paper: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf . Additionally, R offers some packages specifically focused on data cleaning and transformation: editrules deducorrect StatMatch MatchIt DataCombine A comprehensive and coherent approach to data cleaning in R, including examples and use of editrules and deducorrect packages, as well as a description of workflow ( framework ) of data cleaning in R, is presented in the following paper, which I highly recommend: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf .
