Apache Forrest as a Code Documentation Solution

Lately, I have been looking into Apache Forrest as a code documentation solution. From Apache's website, "Apache Forrestâ„¢ software is a publishing framework that transforms input from various sources into a unified presentation in one or more output formats. The modular and extensible plug-in architecture of Apache Forrest is based on Apache Cocoon and the relevant industry standards that separate presentation from content. Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a dynamic server, or be deployed by its automated facility." I was wondering if Apache Forrest could be used as a way to organize and post documentation of some java code which is complete with JavaDoc comments. I know JavaDoc can do it itself, but I feel like Apache Forrest provides some additional customization. I found instructions on the Apache website on how to include it in Maven, but it appears to be tailored towards Maven 1.x and I use Maven 2. Is something like this possible? And if so, what is the best way to go about integrating it? Thanks ahead of time.
