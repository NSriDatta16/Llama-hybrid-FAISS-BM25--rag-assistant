Is there a particular reason to delay processing until all have arrived? One method that I've used quite successfully in the past is to dequeue the message and persist the relevant data and sequence number from the message into local storage. Furthermore, as each message arrives, I increment the number of messages received and the total number of messages expected in storage. Finally, all messages have arrived and the increment counter equals the expected number of messages, I perform the actual work. In this way, we are able to receive all of the messages, but only perform the real work as per your requirements.
