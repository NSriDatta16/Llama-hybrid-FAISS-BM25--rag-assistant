You may want to look at your target audience as well to help determine how you want to make it harder (since you can't realistically prevent it).. For the simple user just disabling the right click may be good enough to prevent it. Slightly more work would be to do as others had suggested and create an image. With the image you'd probably want to set a background-image on a DIV or something since you can easily drag images, using the IMG tag, straight from the page onto you desktop, or wherever. From there you could use Flash, or some other RIA, or maybe even SVG/VML.. Anyone who knows how to do a screen capture really narrows down what you can feasibly implement :(
