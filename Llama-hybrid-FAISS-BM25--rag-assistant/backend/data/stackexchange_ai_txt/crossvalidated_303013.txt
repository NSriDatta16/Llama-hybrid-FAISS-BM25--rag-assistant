multiple output layer in tensorflow

I have code in Tensorflow using CNN model to detect text. The Model contain 9-conv layers flowed with RELU activation and 4-max pooling layers with window and stride equal to 2. image size is 224*224*3, and the label for each image is (x,y,width,height); where the x and y are the text coordinate(location) in image, width and height are the bounding box size. Now, how can I use the (x,y,w,h) in Dens regression layers? Should I uses 4-dens layer (one layer for each value in the coordinate and size). If I can do this, it will be correct to use 4-loss function (MSE error) which each loss function for one Dens layer? also should I use an optimizer for each one? Or is there another way to use just one Dens layer?
