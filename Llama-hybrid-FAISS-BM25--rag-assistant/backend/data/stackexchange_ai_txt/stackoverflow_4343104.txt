I heard a great explanation of this (apologies to the author, I've forgotten who it was): At a very high level, IoC is good when you want one thing for a given interface, MEF is good for when you want all things from a given interface. For instance in IoC you want to return a specific single concrete class for an interface: For ().Use (); Whenever you want to use a ICanFactory you will get a CarFactory . MEF is good for saying give me all the car factories: CheapCarFactory : ICarFactory FamilyCarFactory : ICarFactory LuxuryCarFactory : ICarFactory Etc.
