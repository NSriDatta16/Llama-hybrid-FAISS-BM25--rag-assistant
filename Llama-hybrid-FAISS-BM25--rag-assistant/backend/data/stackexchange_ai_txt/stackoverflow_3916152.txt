SVN Log/diff on files in a deleted directory

In my project another dev reorganised some files, and now I'm having some issues getting at the diffs of them :-( I started out thinking that it'd be nice to get webSVN to be able to show these diffs, now I'd just like to be able to see them myself! I know that the 'svn way' is to treat deletion as an operation on the parent directory, but my problem is compounded by the fact that the files were in a subdirectory, which has been deleted. Original structure: conf/ files/ configfile1 configfile2 Here's what happened: $ svn log -vr 5 ... D /conf/files A /conf/combined_configfile What I'm trying to get is a diff of the changes previously introduced in the config files, before the delete happened. Something like this would be nice: svn diff -r 2:4 conf/files/configfile1 svn: 'conf/files' is not a working copy svn: 'conf/files' does not exist or even: svn diff -r 2:4 'conf/files' svn: 'conf/files' is not under version control or how about: svn diff -r 2:4 'https://svnhost.localdomain/project1/conf/files' svn: '/proj1/!svn/bc/1343/conf/files' path not found It seems like the only way to get at this history is through svn operations on a directory that's currently present in the head revision of the repository ( conf/ in this case), widening the scope of the diff massively. Surely there must be a better way?
