It's possible, you have to .load sos.dll in your ADPlus script. This blog post shows you how. Beware of the questionable joys of debugging managed code from a minidump. If you are running into hard-to-diagnose exceptions while it is still in QA, you'll run into it again when it goes into production. With dragons breathing fire added then. Take care of good unhandled exception logging by writing an event handler for AppDomain.UnhandledException. Logging e.ExceptionObject.ToString() gives a wealth of information.
