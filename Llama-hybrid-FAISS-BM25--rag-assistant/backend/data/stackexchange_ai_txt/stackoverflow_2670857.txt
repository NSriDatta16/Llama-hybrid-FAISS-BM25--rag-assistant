Neural Network Inputs and Outputs to meaningful values

I'm trying to determine how to transform my "meaningful input" into data for an Artificial Neural Network and how to turn the output into "meaningful output". The way I can always see of doing it is by convering everything to categories with binary values. For example, rather than outputting age, having a 0-1 for Same with the inputs, where I might be using for example, hair colour. Is the only way to turn this into input to have Blonde 0-1, Brown 0-1, etc? Am I missing some entire topic of ANNs? Most of the books and similar I read use theoretical examples.
