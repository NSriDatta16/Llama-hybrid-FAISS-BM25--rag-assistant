I think you want to use the reserve function to reserve space in the vector for the required number of items. Have a look here: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/reserve/ Before you remove an item from the vector you could call reserve with the current size to keep the capacity the same. Request a change in capacity Requests that the capacity of the allocated storage space for the elements of the vector container be at least enough to hold n elements. This informs the vector of a planned increase in size, although notice that the parameter n informs of a minimum, so the resulting capacity may be any capacity equal or larger than this. When n is greater than the current capacity, a reallocation is attempted during the call to this function. If successful, it grants that no further automatic reallocations will happen because of a call to vector::insert or vector::push_back until the vector size surpasses at least n (this preserves the validity of iterators on all these future calls). A reallocation invalidates all previously obtained iterators, references and pointers to elements of the vector. In any case, a call to this function never affects the elements contained in the vector, nor the vector size (for that purposes, see vector::resize or vector::erase, which modify the vector size and content).
