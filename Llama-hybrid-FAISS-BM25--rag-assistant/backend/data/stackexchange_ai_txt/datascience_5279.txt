How to select topology for neural network?

I was given a target function to design neural network and train: (y = (x1 ∧ x2) ∨ (x3 ∧ x4)) The number of input and number of output seems obvious (4 and 1). And the training data can use truth table. However, in order to train as a multilayer artificial neural network, I need to choose number of hidden units. May I know where can I find some general guideline for this? Thank you!
