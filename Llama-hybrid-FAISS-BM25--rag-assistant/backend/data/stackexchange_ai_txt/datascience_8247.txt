Deploying machine learning modules

I am looking to find some resources about what I wan't to do :I wan't to make some GUI of my machine learning models and finally deploy them as a web app.I find R Shiny to be somehow ok , but it limits me only to use R,and I have also Python things.Looking at the azure ml studio it brings somekind of workflow like in Disco and ProM from process mining, but I am not sure how much pain will be to feed everything like ensembles/grid search etc to those flow components,also the full paid version is very expensive. Trying to do a web application from scratch could also not be ok cause it will be a lot of pain when I will modify my models. Any suggestions?
