"Chaining" Animation-events with Callbacks. Suppose you wanted to animate a paragraph vanishing upon clicking it. You also wanted to remove the element from the DOM afterwards. You may think you can simply chain the methods: $("p").click(function(e) { $(this).fadeOut("slow").remove(); }); In this example, .remove() will be called before .fadeOut() has completed, destroying your gradual-fading effect, and simply making the element vanish instantly. Instead, when you want to fire a command only upon finishing the previous, use the callback's: $("p").click(function(e){ $(this).fadeOut("slow", function(){ $(this).remove(); }); }); The second parameter of .fadeOut() is an anonymous function that will run once the .fadeOut() animation has completed. This makes for a gradual fading, and a subsequent removal of the element.
