is PHP/mysql still a way to go? Yes, PHP/MYSQL (LAMP) has been successfully used in hundreds of sites with exponentially larger user bases than yours. could a framework like codeIgnitor be a basis for such an application or should I develop everything from the scratch? Nontrivial PHP sites built without a framework (or a custom built framework) tends to get sloppy fast. PHP frameworks are now the norm for getting started, I would personally recommend the Zend Framework . It's a very robust framework, providing tools for many common PHP tasks (replacement/enhancements for Database, Date, JSON, RPC, REST) and an organized methodology for web application development: MVC using Zend_Controller . do you know any kind of survey specific framework I could use as a basis? None that I know of, but you may want to try using Zend_Form to automatically generate form elements (type, filters, sanitizers, validators) from configuration files.
