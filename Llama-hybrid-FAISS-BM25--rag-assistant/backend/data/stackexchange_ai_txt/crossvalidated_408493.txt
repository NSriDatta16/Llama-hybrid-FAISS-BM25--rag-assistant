There are multiple different reconstruction losses that you could use, but it's not a bad idea to use losses from some previous papers. In INFO VAE, the author Shengjia Zhao uses square loss between input and output as the reconstruction loss. You might want to look at some of the different reconstruction losses that different authors use, but Square loss is a great start!
