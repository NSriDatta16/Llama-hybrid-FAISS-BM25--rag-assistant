Classic ASP ADODB with SQL Server Compact Edition 3.5 is not working in Command Parameters

I'm new to SQL CE. I'm programming in Classic ASP, connecting the SQL CE using ADODB.Connection. I have created the table and trying to insert data from the ASP. I tried in 3 ways. The inline insert statement [e.g. INSERT INTO tblName(col1, col2) VALUES(1,2)] (WORKED) The parameterized insert statement [e.g. INSERT INTO tblName(Col1) VALUES(?)] (WORKED). I added the Command Parameter and supplied the value. The parameterized insert statement with more than one param ( FAILED) I dont know what wrong with multiple parameters. It throwing me the unhandled error when the Cmd.Execute statement runs. "The remote procedure call failed and did not execute." I did lots of Google to find out the issue. But no use. I didn't get any clues. Please help me to solve this issue -Ganesh
