I have paperclip with S3 and Heroku on two apps. This is what worked for me: In your mode: has_attached_file :image, :styles => { :thumb => "250x250>" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => "username/:attachment/:style/:id.:extension" in config/s3.yml development: bucket: name access_key_id: xyz secret_access_key: xyz test: bucket: name access_key_id: xyz secret_access_key: xyz production: bucket: name access_key_id: xyz secret_access_key: xyz and of course in your environment.rb you need to have the gem included or however you include gems.
