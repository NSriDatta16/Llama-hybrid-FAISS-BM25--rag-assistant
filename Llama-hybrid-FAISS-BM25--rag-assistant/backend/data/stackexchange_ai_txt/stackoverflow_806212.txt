Outlook style events calendar for project based on MVC framework

I need large Calendar (not jQuery datepicker) with possibility to schedule events and show them on calendar. Calendar must support month/week/day views. It is very desirable for Calendar not to reload whole page when view changes (AJAX refresh). It must be easily customizable (CSS themes) and localizable. It should support drag & drop (for scheduled events). Such Calendar must be rendered on client side from JSON data snippet. I know there are too many requirements to find Calendar that matches them all but all they are important. I have found some free open source Calendar controls, but almost all are tightly tuned for ASP.NET but not MVC or have very "heavy" JavaScript codebase. Ideally i see it as jQuery extension but not server side ASP.NET control. The best ready-to-use solution I have found is FullCalendar by Adam Shaw ( http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ ). It is jQuery plugin which source code I can change to fit my needs. If you can suggest some better existing solutions I'll be very appreciative.
