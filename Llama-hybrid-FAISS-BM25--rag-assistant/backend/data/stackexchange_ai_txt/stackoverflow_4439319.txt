first of all it would be better to analyze what the whole thing is doing (semantically) rather than looking at sequences of code. So the remainder of this post is a bit speculative .... There are a couple of textboxes displayed on the screen TextBox1 ... initialized with value 1(double), later containing current time ( now() ) (imho a sin in itself - brrrr - hope there is good business logic explanation for this) TextBox3 ... initialized with the current date TextBox4 ... initialized with "something we don't know" - hopefully a date ( MyDate ), and formated as Weekday ( "dddd" ) TextBox10 - TextBox12 ... seem to be used to calculate a variable SumCashUp we have some more variables which may be textboxes as well (as sometimes we see a .Text added in the code) txtTurnoverIncl txtTurnoverExcl txtRoyalty SumCashUp and a code fragment that calculates a 14% margin from a Gross ( *14/114 ), rounds and formats the result ... and we have no clue about where this result is used. We can speculate that it may be another form field (because of .Text ) - maybe txtRoyalty - but we don't know. Basically all the code fragments are about putting values into textboxes displayed on the screen and/or using the values of that text boxes to compute something (like the SumCashUp or a 14% GM). So I guess the path to the solution must be get the source layout of textboxes understand the business logic create a HTML page containing a form with similar objects (textboxes, a submit button, etc.) write PHP code that implements the business logic - most probably as a reaction to a POST event triggered by a Submit button You already received a couple of code fragments, but one needs to put this into a greater context, otherwise the code blocks won't help.
