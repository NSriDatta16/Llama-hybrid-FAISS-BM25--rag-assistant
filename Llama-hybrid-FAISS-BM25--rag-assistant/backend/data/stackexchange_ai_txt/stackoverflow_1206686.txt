jQuery media browser

I am attempting to build out a visual jQuery based browser for thumbnailed assets grouped by the upload date of the asset. The backend part is fine, but I'm having a really hard time finding a workable visual solution that can handle (potentially) hundreds to thousands of assets smoothly. The display of the content is not an issue as it is being handled by a lightbox, I just need to figure out a way to actually display the thumbnails. I've been trying to interface with this plugin but have been running into a lot of problems once it gets over 100 records, everything just becomes horribly unresponsive. Ideally I want to be able to build ajax into this for loading media as needed rather than a bulk get on page load. Does anyone know of a good plugin that can be leveraged to achieve this effect or at least provide a good user interface for browsing large amounts of content? To clarify: I have properly generated thumbnails being made when an asset is uploaded, these are what are displayed on the page, and the full size image is only loaded in the lightbox when the thumbnail is clicked. I'm just trying to determine a good way to browse a large quantity of thumbnails sorted by upload date.
