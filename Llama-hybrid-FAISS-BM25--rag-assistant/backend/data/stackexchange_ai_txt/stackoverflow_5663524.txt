If size is an intended configurable attribute, I'm not sure this will be so easy. Magento does not allow you to redefine the attributes upon which an item is configurable after creation time. After creating the attribute and adding it to the attribute set, you'll probably need to hack it at the database level to make the attribute configurable. That means your simple child products will also need modification to have a size attribute. Good luck. Make sure to come back and tell us what you did to make it work. Thanks, Joe
