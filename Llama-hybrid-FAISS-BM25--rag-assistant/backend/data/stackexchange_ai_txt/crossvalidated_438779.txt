Linear regression - Bayesian Predictive distribution

I am trying to answer a question about linear regression but i am stuck: $y=w \cdot x + \epsilon, \epsilon \sim N(0,\alpha)$ i am also given a prior: $w\sim N(0,\beta)$ from which i was able to work out that: $p(w|S)=const * exp(-\frac{1}{2\alpha} \sum (y^{i} - w \cdot x^{i})^{2}-\frac{1}{2\beta}w^{2})))$ Where $S$ is the sample training data Now i want to work out $p_{y}(\bar{y}|S,\bar{x})$ where $\bar{y}$ is output when $\bar{x}$ is novel input data I have been told to use marginal and conditional guassian linear models. I am just confused on what to do now...
