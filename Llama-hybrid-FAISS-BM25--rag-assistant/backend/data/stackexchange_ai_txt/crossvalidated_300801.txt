GARCH vs ARCH models - which is more parsimonious?

As I understand the inclusion of the GARCH term, $\sigma^2$, in a GARCH model allows for an infinite number of time series terms, $\epsilon^2$, to influence the conditional variance. Is this the case? How does this characteristic enable the GARCH model to be more parsimonious than the ARCH model?
