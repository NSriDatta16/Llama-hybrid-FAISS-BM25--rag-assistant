For which dimensions do Neural Networks become favorable to multidimensional interpolation methods?

Say I have a high-dimensional function and I'm trying to approximate/interpolate it. The typical methods I've found were Gaussian Process, spline interpolation (and others here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_interpolation#Regular_grid ), and neural networks. I was searching the literature but I couldn't find papers that compare these methods in high dimensions ( $D > 5)$ . Have there been studies on this or resources for learning about the performance of each of these methods in high dimensions?
