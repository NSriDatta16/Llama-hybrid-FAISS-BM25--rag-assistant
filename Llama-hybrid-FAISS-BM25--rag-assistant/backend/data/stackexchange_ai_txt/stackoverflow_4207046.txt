Sencha Touch 1.0 has been released this week and is free for commercial use now. Sencha Touch 1.0 is compatible with Apple iOS and Google Android. Sencha Touch is the world's first app framework built specifically to leverage HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript for the highest level of power, flexibility, and optimization. We make specific use of HTML5 to deliver components like audio and video, as well as a localStorage proxy for saving data offline. localStorage is a new HTML5 feature which allows to store data on the client. However, it differs from cookies in some key ways. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Storage Sencha is the company behind Ext JS , the Javascript library which is also available over a Delphi wrapper/binding called extpascal , so it is possible that Sencha is based on Ext JS technology, and writing a Delphi client web app could be a logical integration path.
