I'm not sure why you did PCA as opposed to factor analysis or partial least squares, but, in either case, you have to figure out what that score means. That's up to you and is based on the loadings on the variables that went into the PCA. The fact that you took logs of the variables before doing PCA means that the interpretation of the score will be a bit different. But the interpretation of the regression coefficients is still the same: As the IV goes up by 1 point, the DV is predicted to go up by $\beta$ points, But the IV is now quite abstract. You would need to make a case for the meaning of your PC separately from the regression. There's no guarantee that this will be optimal. PCA regression has its issues. That's why partial least squares might be useful. This was discussed here on CV in this thread
