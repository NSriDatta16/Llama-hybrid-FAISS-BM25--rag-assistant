MySQL actually has a built in average function SELECT AVG(rating) as average_rating, id FROM rating WHERE id=$id GROUP BY id If for some reason you really wanted to use the SUM, you could use SELECT SUM(rating)/COUNT(rating) as average_rating, id FROM rating WHERE id=$id GROUP BY id Hopefully not though!
