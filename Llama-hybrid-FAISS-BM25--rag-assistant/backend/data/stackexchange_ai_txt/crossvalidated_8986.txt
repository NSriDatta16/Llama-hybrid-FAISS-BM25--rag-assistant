You may want to examine the GAM package in R, as it can be adapted to do some (or all) of what you are looking for. The original paper ( Hastie & Tibshirani, 1986 ) is available via OpenAccess if you're up for reading it. Essentially, you model a single dependent variable as being an additive combination of 'smooth' predictors. One of the typical uses is to have time series and lags thereof as your predictors, smooth these inputs, then apply GAM. This method has been used extensively to estimate daily mortality as a function of smoothed environmental time series, especially pollutants. It's not OpenAccess, but ( Dominici et al., 2000 ) is a superb reference, and ( Statistical Methods for Environmental Epidemiology with R ) is an excellent book on how to use R to do this type of analysis.
