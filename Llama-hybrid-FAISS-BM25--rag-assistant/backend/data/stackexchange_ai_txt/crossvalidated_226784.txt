There are two things at play here. First off, there are five other variables, many of which appear to have strong effect sizes. Since these variables aren't completely independent, a positive correlation does not necessarily imply a positive coefficient. Second, you should look at the average of the log farm sizes rather than the log of the average farm sizes if you want to see which group is bigger in the eyes of your regression model.
