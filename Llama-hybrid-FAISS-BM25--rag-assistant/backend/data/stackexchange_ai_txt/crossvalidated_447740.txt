Good to see you figured out you initialized the weights to 0. But this shouldn't be a direct cause for the above effect by itself. The reason is that you have a posterior collapse , this means your decoder ignores whatever the encoder is providing and generates the same outcome. A few ways to fix it is to change your bottle-neck or consider alternative architectures such as VAEs (that still are susceptible but should be less)
