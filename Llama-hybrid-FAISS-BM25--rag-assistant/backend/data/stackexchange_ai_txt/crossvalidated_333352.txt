It depends what "all reasonable functions" consists of. If you have a set of functions that is narrow enough that any function in the set can be fitted with only one data point on each $c$ value, then yes, there will obviously be some transformation $S$ that achieves this. The problem is, your setup does not tell you anything about how to construct this function $S$ other than by fitting the model with all the data points first. That defeats the purpose of the problem, since presumably you want a method that allows you to fit your model without all the data points, and still have some likelihood of having reasonable accuracy. I would think that a better approach here would be to posit a well-specified class of models (e.g., linear regression, or some kind of GLM) and then see what happens if you estimate the regression line by using only a "representative" value of $s$ at each $c$ value (e.g., the sample mean). You could then derive results about how close this low-data method approximates the full model fit using all the data points. (Also, as an aside, you say in your post that the blue dots have some symmetric distribution around the average. That does not seem to me to be consistent with the plot you have displayed; the plot shows evidence of positive skew in the vertical distribution of these points.)
