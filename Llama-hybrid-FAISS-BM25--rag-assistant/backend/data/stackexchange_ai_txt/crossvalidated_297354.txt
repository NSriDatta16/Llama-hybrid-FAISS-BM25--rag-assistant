How does whitening or decorrelation help machine learning models?

One of the steps in performing whitening is decorrelation. I understand that decorrelation reduces the correlation among various input features, but haven't found a compelling reason why reduced correlation helps machine learning models perform better most of the times. Is there any mathematical or intuitive explanation to explain this or it's mostly an empirical finding?
