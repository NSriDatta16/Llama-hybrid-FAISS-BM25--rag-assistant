How can I make random forest have multiple valid outcomes?

I am new in machine learning I will describe my problem with similar approach. I want to make a random forest with multiple but diffrent outcomes. My example is I want the decision tree or random forest to decide which clothes should i wear in some event(example custome party or bussniess meeting...) but I need it to decide which hat is appropriate, which t-shirt is appropriate, shoes... All have the same root that is me wearing them and the event but with diffrent clothes body parts. For example in bussniss meeting in my upper half I will wear a suit with tie or butterfly tie and blue texido or black texido I mean in the same tree there will possible multiple outcomes. I hope what I mean is clear.
