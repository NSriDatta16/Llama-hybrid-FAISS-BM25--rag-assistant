I'd say that like most things, it depends on what kind of information you're trying to organize. For example, here on Stack Overflow, there isn't really a rigid hierarchy by which to sort the questions. They're much more organic in the sense that they can span multiple, and even unrelated, disciplines or fields and create a whole host of dynamic connections. For organizing this type of information, I think tags are an appropriate replacement for traditional, hierarchical taxonification. The decentralized, dehierarchized nature of tagging dovetails perfectly with the general organization of the site's content, especially when the site's users/community is encouraged to participate in cataloguing and organizing the information. Many blogs and social networking sites like Delicious organize their content with a series of tags as well. Conversely, if you're trying to sell products or provide technical support, you'll probably find that tagging is not a suitable replacement for traditional taxonomic organization. If you're familiar with MSDN , which provides online documentation for developers in the Microsoft ecosystem, you'll observe that most of its content is organized into a natural hierarchy by technology/language, feature, sub-feature, etc. If you want to buy a computer from Dell , you start by narrowing down your choices: do you want a desktop, notebook, or tablet? Do you want a performance-oriented notebook, a desktop-replacement notebook, or an ultra-portable? Etc. Of course, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't consider implementing tags as an alternative way for users to explore the information that you have available, but in the best of cases, they will work together. Think about the type of content you plan to host on your site and consider the most natural way to organize that information. Your users will appreciate more than anything a site that is intuitive and where they feel it is easy to locate exactly what they're looking for.
