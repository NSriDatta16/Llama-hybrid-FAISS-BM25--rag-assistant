Offset and weights are very different things. Offset is really a covariable included in a model with a fixed coefficient of $1$, which is not estimated. They are mostly used with poisson models to represent exposure, see Should I use an offset for my Poisson GLM? , When to use an offset in a Poisson regression? and search this site, there are many posts. For example of use with logistic regression, see Using offset in binomial model to account for increased numbers of patients Weights are used to modify the estimation algorithm, by giving some observation more importance ("weight") than others. Their use varies by model type and software implementation, so you really have to read the docs! See also Can Weights and Offset lead to similar results in poisson regression?
