@cbeleites actually to add on the following statement "But you need to be aware that this is a non-standard procedure and should be explained clearly, and the averages should IMHO ", there is the following paper which states: "The problem with AUCmerge is that by sorting different folds together, it assumes that the classifier should produce well-calibrated probability estimates. Usually a researcher interested in measuring the quality of the probability estimates will use Brier score or such. By contrast, researchers who measure performance based on AUC typically are unconcerned with calibration or specific threshold values, being only concerned with the classifierâ€™s ability to rank positives ahead of negatives. So, AUCmerge adds a usually unintended requirement on the study: it will downgrade classifiers that rank well if they have poor calibration across folds, as we illustrate in Section 3.2." https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2009/HPL-2009-359.pdf Which seems to demonstrate that averaging the AUC should be indeed considered the standard procedure
