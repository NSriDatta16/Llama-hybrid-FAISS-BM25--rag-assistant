Just to add to what Ham already well put: If the font came with a MS or Adobe product, you are most likely not allowed to use the font in that way. See for example Microsoft Typography - Font Redistribution FAQ (I quoted this in a different question earlier but it's a slightly different context.) Q. What can I do with the fonts supplied with Microsoft products? A. The fonts are governed by the same restrictions as the products they are supplied with. You are not allowed to copy, redistribute or reverse engineer the font files. For full details see the license agreement supplied with the product. There is the option of "embedding" fonts, but I'm certain that does not apply to font-face Q. Can I embed Microsoft fonts in my documents? A. Embedding allows fonts to travel with documents. Most fonts distributed with Microsoft products allow embedding. To check a font's embedding permissions, right-click on the font file and choose 'Properties'.
