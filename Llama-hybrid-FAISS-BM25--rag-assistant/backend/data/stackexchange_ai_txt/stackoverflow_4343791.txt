Yes, you are using it correctly. There are better ways to organize the storage than this, but this will work. At least until you need more than 30 students... Note that you must call free() with each pointer that is returned by malloc() . That means that your loop over the array of pointers is the correct approach for your chosen architecture. Your attempt to call free on the array itself will not work. It invokes Undefined Behavior because you are passing a pointer (to the base of the array itself) to free() that did not come from a call to malloc() .
