Showing all HTTP data sent in C# using HttpWebRequest

I'm trying to hunt down why a POST request from a C# script isn't working, when the same request works fine in Python. I want to be able to have all the data sent by the script, and the response from the sever, to be displayed on the screen so that I can work out what the difference is between what the C# and Python scripts are sending. In Python I can do this with the standard httplib2 library by just using: httplib2.debuglevel = 1 This produces the following output (as an example): reply: 'HTTP/1.1 201 Created\r\n' header: Date: Tue, 05 Oct 2010 09:25:42 GMT header: Server: Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny9 with Suhosin-Patch header: X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny9 header: Location: http://example.org/api/2 header: Content-Length: 0 header: Content-Type: text/html send: 'GET /api/2 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.org\r\naccept-encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nuser-agent: Python-httplib2/$Rev$\r\n\r\n' Is there a way to produce similar output in C# using the HttpWebRequest class? I've seen mention of Fiddler in another question, but I'm running Linux and Fiddler appears to be for Windows only.
