[...] but by having the initial Prob. of each state (P(t=1)), and Transition prob. i can calculate prob. of each state in any given time [...] That sounds correct. You should be able to use induction and conditioning to deduce this. It has been a while since I've done anything with Markov Chains, so apologies in advance for any poor notation (also my first post ever :D ). The base case for induction should look something like this. Suppose that we know the initial probabilities as above. Then we have : $P_1[2] = P(X_2=1|X_1=1)P(X_1=1)+P(X_2=1|X_1=2)P(X_1=2)= S_1\epsilon_{11}[1]+S_2\epsilon_{21}[1],$ which are all known quantities. I think a simple induction argument should finish it from there.
