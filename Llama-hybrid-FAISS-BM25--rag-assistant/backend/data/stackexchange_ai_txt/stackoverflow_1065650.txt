I suggest you try that using DataSet instead of DataTable. I don't know that it will work, but it makes sense that it would. The schema might have included more than one table. OTOH, did the XmlNode include a schema at all? I recommend you look at this in the debugger. In particular, watch to see which node the XmlReader is positioned on. I'm not 100% convinced it will advance as you want, from the wrapping element, to the schema, then to the data. Also, is there an element wrapping the schema and data: Or are the schema and data elements top-level nodes. This would be a fragment.
