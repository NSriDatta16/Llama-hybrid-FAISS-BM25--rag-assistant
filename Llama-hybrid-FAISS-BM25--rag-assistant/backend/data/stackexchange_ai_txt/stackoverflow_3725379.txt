Your best option is to use Magento's translate feature. Notice how the text in Breadcrumbs.php is wrapped with ->__('text') which instructs Magento to see if there is a translation for text for the current module. If you turn on Translate Inline in System>Config>Admin>Developer , you will be able to edit the text on the page (after refreshing, click the red box then the little book icon). This will then be entered into the database in the core_translate table and replaced in future page renders. As a general rule, you should never edit files in app/code/code as you will break future upgrades and patches.
