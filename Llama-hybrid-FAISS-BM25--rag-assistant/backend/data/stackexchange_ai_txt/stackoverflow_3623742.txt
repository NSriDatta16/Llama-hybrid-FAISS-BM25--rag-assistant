From what I gather, it sounds like you need to organize this somehow. I recommend you try a tabbed-based application. Create three tabs with the first two having navigation controllers for your tables. The first tab will have the tableView that sorts by book title. The second tab will have the tableView that sorts by the author. The third tab can do the search for either case. Hopefully, that points you in the right direction.
