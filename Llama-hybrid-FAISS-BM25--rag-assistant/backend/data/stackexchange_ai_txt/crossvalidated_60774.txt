Is repeated measures ANOVA the right test?

I am studying a parameter in several organs of mice and I have two categorial factors. I would like to study the effects of those two factors on my parameter in each organ (I don't care about differences of the parameter bewteen organs). I was previously doing a two-way ANOVA for each organ but this led to multiple ANOVA tests. I think this could be a problem since it increases the risk of having false positive results. To adress the problem of multiple comparisons, could I perform a single repeated measure ANOVA test, taking organs as the within-subject factor (even though I don't want to study this factor) and the two remaining factors as between-subject factors ? In my mind, repeated measures ANOVA is mainly used to measure a parameter at different time points so I'm not quite sure about this test in this case. Thank you !
