Neural Network Assumptions in a Time series

I was wondering whether an artificial neural network regression, like ARIMA, requires statistically insignificant residual autocorrelation -- and, if so, why? I presume that, if I am using the ANN model to forecast prediction intervals, statistically insignificant heteroscedasticity and statistically significant residual normality are requisites. Is this correct?
