Try Decision Trees,Support Vector Machines or Naive-Bayes method with TF-IDF weighting for creating document vectors and check the Precision/Recall/F Measure scores. But this will not deal with unknown/new organizations, they will get classified to any other one. One way would be remodel/train again when there are so many unknown/new organization and the Precision/Recall/F Measure score too low.
