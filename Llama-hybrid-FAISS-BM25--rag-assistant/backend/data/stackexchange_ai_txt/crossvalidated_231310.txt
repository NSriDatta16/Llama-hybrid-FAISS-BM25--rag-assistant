It seems there are ARCH effects in your data, because the ACF and PACF values are statistically significantly different from zero. For high lags you could interpret them as being due to chance (because at 95% confidence level, on average 5% of the observed statistics will exceed the confidence bound purely due to chance). However, for low lags (such as 1 for ACF and 1, 2 for PACF) the effect can be thought of as being genuine, especially if there is a subject-matter explanation for it. (Don't pay attention to lag 0 in ACF, it indicates variance rather than autocorrelation.) You could do formal testing for presence of ARCH effects using the ARCH-LM test. But you already know the answer for low lags. Meanwhile, for high lags the power of the ARCH-LM test w.r.t. detecting the low-order ARCH effects will go down, because these effects will be swamped by absence of ARCH effects in the higher-order lags. You could try an ARCH(2) model to account for the ARCH effects.
