To find similarity between products you need a metric by which to measure it, which you haven't specified. for example, if you have items with only two features: $ i_1 = [0.9,0.5] , i_2 = [0.9,0.3], i_3 = [0.5, 0.5] $ in one application similarity in the first feature may be more important so item 1 and item 2 would be more similar than item 1 and item 3, but in a different application, feature 2 may be more important so item 1 would be more similar to item 3 than item 2. But generally speaking, you usually embed the categorical features into a continuous vector, you either bin and embed the continuous feature or directly transform it, and the date is usually used for feature engineering like holiday detection, weekday, month, etc.
