If you're passing multiple params in the query_string, you can get Domino to do a bit more of the work for you. There's an Function command - UrlQueryString - that can format the params into a list, delimiting at the "&". E.g. server/app.nsf/form?openform&ideaNum=1&var2=foo2 becomes a list: openform ideaNum=1 var2=foo2 To use it, on the destination form create a multi-value text field called something like "QryStringList". Set it to be computed when composed, and set it's value to @UrlQueryString. In your WebQueryOpen agent, you can access the params as doc.QryStringList(0), docQryStringList(1) and so on, if you're using Lotusscript. I'm fairly sure I put this together using info from the IBM/ldd forum, but the exact source is lost in the mists of time and memory, so apologies if I've copied someone's post.
