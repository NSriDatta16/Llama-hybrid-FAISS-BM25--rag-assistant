You can also estimate the location of the Cauchy using heavy-tail(s) Lambert W x F distributions (Disclaimer: I am the author.) since both are symmetric around $c$ (location of Cauchy) and $\mu_x$ (mean of the input X ~ F), respectively. In fact, I give an example of estimating the location of a Cauchy in the paper and compare the cumulative sample average estimates as suggested by user777. For F being the Normal distribution and $\alpha = 1$ , the transformed random variable $Y = func(X, \delta)$ reduces to Tukey's h distribution. For $\delta = 0$ they are the Normal distribution; for $\delta > 0$ they have heavier tails. The nice property of Lambert W x F distributions is that you can also go back from non-normal to Normal again; i.e., you can estimate parameters and Gaussianize() your data. In R you can simulate, estimate, plot, etc. several Lambert W x F distributions with the LambertW package. library(LambertW) library(MASS) # for fitdistr() LogLikCauchy $est["location"])) out tau beta.hat Now let's look at simulations # simulate and look at bias, std dev, and MSE nsim As we knew beforehand, the mean is a bad estimator, so we'll remove it from the plots. library(ggplot2) library(reshape2) theme_set(theme_bw(18)) est.m They all seem pretty close to each other (with median and IGMM being slightly worse).
