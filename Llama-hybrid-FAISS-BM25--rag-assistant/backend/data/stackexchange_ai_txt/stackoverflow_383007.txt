Code legibility and organization, like many have pointed out. Separation of similarly-named classes into different "spaces", like Network.Session, Meeting.Session, WebServer.Session, etc. In real world, there are many objects that bear the same or similar names. That's why names need their own spaces to qualify them. Namespaces also facilitate the naming of assemblies when used properly, like System.Web.DLL and System.Messaging.DLL . This helps code re-use, because you separate code into smaller functional chunks (DLLs) that can be included as needed, without including the whole giant mass (or mess). Namespaces are boundaries that separate code of different projects, purposes and categories. In larger projects where many DLL files are shared and re-used, programmers need a easily-memorable way to reference the right classes, and to avoid referencing the wrong classes. Can one imagine the unmanageable madness if Microsoft had decided to put all the .NET classes into one single "System" namespace? How would any programmer even start to write code to invoke these classes? Furthermore, you would need to deal with classes named like WindowsFormsTextBox and WebUIWebControlsTextBox or something longer than that. Having proper namespaces helps programmers write code quickly and safely. The benefit of namespaces become more obvious in larger projects, or when small projects gradually become large enough to be a issue. You can take a look at the size of the current projects, and determine how hard you need to twist your colleague's arms.
