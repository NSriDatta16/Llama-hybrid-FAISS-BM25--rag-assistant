Includes and requires are designed in part to allow you to organize your code and make maintaining your software easier to do. While there technically is a performance hit for using includes it is negligible and more then offset by increasing the maintainability of your software. Especially if you use an opcode cache. I wouldn't worry about this and chalk it up to premature optimization.
