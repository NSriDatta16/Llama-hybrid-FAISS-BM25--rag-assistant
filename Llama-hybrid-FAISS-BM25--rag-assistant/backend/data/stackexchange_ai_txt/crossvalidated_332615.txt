R- How to find the trend of irregular time series?

I'm working on marine fish ecological data, on an irregular time scale with data only for 1993,1994,2006,2007,2009,2014,2016 and 2017. For each year, I have computed several taxonomic and functionnal diversity indices over my study area. I would to determine if there are trends in my data series, but I'm not very confident with the method I should use. I tried with pastecs :: trend.test() but this Spearman's rank test considers that the input is a regular time series, and I imagine that the 12 years gap give a false output of the test. Would it work with a simple lm(indice~year) with using the positive or negative correlation as a trend ? Or should I find an other test?
