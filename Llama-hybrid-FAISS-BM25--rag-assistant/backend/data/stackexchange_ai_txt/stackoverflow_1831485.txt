This really depends what kind of speed information you are interested in. You must be aware of several things: The speed test may be skewed by caching CDN servers that catch a request (assuming you are checking for HTTP response speed) The offchance of the network traffic veering to a congested network DNS caching My suggestion is to make requests to a fair amount of unique sites for it to test. [Within an accetable margin of error] Test lots of them and take the average speed, that is what you can generally expect from a client. The max is an estimated maximum that a client can get. The minimum that a client can guarentee is 0mbs.
