What does environment dynamic means in Reinforcement learning

From the book Reinforcement learning: an introduction, I have two questions: 1) there is the following sentence: "If the environment's dynamics are completely known, then finding the optimal policy for the state-value function is a system of |S| simultaneous linear equations in |S| unknowns" where |S| is the number of different states. Does environment's dynamic means the different states, actions, probabilities and rewards? 2) Also, I was wondering how it was possible to select an optimal policy in a stochastic policy. Indeed, in a deterministic policy, of course, we decide which action to take in each state. However, in a stochastic policy, it's all about probabilities, right? So, what choices do we have to do? Aren't we subject to probabilities without the possibility to do anything more? Thanks !!
