While labeling, label with sub-categories. This enables you to work with larger set of tools / algos. With Algos that work better with linear labels (and don't know about label hierarchies), you can pre-process to transform and use only least granular labels (E.g.: CoreNLP) With some of Deep Learning models, you can use sub category tags as it is. Since tagging / labeling is expensive and (potentially one-time) exercise; it is better to tag more granular categories.
