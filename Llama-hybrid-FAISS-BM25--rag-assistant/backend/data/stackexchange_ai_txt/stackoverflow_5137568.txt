The request for documentation for ReferenceClasses comes up every now and then, for example on the r-devel list. The best answer so far is to actually look at what help(ReferenceClasses) gives you---which is a pretty decent start. Then there are a few presentations: John's presentation in November 2010 at Stanford Martin Morgan in November 2010 from the BioConductor Europe meetings Romain and myself mention it in the Google Tech Talk on Rcpp And as noted by mdsummer in the comment, R5 was a short-lived joke. There was already another R-related project called R5, and John much prefers ReferenceClasses. And I reckon they are here to stay. People use them already as e.g. Jeff Horner is his new Rack package.
