First let's assume assume you truly want to maximize incidence of this activity in your sample. Let's also assume that the smallest clip we're willing to sample is fixed, let's say 1 hour for simplicity. In order to frame this in some probabilistic theory, it would be nice to be able to assume independence between the number of people doing this activity in any interval, which of course is not reasonable since if someone starts in the last couple minutes of one hour, they'll be doing it in the next. So, if you don't mind, I will approximate the problem by saying we want to capture as many people starting this activity as possible. Beside this, is the independence assumption reasonable in your case? Moving on, with this set of assumptions, our only choice is, which hour of footage to watch next. Therefore the only relationship we can exploit is the relationship between time and the rate of this activity. So if we model this rate as a function of the hour, than hour of day , or day of week , or is a holiday , etc. are our only real features (unless you can extract features from the video like average brightness...) For continuing this problem I would look into two things. First, The Poisson distribution which is the distribution used for modeling rates of independent events. Secondly, the multi armed bandit problem. Essentially, think of your footage as a slot machine, and each hour of day as a lever. The payoff is instances captured. When you sit down at the slot machine you can start with some beliefs (as it sounds like you do) in the form of a (probably gamma) prior of which lever is best, or no beliefs at all. But each time you play, you update your beliefs, informing your next draw.
