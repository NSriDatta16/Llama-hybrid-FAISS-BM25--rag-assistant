Calculating auto correlation of recursive time series

I have a time seres {$X_t$} that is defined by the following recursive relation: $X_t=\phi_1X_{t-1}+\phi_2X_{t-2}+Z_t$ with {$X_t$} being stationairy with $\mathbb{E}(X_t)=0$ Now apparently you are able to rewrite the autocorrelation function of this series to the following: $\rho(h)=\phi_1\rho(h-1)+\phi_2\rho(h-2)$ When trying to reproduce this, I get the following: $\rho_x(h)=\frac{\gamma_x(h)}{\gamma_x(0)}= \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X_{t+h},X_t)}{\operatorname{Cov}(X_{t},X_t)}=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}(\phi_1X_{t-1+h}+\phi_2X_{t-2+h}+Z_{t+h}, \phi_1X_{t-1}+\phi_2X_{t-2}+Z_t)}{\sigma^2}$ I have no idea how I can rewrite this to $\rho(h)=\phi_1\rho(h-1)+\phi_2\rho(h-2)$, do you guys know what I am doing wrong?
