Another way to do this is to make the SqlCommand a member field of the class, and have a member method to initialize it. This is similar to the code that Visual Studio generates when you create a Component, then drag a SqlCommand onto the design surface. If you configure the SqlCommand with a parameterized query or stored procedure with parameters, then it will generate code to create the SqlParameter objects and add them to the Parameters property. To use thie SqlCommand later in your code, you would do: m_Command.Parameters["@ParamName"].Value = value;
