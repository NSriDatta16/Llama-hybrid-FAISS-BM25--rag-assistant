Just like the other answers: s -= (s > 73) + 60; This expression works because the spec defines the results of the relational operators. Section 6.5.8 paragraph 6: Each of the operators (less than), > (greater than), (less than or equal to), and >= (greater than or equal to) shall yield 1 if the specified relation is true and 0 if it is false. The result has type int .
