No touchesbegan: in live camera area of UIImagePickerController

in my UIImagePickerController (camera shooting view), I want to track touches. Every touch event gets properly called except for touchesbegan: It's not a typo or something because touchesbegan: had been called up to the moment, I've changed the controller from UIViewController to UIImagePickerController. Why is touchesbegan: not called in UIImagePickerController? How do I achieve this? Update: It works. But only on the controls (which are located at the bottom). It doesn't work in the camera live picture.
