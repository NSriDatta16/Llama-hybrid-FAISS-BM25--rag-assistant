Delayed Rewards in Reinforcement Learning

I have an MDP where the rewards are delayed for six steps as follows: The reward from action at time t is received when the action at time t+6 is taken. The reward from action at time t+1 is received when the action at time t+7 is taken etc. How can I modify Q-Learning or a variant of Q-Learning in order to handle delayed rewards? Is there a model-free rl algorithm in general that handles delayed rewards?
