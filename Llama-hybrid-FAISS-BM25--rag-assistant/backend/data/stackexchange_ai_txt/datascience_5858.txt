Data science is much more broad. It's sort of a catch-all term that right now doesn't honestly have a very clear definition. But data-science includes all of the skills and techniques required to make sense of data which has high velocity (it's coming at you quickly), volume (there's a lot of it), or variability (it's messy, like natural language processing). This means that it certainly includes machine learning and AI, but that it's also about the tools one might use in a real-world situation such as SQL, Hadoop or Spark (and related information such as a knowledge of parallel programming). Additionally, data science may or may not include the communication aspect such as making good graphs and using Excel. Basically, Data Science is ML+.
