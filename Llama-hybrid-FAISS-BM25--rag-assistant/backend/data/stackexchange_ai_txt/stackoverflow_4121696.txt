If you use a RandomAccessFile , you can use length and seek to get to a specific point near the end of the file and then read forward from there. If you find there weren't enough lines, back up from that point and try again. Once you've figured out where the N th last line begins, you can seek to there and just read-and-print. An initial best-guess assumption can be made based on your data properties. For example, if it's a text file, it's possible the line lengths won't exceed an average of 132 so, to get the last five lines, start 660 characters before the end. Then, if you were wrong, try again at 1320 (you can even use what you learned from the last 660 characters to adjust that - example: if those 660 characters were just three lines, the next try could be 660 / 3 * 5, plus maybe a bit extra just in case).
