Looking for a skeleton application for a native macosx application (w/ installer script, notify icon, user preferences)

I have a relatively simple application which I need to make native Mac OSX version of. I find it's easiest to learn from examples and I have never setup/developed/packaged a product on Mac yet. So, I was hoping to start from a project which has basic packaging scripts and includes as many components listed below as possible: Installer build script which installs the program and makes the program run on startup. Notify Icon (or whatever the Mac equivalent of a System Tray Icon is called) w/ a context menu User Preference Storage (.Net equivalent of Settings files) Anyone know of a say an open source project with those characteristics?
