Missing R Squared and ICC for Multilevel Binary Logistic Regression

I am currently assessing if allocation to a rejection scenario and degree of negative beliefs predicts the odds of engaging in a series of behavioural outcomes (e.g. avoiding the person). My first IV (Rejection Condition) is a repeated measures 3 level categorical variable (control, ambiguous rejection, and rejection conditions). My second IV is a continuous variable (overall negative belief score). I am also looking at the moderation between rejection condition and negative beliefs. To assess this I have used a multilevel binary logistic regression model with participant id acting as the clustering variable and a random intercept. I have used the software Jamovi to estimate the model with an N=163 (i.e. 489 observations). I must admit, my understanding of these kinds of models is mostly rudimentary. One thing I cannot work out is why my model has excluded the conditional and marginal r-squared values and estimation of the inter-correlation coefficient. Can anyone explain why this might be occurring and how to remedy it?
