The goal is to predict who will not respond, i.e. anyone who didn't complete their survey by end of day 5. For this goal, instead of using the response as the event, use the failure to "complete their survey by end of day 5" as the event. That then becomes a simple logistic regression: didn't complete versus completed within 5 days. If the time to respond isn't important, then you don't need to think about this as a time-to-event model. If the time to respond is important and you want to use response as the event, you have a cure model . If the time points are as discrete as your example implies, then a binomial regression model with the time points included as predictors (a discrete-time survival model) will do all that you want together, as you get probabilities of response as a function of time point, and the probability of no response at all is just 1 minus the sum of probabilities of responding at earlier tune points.
