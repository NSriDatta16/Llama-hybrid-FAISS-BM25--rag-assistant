You could check out the Request Filtering of IIS7. Just don't know if your 'condition' can be implemented in such a way that Request Filtering is possible. Ofcourse IP Security is an option, but not very elegant. Isn't there a Forefront TMG (or other firewall) in front of the webserver? If so, you can add some security in the firewall. If both of them can't do the stuff you want, you probably need to write your own HTTP Module to stop a request. This still doesn't answer your question on how to stop the request though. Perhaps a solution would be to serve those 'users' an empty page. That way you don't have to stop a request, but simply serve them an empty page. This will give your webserver some load, but doesn't impact the database server.
