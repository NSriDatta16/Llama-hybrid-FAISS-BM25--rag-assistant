Interpretation of marginal effects in Logit Model with log$\times$independent variable

I am totally confused by statistics and I would be glad if you could help me. I have a difficulties to interpret marginal effects in logit model, if my independent variable is log transformed. I will illustrate my question on the example from my data below. I run a logistic regression in stata My dependent variable is dummy indicating whether a game is of X Genre. My independent variable is a continuous and log transformed variable (log heterogeneity) After I run a logit regression: logit xGenre logheterogeneity + control variables I get the following results: The coefficient of my independet variable is .567 STATA: -X Genre Coef. Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -log heterog| .5655944 .1741354 3.25 0.001 .2242953 .9068935 In order to be able to interpret the results easier, I should look at the marginal effects. I have used therefore an mfx command. My results show following: for my independent variable I get dy/dx = .056 STATA: -variable dy/dx Std. Err. z P>|z| [ 95% C.I. ] X -log heter. .0563382 .01688 3.34 0.001 .023259 .089417 3.51361 (*) dy/dx is for discrete change of dummy variable from 0 to 1 Now I am confused on how to interpret my results. Can I say, If my independent variable increase in 10% (log heterog.), then the probability that my Game will be of Genre X increases by 0.56%.
