Derivation of the posterior distribution based on a "complete sample analysis"

Let $y$ denote the i.i.d. data, and suppose it is splitted into two parts $y = \{y_1, y_2\}$ . Upon a Bayesian analysis of the first part of the data, let's assume that the posterior distribution of $\theta$ (the parameter of interest) is normal: $$ \theta | y_1 \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) $$ Finally, let's suppose that the analysis of the second part of the data yields the exact same posterior: $$ \theta | y_2 \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) $$ Is it possible to derive the posterior distribution based on the complete sample, $$ \theta | \{y_1, y_2\} \sim ? $$
