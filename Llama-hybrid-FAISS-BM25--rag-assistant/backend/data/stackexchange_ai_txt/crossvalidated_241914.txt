Terms "cut off" and "tail off" about ACF, PACF functions

I'm trying to understand the meaning of cut off and tails off in time series plot of ACF and PACF. What "Cut off after lag" mean? This about limit? What "Tails off" mean? In the example above, the book that I'm using to study, say that is an AR process. But I can't figure out the meanings of "cuts off" and "tails off"
