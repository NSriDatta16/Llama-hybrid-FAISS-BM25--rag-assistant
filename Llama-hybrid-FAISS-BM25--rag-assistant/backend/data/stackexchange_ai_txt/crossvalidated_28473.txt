Similarity measures are not machine learning algorithm per se, but they play an integral part. After features are extracted from the raw data, the classes are selected or clusters defined implicitly by the properties of the similarity measure. It might help to consider the Euclidean distance instead of cosine similarity. Is the Euclidean distance a learning algorithm? No, but you can use it to define one.
