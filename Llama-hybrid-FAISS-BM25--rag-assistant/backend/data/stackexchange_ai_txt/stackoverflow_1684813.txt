I work with some heavyweight tool which is HP QualityCenter. It lets to organize tests, search them by any property/text, generate tests statistics, some reports, defects management. It is expensive, so may be to much for you, but you should find something else to do test management. As for question is it worth... it depends. If it is few months project, maybe it is to much overhead. But regardles of the team size if system is complex and you will be working on it for some time really consider trying some test management system. I work as only tester with 4 developers, so team is relatively small. But what we work on is quite complicated. It is not one single application, but whole system. It is a web app with collection of small tools that are called from master web app. Additionally it is also interaction with MS Project and MS Excel (with collection of our build in tools). There is additional tool for admin tasks. Oracle Hyperion server for reports. Some Citrix virtualization. Bunch of interfaces for interaction with other systems. Just another corporate app. It is 3-4 years old, 0ver 2000 changes/implementations done. Since beginning few people on the team changed, few people form business changed. And there is lots of users. Without Test Management system we would lose control quickly. So I would say, you need test management only if you are loosing control over testing activities. Don't try new tool just to have your manager nicer reports. use it if current reports and test management capabilities are not sufficient.
