Just to name a few: Oracle Real Application Cluster - provides advanced clustering features Oracle Data Guard - in short provides physical and logical stand-by features. Oracle Exadata - implements the database aware storage (that can do predicate filtering, column projection filtering, join processing, hastens tablespace creation). The solution comes with HP servers, full 24/7 warranty, and other nice things. It's quite nice for applications with highly intensive data loading (for example thanks to the independent tablespace creation). Oracle Virtualization And of course the magic of the brand ;) And when it comes to choosing the RDBMS? Usually the choice is pretty obvious - Oracle or the rest of the world. After that you can narrow the choice down by: platform (windows-only or not) weight (sqlite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, ...) budget (initial license cost, maintenance + support cost) evolution perspectives, for example: Oracle Express -> Oracle SQL Server Express -> MSSQL business perspectives - "secure, well known product" or open-source product (bear in mind the quotation around the first phrase). Other post tends to look deeper into this aspect.
