I found, as suggested here , that adding -lgcov to the build line when building a shared library that contains .o's built with -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage solved this for me. And of course linking the executable with -lgcov. Built the shared library like so: g++ -shared -o libMyLib.so src_a.o src_b.o src_c.o -lgcov And the executable like so: g++ -o myExec myMain.o -lMyLib -lgcov Adding the -lgov to the build of the shared library (not just the exe), solved this additional error for me: hidden symbol `__gcov_merge_add' in /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.1.2/libgcov.a(_gcov_merge_add.o) is referenced by DSO /usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Nonrepresentable section on output Please note that -lgcov must be the last linked library.
