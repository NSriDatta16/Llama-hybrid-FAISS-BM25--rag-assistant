fitting in neural network with MATLAB

I want to fit a function using neural networks, with 0/1 as outputs. please help me find the best way to it. In fact I want to know the fitting function in MATLAB, specifically in the neural network toolbox. I don't know which method is good for modeling a function with binary output. Also is there anyway in MATLAB that I can gain weights?
