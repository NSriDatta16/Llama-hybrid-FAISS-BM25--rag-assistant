A/B testing of newsletter in R or Excel

I have conducted A/B test on Newsletter send outs regarding title length over 10 week period. One group of people during those weeks always got long title, other short version of title. Newsletters did not differ in other things then title, content was same. To check if in one particular case one of the newsletter in pair had higher Open Ratio I need to use test of proportions ( t.test ). The better result in one particular case might be due to better title text, not due to length of title, but other factors (for example more funny or more elegant: Short - "Buy with us", Long - "Need present for Christmas? Buy with us"). So how can I take into account repetitiveness of the test and check if one option was systematically better Open Rate then other? Sample data: set.seed(1) NL_Data My idea is to calculate mean Open_Rate in each type of newsletter (with Long and Short title) and then do a t.test with sample size equal to sum of each send-out.
