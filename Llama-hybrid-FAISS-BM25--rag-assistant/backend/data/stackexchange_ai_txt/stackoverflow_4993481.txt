How to Improvement on Data retrieval from Database in Classic ASP?

My application is in Classic ASP. Currently SAVE functionality is taking around 30sec to complete and the process is: Reads the data from UI. Send to the Database. Retrieve saved data again from database to populate UI. I need some other way to improve the performance by less then 10sec. e.g: Using XML and web services, but I do not want to save the xml file temporarily in the system. Using JQuery and Ajax . Please suggest me which one is feasible and will take less effort to code also less maintainable. Please provide me any code or reference if anyone have. As I do not have any experience in XML or JQuery or Ajax.
