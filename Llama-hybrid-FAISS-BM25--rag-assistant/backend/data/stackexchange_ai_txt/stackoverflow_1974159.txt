.NET Mobile Apps while Soft/Hard Reset

Question here is where to find best practices for designing my program and have in mind if user makes a soft or hard reset on the mobile device?! What happens to my program? How i can deal with that? Install in storage card? Having the setup file somewhere and after reset setup again automatically? Any info and help appreciated! Thank you.
