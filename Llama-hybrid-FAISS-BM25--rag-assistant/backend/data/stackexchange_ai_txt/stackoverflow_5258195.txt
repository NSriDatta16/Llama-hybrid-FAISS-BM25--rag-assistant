Loading a new view before the old one iphone sdk

Probably just a simple question, but ive been building a little puzzle game and no decided i could do with a menu for it. Ive created the menu no problem i just cant get it to show before the puzzle. Ive tried changing the code in the appdelegate but its not liking it. slider appdelegate.h #import @class SliderViewController; @class MainMenu; @interface SliderAppDelegate : NSObject { UIWindow *window; MainMenu *viewController1; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window; @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet SliderViewController *viewController; @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet MainMenu *viewController1; @end Slider appdelegate.m #import "SliderAppDelegate.h" #import "SliderViewController.h" @implementation SliderAppDelegate @synthesize window; @synthesize viewController; @synthesize viewController1; #pragma mark - #pragma mark Application lifecycle - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { // Override point for customization after application launch. // Add the view controller's view to the window and display. [self.window addSubview:viewController1.view]; [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } But doing that throws out an error: error: request for member 'view' in something not a structure or union I know its probably a stupid question but could anyone help please.
