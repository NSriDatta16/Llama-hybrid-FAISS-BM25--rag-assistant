Irreducible markov chain problem

Let $P$ be a stationary transition probability matrix of the markov chain $ \{X_n , n \ge 0\}, $ which is irreducible and every state has a period 2. Further suppose that the markov chain $\{Y_n , n \ge 0\}$ on the same state space has transition probability matrix $P^2$ . Both chains are assumed to have the same initial distributions. then state how the chain $\{Y_n , n \ge 0\} $ is irreducible ? i am very new to the concept of markov chains and found this question beyond my level , please tell how and why $\{Y_n , n \ge 0\} $ should be irreducible ?
