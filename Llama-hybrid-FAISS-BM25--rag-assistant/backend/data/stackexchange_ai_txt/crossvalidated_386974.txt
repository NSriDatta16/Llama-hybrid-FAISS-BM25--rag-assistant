Because the measurements are blocked by Subject, you have paired or repeated measures data. In this particular case, the data arranged in unreplicated complete block design. Friedman's test can be applied in this case. Kruskal-Wallis would not be ideal for repeated measures data. I would encourage you to look at Quade test also, which is used for similar situations as Friedman's test.
