I was using insufficient test to compare the two scenarios (i think less than 100 resources). With sufficient tests -- more than 6000 urls, it showed that the compressed response time to first byte was faster by 200 milliseconds in serving text/html, where as TTLB was faster by 25 milliseconds on the average. I haven't load tested this which I plan to do and update this answer.
