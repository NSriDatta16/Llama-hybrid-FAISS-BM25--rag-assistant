compare two states using a combination of predictors in logistic regression

When using Logistic regression concept in an example, I want to compare the risk of the disease (response) for a 25 year male who smokes with a 50 year male who does not smoke. Response would be if the patient has the disease or not. How are we suppose to consider 3 predictors in a comparison (Age, Gender and smoke) in R programming?
