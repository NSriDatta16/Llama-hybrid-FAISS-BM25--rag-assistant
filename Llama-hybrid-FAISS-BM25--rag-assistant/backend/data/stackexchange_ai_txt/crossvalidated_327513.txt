After @whuber and @ZahavaKor comments, especially noting since I actually have no data to base a covariance on I have arrived at the following: Thinking on this further, I believe my assumption that the covariance was not zero is the one that is failing. Since the input of part complexity to the queue for the machines is random then the output of complexity is random. For the covariance to be nonzero, then the LF/hr of machine1 would need to somehow affect the LF/hr of machine2 which is not the case. I was assuming that for each point in the dataset machine1 took 1/2 and machine2 took 1/2 which would show that for each datapoint X=Y=(X+Y)/2. This would lead to very high covariance. However, it is very unlikely that the weekly production rate of each machine was the same, however their long-term average production rates WOULD be the same. TLDR: The covariance is 0 since the machines are independent and their inputs are random.
