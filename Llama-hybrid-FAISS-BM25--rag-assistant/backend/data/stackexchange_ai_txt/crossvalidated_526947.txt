Hi there, I'm unable to solve this question. I know that Bayesian is used to solve this question but i don't know where to start

Question A screening test for a disease shows a positive result in 88 % of all cases when the disease is actually present and in 1 % of all cases when it is not . If a result is positive , the test is repeated . Assume that the second test is independent of the first test . If the prevalence of the disease is 1 in 350 and an individual tests positive twice , what is the probability that the actually has the disease Tried to solve but seems like this is wrong.
