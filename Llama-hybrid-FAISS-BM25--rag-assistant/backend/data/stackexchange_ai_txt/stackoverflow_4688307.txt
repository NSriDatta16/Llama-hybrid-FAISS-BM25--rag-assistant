Does it make a difference to the debugger that it is Scala code I'm debugging?

I am wondering what difference it makes to the debugger (Intellij IDEA + Scala plug-in) when I debug Scala code and not Java code. To my understanding, a debugger is tightly coupled with the language i.e. a Java debugger can not handle Scala code but apparently the JVM is the center of attention here meaning as long as it is byte-code, any debugger would do. right ? IMPORTANT UPDATE: The problem was to give an example of how a byte-code debugger may be limiting for Scala. Assume a break point is reached and I don't want to go to the next line but I want the debugger to evaluate an Scala expression in the context of the application (e.g. I like to call an operator method from a singleton object). The debugger is stuck because it can not understand Scala. I have to do the transformation myself and input the resulting Java to the debugger. The problem is that only "breakpoint stuff" could be handled in byte-code level. What if you want to put an expression under watch? Debugger has to understand Scala to evaluate the watched expression,right? This time I'm sure I'm right. Vengeance is mine, Saith the Lord ;-)
