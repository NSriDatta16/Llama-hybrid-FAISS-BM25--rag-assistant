In general I would recommend including both (1|A) and (1|B) in the model - otherwise you're not fitting the maximal model, i.e. the model that includes all terms that are statistically identifiable. If the variation in A is reasonably large and you omit the (1|A) term, the model for the random effects corresponding to the remaining (1|B) term (that they are independently drawn from a zero-centred Normal distribution) might be off. Some reasons it might be reasonable to omit the (1|A) term: there is something about your data that would eliminate any differences in A ( not just experimental control: for example, maybe you've already subtracted the mean from the observations in each A group) you get a singular fit, i.e. an estimate of zero variance among levels of A (in this case you'll get exactly the same answer if you drop this term) you think there are too few levels of A to estimate the variance (in this case it would be more conservative to include A in the model as a fixed effect if you are using data-driven model selection to decide what terms to include, and the model including (1|A) is not selected (e.g. the AIC is higher). (In general you need to be very careful when doing this kind of "sacrificial pseudoreplication" ( sensu Hurlbert 1984) that you don't mess up your coverage/type-I error ...) (Note that the levels of B need to be uniquely coded - otherwise you should specify the nested syntax (1|A/B) (or (1|A) + (1|A:B) ) in lme4 as well in nlme ...)
