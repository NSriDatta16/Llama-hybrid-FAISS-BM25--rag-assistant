When to use Test="F" or Test="Chisq" when comparing regression models?

I would like to understand when to use either the test="F" or test="Chisq" options when comparing regression models with the ANOVA function. In my class, we have been using test="Chisq" on all logistic regression problems but now I have a case that is linear regression. When I try comparing the two tests with test="Chisq" I no longer get a test statistic. Do I understand correctly that I need to use test="Chisq" for logistic regression and test="F" for linear regression? I am comparing two models now (both linear regression models) and the output of the anova test where test="Chisq" only provides res.df , RSS, Df, Sum of Sq, and Pr(>Chi ). Does this mean I need to do test="F" when I don't see a test statistic ?
