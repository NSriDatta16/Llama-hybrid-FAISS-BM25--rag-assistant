Practical uses of OOP

I recently had a debate with a colleague who is not a fan of OOP . What took my attention was what he said: "What's the point of doing my coding in objects? If it's reuse then I can just create a library and call whatever functions I need for whatever task is at hand. Do I need these concepts of polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, patterns or whatever?" We are in a small company developing small projects for e-commerce sites and real estate. How can I take advantage of OOP in an "everyday, real-world" setup? Or was OOP really meant to solve complex problems and not intended for "everyday" development?
