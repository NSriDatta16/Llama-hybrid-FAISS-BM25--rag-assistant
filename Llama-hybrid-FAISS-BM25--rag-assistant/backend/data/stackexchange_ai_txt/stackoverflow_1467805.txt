Sending Notifications from a SQL Server 2000 Job without SMTP Server on the Box

I have SQL Server 2000 installed on Windows 2003 Server. We do not have SMTP installed on the box, so when creating a notification for a failed SQL Agent job, the email is not sent. Is there a way to send out a notification without installing SMTP on the box?
