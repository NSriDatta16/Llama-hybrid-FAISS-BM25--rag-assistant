Cross validation where either in or out sample is missing some categories in a categorical variable

Consider a sample data set: +---------+----------------+ | Sex | Likes Icecream | +---------+----------------+ | M | Y | | F | Y | | M | N | | F | Y | | Unknown | N | | Unknown | N | | Unknown | Y | +---------+----------------+ I am interested in cross validating a model which tries to predict "Likes Icecream" based on the value for sex. Now, suppose we do 2-fold cross validation, and you were unlucky enough to have the following two in and out-sample datasets for the first fold: In-sample: +-----+----------------+ | Sex | Likes Icecream | +-----+----------------+ | M | Y | | F | Y | | M | N | +-----+----------------+ Out-sample: +---------+----------------+ | Sex | Likes Icecream | +---------+----------------+ | F | Y | | Unknown | N | | Unknown | N | | Unknown | Y | +---------+----------------+ and suppose we fit a logistic regression. Now, on the in-sample data we would know how Sex M/F affects Likes Icecream . However, to measure this model on the out-sample data, we need to predict the value of Likes Icecream . So what prediction do you give for Sex = Unknown in the out-sample data, or how do you measure the inaccuracy of the model on the out-sample data when Sex = Unknown ? Does it matter that you cannot measure the inaccuracy of the model on Sex = Male in the out-sample data?
