The parameter $\theta$ can only be regarded as fixed but unknown if you assume that the underlying model that you are working with is a perfect representation of the true system. However, since nature is usually much more complex than any mathematical model that we use, this assumption cannot be made. Therefore, there is no 'one true fixed' parameter of your model. Mathematically, as you add more and more data, you will converge to a certain parameter $\theta$. However, this is due to the insufficiency of your assumptions in the modeling process. You should be careful to call it the true fixed parameter of the underlying system. Even if a parameter in your model has a physical meaning - it is only an assumption that the posterior parameter retains this interpretation completely. The data in a Bayesian view is generated by the 'true system' - which you will never be able to model correctly. Therefore, an underlying true parameter of your assumed model cannot exist.
