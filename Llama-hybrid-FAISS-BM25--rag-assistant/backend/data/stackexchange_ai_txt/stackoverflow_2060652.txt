What's wrong with: SELECT `id`, `title`, count(*) AS `count` FROM `news` WHERE YEAR(`date`) = "2010" AND MONTH(`date`) = "03" GROUP BY ( `id` ) #assuming id is unique ORDER BY `date` DESC ? EDIT: Forgot to add GROUP BY clause EDIT 2: Forget the above. That was obviously not correct. This will do the trick, though it may be concidered not very elegant: SELECT `id`, `title`, ( SELECT count(*) FROM `news` WHERE YEAR(`date`) = "2010" AND MONTH(`date`) = "01" ) as `count` FROM `news` WHERE YEAR(`date`) = "2010" AND MONTH(`date`) = "01" ORDER BY `date` DESC So maybe the suggested mysql_num_rows() isn't so bad after all. :)
