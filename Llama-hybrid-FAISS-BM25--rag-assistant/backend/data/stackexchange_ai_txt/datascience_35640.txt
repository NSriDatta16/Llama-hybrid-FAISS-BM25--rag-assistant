Handling actions with delayed effect (Reinforcement learning)

I am working on a problem where the action that I learn (using DQN) can be executed 'now' but it's effect on the environment is delayed by 'T' units of time. The environment however is active in that time and there are other conditions based on which rewards are computed and returned. How is this handled? I believe the Q value function (with gamma) handles 'delayed' effects of rewards but not actions. This is similar to the inventory management use cases. As an analogy consider that I sell cakes. As customers walk into my shop I consume cakes off the shelf. I must reorder to stock my shelf BUT this reordering can take time to take effect. I thought of just adding the quantity reordered to the shelf at a later time and let the agent learn it's effects. Will this suffice? As another approach I thought of Experience and Replay as a mechanism to handle this delayed effect. Appreciate the help.
