HttpWebRequest with pages that have dynamically generated html from javascript?

This is kind of a two part question. Is it possible to retrieve data from a page that loads content dynamically through javascript by using WebClient/HttpWebRequest? I'd also like to how I would be able to use WebClient/HttpWebRequest to replicate a XMLHttpRequest like you would see executed via javascript. Edit: I captured the headers of the request I am trying to replicate which looks like this: http://www.tagged.com/api/?application_id=user&format=json&session_token=6thk20fhv7d727emgdhfka6034 POST /api/?application_id=user&format=json&session_token=6thk20fhv7d727emgdhfka6034 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.tagged.com Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9, / ;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 88 connect_status=-1; __utmb=50703532.0.10.1303366930 DNT: 1 Connection: keep-alive Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache method=tagged.usermgmt.addFriend&uid_to_add=5402501977&api_signature=&track=1mJ0lY7-W3 I understand everything up until the method. As far as I know you can only supply GET or POST to HttpWebRequest.Method. Could someone maybe fill in the blanks for me?
