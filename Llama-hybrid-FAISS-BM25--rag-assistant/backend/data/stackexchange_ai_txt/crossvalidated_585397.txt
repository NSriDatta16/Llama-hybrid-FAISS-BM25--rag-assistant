Is the MLE estimate of the mean of Gamma distribution same as the average?

Consider the Gamma distribution: $\Gamma(\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\beta^\alpha x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}$ According to many sources (e.g. wikipedia ), the mean is given by $\mu=\alpha/\beta$ . On the other hand, using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, we can find that (see page 11 here for example) $\hat{\beta}_{MLE}=\frac{\hat{\alpha}_{MLE}}{\bar{x}}$ , where $\bar{x}$ is the average. Accordingly, $\hat{\mu}_{MLE} = \frac{\hat{\alpha}_{MLE}}{\hat{\beta}_{MLE}}=\bar{x}$ . Is this correct? If so, why do many sources go on length to do numerical estimation of the parameters? Since most of the time all what we care about is mean and variance, I don't see why we would resort to numerical estimation of individual parameters.
