I read this as: I have 10000 observations, 2 numeric variables (let's call them $X$ and $Y$) and also a categorical variable with categories A and B. I wouldn't start with PCA or even use it here: just plot your two variables on a scatter plot of $Y$ versus $X$ and distinguish As from Bs. If the pattern is really messy, then plotting As with all as backdrop and Bs with all as backdrop might help. This thread gives examples . This one gives more references to literature.
