Yes, it could be (and has been) argued that a p-value is a point estimate. In order to identify whatever property of a distribution a p-value might estimate, we would have to assume it is asymptotically unbiased. But, asymptotically, the mean p-value for the null hypothesis is $1/2$ (ideally; for some tests it might be some other nonzero number) and for any other hypothesis it is $0$ . Thus, the p-value could be considered an estimator of one-half the indicator function for the null hypothesis. Admittedly it takes some creativity to view a p-value in this way. We could do a little better by viewing the estimator in question as the decision we make by means of the p-value: is the underlying distribution a member of the null hypothesis or of the alternate hypothesis? Let's call this set of possible decisions $D$ . Jack Kiefer writes We suppose that there is an experiment whose outcome the statistician can observe. This outcome is described by a random variable or random vector $X$ ... . The probability law of $X$ is unknown to the statistician, but it is known that the distribution function $F$ of $X$ is a member of a specified class $\Omega$ of distribution functions. ... A statistical problem is said to be a problem of point estimation if $D$ is the collection of possible values of some real or vector-valued property of $F$ which depends on $F$ in a reasonably smooth way. In this case, because $D$ is discrete, "reasonably smooth" is not a restriction at all. Kiefer's terminology reflects this by referring to statistical procedures with discrete decision spaces as "tests" instead of "point estimators." Although it is interesting to explore the limits (and limitations) of such definitions, as this question invites us to do, perhaps we should not insist too strongly that a p-value is a point estimator, because this distinction between estimators and tests is both useful and conventional. In a comment to this question, Christian Robert brought attention to a 1992 paper where he and co-authors took exactly this point of view and analyzed the admissibility of the p-value as an estimator of the indicator function . See the link in the references below. The paper begins, Approaches to hypothesis testing have usually treated the problem of testing as one of decision-making rather than estimation. More precisely, a formal hypothesis test will result in a conclusion as to whether a hypothesis is true, and not provide a measure of evidence to associate with that conclusion. In this paper we consider hypothesis testing as an estimation problem within a decision-theoretic framework ... .
