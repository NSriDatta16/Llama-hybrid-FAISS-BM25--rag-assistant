I strongly recommend against it. Put your data files locally on the server itself, with RAID mirrored drives. The reasons are twofold: SQL Server will run much faster for all but the smallest workloads SQL Server will be much less prone to corruption in case the link to the NAS gets broken. Use the NAS to store backups of your SQL Server, not to host your datafiles. I don't know what your database size will be, or what your usage pattern will be, so I can't tell you what you MUST have. At a minimum for a database that's going to take any significant load in a production environment, I would recommend two logical drives (one for data, one for your transaction log), each consisting of a RAID 1 array of the fastest drives you can stomach to buy. If that's overkill, put your database on just two physical drives, (one for the transaction log, and one for data). If even THAT is over budget, put your data on a single drive, back up often. But if you choose the single-drive or NAS solution, IMO you are putting your faith in the Power of Prayer (which may not be a bad thing, it just isn't that effective when designing databases). Note that a NAS is not the same thing as a SAN (on which people typically DO put database files). A NAS typically is much slower and has much less bandwidth than a SAN connection, which is designed for very high reliability, high speed, advanced management, and low latency. A NAS is geared more toward reducing your cost of network storage.
