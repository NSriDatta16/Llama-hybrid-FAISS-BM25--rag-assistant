I get what you're asking (and if I'm right: yes, it is ok), but I think the question is ill-formed. In MCMC you use a Markov chain to wander over some state space, visiting points of the space with probability proportional to some target function. The chain wanders from point to point based on some proposal distribution. The target function needs to be proportional to a probability density, but that's it. It's not necessarily connected to a choice of prior or likelihood in a Bayesian model. We fruitfully use MCMC to approximate integrals over posterior distributions in Bayesian statistics, but you could also use e.g. the Metropolis algorithm to approximate the expectation of the distribution with density proportional to the function $$ f(x, y) = \exp \left\{-(1 - x)^{2} - 100(y - x^{2})^2 \right\}. $$ Notice I haven't specified a Bayesian model consisting of prior & likelihood; I've just given you some function that is proportional to a probability density. So: yes, feel free to use the same proposal distribution as your prior, if you're performing MCMC on a posterior. The two are not meaningfully connected.
