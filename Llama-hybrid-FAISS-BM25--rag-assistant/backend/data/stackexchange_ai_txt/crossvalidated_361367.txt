Identifying seasonality in a quarterly time series

I am attempting to understand whether there is seasonality in the quarterly time series below. y By fitting the below time series using ETS (part of the forecasting package), I get the following output: ETS(M,N,A) Call: ets(y = y) Smoothing parameters: alpha = 0.0002 gamma = 0.0003 Initial states: l = 245.5385 s=267.8483 -106.6074 -69.7656 -91.4754 sigma: 0.0236 AIC AICc BIC 88.27329 110.67329 92.22794 Clearly the output indicates seasonality is present. But how do I interpret this output? Specifically, how do the values s=267.8483 -106.6074 -69.7656 -91.4754 tell me which quarters have seasonality (and thus need to be accounted for in any model)?
