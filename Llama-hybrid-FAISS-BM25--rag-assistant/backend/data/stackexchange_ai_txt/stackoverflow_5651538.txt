Speedup IntelliJ-Idea

I'm using intelliJ for Scala development and got 8 GB of new RAM last week, so I thought: time to use it. I checked my task manager and found intelliJ using ~250mb . From eclipse I knew that tweaking JVM options helped a lot in improving speed, so I googled ... and found this one for OS X I couldn't find the JVM option immediately, so I started tweaking Xmx. At 1 GB, I realized it doesn't start any more. I checked the intelliJ java version, found it's outdated and 32bit. So in order to use your current JDK and 64 bit you have to change your link to from: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 10.0.2\bin\idea.exe to IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 10.0.2\bin\idea.BAT and adjust "Start in" The bat looks for JDK_HOME and uses 64bit now. My current VM Options , which are located in ...\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 10.0.2\bin\idea.exe.vmoptions are -Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -ea -server -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis -XX:+UseCompressedOops -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseParallelGC Instead of -XX:+UseParallelGC , you can use -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC , which is the accepted choice for desktop apps, but I have changed to the throughput collector recently. because with a fast machine and a small enough heap, you have quick pauses, more throughput and no issues with fragmentation (ijuma. #scala) Changes: -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC //removed // removed, because not needed with the lastest JVM. -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis -XX:+UseCompressedOops I'll stick to these options for now. I would really like to know your experience with it. Which options work best for you? How do I hide this cmd window while running intelliJ through the .bat ? :) By the way, here's another link for tuning intelliJ . Basically it says on p.20/21 to turn off windows restore and antivirus for system dirs. Another way to speed up intelliJ is to put intellij system folder on ramdrive (thanks OlegYch|h). from idea.properties idea.system.path=${idea.home}/.IntelliJIdea/system See Superuser for Win 7 64bit RAM Drive or this one . 1 GB seems fine for me. Another hint a friend gave me is to exclude the project directories from your antivirus (scan on access) There are similar posts regarding tuning Eclipse: Eclipse Helios 3.6 Eclipse Juno 4.2 Specify the JVM to start Eclipse with
