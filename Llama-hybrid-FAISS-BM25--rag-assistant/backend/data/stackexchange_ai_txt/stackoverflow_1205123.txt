One of the places where you can see this principle being effectively applied is for applications that use people to generate or index content. In these cases, the game-like aspects are a way to encourage self-moderation. For example, on SO, the rep and badges aim to encourage constructive behaviour like higher-quality answers, peer review etc. Similar systems exist on many generic forums, as well as sites like boardgamegeek and wikipedia . I could imagine this kind of thing working well for things like community/company wikis, software documentation, or adherence to coding standards or test coverage. The problem, as ever, is to stop the game becoming the main focus. For example, if you could get rep for tidying up your intranet wiki, I can guarantee there would be some people who would do that all day, when their main job was something quite different!
