Time series forecasting using statistical tools

I'm building a system which needs to poll some feed of articles in a smart way. When polling, I can only know the number of new articles (could be $0$ - no new articles). I don't have the info when each article was published. So I thought about a relatively simple solution: Exponential Moving Average. Something like: $$t_n = \alpha\cdot t_{n-1} + (1-\alpha)\cdot p$$ Where $p$ is the time difference between the last poll to the last successful poll (so if there are no new articles, $p$ is getting larger and larger and so $t_n$ is). Requests and Thoughts I'd like to get a critique on the above formula (Would you define it differently?) How can I define $\alpha$ efficiently? Could it be dynamic/changing over time? I've read about more sophisticated statistical tools (like ARMA/ARIMA) for forecasting time series. Most of them uses the errors (the time difference between the forecast time and the actual time), but I don't own this information, sadly. What statistical model fits my scenario? Currently, I don't use the number of articles, though they could be useful to evaluate the next poll. Thanks! P.S. I haven't checked it but I think the behavior of feeds is somewhat trendy/seasonal (For example, fewer articles at night time). On the other hand, there are what is called if I'm not mistaken, "random shocks" (For example, a terror attack).
