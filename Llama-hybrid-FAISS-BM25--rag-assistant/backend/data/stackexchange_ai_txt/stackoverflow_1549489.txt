A simple list comprehension to the second depth: >>> L = [ [5, 44, 73] , [7, 21, 99], [1, 32, 100] ] >>> [x for li in zip(*L) for x in li] [5, 7, 1, 44, 21, 32, 73, 99, 100] pretty nice. If the sublists are of uneven length, it is not as elegant to express: >>> L = [ [5, 44, 73] , [7], [1, 32, 100, 101] ] >>> [li[idx] for idx in xrange(max(map(len, L))) for li in L if idx These solutions are of complexity O(n), where n is the total number of elements.
