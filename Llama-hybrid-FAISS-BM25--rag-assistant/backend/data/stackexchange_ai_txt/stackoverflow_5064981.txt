In general, in classification you have a set of predefined classes and want to know which class a new object belongs to. Clustering tries to group a set of objects and find whether there is some relationship between the objects. In the context of machine learning, classification is supervised learning and clustering is unsupervised learning . Also have a look at Classification and Clustering at Wikipedia.
