Why is it bad for neural networks to output indices?

Let's say you wanted to train a neural network to output N indices (maybe it's sorting an array). There are at least 2 possible ways one might sample from this network: Project the N, dim vector to N, 1 and round the outputs Project the N, dim vector to an N, N vector and do softmax on the rows / columns to select the correct index at each position Apparently, it is better to use method 2 instead of method 1. But ... I don't have good intuition for why this is the case.
