Easy way to do it. Highlight your formula cell. The lower right corner should turn into a + sign. Click on that + sign and drag it for as many rows as you like. Alternatively, you can do this: Highlight the formula cell. Ctrl+C to copy. Click on the C column. Hit enter. Now with the second method, it may start to lock up on you because of the large number of cells it has to compute. Just hit escape and it'll go back to normal (but some cells may not be filled in, depending on how early you hit escape.)
