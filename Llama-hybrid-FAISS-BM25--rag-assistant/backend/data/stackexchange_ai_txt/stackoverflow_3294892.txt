How do I set up my first view with Draggable Views module?

I'm learning how to use Draggable Views for Drupal 6 for the first time, following this tutorial: http://thedesignspace.net/MT2archives/000666.html . I'm encountering a problem though: in part 4, once I set up the draggable table ( http://thedesignspace.net/MT2archives/000708.html ) the entire preview disappears, showing no table. Switching the style to another type, such as table, brings everything back. Directly viewing the page from its path makes no difference. Any ideas of what the problem could be?
