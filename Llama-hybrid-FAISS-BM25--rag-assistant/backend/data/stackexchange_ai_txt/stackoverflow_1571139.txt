There is a concept of load distribution where requests are sprayed across a number of servers (usually with session affinity). Here there is no feedback on how busy any particular server may be, we just rely on statistical sharing of the load. You could view the WebSphere Http plugin in WAS ND as doing this. It actually works pretty well even for substantial web sites Load balancing tries to be cleverer than that. Where some feedback on the relative load of the servers determines where new requests go. (even then session affinity tends to be treated as higher priority than balancing load). The WebSphere On Demand Router that was originally delivered in XD does this. If you read this article you will see the kind of algorithms used. You can achieve balancing with network spraying devices, they could consult "agents" running in the servers which give feedback to the sprayer to give a basis for decisions where request should go. Hence even this Hardware-based approach can have a Software element. See Dynamic Feedback Protocol
