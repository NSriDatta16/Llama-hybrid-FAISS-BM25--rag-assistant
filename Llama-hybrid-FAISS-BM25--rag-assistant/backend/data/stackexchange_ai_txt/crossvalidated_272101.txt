ACF for long time series, trying to identify ARIMA models

I start to work with a dataset with more than 3000 samples, and realize that ACF plot does not make sense with respect of confidence intervals, see figure. My purpose is to fit an ARIMA on this, however, I'm not sure if it's a good choice because of this large sample size, as @IrishStat answer alerts. Does anyone recommend an approach to handle this ACF plot to model the ARIMA? EDIT : In acf, the first lag inside interval confidence is in something about 400.
