Just because something was originally described in XAML does not mean it's a string at runtime (just like you can't take a string containing a C# fragment and just run it). You have to use the objects representation: MyStyle = new Style(){TargetType=typeof(Button)}; MyStyle.Setters.Add(new Setter(){Property="FontSize", Value=12}); MyStyle.Setters.Add(new Setter(){Property="Backround", Value=Brushes.Orange}); Application.Current.Resources.Add("MyStyle",MyStyle); If you have a complete valid XAML file you can use XamlReader
