Just adding onto @Alec's answer. There is a parse_url() function: Which can return fragment - after the hashmark # . However, in your case it will return all values after the hashmark: Array ( [path] => catalog.php [fragment] => album=2song=1 ) As @NullUserException pointed out, unless you have the url beforehand this really is pointless. But, I feel its good to know nonetheless.
