Simulated annealing and k-means

One of my problems https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7783933/clustering-data-outputs-irregular-plot-graph suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which also makes it infeasible for exhaustive search or analytical methods, metaheuristics for combinatorial problems like simulated annealing might help in my endeavour how would I combine simulated annealing with k-means in my example problem? Sorry for the very short question im still trying to get my head around simulated annealing and how it could possibly help. Other questions that could help is the comparison of simulated annealing to pca, vds or how it can be used in conjunction. (sorry abit late for me) Edits are welcome if you undertsand my lack of knowledge and what I might be trying to get at.
