I am really inspired by the unit testing framework of the Flood NN library by Robert Lopez. It uses a different project for every single unit tested class, and has one solution holding all these projects, as well as a main project that compiles and runs all the tests. The neat thing is also the layout of the project. The source files are in a folder, but then the folder for the VS project is below. This allows you to make different subfolders for different compilers. All the VS projects are shipped with the code, so it is very easy for anyone to run any or all of the unit tests.
