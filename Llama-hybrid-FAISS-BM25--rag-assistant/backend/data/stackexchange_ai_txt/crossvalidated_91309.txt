When does drawing additional samples not cause much benefit in estimating the population probability distribution?

Suppose I have a random variable X that either evaluates to A, B, or C when I realize it (each with its own fixed probability). Now let's say I have drawn 100 samples and the frequency distribution is something like A 30 B 55 C 15 dividing by n=100 gives me the probability estimates. However, when do I have a 95% chance of being $\delta$ close to the true population probabilities? EDIT: I'm not precise enough with that question. Does $\delta$ refer to the best deviation, the worst deviation or the average deviation? If some of them are tricky please just assume the simple interpretation. I just need a rule of thumb.
