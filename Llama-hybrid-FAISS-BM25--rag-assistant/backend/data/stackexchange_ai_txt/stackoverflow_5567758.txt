Application.Doevents is the key to this problem. This will refresh the listbox and make the program response to other things. For example a button clicks while in the loop. So you can have a button to abort the long running task. private abort as boolean =false sub doit() abort=false do until abort listbox1.additem "weee" my.application.doevents loop end sub sub abortbutton_click(...) handles abortbutton.click() abort=true end sub From MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.doevents.aspx If you call DoEvents in your code, your application can handle the other events. For example, if you have a form that adds data to a ListBox and add DoEvents to your code, your form repaints when another window is dragged over it. If you remove DoEvents from your code, your form will not repaint until the click event handler of the button is finished executing.
