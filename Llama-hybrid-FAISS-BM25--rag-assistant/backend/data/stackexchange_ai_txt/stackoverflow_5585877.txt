I don't think there is a difference in the recordset object itself. The difference is in the literal definition/organization of the contents of the recordset: A hierarchical recordset is a recordset that is comprised of a hierarchy of records. For example, any recordset with a parent/child relationship can be defined as a hierarchical recordset. Unlike a join which basically duplicates all of the parent data for each child, each record in a hierarchical recordset contains the set of parent fields and one field which is the child recordset.
