Is there any kind of idiots guide to deploying your ASP.NET MVC website in one click?

I'm about to begin building a website using the ASP.NET MVC framework and I'm trying to find a good solution to 1)Source Control Management and 2)Deployment. For the SCM, I'm probably going to use SourceGear since it integrates into Visual Studio nicely, but for deployment, I don't even know where to start. Up until know, most websites that I've built were very static and every time I had to update the site, I would use an FTP program and just drag and drop the files to the server. But now that I'm going to be building a much more dynamic web application, this approach feels dangerous (which, oddly enough, is also my middle name). Does there exist some kind of idiots guide or tutorial that explains a good way to deploy an update to your website? Thanks so much in advance for all your help!
