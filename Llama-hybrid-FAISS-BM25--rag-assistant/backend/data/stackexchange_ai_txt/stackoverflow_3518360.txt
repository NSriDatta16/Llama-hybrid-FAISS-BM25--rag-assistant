A co-worker and I did some rudimentary benchmarks recently to test which was faster for an application we were writing. We tested this JSON framework, and the NSXML parser as well as a TreeNode parser we found in an Objective-C book. Here is the note I sent to the other developers on our team: The benchmark tested how each library handled getting the filename and path of 100 assets, 100 times each (for a total count of 10,000 runs per library). The results are below: Method Average(s) Total(s) TreeNode 0.307475 30.747493 NSXML 0.483778 48.377843 JSON 0.233179 23.317870
