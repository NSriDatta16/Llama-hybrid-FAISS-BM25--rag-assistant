This could happen if you replace the original form in the success callback with the partial view. So when you remove some HTML elements (as in replace existing HTML with partial view from the server) all their events are gone as well. Re-adding the same HTML (from your point of view) is just some new HTML to the browser. It doesn't make assumptions whether this new HTML is related to old code or not. That's why you have to re-add all functionality and events if you want the new form to work as it did before. If this is your case the form will no longer have the submit Ajax action attached and therefore the second time it will perform a full post. For this to work you need to reattach the submit event in the success function: $(function() { ajaxifyForm(); }); function ajaxifyForm() { $('#AccountSetup').ajaxForm({ target: '#AccountSetup', replaceTarget: false, success: stepCallWithForm }); } function stepCallWithForm(result) { // If you replace the #AccountSetup form with the // returned partial result you need to reattach the AJAX submit: ajaxifyForm(); }
