Calculating Weighted Average with LINQ

My goal is to get a weighted average from one table, based on another tables primary key. Example Data: Table1 Key WEIGHTED_AVERAGE 0200 0 Table2 ForeignKey Length Value 0200 105 52 0200 105 60 0200 105 54 0200 105 -1 0200 47 55 I need to get a weighted average based on the length of a segment and I need to ignore values of -1. I know how to do this in SQL, but my goal is to do this in LINQ. It looks something like this in SQL: SELECT Sum(t2.Value*t2.Length)/Sum(t2.Length) AS WEIGHTED_AVERAGE FROM Table1 t1, Table2 t2 WHERE t2.Value <> -1 AND t2.ForeignKey = t1.Key; I am still pretty new to LINQ, and having a hard time figuring out how I would translate this. The result weighted average should come out to roughly 55.3. Thank you.
