PHP/HTML Nested Navigation list giving unexpected results

I'm writing a recursive navigation menu in PHP for easier organization and expandability. For now I am using some examples from Diablo II to get the nesting to work properly. The recursive looping is giving me some weird results. Sometimes it only returns a single letter as opposed to the name/url of an array and it doesn't recurse through all elements. It's a bit difficult to explain, and my main issue is I don't really understand how to debug this. It's probably something simple that I can't figure out. To save everyone time, I made a page with the source (syntax highlighted) and output here: http://radleygh.com/files/test/example.php That should make it easy to see what is going on. The layout of the list should look like this (With the name and UL of each group contained within the same LI element): ul li Parent Title #1 ul li Child Title #1 li Child Title #2 /ul li Parent Title #2 /ul PS: Is there a better way to go about sorting a huge array like the one I have? Thanks. Back to debugging for now
