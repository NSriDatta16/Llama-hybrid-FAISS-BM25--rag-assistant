I don't think you're going to find a text compare utility that will do this. You're better off reorganizing the functions so they are in the same places. I've seen designer generated code do this (ie, move functions around every time the file gets regenerated). Its annoying, but I don't think you're going to get around it. BeyondCompare really is one of the best comparison utilities out there.
