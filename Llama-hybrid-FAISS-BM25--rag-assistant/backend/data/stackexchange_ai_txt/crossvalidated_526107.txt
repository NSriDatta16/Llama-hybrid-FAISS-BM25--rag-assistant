how to calculate total loss using losses of batches

I want to train a neural network in pytorch and I want to check it's total loss but I get gpu memory error. so I can't fit whole train dataset into gpu and calculate the total loss of train dataset, but I have no problem calculating losses of batches, so is there any way to calculate whole dataset loss using losses of batches?
