My organizations have followed this pattern: Systems engineer or QA notices the bug and enters it in the bug tracking tool. PM or Dev Lead prioritizes the bug according to severity, possible workaround, and the effort required to fix it. PM or Dev Lead assigns the bug to a developer. Developer reproduces the bug, with any necessary help from the person in step 1. Developer codes a solution and makes a build (or has a build made). Tester from step 1 retests the bug. If the bug is fixed, redeploy or patch. Else, repeat steps 5 and 6 until it is fixed or a more pressing issue takes priority. If the bug was found by the customer, verify with them that it is fixed. Generally, bugs go through this assignment cycle: Tester -> (PM/Lead, then developer; or developer) -> Tester -> PM/Lead -> Closed.
