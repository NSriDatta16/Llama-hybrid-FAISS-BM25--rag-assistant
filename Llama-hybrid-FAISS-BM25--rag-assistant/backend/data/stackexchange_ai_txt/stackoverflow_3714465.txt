history/favourite feature iphone

For my current development of iphone app, I want to implement history/favorite feature. After lots of googling I came to conclusion that 'NSUserDefaults' would work better in case of short data storage. But still I am not clear how to interact with NSUserDefaults....Can anyone refer any example or article to work out with this requirement? Help appreciated... Thanks
