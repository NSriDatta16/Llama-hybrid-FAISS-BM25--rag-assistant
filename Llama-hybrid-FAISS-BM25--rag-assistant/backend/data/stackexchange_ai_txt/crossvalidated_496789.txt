Yes, I agree that the John Rice book is not good for self-study. It jumps around topics of varying difficulty, although it is obvious the author is a very experienced practitioner. For my level, it does more confusion than enlightenment. I would highly recommend: Dimitri Bertsekas Sheldon Ross Ron C. Mittelhammer Richard Larsen You can contact me if you want copies.
