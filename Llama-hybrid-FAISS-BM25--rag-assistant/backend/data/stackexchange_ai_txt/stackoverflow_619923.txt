How to use Brail as a stand-alone general purpose templating engine (like NVelocity)?

I've been using NVelocity as a stand-alone templating engine in my text file generator. The problem with NVelocity is that the macros are quite shaky; pretty much all errors I get are from faulty macro implementation. It would be cool if I could just use some other templating engine, such as Brail. That way I would just write functions that output strings. What's the best way of embedding Brail engine? I would like to just pass it a string containing the template (not reading from disk), and I would like to minimize the number of external dependencies. EDIT: I found the answer myself. Take a look at this source file from Castle .
