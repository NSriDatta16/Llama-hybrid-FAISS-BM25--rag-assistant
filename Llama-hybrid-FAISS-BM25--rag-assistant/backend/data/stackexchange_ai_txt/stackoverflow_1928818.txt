How to copy a disorganized Visual Studio solution?

Hey. I've a very large C# solution, with many projects that are messy in many locations in my computer. I want to send the solution to a friend. Is there any tool to copy the solution to a new directory, with all the projects in it, cleaned and organized? Thanks.
