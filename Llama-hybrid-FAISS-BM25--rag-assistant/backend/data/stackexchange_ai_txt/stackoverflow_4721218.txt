The best approach (to me) to find candidates for unused methods is to use coverage tools, like emma. Instrument you application, use it excessivly and examine the emma logs - methods that not have been used during the session may be unused and you can use your favourite IDE (eclipse, ...) to examine the unvisited methods call hierarchies. I doubt, that find bugs or any other code analyser can really detect unused methods, because methods may be called by other libraries (for all non-private methods) called remotely invoked through reflection API (even private methods, technically spoken)
