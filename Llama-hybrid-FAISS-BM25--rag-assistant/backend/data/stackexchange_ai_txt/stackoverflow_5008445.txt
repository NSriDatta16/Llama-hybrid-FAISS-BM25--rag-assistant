Android LIVE Wallpaper approach?

I'm entirely new to Android development, and I'm interested in making a live wallpaper. I was thinking about looping a set of pictures instead of drawing the animation. Is this a possible approach? If possible is this a suitable or ideal way of doing it, does it eat up memory and would i need images with different resolutions because of the fragmentation?(hundreds of different devices) Thanks in advance :)
