Is house price prediction a regression or a time series problem?

I have a dataset of house prices from 2000 to 2016 from several U.S.A. cities. From this I want to predict the price of similar houses at the current date, is this better addressed as a regression problem or as a time series problem. An important point is that the data I have till now is rather sparse, just few thousand of records.
