For a given fixed parameter $\theta$ , the coverage of a Bayesian credible interval can be greater or lower than the nominal value. For example, coverage may be greater than nominal if the prior is informative and is centred on the 'true' value of the parameter - see this question and its answers. Conversely, the coverage can be lower than nominal. For example, if the prior for $\theta$ is uniform on the interval $[0,1]$ and there are no data ( $y$ is 'empty') then the coverage might be zero if the true value $\theta and we always choose the equal-tailed credible interval for $\theta$ . If $\theta$ is not fixed but is instead sampled from the prior then you will get the nominal coverage, as explained in the answers you reference - but this is a somewhat different situation.
