You probably won't find a single answer because non-linear regression is a catch-all phrase that can mean arbitrarily complicated models. In such a case, it's hard to give any recommendations. Also, keep in mind that most such recommendations are just rules of thumb that do not give any guarantees of correctness. There is even no single (or simple) answer for linear regression or logistic regression not to say about more complicated models.
