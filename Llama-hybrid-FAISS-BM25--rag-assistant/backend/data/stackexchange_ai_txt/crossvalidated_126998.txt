Checking linearity assumption of logistic regression using smoothed plot

I would like to check on the linearity assumption of my continuous variables in my logistic regression. I have produced some loess plots and I can see that they are not linear. What are the next step I should take? Is there any rough guide to the transformation that I should use on my variable by looking at the shape of my plot? The last plot is a transformation suggested by @TenaliRaman
