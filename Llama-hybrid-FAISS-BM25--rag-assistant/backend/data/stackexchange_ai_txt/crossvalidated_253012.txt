It is pretty straightforward: there are no differences between Bayesians and frequentists regarding the idea of the data-generating model. To understand this, consider first that the data-generating model is mathematically encoded in the likelihood, which is the basis for the inference of Bayesians and frequentists alike. And there is zero difference between a Bayesian and frequentist likelihood. Now, you could say: that doesn't mean that Bayesians think that the parameters of the data-generating process are fixed. Sure, but really, it makes very little sense to think otherwise - what would be the point of estimating a quantity that is not fixed? What would that even mean mathematically? Of course, it could be that you have a quantity that is not a value, but a distribution. But then you estimate the distribution, so it is fixed again. The real difference, as @Xi'an says, is not in the assumption about how our data is generated, but in the inference. So, when you say However, in the Bayesian setting, we model the parameter as a random variable. I would disagree - we model our knowledge / uncertainty about the true parameter as a random variable - that is the subtle, but important difference - we treat the parameter as random variables to explore our uncertainty about their "true" value.
