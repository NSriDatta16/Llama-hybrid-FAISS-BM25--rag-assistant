Help with notation!

I have calculated the average absolute difference with the accompanying absolute standard deviation. I write this as e.g.: |0.05 +- 0.12| Is this correct? I have also calculated the average standard deviation for a number of samples. I refer to this as: 'Âµ' Is this also correct? or would sigma be better? I would appreciate some suggestions on proper notation if these are not good.
