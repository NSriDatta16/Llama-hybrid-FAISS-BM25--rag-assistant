Definitely don't grow and shrink 4 bytes at a time. Your heap will become very fragmented, and you'll spend too much time in the allocator. Even on a memory-limited architecture, you don't want to be micro-managing memory like that. Choose a "page size", and increment by that amount. It's common to recommend doubling the size, but I'm not sure why that is. You probably know more about how the stack will be used to understand how best to increment the size.
