Confidence interval for the intercept in logistic regression

Some major commercial statistical packages (e.g., SPSS) do not report a CI for the intercept term in logistic regression. [Based on answer below R does provide CI for intercept] Why might confidence intervals for the intercept term not be included by default? UPDATE: Based on feedback, Confidence Intervals for odds associated with intercept term are reported in some stat. packages. And, obviously, they can be easily computed manually, knowing the standard error. Therefore, reformulated question: What is the interpretation of intercept's CIs (for odds) in logistic regression?
