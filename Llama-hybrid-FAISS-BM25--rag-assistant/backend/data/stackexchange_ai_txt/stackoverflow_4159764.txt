You can do something like that, but it will be hard to make something that wont be fragile. You can take a look at the Redirect 403 to User Login module. It redirects anonymous users to the login page. You can either use that as a basis to build your own module, I would imagine only a few tweaks would be needed to make it work how you want. You might be able to alter the module with your own module, to make it function like you want, but I don't know exactly how it's built and if that's an option.
