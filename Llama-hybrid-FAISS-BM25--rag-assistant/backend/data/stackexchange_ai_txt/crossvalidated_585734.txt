How to apply the t-test to data with multiple observations per pair

Imagine I collect time series data from a group of people before and after treatment. Now if I want to compare the results before and after should I take the average of the time series and apply a paired t-test? I assume taking average will lose some information. Is there any other way to apply a comparison test without losing any time series information? An exact question/problem has been posted here: Paired t-test with multiple observations per pair . Did not understand the accepted answer and could not comment due minimum reputation required.
