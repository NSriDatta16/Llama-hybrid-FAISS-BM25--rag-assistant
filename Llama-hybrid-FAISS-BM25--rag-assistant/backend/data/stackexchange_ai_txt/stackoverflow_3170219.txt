I am running Chrome v 5.0.370. When I perform the "Delete cookies and other site data" from the "Clear Browsing Data" dialog, localStorage is in fact wiped out. Now, to be literal, if the user fires up Webkit Inspector, opens the Storage tab, and only deletes cookies, then localStorage will not be affected. But I assume you mean through the normal dialog.
