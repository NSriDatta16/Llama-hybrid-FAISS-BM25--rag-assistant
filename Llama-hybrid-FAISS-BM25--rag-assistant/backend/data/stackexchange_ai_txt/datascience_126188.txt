What are these 'code' columns in this csv and what does Pandas pivot method do with it?

In a csv discussed in the book HoML (hands on machine learning), what do the values in capital letters represent? Are these some sort of code? Also, it seems the pandas.pivot() methods does something with these values. So what are these values for and what does pandas.pivot() do with it? oecd_bli = pd.read_csv(datapath + "oecd_bli_2015.csv", thousands=',') oecd_bli = oecd_bli[oecd_bli["INEQUALITY"]=="TOT"] oecd_bli = oecd_bli.pivot(index="Country", columns="Indicator", values="Value") The csv is available in this link of the homl github. link to csv on homl github I looked at other .csv and they look different, also I searched on the pandas help but didn't get the answer. thank you
