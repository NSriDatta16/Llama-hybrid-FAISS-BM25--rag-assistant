You may want to consider SQL Server 2008 on the server and SQL Server Compact on the local machine. Each is optimised for that kind of environment, and the data storage and management features that they offer are quite similar. Abstracting out access mechanism from your code, as jasper suggests, should be extremely easy with this pair of technologies. SQL Server Compact is an embedded database engine that runs in-process with your app, installs together with it as a "single DLL", and does not need a separate database server installation. In any case, I totally agree with jasper that you should focus on the architecture and design on the system, and think of technology as something secondary.
