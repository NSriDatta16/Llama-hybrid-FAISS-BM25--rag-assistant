It probably has the most to do with what book it came from. Singleton was first popularized in "Design Patterns" by the Gang of Four. ActiveRecord was in "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture", by Martin Fowler. The Gang of Four described Design Patterns as generally useful object-oriented class structures. Fowler's book is about how to access enterprise pieces (databases, messaging backbones, etc) in object-oriented code.
