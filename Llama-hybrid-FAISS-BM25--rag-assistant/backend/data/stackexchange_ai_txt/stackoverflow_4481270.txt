The Credit Card saved method will allow you to accept credit card information for a purchase, but Magento will make no attempt to verify its accuracy other than a simple luhn checksum. The credit card information will be stored in the database, encrypted using a call to Mage::helper('core')->encrypt($data) In a default 1.4.2 instal, you can view the payment information (including the credit card) with the following SQL query SELECT * FROM sales_flat_order_payment You can view this Payment method in System -> Config -> Payment Methods -> Saved CC You can also set it's "enabled" config value to "No", which will remove this as an option. Fully securing credit card information is a Hard Thingâ„¢, both from a technical and bureaucratic standpoint. Unless you and your team have the expertise to do it (which, based on your question, I'm going to assume is a no) you don't want this option turned on.
