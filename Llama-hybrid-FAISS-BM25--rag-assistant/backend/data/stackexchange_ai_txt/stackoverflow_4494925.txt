According to this forum thread there is an official answer: ... we’re no longer offering Bridge Connect. We’re sorry for the inconvenience ... This module was included in previous Enterprise versions, but they have removed it in the latest ones. Maybe they are going to release something new and more flexible, but who knows... If you want to integrate with some particular ERP/CRM you should look closer on extensions available on Magento Connect or write your own.
