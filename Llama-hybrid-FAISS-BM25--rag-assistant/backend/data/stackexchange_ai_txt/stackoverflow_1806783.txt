How to display static text and dynamic text(generated by variables) differently in PHP?

A HTML file is generated by a PHP file. Generally speaking, what a user can see from a HTML file can be divided into two parts, one part is static; another part is dynamic, this part is represented by variables in the PHP file. For example: $html= Total Price:$row[column1] Quota:$row[column2] $row[column3] Balance: $row[column4] Current Unit_price: $row[column5] $row[column6] readers are expected. Announcer:$row[column6] eod; echo $html; Total Price: Quota: Balance: Current Unit_price: readers are expected.Announcers: is one part, it is static; $row[column1]$row[column2]$row[column3]$row[column4]$row[column5]$row[column6] is another part, the text is generated by variables, and the content of the text is dynamic. I knew that I can do it by wrapping them with , , , etc. But is there a better way to do it without any markers? How to differentiate both when displaying them? How to control the color or font of two parts respectively? Is there an elegant way to do it?
