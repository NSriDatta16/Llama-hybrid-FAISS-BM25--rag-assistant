When I was working on Hadamard products, I had found these papers very useful. It seems relevant to your work too https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003620100078 https://ac.els-cdn.com/0024379573900232/1-s2.0-0024379573900232-main.pdf?_tid=3509e06a-41ee-4bd1-bca4-5cfc668a7ee3&acdnat=1520922171_3b634a65ab31aede520c7295a8328555 I am surprised people think it is useless. It finds diverse use in the study of non negative matrices, and even in neural networks (LSTMs essentially make Hadamard products as part of their formulation). A good starting point might be "Topics in Matrix Analysis" by Horn and Johnson. They have an entire chapter devoted to the Hadamard product. The matrices for which I was finding hadamard products were not typically random, so I cannot provide too many good insights apart from the ones above
