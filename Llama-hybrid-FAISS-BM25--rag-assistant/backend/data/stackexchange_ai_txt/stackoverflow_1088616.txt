Referencing a morph in Squeak (Mophic) created by direct manipulation via 'code'

How do I reference (i.e. program) a Morph created by direct manipulation, for instance dragging a text box from the supplies menu to the desktop, via Squeak/Smalltalk code in say the workspace? I'm okay (well sort of - I'm just learning Morphic) when I instantiate a Morph via Squeak/Smalltalk code but I'm at a loss when I've dragged a Morph into existence.
