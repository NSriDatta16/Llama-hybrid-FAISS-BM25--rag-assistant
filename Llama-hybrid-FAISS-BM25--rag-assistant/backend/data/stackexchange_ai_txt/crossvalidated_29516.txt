This sounds like just a stacked bar chart. I don't see how you handle the situation when the "contribution" made by a predictor and its coefficient is negative. But you might get something like the not very elegant but workable below. It returns warnings for when it is trying to plot something negative. Perhaps in your case this doesn't happen. The code uses ggplot2 0.8.9 - I think melt() changes in the latest implementation but I don't have it installed at work: library(ggplot2) X1
