Storage transactions in Redland's Python bindings?

I've currently skimming through the Python-bindings for Redland and haven't found a clean way to do transactions on the storage engine via it. I found some model-transactions within the low-level Redland module: import RDF, Redland storage = RDF.Storage(...) model = RDF.Model(storage) Redland.librdf_model_transaction_start(model._model) try: # Do something Redland.librdf_model_transaction_commit(model._model) model.sync() except: Redland.librdf_model_transaction_rollback(model._model) Do these also translate down to the storage layer? Thanks :-)
