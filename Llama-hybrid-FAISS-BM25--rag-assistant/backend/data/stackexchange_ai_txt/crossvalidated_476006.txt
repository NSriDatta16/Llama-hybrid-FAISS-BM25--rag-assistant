Which specific type of recurrent neural network (RNN) is required to solve this supervised sequence problem?

I have a variety of features and an sequence target variable of fixed dimension 1x20 e.g. [0,0,0,1,0,...]. I've been reading up on the potential of RNNs to predict sequences. What specific methods/architectures can be used to solve this problem? i.e. given a list of features, predict the full target vector. Is sequence to sequence prediction useful here? i.e. convert the features into a vector so I'm predicting a target vector from an input feature vector. Is there a name for these specific problems and is there a state of the art you'd recommend I look into (or any papers)?
