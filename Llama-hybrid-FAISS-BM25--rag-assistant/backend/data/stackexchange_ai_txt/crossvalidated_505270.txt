Can the dimension of a feature map in the CNN be bigger than the original image dimension?

I have implemented an convolutional Autoencoder of a paper. The thing is that I want to look at images of the size 32x32, but the original Autoencoder is used on 128x128 images. After I changed the Layers so it would fit my image size it worked fine with reconstruction and everything. But I now noticed that the dimension of several feature maps in the conv-layers are bigger than my original input images size. For me it is unclear if a CNN can have a higher dimensional feature map than the input image. One of my conv-layers creates a feature map of the dimension 16x16x64 which is significantly higher than the input image size of 32x32x3. Can this happen in CNNs or is this some kind of no go?
