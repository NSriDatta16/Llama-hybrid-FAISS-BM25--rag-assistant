VB6 Game Development

I am developing a game in VB6 (plz don't ask me why :) ). The storyboard is ready and a rough implementation is underway. I am following a "pure-software-rendering" approach. (i.e. no DirectX, no openGL etc.) Amongst many others, the following "serious" problems exist: 2D alpha transparency reqd. to implement overlays. Parallax implementation to give depth-of-field illusion. Capturing mouse-scroll events globally (as in FPS-es; mapping them to changing weapon). Async sound play with absolute "near-zero-lag". Any ideas anyone. Please suggest any well documented library/ocx or sample-code . Plz do suggest solutions with good performance and as little overhead as possible. Also, anyone who has developed any games, and would be open to sharing her/his code would be highly appreciated. (any well-acknowledged VB games whose source-code i can study??) UPDATE: Here is a screen shot of GearHead Garage . This picture ought to describe what i was attempting in words above... :) (source: softwarepod.com )
