What's discouraging you from writing ruby 1.9-specific code?

So far, I've been merely using YARV (ruby 1.9) as merely a faster implementation of ruby than ruby 1.8, and ensured that all of my code is backwards-compatible with ruby 1.8.6. What circumstances, if any, are stopping you from writing 1.9-specific code? One reason per answer.
