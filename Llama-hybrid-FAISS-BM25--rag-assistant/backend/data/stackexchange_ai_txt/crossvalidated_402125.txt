I suspect that your events are not independent but rather involve some sequential dependencies, because you mentioned that the rate is not constant and don't know any controlling variables. The sample is the portion of the data randomly sampled from the population. Since you use a deterministic range to define your sample (e.g. select first N events out of the list of N+1 events) you can not treat it as a valid sample. Thankfully, as you already noted, you can compute your population statistics directly. Yet those statistics wouldn't lead to any reasonable outcomes, because you've also noted that the rate is not constant - and those statistics can provide you only with a constant. You can approach the prediction problem in multiple ways. I'll provide you one just to give you a hint. Your problem is actually to model a probability $p(e_t = 1 | e_{t-1}, e_{t-2}, ..., e_0)$ of observing the event at time $t$ given the information about all previous events. It is often the case that it is not necessary to consider all of the previous events, but only limit yourself the last K. You end up with $p(e_t = 1 | e_{t-1}, e_{t-2}, ..., e_{t-K})$ . For simplicity you could just assume, that this probability equals to the rate of the events within this K-length window: $$p(e_t = 1 | e_{t-1}, e_{t-2}, ..., e_{t-K}) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_i^K e_{t-i}$$ You can then evaluate this model on different windows sampled from your list in order to find the best window size. You can then improve this model by introducing new assumptions and/or parameters. Take a look at language models and kernel density estimation .
