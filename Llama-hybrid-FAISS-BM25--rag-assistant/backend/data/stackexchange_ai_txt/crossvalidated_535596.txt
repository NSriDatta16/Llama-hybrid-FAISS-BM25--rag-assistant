Dealing with label noise (Regression, NLP)

For my school project, my group is tackling this Kaggle challenge (assign reading level based on passage). commonlitreadabilityprize However, it seems there is some label noise (examples below, lower score means more difficult) https://i.stack.imgur.com/tNwKU.jpg https://i.stack.imgur.com/vEyuO.jpg https://i.stack.imgur.com/w9KcE.jpg What are some good ways with identifying and/or correcting mislabeled regression scores for textual data? Since this is for a Deep Learning course, deep methods would be preferred.
