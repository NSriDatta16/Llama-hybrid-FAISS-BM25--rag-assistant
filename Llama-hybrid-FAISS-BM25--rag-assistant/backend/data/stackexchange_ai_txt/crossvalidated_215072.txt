Yes. In the simplest case, say $x$ is the input, $t$ is the target value, $y(x,w)$ is the output of the network, minimizing the sum-of-squares loss $$E=\sum(t_i-y(x_i,w))^2$$ can be interpreted as maximizing the log-likelihood of $$p(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{x},w,b)=\prod N(t_i|y(x_i,w),b)$$ under the assumption of a Gaussian noise (see any textbook for details). So in this sense the output of the network is the parameter of a Gaussian distribution. In general the output of neural networks can be interpreted as function parameters as long as they are of the same range.
