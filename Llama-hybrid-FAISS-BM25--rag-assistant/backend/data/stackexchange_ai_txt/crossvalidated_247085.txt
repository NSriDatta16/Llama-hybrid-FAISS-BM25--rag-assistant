The Gaussian assumption is not a necessary one, and actually not always correct. In practice you will see many other distributions if many sources of data are collected. I've analyzed over 100 million time series signals for anomaly detection and more than half follow various other distributions (exponential, Possion, log-normal, gaussian mixtures and more). While estimating the Gaussian parameters is simple, in practice it will lead to poor models of normalcy in many cases. The best approach is to design an algorithm for choosing the most appropriate distribution for a given data set, or use non-parametric techniques.
