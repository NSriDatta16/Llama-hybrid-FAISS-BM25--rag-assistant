How can logistic regression have a factorial predictor and no intercept?

I tried a regression in the form ${\rm logit}(Y) = {\rm coefficient}\times X + 0 + e$, where $Y$ is a binomial variable and $X$ is a factor variable with $n$ levels. I noticed that removing the intercept yields higher $p$ values. I'm wondering how to interpret it though. Since removing the intercept makes it equal to $0$, I believe that the coefficients returned are relative to a $0$ probability of the event $Y$ and that all $X$ factors are in the $0$ state. But I think this is impossible isn't it? $X$ are mutually exclusive factors, therefore it's impossible to have a case where no factor is $1$, at least in the presented observations. And it cannot be interpreted like the coefficient is relative to hypothetical cases in which really no one of the factors is present, because we have no data like that. Regarding $Y$ having a $0$ intercept, wouldn't it mean forcing the probability of the event to $0$ when none of the factors is present? Again, this is an impossible case. Nonetheless this kind of regression would allow me to retrieve pure probability range of the event Y given a factor by transforming the coefficients in the confidence intervals given as $\exp({\rm coefficient})/(1 + \exp({\rm coefficient}))$, and the $p$ values would test whether this probability is not $50\%$. This could also be a valuable result, since it would give independent probabilities for each factor. Am I wrong?
