short answer, you cannot run your current model as described into the future. However, there is hope. When building a forecasting model, you're typically using an "autoregressive" model, which is predicting, for example, the price in the future based on the price in the past. The reason this works is you are both predicting the next value, and generating the next input for your model. Let's say you have an autoregressive model $F(X) \rightarrow Y$ that predict the price of the stock tomorrow ( $Y$ ) based on the price today ( $X$ ). You can run this into the future by recursive calls to your model. $Y_{10}$ = $F(Y_9)$ = $F(F(Y_8))$ ... $= F(...F(X)$ . So let's take a look at your case. Your model takes as input a variety of technical indicators $\color{grey}{\text{RSI, ROC, stochastic oscillators (fast and slow), macd, on balance volume and the 200 day moving average}}$ So with your current model, in order to project into the future 10 days, we need an estimate of these features 9 days into the future. Here are a couple solutions. You could train a model to predicts 10 days into the future. So instead of training $F(X_i) \rightarrow Y_{i+1}$ you train $F(X_i) \rightarrow Y_{i+10}$ . You could build a model to predict your features into the future. $F(X_i) \rightarrow X_{i+1}$ , and then use these new estimated features with your current model. This is easier if $\color{grey}{\text{RSI, ROC, stochastic oscillators, ...}}$ are derived from the price. In which case, we can estimate the price and then derive these values. Although, I'm not familiar with the finance to say if you can derive them from price. Although, as a word of warning, you should think deeply about your model performance, and if it's fooling you. You may consider the following: Have you compared performance to any simple baseline models? Is there any "target leakage"? If you look at interpreting your model, do the patterns it found make sense?
