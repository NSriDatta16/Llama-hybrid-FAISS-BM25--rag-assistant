the fulfillment of the detailed balance equation guarantees that our MC has reached its stationary distribution (given we ensure ergodicity). This is not a correct statement. Detailed balance wrt $\pi(x)$ guarantees that $\pi(x)$ is the stationary distiribution for the Markov chain. The fact that the MC "reaches" this stationary distribution is the definition of ergodicity of the Markov chain. (Note that there is a difference between stationary distribution and limiting distribution). Detailed balance is a property of a Markov chain and says close to nothing about the limiting behavior of the chain. So for a chain that is detailed balanced, the DBE will hold at every step of the Markov chain.
