Algorithm or formula to measure happiness?

I am working on a project that takes in comments in a given Facebook page and determines the average happiness rating for it based on users of the page. My question is where would I find a formula, rating, or any other literature that would help me find a way to measure happiness using words and collections of words? I'm looking for something similar to cosine similarity I suppose, but not to find similar words, but to find the average positivity or happiness related to a word or collection of words. I'm not entirely sure this is the correct place for this question, but it has to do with data, and big data within Facebook so I am hoping to either get a question or be directed to somewhere that I may be able to find my answer. Thanks in advance for your help.
