How do I use deep learning (Convolution Neural Network) with small training data-set?

I have an image data set of around 180 images in 60 classes (3 images per class). I am able to build a classifier using feature matching. However, I want to try Convolution Neural Networks and see if I can improve. I don't think I can train a CNN on just 120 images. If that's true, what is the best way to approach this problem?
