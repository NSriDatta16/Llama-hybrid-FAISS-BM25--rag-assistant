Recommendation based on correlation

everyone! My question is very basic. If we find a statistical correlation between grade-point averages and test scores after taking an online short course, what kind of recommendation for a policy can we give based on this? Can we recommend that the school develops different courses to suit students with different grade-point averages so as to help them get better test scores? Thank you very much. [Edited]
