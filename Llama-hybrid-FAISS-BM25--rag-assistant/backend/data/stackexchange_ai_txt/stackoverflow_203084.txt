I would hesitate to manage your site on your web host with Subversion unless you have shell access. When performing Subversion operations, there might be things that require your interactive attention which you wouldn't be able to provide through a script interface. What I might suggest instead, is to maintain a local checkout directory that mirrors your remote directory. When you want to make a change to your live site, do an svn update on your local checkout, to make it look exactly like you want, then use your favourite mirroring tool ( rsync or something) to push the site up to your web host. Alternately, you could switch web hosts to one where you have shell access. I manage some web sites this way using Git and it works really well.
