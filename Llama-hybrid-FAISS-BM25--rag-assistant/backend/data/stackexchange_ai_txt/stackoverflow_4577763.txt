Unfortunately attachment_fu does not support the same attachment "interface" for :storage => :db_file as it does for :storage => :file_system , but there's a plugin that fills the void here : https://github.com/kares/attachment_fx Extends the file interface for the :db_file backend (@see attachment_fu :storage option). The database backend interface mimics the :file_system storage, the db data is on-demand downloaded into the public directory (the target path prefix is customizable with the :path_prefix option). You basically use the :file_system methods like You're used to with the :db_file backend e.g. photo.public_filename(:small) . As a bonus You can enjoy some useful helpers from the owning model : user.has_photo? user.photo_path(:small) user.photo_full_path
