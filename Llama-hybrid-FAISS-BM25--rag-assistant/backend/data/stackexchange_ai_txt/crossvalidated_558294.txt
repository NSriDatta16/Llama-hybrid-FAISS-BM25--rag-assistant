Make 21-days ahead forecast with daily log return data?

I want to make daily 1-days and 21-days ahead forecasts of a stock price. I have used daily log return data for both 1-day and 21-days forecasts. Now I'm not sure if that is correct for the 21-day case since I would try to forecast the daily change from the 20th to the 21th days rather than a 21 day return. Do I have to use a completely new time series and create daily 21-day returns to make the 21-day ahead forecasts? Or is the procedure I have tried correct?
