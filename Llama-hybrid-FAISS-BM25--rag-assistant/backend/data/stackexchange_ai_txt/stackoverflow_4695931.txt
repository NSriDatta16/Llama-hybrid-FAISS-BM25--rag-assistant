Are you trying to support an old iPhone OS version and thus stuck with -touchesBegan, -touchesMoved, etc? If not, I suggest you use UIGestureRecognizers instead. You wont have to worry about other views that way. The view that gets the touch will get it's gesture recognizer executed, no need to worry about hit testing.
