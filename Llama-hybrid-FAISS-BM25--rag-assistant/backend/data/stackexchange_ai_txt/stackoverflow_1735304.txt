Magento is hard-wired to only import images from the /media/import/ directory. I think it needs the images to be on it's own server to properly copy them to a new location within /media/catalog/product/. You'll have to either download all the images your self manually and upload them to /media/import/, or write a module that will override some of the core functionality that will get the images and process them properly from an outside source.
