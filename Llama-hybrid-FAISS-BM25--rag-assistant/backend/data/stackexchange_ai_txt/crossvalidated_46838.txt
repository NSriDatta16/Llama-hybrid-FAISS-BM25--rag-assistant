I think you are expecting too much from machine learning algorithms. A computer cannot decide whether item 1 is better than item 2 on its own. What a Machine Learning algorithm can do is if you give it a few examples where you have rated some item 1 to be better than item 2, then it can learn to rank the items [1]. But you still need a training data where you provide examples of items and with information of whether item 1 is greater than item 2 for all items in the training data.
