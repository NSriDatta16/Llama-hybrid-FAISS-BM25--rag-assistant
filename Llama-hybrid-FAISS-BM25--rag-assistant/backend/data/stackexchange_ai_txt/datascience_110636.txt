How to draw each ROC curve of an SVM model with cross validation

I would like to make a graph like the following in python: That is, one curve for each fold. I have the following code where I use an SVM model to classify some data kf = KFold(n_splits=10) a, fma, fmi = [], [], [] for train, eval in kf.split(x_train): x_train_i, x_eval_i, y_train_i, y_eval_i = x_train[train], x_train[eval], y_train[train], y_train[eval] c = svm.SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma='scale', C=40).fit( x_train_i, y_train_i ) p = c.predict(x_eval_i) acc = c.score(x_eval_i, y_eval_i) f1ma = f1_score(y_eval_i, p, average='macro') f1mi = f1_score(y_eval_i, p, average='micro') a.append(acc) fma.append(f1ma) fmi.append(f1mi) Would anyone know what to add in the loop to display a graph like the one above? Thank you very much.
