Proof of Herglotz Theorem in Time Series Analysis

I am studying time series, following Time Series Theory and Methods by Brockwell and Davis. I am reading the proof of the Herglotz Theorem, I have the following questions. First, the proof given in the book is the next one: I don´t understand the equality given in the proof (I drew an arrow there) How to get $\frac{1}{2\pi N}\displaystyle\sum_{|m|-N}(N-|m|)e^{imv}\gamma(v)$ Aditionally, I don't have clear why is possible to say that $f_N(.)I_{(-\pi,\pi]}$ is a density function? I add the part where is mentioned that $f_N$ is a density, I don´t have clear why it is true.
