Hooking into comment_text() to add surrounding tag

Trying to hook into the function comment_text() supplied by Wordpress API to wrap the output of every comment into a ... container I am running into the following problem: Without my added filter the output of comment_text() looks like this: Hello User! Thank you for your comment. Stefan Thats fine but as I said I would like to have it wrapped into a ... . As far as I know the correct way doing this would be in adding a filter to functions.php of my theme and so I did: function stefan_wrap_comment_text($content) { return " ". $content ." "; } add_filter('comment_text', 'stefan_wrap_comment_text'); As I can see from the output the given filter works but it has a negative sideeffect to the first paragraph of the content as you can see in the following example. The first paragraph should be Hello User! but looks like this: Hello User! . Hello User! Thank you for your comment. Stefan Any ideas or hints what I am doing wrong?
