Choosing the proper statistical approach for glm

I have data on alcohol use by drivers as a binary response variable along with many other variables such as: Driver's age, gender and race Passenger's (if present) age, gender Location variables Road characteristics Here is sample of the data: data1 Now, how do I go about analyzing the data. Will my method depend on what I want to model / analyze? My question is more general than this particular data-set. Should we always take all the available data together. For example, suppose I want to see how passenger's age and gender affect driver's being drunk. One thing I can do is do an ANOVA with respect to passenger's gender. One can also do a binary logistic regression with all data and study the marginal effects/odds-ratios for passenger's gender. How about spiting the data into two sets based on passenger's gender and then getting two separate models and comparing the co-efficient? To me it seems wrong since i have not seen anything like that. Can anyone explain to me why is it so? You may also give a hint on how you would go about analyzing this data from scratch.
