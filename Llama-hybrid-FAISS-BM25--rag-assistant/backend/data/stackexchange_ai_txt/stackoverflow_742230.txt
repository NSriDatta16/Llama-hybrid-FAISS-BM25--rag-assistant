The flash memory that makes up most of the iPhone's advertized "memory" is a kind of hybrid between RAM and "disk space" in its most important characteristics: Less expensive than RAM, more expensive than a harddisk Sequential transfer rate is lower than RAM's, about the same as a harddisk's (though this really depends on the type and quality of flash memory) Random access delay is higher than RAM's, but much lower than a harddisk's The last point is the most important one from a programmer's point of view. All kinds of basic programming techniques and an incredible amount of effort hinges on the fact that compared to most other things that happen in a computer, random access to harddisk memory takes eons because it involves physical movements - and that's where most of your storage is. This basically means that in an environment with flash memory instead of a harddisk, you can get away with a lot of shit that would absolutely kill an app operating with a harddisk. There aren't really any downsides except for the limited amount of storage. Of course, conversely, it may mean that an app ported from the iPhone to a PC may exhibit godawful performance. Then again, the PC's OS might hide this by caching HD accesses in the more plentiful RAM.
