Covering transformation for Lipschitz functions: can we prove that $\mathcal{H}(r,\mathcal {G'},||.||_n)\asymp \mathcal{H}(r/C_n,\mathcal {A'},\rho)$?

Let assume that $\mathcal{A'}\subset \mathcal {A}$ (is a vector space) and $\mathcal {G'}:=\{g_\theta : \ \theta\in \mathcal{A'}\}$ (space of functions parameterized by $\mathcal{A'}$ ) and a metric $\rho: \mathcal{A'}\times \mathcal{A'}\to R$ . Also assume that $|g_{\theta}(x)-g_{\gamma}(x)|\le C(x) \rho(\theta,\gamma)$ for every $\theta,\gamma\in \mathcal{A'}$ and $x\in R^d$ , that means the function space $\mathcal{G'}$ is Lipschitz ( $C(x)$ is the Lipschitz constant in a sense) with respect to the parameters. Then, it is not difficult to prove that $\mathcal{H}(r,\mathcal {G'},||.||_n)\le \mathcal{H}(r/C_n,\mathcal {A'},\rho)$ for all $r> 0$ , that $\mathcal{H}(r,\mathcal {G'},||.||_n)$ is the entropy ( $\log$ of covering number) of the space $\mathcal{G'}$ with radius $r$ , and $\mathcal{H}(r/C_n,\mathcal {A'},\rho)$ is the entropy of the space $\mathcal{A'}$ with radius $r/C_n$ . Clarifying the notations a bit: $\mathcal {G'}$ is the space of functions which are parameterized by some $\theta\in \mathcal {A'}$ . For example, you can see $\mathcal {G'}$ as the space of neural networks that their weights belongs to $\mathcal {A'}$ (some vector space). By $R$ we mean real space. Now, my question is can we go even more further and prove that $\mathcal{H}(r,\mathcal {G'},||.||_n)\asymp \mathcal{H}(r/C_n,\mathcal {A'},\rho)$ ? Or more specifically, can we also prove that $\mathcal{H}(r,\mathcal {G'},||.||_n)\ge a \mathcal{H}(r/C_n,\mathcal {A'},\rho)$ for a constant a? (we use $C_n=1/n\sum_{i=1:n}C(x_i)$ ).
