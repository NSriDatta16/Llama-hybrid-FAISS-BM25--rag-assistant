Is there a way one can use custom priorities in syslog daemon or rsyslog daemon? Syslog output is something admins look into. And the syslog is managed by the user-space daemon. What that means, if you would manage somehow to cram your own custom priorities into the syslog() call, the receiving side, likewise the users, wouldn't be able to make much out of them. The priorities (or levels) as they are documented for the syslog() call are pretty straightforward, covering all levels of attentions admins has to pay to the error conditions. Because that is what the levels there are for. I would recommend posing on the SO another question with details what you really want to achieve. Because inventing custom priorities is a step in wrong direction. P.S. Otherwise, if it is some sort of tracing or debugging or diagnostic output, used only during development/testing/installation, you can always use one of the standard levels and distinct prefix in the log message. That's what I did on few occasions to be able to extract from the syslog (with grep) only the particular types of diagnostics.
