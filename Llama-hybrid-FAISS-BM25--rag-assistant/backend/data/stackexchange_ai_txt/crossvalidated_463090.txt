Is a population parameter really a fixed quantity?

This might be a simple issue. I consistently come across internet sources that say that a population parameter is "fixed" and cannot change. However, if we define, for example, our parameter to be the average age of living UK citizens, it could currently be, for example, 40.21292... years, which interestingly could easily be obtained because there is a registry (unlike parameters from other less-well-defined populations). However, the number of people that have been born and died before our next measurement is unlikely to be equal and thus the average age might, for example, be 40.10432 instead. In effect, our population parameter has changed. Could somebody explain that?
