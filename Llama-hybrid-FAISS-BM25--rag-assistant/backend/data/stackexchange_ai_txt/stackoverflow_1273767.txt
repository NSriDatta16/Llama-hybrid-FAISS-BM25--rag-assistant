Even better then just embedding a .txt with your flash, if you're more versed with programming I would suggest you to create a static class to store the values of your application. Just like: class StaticData { static public var siteTitle:String = "My site name"; static public var homeMessage:String = "Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet..."; static public var welcomeMessage:String = "Hello World"; static public var siteWidth:Number = 1024; static public var siteHeight:Number = 780; } This is a safe and realiable way to store static values using a simple class structure, to use a value from the class, you just need to call inside your flash: my_textfield.text = StaticData.siteTitle; my_shape.width = StaticData.siteWidth;
