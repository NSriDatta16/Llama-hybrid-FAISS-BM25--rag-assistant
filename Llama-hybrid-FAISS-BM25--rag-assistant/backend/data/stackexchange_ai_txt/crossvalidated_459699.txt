PCA sum(variance) != sum(explained_variance_)

As far as I understand the sum(variances) should always be equal to the sum(explained_variance_) , however when I run: data = [[1, 4], [5, 1], [1, 4], [6, 8], [7, 1], [2,3], [3, 4], [1, 5], [3, 9]] model = PCA(2) model.fit(data) variances = np.var(data, axis=0) print(sum(variances), sum(model.explained_variance_)) I get this output: 11.283950617283951 12.694444444444443 I'm probably making some silly mistake but I don't see where is the problem.
