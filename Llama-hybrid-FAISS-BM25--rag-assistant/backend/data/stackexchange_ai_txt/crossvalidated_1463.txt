You've stated something that is a classic counter argument to Bonferroni corrections. Shouldn't I adjust my alpha criterion based on every test I will ever make? This kind of ad absurdum implication is why some people do not believe in Bonferroni style corrections at all. Sometimes the kind of data one deals with in their career is such that this is not an issue. For judges who make one, or very few decisions on each new piece of evidence this is a very valid argument. But what about the judge with 20 defendants and who is basing their judgment on a single large set of data (e.g. war tribunals)? You're ignoring the kicks at the can part of the argument. Generally scientists are looking for something â€” a p-value less than alpha. Every attempt to find one is another kick at the can. One will eventually find one if one takes enough shots at it. Therefore, they should be penalized for doing that. The way you harmonize these two arguments is to realize they are both true. The simplest solution is to consider testing of differences within a single dataset as a kicks at the can kind of problem but that expanding the scope of correction outside that would be a slippery slope. This is a genuinely difficult problem in a number of fields, notably FMRI where there are thousands of data points being compared and there are bound to be some come up as significant by chance. Given that the field has been historically very exploratory one has to do something to correct for the fact that hundreds of areas of the brain will look significant purely by chance. Therefore, many methods of adjustment of criterion have been developed in that field. On the other hand, in some fields one might at most be looking at 3 to 5 levels of a variable and always just test every combination if a significant ANOVA occurs. This is known to have some problems (type 1 errors) but it's not particularly terrible. It depends on your point of view. The FMRI researcher recognizes a real need for a criterion shift. The person looking at a small ANOVA may feel that there's clearly something there from the test. The proper conservative point of view on the multiple comparisons is to always do something about them but only based on a single dataset. Any new data resets the criterion... unless you're a Bayesian...
