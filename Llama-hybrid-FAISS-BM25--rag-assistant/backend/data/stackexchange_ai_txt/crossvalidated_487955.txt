Weighted average, then adding an intercept term

I am working with a problem where we are calculating the weighted average of DNA modifications. Modified sites are placed into four different groups and the average weight is calculated from there. However, I am then supposed to add an intercept term. I am confused by "intercept term". How would I go about adding an intercept term in this case? The step is written below: "Next one forms a weighted average of the levels using the reported coefficient values and adds an intercept term."
