My question is that what is the main purpose of DTO? Like the expansion (Data Transfer Object) implies, DTOs are meant to transfer structured data across various tiers. DTOs enable you to decouple the protocol specific implementations that represent data, so that data from different sources can be abstracted before communication across tiers. For example, DTOs will allow you to decouple the data present in a HttpServletRequest object from its internal storage, so that you can send the data to a service in the business logic layer. The same applies for DTOs used to abstract the results obtained from a SQL query and residing in a ResultSet object. In short, DTOs allow you to transmit data without holding onto the source - you can forget about the HTTP response and the JDBC connections, while you work on the data. Can i use DTO's to map our relational database table or should i go with 'Bean'? You can adopt the second approach of using Beans. In fact, with JPA you do not require your DTOs at all. The JPA managed beans themselves represent data in various tables, and can be de-linked from the database state, so that you can use them for data transmission. If i use DTO's between layers then how can i represent a database table in object because DTO's among layers can contain properties which are not related to database table. That depends on how you want to couple the DTO with the database table. It is preferable to have a one-to-one mapping between the DTO and the database table, and choose another DTO for the purpose of transmitting properties not related to the table. After all, DTOs like every other object should have a single responsibility. If the responsibility is to reflect a database table, then it should contain other "irrelevant" properties. To extend the recommendation of using JPA in this context, it is poor design to have unrelated attributes in a JPA entity, especially when that unrelated attribute should be marked as transient and adds no value to the behavior of the entity.
