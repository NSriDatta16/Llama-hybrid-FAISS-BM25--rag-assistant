Take a look at this ticket and this guide maybe it will help you. PS: If your key is password protected you need to have ssh agent (pageant in your case) running with key loaded, otherwise your ssh client wouldn't be able to use your key. The fact that you have a password prompt just means that key-based authentication failed and server accepts password authentication. PPS: Looking at this and this questions, are you really sure you have same plink used everywhere? I'm not sure all of them would necessarily share configuration, e.g. plink (that comes with putty) and tortoise plink.
