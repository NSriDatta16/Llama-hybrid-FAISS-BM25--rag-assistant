I think the problem is more at a design level, can you elaborate a bit on what classes do you have ? I work on CUDA too, and usually one creates an interface (aka Facade pattern) for using the architecture specific (CUDA) layer. Edit : After reading the update interface I think you are doing the right thing. Keep the Encoder logic inside the class and use plain boost::threads to execute different units of work. Just pay attention on thread safety inside Encoder's methods.
