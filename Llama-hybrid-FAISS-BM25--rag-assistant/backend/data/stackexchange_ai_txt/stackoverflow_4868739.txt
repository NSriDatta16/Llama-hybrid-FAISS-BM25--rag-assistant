Usually you want some LaTeX processing done on the text, say you have \newcommand*{\SO}{StackOverflow\index{StackOverflow}\xspace} ... I spend a lot of time on \SO, blah blah .... Just filtering out the text paragraph here will not give a text like the intended result when it contains any macros. Therefore trying to extract things directly from the *.tex file usually will leave much to be wanted from the result. It is typically therefore better to work on output from latex processing. I would recommend to convert latex to html and then from html to text. You will probably need some manual clean-up, but I think it should be relatively close.
