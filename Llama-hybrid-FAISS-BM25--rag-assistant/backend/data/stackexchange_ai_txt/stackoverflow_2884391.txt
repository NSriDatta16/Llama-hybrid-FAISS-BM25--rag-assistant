API to determine whether running on iPhone or iPad

Is there an API for checking at runtime whether you are running on an iPhone or an iPad? One way I can think of would be to use: [[UIDevice currentDevice] model]; And detect the existence of the string @"iPad" - which seems a bit fragile. In the 3.2 SDK, I see that UIDevice also has a property which is really what I'm looking for, but doesn't work for pre-3.2 (obviously): [[UIDevice currentDevice] userInterfaceIdiom]; Are there other ways than checking for the existence of @"iPad" for a universal app?
