The Bhattacharyya distance is a distance between distributions while, what you need to conduct ABC, is a distance between summary statistics (this is, vectors of numbers that summarise the information in the sample), unless your summary statistic is a functional approximation to the distribution, which I doubt. For this reason, people typically employ the Euclidean distance (more sophisticated and better distances have also been studied). Have a look at the following references for more details on the ingredients of ABC: https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/introduction-to-approximate-bayesian-computation-abc/ http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/C.Archambeau/AIS/Talks/rwilkinson_ais08.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TGkrkK6pq4
