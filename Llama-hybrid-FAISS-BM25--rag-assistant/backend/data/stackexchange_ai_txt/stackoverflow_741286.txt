If it's a wizard you probably actually should use separate web pages rather than having a single page that's updated through ajax calls, that way the forward and back buttons can work as nature intended in the browser for moving forward and back through the wizard. Of course you can use fragment tricks to get forward / back working in a single page but in my experience this is tricky.
