Another option is to reuse the minority class: suppose your entire dataset has 10000 rows and you have 200 positive samples (exact 50:1 proportion). What you can do (I'm not claiming this is a 'good' solution): Create two datasets: P with all "1" examples and N with all "0" examples. Shuffle the N dataset. Fit 50 different models like this: model_1 uses all of P and samples 1 to 200 of N. model_2 uses all of P and samples 201 to 400 of N. ... model_50 uses all of P and samples 9801 to 10000 of N. When applying this model just take the average of these 50 models. This may or may not work, depending on your data. To validate you could set aside some of the data and apply the same idea.
