Running batch file remotely using Hudson

What is the simplest way to schedule a batch file to run on a remote machine using Hudson (latest and greatest version)? I was exploring the master slave setup. I created a dumb slave but I am not sure what the parameters should be so that I can trigger the batch file in the remote slave machine. Basically, I am trying to run 2 different batch files on two different remote machines sequentially, triggered from my machine (the master). The Step by step guide on the Hudson website is a dead link. There are similar questions posted on SO but it does not quite work for me when I use the parameters they mention. If anyone has done something similar please suggest ways to make this work. (I know how to set up jobs, and add a step to run a batch file etc what I am having trouble configuring is doing this on a remote machine using hudson in built features) UPDATE Thank you all for the suggestions. Quick update on this: What I wanted to get done is partially working, below are the steps followed to get to it - Created new Node from Manage Nodes -> New Node -> set # of Executors as 1, Remote FS root set as '/var/hudson', set Launch method as using JNLP, set slavename and saved. Once slave was set up (from master machine), I logged into the Slave physical machine, I downloaded the _slave.jar from http://masterserver:port/jnlpJars/slave.jar , and ran the following from command line at the download location -> java -jar _slave.jar -jnlpUrl http://masterserver:port/computer/slavename/slave-agent.jnlp . The connection was made successfully. Checked 'Restrict where this project can be run' in the Master job configuration, and set paramater as slavename. Checked "Add Build Step" for adding my batch job script What I am still missing now is a way to connect to 2 slaves from one job in sequence, is that possible?
