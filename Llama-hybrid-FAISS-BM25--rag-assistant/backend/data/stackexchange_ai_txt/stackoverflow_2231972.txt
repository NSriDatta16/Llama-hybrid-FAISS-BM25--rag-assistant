How is Gant able to reference targets by their names, and not get a missing property exception?

In the code presented here: Gant file , there is the following code: target(dist: 'Create release artefacts') { depends(test) depends(jar) } target(run: 'Run the distributed jar') { depends(dist) Ant.java(jar: distributedJarPath, fork: 'true') } target(hello: 'Hello World') { println("Hello World") } setDefaultTarget(dist) I'm interested in how it's able to write setDefaultTarget(dist) , and not receive an exception about dist as a missing property. Is this snippet evaluated in the context of some object, and the targets create instance variables?
