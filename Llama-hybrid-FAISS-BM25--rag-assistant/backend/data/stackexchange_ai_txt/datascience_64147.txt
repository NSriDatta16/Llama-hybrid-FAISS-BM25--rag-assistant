Predict_proba() probabilities distribution

I’m trying to calculate probability of class 1. I’m using gradients boosting (catboost classifier) Is it normal to have an equal rate of positive classes in every predict_proba() bucket? e.g.: [Probability] : Positive rate [0 - 0.25] : 17% [0.26 - 0.50] : 17% [0.51 - 0.75] : 17% [0.76 - 1] : 17% However when I 'm using logistic regression and convert WOE to the scores, the distribution of class 1 rate decreases with increasing score. e.g.: [Score] : Positive rate [100-150] : 17% [151-200] : 15% [200 - 250] : 13% [250-300] : 10%
