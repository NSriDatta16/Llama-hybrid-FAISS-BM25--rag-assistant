How to reduce variables in logistic regression?

I am running a logistic regression to predict Yes/No. I have more than 200 independent variables. I have tried to input all the variables, the result is terrible. It is obvious that one variable will effect to the other variable. 1. Is there any way to reduce the variables? 2. How do I know which variables are important and which are not important? 3. I know there is a way called stepwise. But it seems doesn't work for me. Thank you
