interface builder breaks on dual display

I frequently connect and disconnect my laptop from a secondary display. Additionally I work in a small group that uses svn to manage xib files. It seems that if you drag a UIView display into a secondary display in interface builder and save the xib then either disconnect that display or open it on a computer with a secondary display in a different postion (left v right of the screen for example) then the view can't be seen/closed/moved. I've found no work around other than attaching a secondary display in the same position. This can be a real pain. Has anyone found a solution to this? thanks.
