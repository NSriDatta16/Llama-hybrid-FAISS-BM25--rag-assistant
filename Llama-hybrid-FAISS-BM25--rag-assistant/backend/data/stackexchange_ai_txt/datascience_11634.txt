I would suggest try doc2vec instead of word2vec. doc2vec not only gives you word embeddings as given by word2vec but it also gives you document embeddings. Using the document embeddings you can also do operations like "which patients have similar notes". Needless to say, with doc2vec you can feed one document at a time.
