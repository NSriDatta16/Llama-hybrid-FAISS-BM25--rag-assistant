I share other users' confusion as to what the heart of your question is. But you reference an 'intelligent agent' you'd like to build, so I gather that your ultimate goal is to suggest products a user is likely to prefer. Systems that perform this task are called recommender systems . Collaborative filtering is a common approach to this problem. Taking your example, say you wanted to predict whether or not I would like a certain shirt. As you get at in your comment, designing an experiment to measure my likes and dislikes could be rather impractical. Very simplified, a collaborative filter would attempt to find one of: users like myself, and suggest their items items similar to ones I like, based on other users' histories As for the approachable literature mentioned in your comment, an oft-cited and wonderful resource is Andrew Ng's open course on machine learning. This video begins the series on recommender systems and collaborative filtering.
