How to provide a newsfeed for another site?

I'd like to implement a newsfeed, that can be plugged into some web-site: my site/service gets a request from another site with that site's ID (or login/password) and return a newsfeed (html-fragment). The newsfeed is then visible on that site. The tricky part is that after clicking on the news title the news content must be displayed on the site (no redirects anywhere). What is the best way to implement such type of service?
