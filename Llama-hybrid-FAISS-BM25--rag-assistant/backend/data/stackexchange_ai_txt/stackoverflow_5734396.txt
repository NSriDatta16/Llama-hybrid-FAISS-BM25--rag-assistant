There is no developer toolbar for Safari iPad, but you could definitely use something like firebug lite to do most of what you want! Just add the bookmarklet to your bookmarks, and then load it while you're looking at your page. Your other option is Weinre , a remote debugger and part of the PhoneGap project. Essentially, it lets you run an interface similar to the Chrome document inspector on your desktop machine, that manipulates the document on your iPad or iPhone. The commenter below brought my attention to this awesome tool a year ago, but since then the project's URL has changed so I'm adding it here. FirebugLite does have some issues with rendering speed and dealing with JavaScript, and it additionally doesn't scale its fonts very well. For these reasons, Weinre is definitely a more powerful tool - but also harder to start using.
