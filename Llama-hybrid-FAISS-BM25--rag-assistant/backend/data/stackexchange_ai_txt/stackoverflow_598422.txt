An interesting aside: the term magic is linked to formal programming languages, which are one of the theoretical foundations of computer science. In Morgan's book "Programming from Specifications", we have this definition of magic: w:[true, false] This notation is of the form: w:[P, Q] and represents a program that, when executed in a state where P is true, will terminate in a state where Q is true, whilst changing only the variables in w . In this context, then, "magic", is an infeasable program that can take a program from any state (since true is always true ) into one that is impossible (since false can never be true ). A much easier program is : w:[true, true] which is the program that always terminates, but guarantees no particular result. This can be implemented with a simple skip . Obviously, this technical definition has been abused when people talk of magic programs, since this ought to mean a program that is provably infeasible. Nevertheless, the term remains colloquially, since it's nice to imagine that something magical happens behind the scenes when we don't know, or understand how something works.
