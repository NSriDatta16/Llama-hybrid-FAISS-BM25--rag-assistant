most efficient javascript method declaration

While writing javascript, one can define a method in 3 different ways. 1] A function in global namespace function doSomething(); 2] A function that is member of a function function Clazz() {} Clazz.doSomething = function(){}; 3] A function that is memeber of the instance of function function Clazz() {} Clazz.prototype.doSomething = function(){}; Depending upon the code organization, one can choose one of the above methods over others. But purely from performance standpoint which is the most efficient one? (especially between 1 and 2) Will your answer be different if doSomething has arguments?
