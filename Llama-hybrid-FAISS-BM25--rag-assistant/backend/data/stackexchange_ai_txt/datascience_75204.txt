There is very difficult to train incremental training for up coming new classes. Once u have fixed featureset and class label for one iteration than u will have to either build new model. U can not not retrain model with different features on same model having different class label. Machine learning model is not supporting training with feature expansion. What u can do is u can train Ensemble training as described follow: U can train an individual model for each class that means if u have an n class than u will have n model. it would be easy for u if u have found new class in dataset. Now question u will have is that how can i validate is so for that u will have get voted for all the model and it's matric. But for that u will have each train model for 2 label like "contains class" or "not contains this class". That's how u can perform Ensemble training. U can validate model by collecting votes from each model. Here i assumed that class label is not defined prior but it come iterativly from data. U might look at this link . Hope this explanation will help. If u have something new idea than u can paste it here. Thank you.
