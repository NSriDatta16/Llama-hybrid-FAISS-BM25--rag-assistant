Application performance management for PHP application

I am looking for an application performance management for PHP (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management ) This tool could be plugged to any PHP application in production, and can collect/display statistic about PHP execution time, network time, db query time for each request. For each indicator, I would like to see the min, max and average value. All these statistics would be available in real time and also for the past. Is there any existing tool which can do that? Suggestion for any tools (free or not) are welcome.
