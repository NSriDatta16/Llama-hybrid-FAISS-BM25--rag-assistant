The only language I can think of that looks like Python today is Ruby, but Ruby was actually influenced by Python. It doesn't really look like anything you've ever used in .NET unless you used IronPython or IronRuby. Don't let that discourage you, Python is very simple to learn and most of the syntax (e.g. operators) won't confuse you.
