R: Random Forest throwing NaN/Inf in "foreign function call" error despite no NaN's in dataset

I'm using caret to run a cross validated random forest over a dataset. The Y variable is a factor. There are no NaN's, Inf's, or NA's in my dataset. However when running the random forest, I get Error in randomForest.default(m, y, ...) : NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 1) In addition: There were 28 warnings (use warnings() to see them) Warning messages: 1: In data.matrix(x) : NAs introduced by coercion 2: In data.matrix(x) : NAs introduced by coercion 3: In data.matrix(x) : NAs introduced by coercion 4: In data.matrix(x) : NAs introduced by coercion Does anyone have ideas as to if this error is caused by the NA's introduced by coercion? If so, how can i prevent such coercion?
