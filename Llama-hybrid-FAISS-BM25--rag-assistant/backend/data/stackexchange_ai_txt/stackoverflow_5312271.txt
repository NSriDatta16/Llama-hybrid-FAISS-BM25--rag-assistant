Suggestions of IDEs for Rich Internet Applications that will run in the browser (Windows, Mac, iOS)?

I'm looking for an IDE for developing Web apps. My idea criteria are: -A programming-like interface (from what I've seen a lot of FLASH IDE's are designed more for animation (although I hear that's better with Flex 4). Intelisense Step-by-step debugging - I have been told that this is a challenge for web apps. Easy to use and learn IDE Visual Development environment (arrange controls on the screen with drag'n drop) Completed app can run on any HTML5 compliant browser with Javascript(i.e., on the iPad, iPhone, Droid, Windows, Mac). So an IDE that supports the above and outputs Javascript +HTML +CSS would be fine. My needs are pretty minimal: -playing audio - Easily modify the UI : e.g, changing the pointer icon (so if they hover over a picture they can change by selecting another picture from a file, it might change to a folder icon). -A very responsive UI (not having to submit a query to the server every-time they click). E.g., we do things like having a message "Select a lesson to begin". When they select a lesson the message changes to "Click the Start button to begin". I'm considering: Real Software (formerly Real Basic). Unity (impressive for games, but maybe overkill for my needs) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28game_engine%29 RunRev (formerly Runtime Revolution) I'd love to hear pluses and minuses of the above platforms as well as any other suggestions. Please post your responses in the Answer for the particular solution (.e.,g all responses for RealSoftware as edits/comments in the Real Software answer).
