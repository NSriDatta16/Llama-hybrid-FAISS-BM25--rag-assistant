You can try, but you're not going to have much grunt left to do other stuff. Prior to Flash 10, I wrote an article detailing a hack to feed PCM data into sound output in Flash . Someone got in touch because they had written an AS3 Ogg decoder, but... even after fully optimzing the code, it was found that AVM2 is really not that much up to the job. Basically, it's rather slow and decoding OGG is quite processor intensive. I can't see that things will have changed that much in the years since, because CPUs have become "wider" and not really that much faster. ActionScript is single threaded, so you can't offload to another core. Probably worth checking out this ... maybe performance has improved. EDIT: Having said all that, as Juan has said, don't be discouraged by this answer. I suspect the computational demands of FLAC decoding are probably considerably less than OGG, and if DSP gets you excited, taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100% worth it, even if the Flash route (possibly) leads to disappointment. Personally I think that the MediaStreamSource for Silverlight looks really promising,but haven't really dabbled that much.
