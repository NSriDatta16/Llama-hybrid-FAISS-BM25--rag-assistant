ARIMA estimate validation through arima.sim

This is out of my curiosity trying to compare time series input to an ARMA model and reconstructed series after an ARMA estimate is obtained. These are the steps I am thinking: Construct simulation time series arma.sim estimate the model from arma.sim, assuming we know it is a (1,0,1) model arma.est1 also say we get arma.est1 in this form, which is close to the original (0.9,0,0.2): Coefficients: ar1 ma1 intercept 0.9115 0.0104 -0.4486 s.e. 0.0456 0.1270 1.1396 sigma^2 estimated as 1.15: log likelihood = -149.79, aic = 307.57 If I try to reconstruct another time series from arma.est1 , how do I incorporate intercept or s.e. in arima.sim ? Something like this doesn't seem to work well because arma.sim and arma.rec are far off: arma.rec Normally we use predict() to check the estimate. But is this a legit way to look at the estimate?
