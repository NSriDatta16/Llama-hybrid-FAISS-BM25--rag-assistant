How can I fit cubic spline method for time series data?

I have a longitudinal data record for each unique ID (total of 11,000). I want to smooth Wt. using time (total of 335 unique time point) as a smoothing variable for each unique ID ($1). The data looks like this ID Wt. Time 10 450 1 10 460 2 10 486 3 10 490 5 100 459 1 100 500 2 100 540 4 100 500 5 100 490 6 101 370 1 101 380 2 101 390 3 101 400 4 101 375 5 I have tried the following code in R but it gives me an error message > model fit Could you give me some suggestions?
