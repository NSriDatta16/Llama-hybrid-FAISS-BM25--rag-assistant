The problem appears to be in the child script, since the parent script in your question runs on my box (Debian Squeeze, Ruby 1.8.7 patchlevel 249): I created the dummy child script bar.rb: #!/usr/bin/ruby1.8 s = $stdin.read $stderr.puts s print s I then ran your script, passing it the path to the dummy script: $ /tmp/foo.rb /tmp/bar.rb The I hit it with wget: $ wget localhost:8080/index And saw the dummy script's output: GET /index HTTP/1.0^M User-Agent: Wget/1.12 (linux-gnu)^M Accept: */*^M Host: localhost:8080^M Connection: Keep-Alive^M ^M I also saw that wget received what it sent: $ cat index GET /index HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: Wget/1.12 (linux-gnu) Accept: */* Host: localhost:8080 Connection: Keep-Alive It worked the same no matter how many times I hit it with wget.
