What are the differences between Bayesian filters and adaptive filters?

I am learning about state estimation and I am having difficulty understanding the difference between Bayesian filters such as Kalman filter and particle filters compared to adaptive filters. According to this tutorial , adaptive filters are stochastic approximators such as LMS and RLS and they assume that state varies very slowly with unknown dynamics. Could you please explain the main differences between these state estimation categories?
