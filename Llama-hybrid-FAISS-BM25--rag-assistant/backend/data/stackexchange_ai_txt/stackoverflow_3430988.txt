HTML delayed indent

I want to make some html output look like this... Tag1 blah blah blah asdfge kedkled pijj ;dopkd uiedeidiud edioejd Tagbigger more blah blah blah wdeodeodd epkdepdpd more of the same... I imagine the html itself might look something like Tag1 blah blah blah asdfge kedkled pijj ;dopkd uiedeidiud edioejd Tagbigger more blah blah blah wdeodeodd epkdepdpd more of the same... except I don't want the blank line between paragraphs. Is there some standard type setting name for this? Better yet, can somebody point me at a style sheet?
