How to calculate concordant percentage in a validation data

I've created a logistic regression model in R using the glm function using a bank data and. I am able to get the AIC value, coefficients, percentage concordant, tied and discordant pairs in test and training data. But I have a validation data set where the status of the customer(good or bad) is not there as I have to check the performance of the model using this validation data. What should be my approach?
