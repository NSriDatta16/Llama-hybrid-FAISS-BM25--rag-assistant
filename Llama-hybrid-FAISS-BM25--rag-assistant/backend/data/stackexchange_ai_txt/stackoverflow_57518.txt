Is it possible for SelectNodes on an XmlDocument to return null?

Is it possible for SelectNodes() called on an XmlDocument to return null? My predicament is that I am trying to reach 100% unit test code coverage; ReSharper tells me that I need to guard against a null return from the SelectNodes() method, but I can see no way that an XmlDocument can return null (and therefore, no way to test my guard clause and reach 100% unit test coverage!)
