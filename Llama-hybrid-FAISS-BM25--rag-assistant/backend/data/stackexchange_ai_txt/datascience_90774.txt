The problem was with the pandas version. I've used Python3.6 as interpreter and pycharm would only let me install version 0.25 pandas. Now I am on Python3.8 and pandas 1.2.3 and the minimum code example provided by @Oxbowerce works now. I'll be more careful with checking the dependencies in future. The sketch goes into the epochs now, there was just a minor labelling error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:/Users/bobin/PycharmProjects/Mussel/cnn_musseltest.py", line 348, in plt.plot(history.history['acc'], "g--", label="Accuracy of training data") KeyError: 'acc' Renaming 'acc' to 'accuracy' and val_acc to val_accuracy helped, as stated in the warning log. WARNING:tensorflow:Early stopping conditioned on metric `acc` which is not available. Available metrics are: loss,accuracy,val_loss,val_accuracy
