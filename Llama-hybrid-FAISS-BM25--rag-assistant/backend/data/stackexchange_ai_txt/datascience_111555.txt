Macro average represents the arithmetic mean between the f1_scores of the two categories, such that both scores have the same importance: Macro avg = (f1_0 + f1_1) / 2 Micro average takes into account how many samples there are per category (the greater the support, the more important that category's f1_score): Micro avg = (f1_0 x support_0 + f1_1 x support_1) / (support_0 + support_1) The category with less support usually tends to have lower scores because it can be hard to catch rarer categories. If the support for your 1 class was very low (say 10) the f1_score could have been very low (say 0.1). In this case the macro avg would give you a very low value, whereas the micro avg would have given much more importance to the score in the 0 class because of the greater support. Once you know the implications, it is up to you to decide what you prefer to use.
