How can I tell which application a CGEventRef is coming from?

I've successfully got a demo app intercepting keyboard events. Here's the handler for them. CGEventRef keyUpCallback (CGEventTapProxy proxy, CGEventType type, CGEventRef event, void *refcon) { NSLog(@"KeyUp event tapped!"); return; } I want to do different things depending on which application sent the event. How can I tell which application it is?
