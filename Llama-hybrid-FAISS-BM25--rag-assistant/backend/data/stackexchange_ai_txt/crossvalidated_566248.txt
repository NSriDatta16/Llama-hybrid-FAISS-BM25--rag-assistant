Controlling for time elapsed between baseline and treatment

I'm having a mixed model with 5 repeated measurements (time is categorical because the timepoints represent discrete events). Edit: I have 5 meaningful timepoints: t0 baseline (neutral timepoint); t1 invitation to intervention; t2 shortly before intervention; t3 shortly after intervention; t4 participants receive the result (good or bad news). I also have 2 treatment groups (randomized trial).The outcome variable is self-reported quality of life (e.g. mental health measured by questionnaire). My plan is to first build a mixed model to test for the significance of the interaction between treatment and time, and then look at specific contrasts (e.g. difference in change in QoL between groups at t0 vs t1 ) While the measurement points are equally spaced between the last 4 measurement points for both groups, the average time elapsed between baseline ( t0 ) and the intervention appointment (and thus also t1, t2, t3, t4 ) differs considerably between the two treatment groups (around 43 days), see image below for illustration. The reason for this difference is not random sampling error, but a a logistical one, i.e. it was easier to plan in the treatment appointment for treatment group 1 than treatment group 2, as less technologically advanced equipment was used. I do think that this time difference could impact the outcome variable (e.g. the longer the time elapsed, the more likely it is that a significant event has happened that impacts quality of life). Therefore I would like to control for it, for example when comparing the change in QoL between the two treatment groups for t0 vs. t1 . Does it make sense to use the time between baseline and intervention as a covariate in the model? So, for example the R code for the model would be: lmerFitQoL where timedifference= difference in time between baseline and treatment appointment Would that be a suitable solution in your opinion? I'm unsure if I'm on the right path here or if there is a better way.
