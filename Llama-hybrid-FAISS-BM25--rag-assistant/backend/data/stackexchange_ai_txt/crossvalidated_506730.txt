Is data-driven modelling and machine learning the same thing?

I read a lot of publications about data-driven modeling and machine learning. Most of them use the term interchangeably. So, is data-driven modelling and machine learning actually the same thing? If not, what are examples of data-driven models which are not considered machine learning? Or, what are examples of machine learning models which are not data-driven? Thanks!
