Thanks Galen. You actually pointed me in the right direction. I realized that my form wanted to save the state of the organization, but I over-wrote it when I did this: echo $form->input('organization_id', array('selected' => $this->passedArgs)); So what I do now instead is: if (!empty($this->passedArgs)) { echo $form->input('organization_id', array('selected' => $this->passedArgs)); } else { echo $form->input('organization_id'); } And it does the trick.
