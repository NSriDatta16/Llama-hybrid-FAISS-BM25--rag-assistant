@Merlyn Morgan-Graham We faced a similar problem. Where we built the .Net application with "Any CPU" build and tried using with 32 bit C++ Dll. When we run the .Net Application in 64 bit OS. It runs as 64 bit executable and hence and got similar issue. After buidling in X86 Loading, Calls to C++ Dlls worked absolutely fine. One more important thing is if you are using C++ DLL in your .Net code. There would be fair amount of marshalling, so it is important to stick to the build type (i.e. X86, any CPU or X64). Please check the following link also: Windows Vista: Unable to load DLL 'x.dll': Invalid access to memory location. (DllNotFoundException)
