You should use the same metric to evaluate and to tune the classifiers. If you wull evaluate the final classifier using accuracy, then you must use accuracy to tune the hyper parameters. If you think you should use macro-averaged F1 as the final evaluation of the classifier, use it also to tune them. On a side, for multiclass problems I have not yet heard any convincing argument not to use accuracy, but that is just me.
