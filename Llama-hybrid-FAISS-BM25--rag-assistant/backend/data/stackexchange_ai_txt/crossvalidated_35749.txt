There is a little restoring force around the mean in a hypergeometric distribution. If your first few balls have been black more than average, then the probability that the next ball is white is a little higher than if the first few balls had been white more than average. This restoring force differs when you sample $100$ balls from $2000$ versus $50$ from $1000$ twice. As an extreme, you could sample $1$ from $20$ $100$ times, and then there would be no restoring force. One measure of the spread of a distribution is the variance. The variance when you draw n balls out of w+b is $$ \frac{n (w+b-n) w b }{(w+b)^2(w+b-1)}.$$ For $n=100, w=100, b=1900,$ the variance is $\frac{9025}{1999} = 4.51476.$ For $n=50, w=50, b=950,$ the variance is $\frac{9025}{3996}$. When you do this twice independently and add the results, you get twice the variance, $\frac{9025}{1998} = 4.51702.$ For $n=1, w=1, b=19,$ the variance is $\frac{19}{400}.$ If you do this $100$ times independently and add the results, you get $100$ times the variance, $\frac{19}{4} = \frac{9025}{1900} = 4.75.$ The difference between $\frac{9025}{1999}$ and $\frac{9025}{1998}$ is not very large, and you won't easily tell the difference by eye-balling results. There is a larger difference if you look at the exact probabilities of events far from the mean. $0$ is not very far from the mean ($5$), so the probabilities are not much different. The probability that you get $0$ white out of $100$ when everything is put together is $0.0051735.$ The probability that you get $0$ white out of $50$ twice is $0.0051707.$ The probability that you get $0$ out of $1$ $100$ times is $0.00592053.$ $40$ is farther from the mean, and there is a larger proportional difference between the probabilities. The chance that you get $40$ out of $100$ is $3.12262 \times 10^{-29}.$ The chance to get a total of $40$ when you take $50$ from each half is $3.35434 \times 10^{-29},$ about $7\%$ larger. The chance to get $40$ if you draw $1$ ball out of each group of $20$ is $5.75970 \times 10^{-26} = 5759.70 \times 10^{-29},$ almost $2000$ times as large. Even that far from the mean, you don't see a large difference between drawing $100$ out of $2000$ and drawing $50$ from $1000$ twice, but there is a larger difference with drawing $1$ out of $20$ $100$ times.
