What is the best way to make a graph in WPF? (or in general that would apply to WPF as well)

So I am making a piece of software in WPF, and I want to be able to make graphs out of the data I am storing. Just line graphs with x and y axises. Ideally I would want them to have a nice elegant simplicity to them. I know WPF doesn't come with graphs, and I have tried ZedGraph in a WinForms project, but I thought frankly it looked ugly. What is the best way to make simple, elegant graphs in WPF?
