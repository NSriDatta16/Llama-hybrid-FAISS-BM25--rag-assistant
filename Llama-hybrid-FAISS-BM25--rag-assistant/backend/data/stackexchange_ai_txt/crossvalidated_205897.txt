How to compute estimate for the first time series value using ARIMA model?

I modeled a univariate time series in R using the Arima command. One can obtain fitted values for the original series using this command by applying the function fitted to the model. However, I noticed that the fitted data has the same dimension as the original data. Hence, a fitted value for the first value in the time series was computed even though there is no past data. I checked wheter it is the mean of the series or the intercept of the model but that isn't the solution. What are possible approaches to get a fitted value here? The code below is a reproducible example using the Lynx data set. > library(xts) > library(forecast) > > data("lynx") > > Y model fit length(fit) == length(Y) [1] TRUE
