This is a very broad question. I suggesting reading up on the MVC pattern. If you want to do this in PHP, I believe CakePHP provides a good way to do MVC in PHP. There is also a shopping-cart solution that is already written in PHP called Magento . It is open source so you can take a look under the hood to see how they do things. For Ruby there is Ruby on Rails , and the Groovy language has Grails . Java has a whole host of frameworks (Spring and JSF come to mind).
