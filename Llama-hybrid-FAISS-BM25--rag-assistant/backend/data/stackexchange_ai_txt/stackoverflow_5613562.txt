Try this: public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { mosX = e.getX(); mosY = e.getY(); repaint(); } The problem was that you were not updating your coordinates for the mouseDragged event. Also instead of calling paint() directly, you should call repaint() . Calling repaint() will ensure your paint() is called automatically. EDIT: To paint on Canvas object, override paint() of the Canvas object. myCanvas = new Canvas() { public void paint(Graphics g) { g.setColor(Color.green); g.fillOval(mosX, mosY, 30, 30); } }; Now your mouseDragged method becomes : public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { mosX = e.getX(); mosY = e.getY(); myCanvas.repaint(); }
