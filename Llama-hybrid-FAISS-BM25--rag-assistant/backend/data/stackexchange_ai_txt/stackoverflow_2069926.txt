Real time data storage and access with .net

Does anyone have any experience with receiving and updating a large volume of data, storing it, sorting it, and visualizing it very quickly? Preferably, I'm looking for a .NET solution, but that may not be practical. Now for the details... I will receive roughly 1000 updates per second, some updates, some new rows of data records. But, it can also be very burst driven, with sometimes 5000 updates and new rows. By the end of the day, I could have 4 to 5 million rows of data. I have to both store them and also show the user updates in the UI. The UI allows the user to apply a number of filters to the data to just show what they want. I need to update all the records plus show the user these updates. I have an visual update rate of 1 fps. Anyone have any guidance or direction on this problem? I can't imagine I'm the first one to have to deal with something like this... At first though, some sort of in memory database I would think, but will it be fast enough for querying for updates near the end of the day once I get a large enough data set? Or is that all dependent on smart indexing and queries? Thanks in advance.
