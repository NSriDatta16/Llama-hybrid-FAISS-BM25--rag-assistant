Track embedded charts via Google Analytics

I've got a site which produces charts such as the one below I'd like to encourage visitors to embed the generated graphic on their own sites and blogs. Is it possible to include views for that chart in google Analytics? I want to be able to see when a site embeds the image so that it's tracked in the analytics reports. I'd envision some API that I can call from the server-side method which generates the PNG, but haven't been able to find anything specific. Thanks!
