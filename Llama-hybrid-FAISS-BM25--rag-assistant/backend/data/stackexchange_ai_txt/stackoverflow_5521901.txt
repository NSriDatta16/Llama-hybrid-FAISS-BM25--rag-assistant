There were couple of issues with this. 1) notice. private EntitySet _cityLocalities; This should have been. private EntitySet _cityLocalities = new EntitySet (); 2) [Association(Storage = "_CityLocality", this should have been. [Association(Storage = "_cityLocalities", 3) Checked the DB Schema and found that had the columns as nullable just in case i changed them from nullable to not nullable. and things worked fine. Kind Regards Vinay.
