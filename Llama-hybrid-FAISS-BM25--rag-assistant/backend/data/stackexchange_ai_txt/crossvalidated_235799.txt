This is a very general question, so I will give a very general answer. Typically in computer vision the prior is based on characteristics of natural images that tend to be seen in practice. This is commonly referred to as a "natural image prior" . One example would be coherence, i.e. neighboring pixels tend to be similar (e.g. this is why feature detectors/descriptors like SIFT look for things like corners, which are "interest points" because the smoothness prior is violated). In the simplest case, which is common in practice, the Bayesian approach might use MAP estimation . This combines the data likelihood given the parameters with the a-priori likelihood of the parameters. In general the prior is interpreted as prior information about the un-observed parameters , rather than the data , which is observed. Note: I mainly learned about these things from the Szeliski E-book (free online), which I highly recommend if you are interested in more details.
