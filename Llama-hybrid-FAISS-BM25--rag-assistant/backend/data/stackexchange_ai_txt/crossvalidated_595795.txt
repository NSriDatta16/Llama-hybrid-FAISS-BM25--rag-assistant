How to cluster diverse elements while respecting the original sorting sequence?

Suppose I have a column with a limited number of discrete values that belong to the range between 1 and 10, e.g. 5 5 3 6 5 2 4 4 5 2 6 I would like to sort those values in a way where I give priority to the chronological order new values appear (e.g. starting with a 5 , then 3 , then, 6 etc) but grouping similar elements together. So, for instance, from the example above I get: 5 5 5 5 3 6 6 2 2 4 4 In this reorganization, I respected the original chronological structure of elements, giving priority to the first one appearing, but grouping them by similarity. Is there an algorithm in statistics or data science that would allow me to do that? Some kind of a combination between k-means clustering and array sorting for instance?
