No, that's not possible - at least not that way. But if you have general-purpose libraries, which are used across various applications, you should reorganize your project and workspace structure anyway... If you had for example two solutions, which partially include the same project(s), and then would map each of these solutions to an individual workspace, then it should work. HTH. Thomas
