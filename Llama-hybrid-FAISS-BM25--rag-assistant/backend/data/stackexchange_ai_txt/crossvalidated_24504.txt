Good tips in PeterR's answer; I don't have any further tips for the actual debugging, but I found a very useful proceedure for testing if your code could have a bug. It's described in this paper: http://pubs.amstat.org/doi/abs/10.1198/016214504000001132 Essentially the idea is to have two simulations: One being your MCMC for inferring (presumably) the parameters of your model. The second simulator simply samples parameters from the prior. They generate data from the parameters of both simulators, and calculate a test statistic comparing the joint distributions of parameters and data. If the MCMC code correctly samples parameters from the posterior, then the test statistic will have a distribution of N(0,1). Code for calculating the test statistic is available.
