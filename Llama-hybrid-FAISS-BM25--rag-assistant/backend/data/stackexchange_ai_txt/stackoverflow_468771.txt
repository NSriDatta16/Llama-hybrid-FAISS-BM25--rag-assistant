Tip for "searching" for a method in irb: "something".methods.select {|item| item =~ /query/ } Tip for trying out methods on a value for comparison: value = "something" [:upcase, :downcase, :capitalize].collect {|method| [method, value.send(method)] } Also, note that you won't get all the same information as Python's dir with object.methods. You have to use a combination of object.methods and class.constants, also class.singleton_methods to get the class methods.
