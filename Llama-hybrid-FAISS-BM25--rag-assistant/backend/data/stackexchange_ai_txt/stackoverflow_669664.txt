As for the errors: you need to link against ws2_32.lib library. You can do this in two ways: Add it in Project properties -> Linker -> Input -> "additional libraries" (don't forget to do this for both Debug and Release configurations). In your header add this compiler directive: #pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib") I prefer the second method because the changes you make are visible in the source instead of being hidden deep in project options. As for APIENTRY and similar defines - it's merely a convenience like returning NULL instead of 0 to point out that you're returning nothing instead of a number zero. Makes code easier to read and understand.
