Organize your work flow in the following way and it'll reduce a lot of time wasting. Make sure you declare a doc-type . Use one of the reset methods others have mentioned here. Work on your structure Avoid using width and padding on the same element where you can. Always think of reducing unneeded HTML and css rather than adding all the time. Try not to use margin left and right when floating elements. If you stick to those items, a lot of the most common issues will not appear. PS One item I forgot to mention was make use of the validators over at W3.
