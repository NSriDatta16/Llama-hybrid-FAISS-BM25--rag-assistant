Interpreting multinomial logistic regression output in R

I am trying to perform multinomial logistic regression on my data which is as below(just the header). "category" is my target variable and all other variables are independent variables. category has values like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. My main motive is to predict category from independent variables. Here is summary of my data set. I used following command to perform multinomial logistic regression: > mod=multinom(category~hlen+iplen+ipttl+iptype+tcpsport+tcpdport+tcpsec+tcpack+tcpwindow+tcpchksum+date_time, data=train) I got the following output but i don't know how to interpret it? What should be the starting point or is there other way to do so? (For example I know how to interpret linear and logistic regression output to create regression equations) Please right click any image and select view to see it clearly. Thank you,
