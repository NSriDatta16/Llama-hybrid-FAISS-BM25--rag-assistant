When can the collapsed Gibbs sampler be implemented?

I understand Gibbs sampling is a means of statistics inference, and it seems that sometimes certain variables can be integrated out in the sampling process, known as collapsed Gibbs sampling. I really want to know in what circumstances the collapsed Gibbs sampling can be applied, and which variables can be integrated out? I did some search on Google, and it appears there are no detailed explanation on it. Though there are some papers on applying collapsed Gibbs sampling on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), I am no expert of MCMC and have no idea what LDA is, so it may be hard for me to read those papers. Can someone answer this question and it would be better, provide some examples? Much appreciated!
