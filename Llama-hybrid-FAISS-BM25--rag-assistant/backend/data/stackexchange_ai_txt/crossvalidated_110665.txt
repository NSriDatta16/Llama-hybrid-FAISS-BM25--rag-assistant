There are actually a number of packages in R for fitting mixed effects models beyond lme4 and nlme . There's a nice wiki run by the R special interest group for mixed models, which has a very nice FAQ and a page comparing the different packages . As for my opinions on actually using lme4 and nlme : I found lme4 to be generally easier to use due to its rather direct extension of the basic R formula syntax. (If you need to work with generalized additive models, then the gamm4 package extends this syntax one further step and so you have a nice smooth learning curve.) As others have mentioned, lme4 can handle generalized models (other link functions and error distributions), while nlme 's focus on the Gaussian link function allows it do so some things that are very hard in the general case (specifying covariance structure and certain things dependent on degrees of freedom calculation, like p-values, the latter of which I encourage you to move away from!).
