You want to cast data.first to an int32 before you do the shift, otherwise the shift will overflow the storage before it gets a chance to be automatically promoted when it is assigned to combined data. Try: const utils::int32 combineddata = (static_cast (data.first) This is of course assuming that data.first and data.second are types that are guaranteed to be precisely 16 bits long, otherwise you have bigger problems. I really don't understand your statement "if data.second gets too big, the | won't take account of the fact that they're both shorts." Edit: And Neil is absolutely right about signedness.
