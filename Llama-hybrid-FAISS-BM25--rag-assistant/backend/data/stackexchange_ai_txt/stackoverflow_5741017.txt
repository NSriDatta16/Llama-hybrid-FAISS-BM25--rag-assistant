From the SQLite web site: A database in SQLite is a single disk file. Furthermore, the file format is cross-platform. A database that is created on one machine can be copied and used on a different machine with a different architecture. SQLite databases are portable across 32-bit and 64-bit machines and between big-endian and little-endian architectures. So yes, when you've validated that the SQLite API is available everywhere you want to use it, that should be fine as a storage format. EDIT: And yes, SQLite does work on Windows Phone 7 , using this Codeplex project or this one .
