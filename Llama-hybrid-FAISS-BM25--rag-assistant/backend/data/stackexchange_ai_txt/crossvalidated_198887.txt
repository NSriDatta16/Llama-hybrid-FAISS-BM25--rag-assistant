Time series with a sequence of zeros

I am trying to model a time series that contains a sequence of zeros. I tried fitting an ARIMA model using auto.arima function from the forecast package in R but the MAPE is reported as infinity (probably due to division by zero). Moreover, the auto.arima fits an ARIMA(0,1,0) model over the data. Can you suggest any types of models that may be appropriate for such data?
