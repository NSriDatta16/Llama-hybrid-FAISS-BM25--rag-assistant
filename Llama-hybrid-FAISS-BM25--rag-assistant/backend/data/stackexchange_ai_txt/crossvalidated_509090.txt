Multilevel analyses do not assume that effects are fixed, they can be specified as fixed or random, but it is up to you to choose. I would regress $X$ on $Y$ and adding days as clusters. The nice thing about multilevel analysis is that it weights the effects of days. For example, consider two scenarios, you could either (a) pool your data per day (average by day), or (b) ignore day and put all data in a single regression. In (a) you lose the within day variation and in (b) you are mixing within and between day variation altogether. The multilevel analysis will weight between these two scenarios.
