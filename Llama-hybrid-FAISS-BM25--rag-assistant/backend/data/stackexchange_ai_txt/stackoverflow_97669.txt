You could easily write crop yourself in fjcore. Start with the code for Resizer http://web.archive.org/web/20140304090029/http://code.google.com:80/p/fjcore/source/browse/trunk/FJCore/Resize/ImageResizer.cs? and FilterNNResize -- you can see how the image data is stored -- it's just simple arrays of pixels. The important part is: for (int y = 0; y shows you that the data is stored in an array of color planes (1 element for 8bpp gray, 3 elements for color) and each element has a 2-D array of bytes (x, y) for the image. You just need to loop through the destination pixels, copying then from the appropriate place in the source. edit: don't forget to provide the patch to the author of fjcore
