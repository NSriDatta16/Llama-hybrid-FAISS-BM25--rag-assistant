You need to make it an IBOutlet . So in your viewController , or whatever you are loading from the nib , declare it like this: IBOUtlet UIImageView *myImageView; Also, in the actual nib , you must connect the File's Owner object to the UIImageView in your file by right-clicking File's owner and dragging the correct outlet name (in this case, myImageView ) onto the correct UIImageView instance in your nib . Now when you load one of the objects using the nib , myImageView will point to the initialized UIImageView , or whatever else you have.
