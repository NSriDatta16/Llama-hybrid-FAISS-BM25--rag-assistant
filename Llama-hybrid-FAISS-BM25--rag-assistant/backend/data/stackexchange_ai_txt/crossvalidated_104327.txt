I'm not sure there's much nice to say about it: I don't recognize the characteristic of $X + Y$, and can't find a way to manipulate it into the same generalized form. Taking the characteristic function of generalized normal random variable $X$ as given in (2.2) of Pogany and Nadarajah , noting a change in parameter names to match those used in the question: $\phi_X(t) = \frac{e^{it\mu}}{\Gamma(1 / b)}\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\Gamma(2m/b+1/b)}{\Gamma(2m+1)}(-1)^m(at)^{2m}$ (I've changed the formula slightly for ease of differentiation, and replaced a factor of 2 that the paper lost in the algebraic manipulation.) Then finding the characteristic of the sum as the product of their respective characteristic functions: $\phi_{X+Y}(t) = \frac{e^{it\mu_X}}{\Gamma(1 / b_X)}\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\Gamma(2m/b_X+1/b_X)}{\Gamma(2m+1)}(-1)^m(a_Xt)^{2m}\frac{e^{it\mu_Y}}{\Gamma(1 / b_Y)}\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\Gamma(2m/b_Y+1/b_Y)}{\Gamma(2m+1)}(-1)^m(a_Yt)^{2m}$ $=\frac{e^{it(\mu_X + \mu_Y)}}{\Gamma(1/b_X)\Gamma(1/b_Y)}\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\Gamma(2m/b_X+1/b_X)}{\Gamma(2m+1)}(-1)^m(a_Xt)^{2m}\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\Gamma(2m/b_Y+1/b_Y)}{\Gamma(2m+1)}(-1)^m(a_Yt)^{2m}$ We can use that to find the moments of $X+Y$, but as guy points out, that tells us nothing we don't already know from the independence of $X,Y$.
