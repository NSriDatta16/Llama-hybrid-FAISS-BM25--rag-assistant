Developing an Empirical Model for Non-Linear Data

I have collected Temp vs. Time data for a controlled environment. I performed three tests, with the thermocouple in the same location for all three tests. I now have three Temp. vs. Time curves for this location. The graphs are shown here: I am looking to generate an empirical model based on the Temp. vs. Time at this location that can predict the temperature at this location over time. How should I approach this? My initial approach was to identify the local minima and maxima, and average the three points together (for each maximum and minimum). And then correlate that average to a sequence of time, for example, 30C between 750 and 1250s, or something like that. I really don't think this is an efficient approach... What do you all think would be an efficient approach to this?
