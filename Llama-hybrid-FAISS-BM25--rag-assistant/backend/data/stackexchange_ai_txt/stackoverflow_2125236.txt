I was in your position, and split my attention between Scheme and Common Lisp. Looking back now I think that (for the purposes of learning Clojure, as opposed to personal development) I would've been better off focusing on Common Lisp, with Practical Common Lisp and PG's On Lisp . Now that there are actual books focusing on Clojure, you should definitely go with one of those. Joy of Clojure is a great book, and 4clojure.com is a good way to get some practice solving puzzles with Clojure.
