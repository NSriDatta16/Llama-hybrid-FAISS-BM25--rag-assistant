Getting the value from a Swing component from outside the EDT

My current code looks like this: final String[] value = new String[1]; SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(new Runnable() { public void run() { value[0] = textArea.getText(); } }); The use of a final array seems like a bit of a hack. Is there a more elegant solution? I've done a lot of searching, but I don't seem to be able to find anything to do this, which surprises me. Although I keep coming across SwingWorker , but I'm not sure that's suitable in this case? I'm assuming that JTextArea.getText() isn't thread-safe. Thanks.
