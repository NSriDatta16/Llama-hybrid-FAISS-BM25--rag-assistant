Transforming IV food expenditures for logistic regression

For my thesis I made a prediction model for food security using logistic regression (n=210). One of the predictors included in my final model is 'food expenditures'. The independent variable is originally positively skewed. It had a few outliers, which I removed. The logodds of the independent variable followed a linear relationship with the dependent variable food security. Would I have a reason to do a lognormal transformation on the predictor food expenditures? I read that monetary variables are often transformed, should this also be the case in my research? I'm looking forward to your answers!
