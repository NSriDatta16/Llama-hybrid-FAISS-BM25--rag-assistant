There is PowerPivot Add-in for Excel. It is an ssas engine with in-memory storage and a powerful expression language called DAX that allows you to load all kinds of data sources and create model/s in Excel itself. It has an engine called Vertipaq that highly compresses the underlying data allowing millions of rows to be sliced and diced. Regards, Hrvoje
