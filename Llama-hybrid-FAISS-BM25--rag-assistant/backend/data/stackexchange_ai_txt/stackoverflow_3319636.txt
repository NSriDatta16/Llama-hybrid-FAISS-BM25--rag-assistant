std::vector > for sparse matrix structure or something else?

I am implementing a sparse matrix class in compressed row format. This means i have a fixed number of rows and each row consists of a number of elements (this number can be different for different rows but will not change after the matrix has been initialised. Is it suitable to implement this via vectors of vectors or will this somehow fragment the memory? How whould i implement the allocation of this so i will have one big chunk of memory? Thanks for sharing your wisdom! Dirk
