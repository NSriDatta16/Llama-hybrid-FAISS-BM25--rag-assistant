Time-varying Coefficients

I have time series data on fish catches from 1950-2011. I wish to implement a regression model with varying coefficients. I'm aware that cox models etc. exist and implementation via the survival package in R. My data is not survival data, it's just several variables with fish catches and year. Is there a way in R to implement such models? I've yet to come across this but I don't think it's unreasonable to want to model such data without it being survival data. I want to model inlandfao from marinefao . Here is my data and some plots: fishdata From these plots, a linear model isn't appropriate. I have fitted GAMs etc. to these data. Let me more if you require details.
