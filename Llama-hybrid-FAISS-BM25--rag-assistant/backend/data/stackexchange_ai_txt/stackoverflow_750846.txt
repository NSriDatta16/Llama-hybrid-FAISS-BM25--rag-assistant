Have a look at the Jetty Ssl Socket Connector instead of the often use Socket Connector. http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Ssl+Connector+Guide http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Embedding+Jetty?focusedCommentId=9241003#comment-9241003 Its not that difficult. Just add the sslSocketConnector to your server (after configuring it) and after this your application should respond to https requests. server.addConnector(sslConnector);
