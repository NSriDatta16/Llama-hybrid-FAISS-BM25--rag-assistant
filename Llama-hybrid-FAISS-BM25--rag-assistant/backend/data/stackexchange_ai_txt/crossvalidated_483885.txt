Bayesian Regression with ARIMA errors

Is there a framework (e.g. R package) which allows for Bayesian estimation of dynamic regression models with AR(I)MA errors (similar to the frequentist implementation in the forecast package in R, e.g. auto.arima ). My goal is to impose priors on the external regressors. So the model looks like $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1, t} + ... + \beta_k x_{k, t} + \eta_t$ , $\eta_t = \phi_t \eta_{t-1} + ... + \phi_p \eta_{t-p} - \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} - ... - \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q} + \epsilon_t$ where the regressor coefficients can have priors, e.g. $\beta_1 \sim N(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)$ or $\beta_2 \sim Beta(a_2, b_2)$ . Is this the same as a Bayesian Structural Time Series model (as implemented in the R package bsts )? Or should I use a framework for Bayesian models like Stan or greta ? Are these even suited for time series modelling?
