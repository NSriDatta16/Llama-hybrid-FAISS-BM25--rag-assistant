ASP.NET MVC Modify CSS links via code (runtime/development)?

does anyone know of a good way of doing the following, I need to have available via CSS Links up to 5 CSS files in one, this is pretty bad for trips to the server.. but it helps me keep it organized... At runtime i automatically consolidate and minify all css files into 1 ... What i was wondering is how to have links to css files in my source at design time and different at runtime?? Is there some special workaround i can do with tags? Thanks
