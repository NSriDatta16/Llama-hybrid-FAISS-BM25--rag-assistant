How to know the shape of the future feature maps knowing the shape of the kernel applied in an image?

Let's say that I have a [32*32] image and i want to convolve a 5*5 filter on it. The result of this convolution will be a 28*28 image. But how do we know that it will give a 28*28 image. Is there a formula to assert ? A Beginner's Guide To Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks
