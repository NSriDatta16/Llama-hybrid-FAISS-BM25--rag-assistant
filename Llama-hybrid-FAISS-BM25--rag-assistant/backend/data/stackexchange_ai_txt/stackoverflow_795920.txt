If you are in a programming language/environment where tail calls grow the stack (no tail call optimization (TCO) applied), then it is best to avoid deep recursion, and iterative solutions that may use a stack data structure are preferred. On the other hand, if you are in a language/environment that supports iterating with tail calls, or if the recursion depth will always be small, then recursion is often a fine/elegant solution. (This is a little over-broad, but overall, I would by no means call recursion "out-dated".)
