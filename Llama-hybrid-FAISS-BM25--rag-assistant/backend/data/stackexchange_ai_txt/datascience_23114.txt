One Class SVM for time series data

One CLass SVM is a well known machine learning algorithm for novality detection, but it is applicable only for a set of vectors not for time series data. I read a paper recently of how to use (One-Class SVM) OCSVM with time series data by first converting the time series into a phase space then apply the projection into OCSVM [1] Is there an implementation or library for such an algorithm to handle OCSVM with time series data?
