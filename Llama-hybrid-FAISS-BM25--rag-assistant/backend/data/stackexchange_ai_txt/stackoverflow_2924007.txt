Ownership of Google API keys in the enterprise

When developing a Google Maps or Recaptcha implementation, you can sign up for a free API key using However, in a large company, you don't want to tie these keys to a developer's gmail account. Does anyone have suggestions or best practices how Google API Keys should be managed on an organizational level? Who owns them?
