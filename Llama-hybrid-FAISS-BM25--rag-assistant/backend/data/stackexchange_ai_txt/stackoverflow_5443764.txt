When you're running the program under xdebug , you should be able to break into it's execution manually at a random time, and then display the call stack. If you do that several times, any code that's responsible for significant time will appear on those stack samples. That's the random-pause technique. It is a bit of a brain-shift. Things like self-time, measuring function execution time, or counting calls, for the purpose of finding problems, are indirect information at best. Rather, it says anything that's actually costing much time can't escape your attention if you just drop in on it and take a look . Anything you see it "doing" (and that means any line of code on the stack that you catch more than once) is something that will give a good speedup if you can avoid doing it. Precision of measurement is irrelevant. You've found it, so you can fix it, and afterwards measure the speedup.
