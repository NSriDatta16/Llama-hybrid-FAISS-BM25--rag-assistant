Custom Flash ActiveX Host - Relative paths

OK, getting this to work properly was a nightmare, so I decided to put this up for others. Hosting the flash activex requires that you call OleCreate with an IStorage that implements SetClass (can be no-op), and a IOleClientSite that implements: IOleInPlaceSiteEx: OnInPlaceActivateEx() (no-op) GetWindow() GetWindowContext() IOleClientSite: ShowObject() (no-op) However, any external resources the loaded swf accesses must be fully qualified, or it will fail with errors like: Error #2032: Stream Error. URL: file:// I'm posting what I figured out as an answer, tell me if this is not propper Stackettique.
