The difference between taking logs of the x-values and plotting the x-values on paper with a log-x scale lies in the labeling of the horizontal axis. In the former case, the x-axis has labels according to the values of $\log(x).$ In the latter case, the (distorted) x-axis has labels according to the values of $x$ . In the plots below, the first plots the data without any attention to logs. In the second, the x-axis has values of $\log(x).$ In the third, the $x$ -values are plotted on a log scale. The second and third plots both appear to be roughly linear. If the scales are appropriate, the slopes will appear to be the same. Numerically, they will not be the same because different numbers are used. In the plot at right, numerically the plot is not really a line, but distorted to look as if it were a line by the log scale on the horizonal axis. This example uses R and 'logs' are natural logarithms, not logs-base-10. R code for the three plots: set.seed(1216) x0 = rnorm(50, 10, 2); x = exp(x0) y = x0 + runif(50, 0, .5) par(mfrow=c(1,3)) plot(x, y) plot(log(x), y); plot(x, y, log="x") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Data description: summary(x) Min. 1st Qu.
