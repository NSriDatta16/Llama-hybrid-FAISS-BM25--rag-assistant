Can an authentication via HTTP over IIS be encrypted (without SSL)?

I'm accustomed to *nix servers and if we wanted a completely secure sign in screen, we (as far as I am aware) are to use SSL via HTTPS. Our overseeing organization at work use Windows Servers for serving web pages. On one such page they are authenticating network credentials. This page is using HTTP, and what appears to be Basic Auth (a popup dialog) for an SQL Server Report Manager. They say Basic is disabled in IIS. In my limited experience with IIS at college, I (think I) recall subdomains can override general settings. They believe it's using Integrated Windows Authentication. So... Is there a way to differentiate between Basic Auth and Integrated Windows Auth when viewing a web-page prompt, and... Is it possible to encrypt the communication between computer and server during authentication so that the text being sent is encrypted (without a JS solution)?
