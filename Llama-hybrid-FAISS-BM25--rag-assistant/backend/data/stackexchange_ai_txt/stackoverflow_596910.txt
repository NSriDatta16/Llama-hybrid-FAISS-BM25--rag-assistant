+1 to all the answers with WSGI. Eric Florenzo wrote a great blog post lately you should read: Writing Blazing Fast, Infinitely Scalable, Pure-WSGI Utilities . This will give you a better idea of pure WSGI beyond Hello World. Also pay attention to the comments, especially the first comment by Kevin Dangoor where he recommends at least adding WebOb to your toolset.
