How to produce a coverage report from a visual studio .coverage file that is similar to the one produced by emma?

Visual Studio code coverage produces a .coverage binary file which can be converted to xml. Is there an xsl transform available that can convert that xml to a formatted report similar to the one produced by emma coverage tool for java. Any other transformations that would produce a meaningful report are also welcome.
