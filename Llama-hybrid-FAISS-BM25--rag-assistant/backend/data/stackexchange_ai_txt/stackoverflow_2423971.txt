Ruby: Problems using Mechanize to access my form!

Just for fun, I wrote a very small rails blog (just a hello world). Now I want to create a post using mechanize. So I created a Ruby Prog and started coding. Here is my problem: Rails creates my form element including all inputs. In HTML my inputs look like this: or Well... Here is my Ruby Prog using Mechanize: require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' agent = WWW::Mechanize.new page = agent.get('http://localhost:3000/posts/new') target_form = page.form_with(:class => 'new_post') target_form.post[title] = "test" target_form.post[description] = "test" page = agent.submit(target_form) puts "end" I know where my error is but I don't know how to fix it. At target_form.post[title] = "test" it crashes, cause of undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError) I think (please correct me), it's because of the input name, cause it is post[title] instead of only post right? How can I fix it?
