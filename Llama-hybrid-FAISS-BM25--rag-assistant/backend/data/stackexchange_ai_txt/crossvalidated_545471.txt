Unbiased estimator of $ 1 + \mu^{2}$ from a Normal population

Question: If $ x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3},...x_{n}$ is a random sample from a $Normal$ $population$ $N(\mu,1)$ then what is the unbiased estimator of $ 1 + \mu^{2}$ ? I began finding the mean and variance of $X$ $$E(X) = \mu \ , \ Var(X) = 1$$ And the expectation of $X^{2}$ is $$ E(X^{2}) = 1 + \mu^{2} $$ Hence is the unbiased estimator of $ 1 + \mu^{2}$ = $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}$ ? Is my method and solution correct?
