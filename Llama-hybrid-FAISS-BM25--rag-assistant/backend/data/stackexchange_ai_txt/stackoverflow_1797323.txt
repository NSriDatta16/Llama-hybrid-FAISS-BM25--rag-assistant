I expect it will generally be a manual process, because the code styles are so different, code-to-code conversion would be likely to be difficult/fragile/error-prone. The only automatic way that I could conceive of is a html-to-flash-ui conversion, which would get you a static look or prototype to start with, but wouldn't help you in the creation of the active/reactive/dynamic elements of the new flash widget. A quick google search brings up a few paid references to html to flash conversion, as well as a few pages mentioning some libraries that might be worth pursuing, if just as a shortcut to creating a prototype that you would have to refine: http://drawlogic.com/2008/01/11/as3-flash-to-html-conversion-library-htmlwrapper/ and here: http://osflash.org/flashml Since there is one free library, there may quite likely be others as well.
