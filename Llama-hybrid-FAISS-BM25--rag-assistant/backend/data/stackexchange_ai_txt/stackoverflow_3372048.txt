I know that you are using PHP, but some Web application frameworks for other languages such as Happstack (for Haskell) use an internal RAM based data storage serialized on the disk. Happstack's RAM cloud database architecture provides you the speed and predictability of RAM based queries combined with the durability, replication, and ACID properties of traditional databases. If you are interested, you can study the approach, I bet there are others.
