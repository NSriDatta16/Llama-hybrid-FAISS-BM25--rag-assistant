How does ETHERNET ensure that the preamble won't occur in TCP/IP section? A TCP stream is carried in (broken into) one or more IP packets. IP packets are carried in Ethernet frames. The IP network device driver splits its IP packets into one or more Ethernet frames before transmission (splitting the IP packets, and adding Ethernet frame headers), and after reception it reassembles Ethernet frames into IP packets (discarding Ethernet frame headers and combining IP packet fragments).
