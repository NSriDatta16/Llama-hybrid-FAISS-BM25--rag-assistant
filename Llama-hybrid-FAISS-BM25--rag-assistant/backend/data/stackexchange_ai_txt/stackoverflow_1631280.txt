The data structures used inside a database engine is far more complex than you are giving it credit for! Yes, there are issues of fragmentation and issues where updating a varchar with a large value can cause a performance hit, however its difficult to explain /understand what the implications of those issues are without a fuller understanding of the datastructures involved. For MS Sql server you might want to start with understanding pages - the fundamental unit of storage (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190969.aspx ) In terms of the performance implications of fixes vs variable storage types on performance there are a number of points to consider: Using variable length columns can improve performance as it allows more rows to fit on a single page, meaning fewer reads Using variable length columns requires special offset values, and the maintenance of these values requires a slight overhead, however this extra overhead is generally neglible. Another potential cost is the cost of increasing the size of a column when the page containing that row is nearly full As you can see, the situation is rather complex - generally speaking however you can trust the database engine to be pretty good at dealing with variable data types and they should be the data type of choice when there may be a significant variance of the length of data held in a column. At this point I'm also going to recommend the excellent book "Microsoft Sql Server 2008 Internals" for some more insight into how complex things like this really get!
