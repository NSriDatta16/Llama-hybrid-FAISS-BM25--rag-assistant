Have a look at the ARIMAX model specification. It seems to be closest to what you're doing. You can use any nonparametric regression or classification model given concatenated Toeplitz design matrices. There's a slight issue, in that your models might not be stable in the sense outlined in this paper: Why Yule-Walker Should Not Be Used For Autoregressive Modelling With forecasting time-series models, you want the data to be preprocessed so that it has approximately the same mean and standard deviation everywhere. Depending on your data, you probably want to preprocess your data by differencing , in which you subtract each value from the previous. For forecasting purposes, the inverse of this operation is the cumulative sum plus your burnt in value at the beginning. This operation can be applied multiple times to make your data appear stationary. Another preprocessing option is to perform low order polynomial regression on the data, then predict the residuals. The appropriate form of cross validation for time-series to take the first 60% as your training set, the next 20% as your validation set and the final 20% as your test set. If you have enough data you can restrict yourself to online (iterative) models, you can have an efficient estimate of performance. A neat trick for with confidence bands in online time series models was presented in this paper: Online Reliability Estimates for Individual Predictions in Data Streams . If you want a stronger background in the theory of time-series, I cannot recommend Brockwell and Davis enough. Unfortunately, there's no legal free source of the PDF.
