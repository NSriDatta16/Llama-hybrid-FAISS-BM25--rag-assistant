I think Rocky Lhotka should get the credit, but I had to touch a CSLA.NET application recently {in my private practice on the side} and I was very impressed with the orderliness of the code. The app worked extremely well, but the client needed a few extensions. The original author had died tragically, and the new guy was unsophisticated. He didn't understand CSLA.NET's business object based approach, and he wanted to do it all over again in cut-and-dried VB.NET, without any fancy framework. So I got the call. Looking at a working example of WinForm binding and CSLA.NET was pretty instructive about a lot of things.
