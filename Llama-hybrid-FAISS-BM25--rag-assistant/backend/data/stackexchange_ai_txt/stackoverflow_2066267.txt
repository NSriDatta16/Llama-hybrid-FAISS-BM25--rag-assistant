Rails 2.3: How to access a model's relationships, when hsing fields_for and :accepts_nested_attributes_for

OK, so the relationship is: Program has many :events And each Event belongs to an Organizer (who has_many :events) In a form for Program/edit, I'd like to list the associated events, and with each of those entries, also have access to each Organizer so I can do something like: textfield(event.name) | textfield(event.date) | label(event.organizer.name) So... ... Event Data Fields true %> Obviously, event_form.text_field "organizer.name" won't work, but that's the concept
