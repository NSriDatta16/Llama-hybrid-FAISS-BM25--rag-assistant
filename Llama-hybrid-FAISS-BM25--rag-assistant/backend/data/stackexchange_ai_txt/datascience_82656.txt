How to Ensemble LGBM and XGBoost Machine Learning Models?

I want to Ensemble my predictions for the StratifiedKFold of LGBM and XGBoost into another LGBM Model. I had written the following code which works when the data set has an ID_COL, but in this data set I don't have any ID_COL. It is simply based on the index. How can I ensemble the model in such case? The Train and Test data are stored in train and test file respectively. CODE train_new = train[[TARGET_COL]] test_new = test[[ID_COL]] #ID_COL is not available in data. train_new['lgb'] = lgb_oofs test_new['lgb'] = lgb_preds train_new['xgb'] = xgb_oofs test_new['xgb'] = xgb_preds After this I pass train_new and test_new to a LGBM Model.
