As Dominic says, checking you're encoding your HTML with the right charset in your meta tag would be the first step. There's info on charsets and encoding here . Whether you need to change the charset meta tag depends on the language the page is in. If your page is in English but just has the odd character that needs accents etc., the easiest way is to use the character code, for example the character code for Ã© is &eacute; One of the many lists of character entities available online can be found here . Alternatively, if your page is basically in English, but has small sections in another language, CSS2 has a lang attribute that can be used to style text in other languages appropriately. There's more info about the four different ways to apply language styles here . You can use the :lang() pseudo-class selector, the [lang |= "..."] selector that matches the beginning of the value of a language attribute, the [lang = "..."] selector that exactly matches the value of a language attribute, or a generic class or id selector. If a small portion of your site was in another language such as Hebrew, you could also use CSS and a span to signify a change in the reading direction of the text, for example: This is a paragraph written right-to-left. or This paragraph is written left-to-right except for these words which were written right-to-left. These examples (taken from here ) show the style being applied inline, but you could also set the styles up in an external stylesheet).
