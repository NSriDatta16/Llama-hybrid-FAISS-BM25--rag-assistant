I don't have a full solution but perhaps it's relevant that the pattern 55 is embedded in itself (I think the term for this is "not prefix free"?). That is, the first time to get a 55 is greater than the time to get the second 55 because the second 55 can occur immediately, as in the sequence "32555". So if we let X1 be waiting time for first 55 and X2 be waiting time for second 55 and E[5] be average waiting time for just a 5 then I think E[X1] = E[X2] + E[5]. My guess for E[X2] was 36 and E[5] is 6, which gives 42 for the first 55 as you calculated.
