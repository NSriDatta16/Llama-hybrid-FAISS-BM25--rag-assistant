Opera won't load some JavaScript files

I have a web page that loads in an IFRAME, that runs correctly in IE and Firefox but not in Opera. Which I hate, because I've been an Opera user for years. And I wrote this thing. :-) The problem is that Opera is not loading some of the JavaScript files that comprise the page. I suspect that it is related to the fact that the page itself is loaded via HTTPS and the included files via HTTP from a different host and port. I believe Opera allows that, but Dragonfly's Net tab doesn't even show an attempt to load them. The page is a Rally "custom app", and I can't control the fact that it is loaded in an IFRAME or that it loads via HTTPS. I also can't control the fact that the included files are loaded from a different host, or that the host only supports HTTP. So I'm sorta stuck with mixed content. Among other stuff, the page's HEAD element contains (sanitized a bit): ALL of the "/slm/..." stuff is getting loaded, and NONE of the "www.example..." stuff is. Anybody got an idea what I'm doing wrong?
