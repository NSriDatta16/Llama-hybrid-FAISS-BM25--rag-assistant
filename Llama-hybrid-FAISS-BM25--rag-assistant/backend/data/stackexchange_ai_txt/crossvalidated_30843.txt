Cheung and Cheung (2010) gave a presentation discussing two appraoches to meta-analytic Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). They label the two approaches: Correlation matrices Meta-Analysis : An average correlation matrix is extracted from the primary studies and SEM is applied to this single correlation matrix. Model Parameters Meta-Analysis : Model fitting is applied separately to the correlation matrix of each primary study and the variation in parameters is modelled using random effects multivariate meta-analysis (Cheung and Cheung, 2010 cite Cheung 2009, and Kalaian & Raudenbush, 1996) Cheung and Cheung (2010) note that this is an area of research needing further development. They recommend trying both approaches especially where the full correlation matrix is available at least in a subset of studies. Discussions of how to perform meta-analysis SEM are also closely related with general discussions of multivariate meta-analysis (e.g., see the tutorial by Van Houwelingen et al 2002). I think that the standIndirect function in the metaSEM package in R (Cheung, 2011) implements a three variable test of mediation using the model parameters meta-analysis approach.
