want to determine whether they come from similar distributions A goodness of fit test doesn't say how similar two distributions are; once you pin down a suitable way to measure similarity (suitable to your particular purpose), that would be more like some kind of effect size. So I understand that if I get a p-value of less than 0.05 I can say that i'm 95% confident that they come from different distributions? No. That's not a correct interpretation of what a p-value tells you. So my question is if I get a p-value of 0.33 am I 67% confident that they come from different distributions? Is that a correct interpretation? No. And conversely, how do I say how confident I am that they come from the same distribution, You can't. (Well, possibly you can make a statement vaguely sort of similar to that if you're a Bayesian, but then you wouldn't be doing a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. And it shouldn't contain the word "confidence" since that has a particular meaning in statistics that wouldn't really apply.) Or is it just the inverse of above? Nope.
