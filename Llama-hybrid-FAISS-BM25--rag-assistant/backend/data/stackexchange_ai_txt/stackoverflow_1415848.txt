NSMutableURLRequest and a Password with special Characters won't work

I'm writing a small program (using Cocoa Touch), which communicates with a webservice. The code for calling the webservice, is the following: - (IBAction)send:(id)sender { if ([number.text length] > 0) { [[UIApplication sharedApplication] beginIgnoringInteractionEvents]; [activityIndicator startAnimating]; NSString *modded; modded = [self computeNumber]; NSMutableURLRequest *theRequest = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL: [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://tester:%=&=-Test2009@samurai.sipgate.net/RPC2"]]; [theRequest setHTTPMethod:@"POST"]; [theRequest addValue:@"text/xml" forHTTPHeaderField:@"content-type"]; [theRequest setCachePolicy:NSURLCacheStorageNotAllowed]; [theRequest setTimeoutInterval:5.0]; NSString* pStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@" samurai.SessionInitiate LocalUri RemoteUri sip:%@@sipgate.net TOS text Content %@ Schedule ", modded, TextView.text]; NSData* pBody = [pStr dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; [theRequest setHTTPBody:pBody]; NSURLConnection *theConnection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:theRequest delegate:self]; if (!theConnection) { UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Error" message:@"A Connection could not be established!" delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles: nil]; [alert show]; [alert release]; sendButton.enabled = TRUE; return; } [pStr release]; [pBody release]; } } The Username and Password have to be in the URL, and it works in most cases, but when the password consists of special characters like in the example "%=&=-Test2009", the Webservice does not respond. If it is something like "Test2009" it works fine. Does anyone have an idea why, and maybe a solution for that?
