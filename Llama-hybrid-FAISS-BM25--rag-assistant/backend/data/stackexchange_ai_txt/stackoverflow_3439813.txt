I bet you're ignoring the memory warnings that are being sent to your UIViewController subclass that is home to your UIWebView. Uncomment -(void)didReceiveMemoryWarning and emit some NSLog messages from there. You'll probably see that the phone is frantically trying to get your attention about a low-memory condition. And when you don't respond by lowering memory use, it kills you. What you want to do in that method is free any resources you're holding on to--images, big chunks of data, etc.
