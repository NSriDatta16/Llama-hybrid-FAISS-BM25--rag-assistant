Comparing multi-class results with binary classification results

We used machine learning to discriminate the following five disease classes: Normal (N) Myocardial Infarction (MI) Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). In the past, these diseases were only discriminated with binary classifiers: N and MI, N and CAD, N and CHF. What is the best way of comparing the multi-class results with the three individual binary classification results? Access to the confusion matrix is available for all cases.
