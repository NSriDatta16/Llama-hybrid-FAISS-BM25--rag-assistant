Compiling SAS SCL code programmatically

Is there a programmatic way of compiling SAS 9.1.3 SCL code (N.B. not ordinary SAS code) in Windows? The only way I have found of doing it involves using the SAS GUI: we have a Perl script which sends keystrokes to the UI. While this works (sort of), it's ugly and error-prone, and is too fragile to add to our automated build script. EDIT: My original question was probably somewhat unclear. I am aware of proc build ; my problem is getting some plain text into the SAS catalogue as an SCL entry in the first place.
