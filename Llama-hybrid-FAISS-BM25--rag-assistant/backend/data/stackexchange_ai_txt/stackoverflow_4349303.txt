Trashing the folder does not properly uninstall Xcode. Here are the steps to uninstall Xcode from the PDF readme distributed with the installer: Uninstalling Xcode Developer Tools To uninstall Xcode developer tools on the boot volume along with the directory, from a Terminal window type: $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools -mode=all To remove the underlying developer content on the boot volume, but leave the directory and supporting files untouched, from a Terminal window type: $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=systemsupport To just remove the UNIX development support on the boot volume, but leave the directory and supporting files untouched, from a Terminal window type: $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=unixdev Finally, to just uninstall the directory you can simply drag it to the trash, or from a Terminal window type: $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=xcodedir NOTE: The uninstaller that ships with previous versions of the Xcode developer tools will not clean everything off of your system properly. You should use the one installed with these Xcode developer tools. My gut feeling tells me that this process will properly nuke/replace dylibs like the one that is causing you trouble. At the very least, all trying this will cost you is time.
