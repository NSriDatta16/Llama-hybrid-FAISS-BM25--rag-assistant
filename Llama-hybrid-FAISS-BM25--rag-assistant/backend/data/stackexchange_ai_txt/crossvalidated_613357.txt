Does it make sense to use the correlation matrix from PCA in LDA?

I'm coming from here and here . I kind of understand what it does running PCA before LDA. However I don't really understand what I have to perform LDA. In the correlation matrix? Here I have all variables centered and scaled and ready to be "weighted" predictors Which would be the steps to follow?
