Decompiling SWFs and fonts

I'm working on a Flash-based font viewer for a font retailer website. I've been reading up on SWF decompilers, and I was wondering, can decompilers grab fonts embedded in a SWF and output them in some sort of reusable format? I might also be embedding the fonts in external SWFs, possibly hosted on a HTTPS server. Would that be a feasible way of protecting the fonts from decompiling? (I've got a copy of the Sothink Decompiler lying around and I was meaning to put all this to the test, but unfortunately the trial period's ended.) Thanks for your help! Andrey
