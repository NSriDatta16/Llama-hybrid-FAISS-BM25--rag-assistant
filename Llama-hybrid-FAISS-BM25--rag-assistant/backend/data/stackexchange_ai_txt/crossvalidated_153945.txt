Removing the bias will definitely affect the performance and here is why... Each neuron is like a simple logistic regression and you have $y=\sigma(W x + b)$. The input values are multiplied with the weights and the bias affects the initial level of squashing in the sigmoid function (tanh etc.), which results the desired the non-linearity. For example, assume that you want a neuron to fire $y\approx1$ when all the input pixels are black $x\approx0$. If there is no bias no matter what weights $W$ you have, given the equation $y=\sigma(W x)$ the neuron will always fire $y\approx0.5$. Therefore, by removing the bias terms you would substantially decrease your neural network's performance.
