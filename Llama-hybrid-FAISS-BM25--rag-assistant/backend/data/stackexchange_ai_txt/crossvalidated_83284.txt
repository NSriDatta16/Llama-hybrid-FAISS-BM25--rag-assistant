How do I compare multiple coefficients of variation?

I have an experiment organized as follows: N repeated measures were done for each of M different conditions (each one having a different mean value) The experiment was done P times, each time using a different measurement method. I now want to estimate which of the P methods has the lowest overall coefficient of variation, but I am unsure on how to follow. I initially thought about computing the CV for each of the M conditions (based on the N repeated measures) and then finding the "average" CV for each measurement method. However, in this case I would not know how to test for significance between the different measurement methods. What would be the best way to show whether a given measurement method has a lower "overall" dispersion than the others with the data I have available?
