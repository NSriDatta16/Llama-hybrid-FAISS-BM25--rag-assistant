I dictate VB.net and TSQL using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10 Professional. VB.net is inherently closer to a "spoken" language, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't work for C# or others. I start with a completely empty vocabulary, and build it from scratch to suit my needs (which is why I use the professional version). Here's the basic steps (this assumes you have already created and trained a user): Create a new vocabulary based on "Base General - Empty Dictation". Don't have it scan your documents or email. Add lists of keywords with pronunciation specific to your programming language (Dim, ByVal\by-val, etc.). Create a .txt document that contains all of your code minus comments. Harvest words from this document and add them with pronunciations. Use the document to train the vocabulary's language model. I'll write up something with more detail when I get a chance if anyone is interested. Edit: Here's how to dictate SQL code . The word list created here can be included in other vocabularies if you are a database developer.
