If we know the probability distribution of data generation, we can calculate unconditional quantities directly without the help of observations. But we don't know the distribution and we have only one instantiation of time series in real life. They seek to find a way to calculate unconditional quantities from a time average over the time series observed. That is to say, we replace the ensemble average over different time series instantiations by the time average of one time series. And the properties of time series in which two quantities agree are called ergodicity. Loosely speaking, ergodicity is satisfied in case of weak stationary time series. Let's consider our task is to calculate the mean of the distribution. If the mean of series is not constant, the time average would not agree with ensemble average at a point of time. Because the mean changes all the time and time average will give a different number depending on the time interval which is averaged.
