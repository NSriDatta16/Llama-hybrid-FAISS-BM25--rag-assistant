I have been working in Java Swing Client/Server applications for almost 3 years. I would suggest you to go for RMI/EJBs. The initial application that we developed was doing this using RMI/EJB for client-server communication with WebLogic being the server. But we later found out that there are lot of "browser-like" features to be included to the application such as session-timeout etc., So, we used the BrightSide Framework which wraps the RMI calls through HTTP. One more enhancment we made is that we replaced Weblogic with the open source JBoss server. The wrapping of calls with HTTP will become very handy and you can make your swing applications really rich. Later, when the situation demands for you to use a website strictly, you can deploy your swing using jnlp . Hope this helped.
