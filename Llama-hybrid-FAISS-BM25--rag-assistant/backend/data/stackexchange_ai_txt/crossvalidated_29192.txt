(+1) Very good question. Minor thing, MLE stands for maximum likelihood estimate (not multiple), which means that you just maximize the likelihood. This does not specify that the likelihood has to be produced by IID sampling. If the dependence of the sampling can be written in the statistical model, you just write the likelihood accordingly and maximize it as usual. The one case worth mentioning when you do not assume dependence is that of the multivariate Gaussian sampling (in time series analysis for example). The dependence between two Gaussian variables can be modelled by their covariance term, which you incoroporate in the likelihood. To give a simplistic example, assume that you draw a sample of size $2$ from correlated Gaussian variables with same mean and variance. You would write the likelihood as $$\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2\sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\exp\left(-\frac{z}{2\sigma^2(1-\rho^2)}\right),$$ where $z$ is $$z = (x_1-\mu)^2-2\rho(x_1-\mu)(x_2-\mu)+(x_2-\mu)^2.$$ This is not the product of the individual likelihoods. Still, you would maximize this with parameters $(\mu, \sigma, \rho)$ to get their MLE.
