Doing a backup & restore to do a database server upgrade has many gotcha's. It's best to do an in-place upgrade (you might want to take a full backup of the server first) & let the MS installer do the work. 2005 supports 2000 DTS packages as Legacy so there's no need to learn SSIS & convert all your packages unless you have the time & there isn't too many. As for the backup & restore upgrade, don't forget about: logins, you'll need transfer these, see KB246133 for more details Any user and role permissions given to system databases will need to be re-created or transferred linked server or remote servers will need to be re-setup SQL Server Agent Jobs need to be exported-imported Any Extended stored procedures need to be re-created Replication will need to be re-setup Log shipping will need to be re-setup & the standby server also upgraded
