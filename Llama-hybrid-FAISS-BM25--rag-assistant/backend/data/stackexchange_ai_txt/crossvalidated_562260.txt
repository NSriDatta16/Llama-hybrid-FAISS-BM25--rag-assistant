Statistical/Automated method for identifying a dataset suitable for Machine Learning Modelling

Given a folder which has 10k Excel files, the objective is to identify the datasets suitable for Machine Learning Modelling Approach. We use a script right now which performs this operation and call it as No Model Possible script. Current logic for this script is based on business rule that: Calculate the % of number of timestamps which are boolean , we save it in variable as X . Calculate the % of number of timestamps for which the OP signal is not in the given range , we save it in variable as Y . If any of the two variables have % greater than 95% , we label that dataset as No_Model_Possible dataset. Now, since i have explained the existing logic, our motive is to improve the same. Requirement : I am looking for some solid Statistical tests that we can perform on the given dataset and then classify the dataset to be Model Possible or No Model Possible . Note : - Dataset can have a shape of (200k,2k) including the Target Tag. - Features and Target Tag may/may not be Normally Distributed. . - One main feature is Timestamp with minute interval.
