Visual Studio adds a circular reference when I drag and drop a user control from the Toolbox

I have a user control C that is defined inside project P. C is present as a ".NET Framework Component" in my Visual Studio Toolbox. I open a form F (also defined inside project P) and drop C onto F. Once I do that drop, Visual Studio adds a reference under P pointing to P's own DLL . This is unnecessary and causes tons of build errors like The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties... after which it lists the exact same method twice. If I go into References and delete the added reference, it builds correctly. Can I prevent VS from adding this unnecessary reference? Summary (By SLaks) : In VS2010, adding a UserControl to a form in the same project automatically adds a reference to the project itself, causing problems.
