The closest you can get is to use the DOMDocumentFragment . Then you can do: $doc = new DOMDocument(); ... $f = $doc->createDocumentFragment(); $f->appendXML(" text text2 "); $someElement->appendChild($f); However, this expects XML, not HTML. In any case, I think you're creating an artificial problem. Since you know the behavior is to create the html and body tags you can just extract the elements in the file from within the body tag and then import the, to the DOMDocument where you're assembling the final file. See DOMDocument::importNode .
