I don't really agree with all the answers here about embedding the HTML beforehand and hiding it with CSS until it is again shown with JS. Even w/o JavaScript enabled, that node still exists in the DOM. True, most browsers (even accessibility browsers) will ignore it, but it still exists and there may be odd times when that comes back to bite you. My preferred method would be to use jQuery to generate the content. If it will be a lot of content, then you can save it as an HTML fragment (just the HTML you will want to show and none of the html, body, head, etc. tags) then use jQuery's ajax functions to load it into the full page. test.html $(document).ready(function() { $.get('_test.html', function(html) { $('p:first').after(html); }); }); This is content at the top of the page. This is content at the bottom of the page. _test.html This is from an HTML fragment document result This is content at the top of the page. This is from an HTML fragment document This is content at the bottom of the page.
