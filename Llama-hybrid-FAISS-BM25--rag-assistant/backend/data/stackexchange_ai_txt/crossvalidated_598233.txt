Actual proportions vs predicted probabilities in Logistic Regression over trained model

I am running a Logistic Regression model on a very upsampled data (upsampled by repeating certain observations). It appears that the expected predicted probabilities of majority class for certain cuts in the data I use for training are not equal or close to the actual proportions of majority class in the same cuts i.e. actual proportions in sample (cutting the sample by various groups) don't match the expected predicted probabilities within the same sample cuts. Under what scenario does that happen? And is it important for the two to be close to one another?
