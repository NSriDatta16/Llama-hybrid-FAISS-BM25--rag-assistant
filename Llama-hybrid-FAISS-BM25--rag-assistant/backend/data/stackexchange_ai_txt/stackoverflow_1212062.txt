What should a front end developer expect from a copywriter?

I'm working on a site and the client has hired a copy writer to supply the text... which has been an absolute nightmare. I'm wondering, what is an acceptable level of service one could expect from a copy writer who has been asked to write copy specifically for the web. Is it unreasonable to expect them to have some basic markup skills, such as being able to encode html entities, create paragraphs and links and so on? Does anyone here have any sort of checklist they use when saying what they will and will not accept as copy for a website?
