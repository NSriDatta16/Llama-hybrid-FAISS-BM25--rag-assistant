I think you should create a file picker first, http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/11958/Create_a_file_picker_856986_11.jsp After that in the application, user could select whether to capture new picture or browse from their storage. If user select the later, open up this file picker and for every images found user can view the image, and the application can save the path where the images located for further processing.
