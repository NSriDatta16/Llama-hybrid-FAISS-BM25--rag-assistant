Ruby on Rails session storage - how to *not* store certain fields in session store?

WARNING: Complete newbie to RoR and Ruby alert! * I have a login method that looks like this: @user = Person.find(:first, :conditions => ["email=?", params[:email]]) if @user and @user.password==params[:user_password] session[:user] = @user else flash[:warn] = 'Invalid password!' However, the user record can get very large, so I don't want to store the entire user record in my cookie session. How can I modify this code so that a specific field does not get stored in the session? There are two fields that can get very large (very large user profile data) and will not fit within the cookie session 4 kilobyte limit, so I want to exclude those from being stored in the session.
