cmath compilation error when compiling old C++ code in VS2010

I've inherited a few C++ files and an accompanying makefile, which I'm trying to bring into VS2010 as a solution. I've created an empty project and added the appropriate C++ and header (.hpp) files for one of the makefile targets. When I try to compile the project, however, I immediately get a large number of C2061 (syntax error identifier) errors coming from cmath regarding acosf, asinf, atanf, etc. The error line in cmath: #pragma once #ifndef _CMATH_ #define _CMATH_ #include #ifdef _STD_USING #undef _STD_USING #include #define _STD_USING #else /* _STD_USING */ #include #endif /* _STD_USING */ #if _GLOBAL_USING && !defined(RC_INVOKED) _STD_BEGIN using _CSTD acosf; using _CSTD asinf; The top block of the relevant C++ file (though named as a .C): #include #include #include #include #include using namespace std; Followed by the main() function, which doesn't call any of the trig functions directly. This has to be something really obvious, but I'm missing it. Can anyone help? Thanks!
