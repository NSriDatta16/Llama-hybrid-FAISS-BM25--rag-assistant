How to get a proper count in sql server when retrieving a lot of fields?

Here is my scenario, I have query that returns a lot of fields. One of the fields is called ID and I want to group by ID and show a count in descending order. However, since I am bringing back more fields, it becomes harder to show a true count because I have to group by those other fields. Here is an example of what I am trying to do. If I just have 2 fields (ID, color) and I group by color, I may end up with something like this: ID COLOR COUNT == ===== ===== 2 red 10 3 blue 5 4 green 24 Lets say I add another field which is actually the same person, but they have a different spelling of their name which throws the count off, so I might have something like this: ID COLOR NAME COUNT == ===== ====== ===== 2 Red Jim 5 2 Red Jimmy 5 3 Red Bob 3 3 Red Robert 2 4 Red Johnny 12 4 Red John 12 I want to be able to bring back ID, Color, Name, and Count, but display the counts like in the first table. Is there a way to do this using the ID?
