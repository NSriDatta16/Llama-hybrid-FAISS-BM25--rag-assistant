Drag-Drop disabling not working in Safari/Chrome WebKit Browsers

I have created a Rich Text Editor Web application using document.designMode="on" in an iframe. I want the selection of text to work but want the drag and dropping of text to be disabled. I tried this: evt.dataTransfer.effectAllowed="none"; evt.dataTransfer.dropEffect = "none"; This works fine in Firefox but it doesn't work in Safari/Chrome WebKit browsers. I have tried to put this in every event: dragover , dragstart , drag , dragenter etc. but to no avail. Putting evt.preventDefault() in mousedown or mouseup addEventListener s disables the selection of text which I don't want. Please help.
