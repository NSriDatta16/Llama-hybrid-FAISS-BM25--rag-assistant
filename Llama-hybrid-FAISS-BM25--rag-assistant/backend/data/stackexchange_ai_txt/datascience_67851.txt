1) How common is this sort of behavior in the data science world? Very common across the board and not necessarily related to data science but any data request. I cannot comment on academia and my experience is much broader than what nowadays is considered data science but with regards to data requests towards different departments (e.g. controlling, sales, production, supply chain, finance, HR) in different industries (e.g. chemicals, metals, consumer goods, retail, utilities) I have seen this a lot. 2) Are there good reasons for it, or is it just how people assert power in this space? There are plenty of different reasons, e.g. high number of incoming data requests, high general workload, unclear goal of data request, bad quality of data requests, not-ideal form of communication, incorrect path of communication, interpersonal issues (with you, your boss, or your department). The important thing here is to anticipate these and request your data accordingly - which brings me to your third question. 3) Is the problem most likely my approach to data, or my approach to people? From the list above you can directly draw some conclusions how to properly request data: Provide your requests in a way that helps the receiver to prioritize properly and process it efficiently. [addresses number 1 and 2 in above list] State clearly what data you need and what the purpose of your request is. [addresses number 3 and 4 in above list] communicate in line with your company culture, e.g. choose the right level of politeness (hugely dependent on corporate culture and countries but very generally tech-people might sometimes come across as too demanding, direct or even impolite). [addresses point 5 in above list] Follow the correct path of communication in your organization, e.g. involve superiors before approaching someone on the working level in a different department or team, have your boss approach the other department or team if appropriate, reach out to people responsible for data provision (and not just anyone who has access to or "owns" it) and if in doubt align with your boss how to proceed. [addresses number 6 of above list] Keep interpersonal relationships in mind and approach them accordingly [addresses number 7 in above list] With regards to the examples you provided I would like to point out two things. Example 1 : As described above it is helpful to explain the reasons for a data request. Failing to answer this question might lead to deprioritizing or not complying with your data request. Example 2 : This can and does happen a lot. There are at least two things you can do about it: 1. include contingencies in your planning. 2. Flag potential and actual delays asap with your supervisor. All this is not say that it is all your fault but do your part to make things go as smoothly as possible.
