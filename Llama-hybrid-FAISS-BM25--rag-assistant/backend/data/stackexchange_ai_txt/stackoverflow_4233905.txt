The pre tag is a block level element, so it will behave like any other block level element and stack vertically (like paragraph, div, etc). You can set it to display:inline instead, I guess. But better would be to use the tag, which is inline by default. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code
