How is this equation deduced?

These two equations are from the book Gaussian Process for Machine Learning. First we already have equation (2.8). $p(\mathbf{w}|X, \mathbf{y}) ∼ N (\frac1{\sigma_n^2}A^{−1}X\mathbf{y}, A^{−1})$ (2.8) $\int \mathbf{x}_*^T\mathbf{w}\ p(\mathbf{w}|X,\mathbf{y})d\mathbf{w} = N (\frac1{\sigma_n^2}\mathbf{x}_*^TA^{−1}X\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x}_*^T A^{−1}\mathbf{x}_*)$ (2.9) I cannot deduce equation (2.9). I just don't know how to put $\mathbf{x}_*$ into the gaussian expression. Could anybody please explain how this is deduced to me?
