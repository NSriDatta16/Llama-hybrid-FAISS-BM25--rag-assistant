Arpit Sisodia is correct. One example of using logistic regression with very sparse features (i.e., most feature values are 0) is text classification using n-grams as features and logistic regression as the classier. Well over 99.9% of feature values are 0, yet it works well and actually is difficult to significantly outperform (e.g. see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251v1.pdf table 2).
