Suppose you try the first method and use the method of moments to estimate $D.$ Let $\bar x$ be the average of your 10 measurements. Since your population is normal, $\bar x \sim \mathrm{N} \left( D,\frac{1}{10} \right)$ Then since for any random variable with finite variance the second moment is given by $E[X^2] = \sigma^2 + \mu^2,$ we have $$E \left[ {\bar x}^2 \right]=\frac{1}{10}+D^2$$ In terms of the diameter $d$, the area of a circle is $$A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$ If we let $\hat A_1$ be the estimate of the area using your first method, its expectation will be $$E \left[ \hat A_1 \right] =\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \left( \frac{1}{10} + D^2 \right)=\frac{\pi D^2}{4}+\frac{\pi}{40}$$ So there is a bias of $\frac{\pi}{40}$ using this approach. Can you take it from here?
