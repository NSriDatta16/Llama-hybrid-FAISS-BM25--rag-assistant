Accessing external files within Java applications under Windows and Linux Operating Systems

Please I am facing the following issue: Throughout my Java program, i am accessing some files which it seems they are being accessed in a different way under windows compared to Linux. For example, if i wanted to access the following file within the same folder as the project i would write the following: Under Linux: File Operations_File = new File("Data/Operations.txt"); Under Windows: File Operations_File = new File("Data\\Operations.txt"); I will be needing a standard methodology that works under all operating systems (or at least those two). As coding two versions of my code is not elegant at all. My Two operating system that I am operating on are: Linux Mint 9 and Windows XP. I used NetBeans 6.9.1 throughout all the project. Your help is greatly appreciated!
