I am not entirely sure what you're asking. However, I am guessing you are asking how to get the most realistic results. You need to run your algorithm hundreds, or even thousands of iterations to get an average. It is also very important to turn off any caching that your language may do, and don't reuse objects, unless it is part of your algorithm.
