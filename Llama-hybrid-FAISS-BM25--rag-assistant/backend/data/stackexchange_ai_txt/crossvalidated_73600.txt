Parameter space exploration

I do realise this question is quite specific and practical, but I seek for some general help which helps me progress further in my analysis. Let $y(\boldsymbol{x})\in\mathbb{R}$ be the function I'd like to regress, whereas $\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^6$. My design matrix $\boldsymbol{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{11\times6}$ (therefore, at the moment, $y(\boldsymbol{X})\in\mathbb{R}^{11}$, but I can run further experiments, if needed). My aim is maximising $y(\boldsymbol{x})$ over $\boldsymbol{x}$, $x_{2k+1}=\{5,7,9\}$, $x_{2k}=\{2,4\}$. If I would run a dense experimental analysis, I would to test $3^3\times2^3=216$ cases, and each of those are very time consuming. The collected data is the following (yes, I know, they do not respect the constrain given above, which it allows me to run a reasonably lower total number of experiments if the dense experimental analysis will be considered as only feasible solution): X = [ 4 2 3 2 3 2 7 2 5 2 5 4 10 2 7 4 5 2 10 2 9 2 8 4 10 4 6 2 4 2 7 2 5 4 5 2 7 4 5 2 5 2 7 2 5 4 5 4 7 4 5 2 5 4 7 4 5 4 5 2 7 4 5 4 5 4 ]; y = [ 64.7 68.0 69.4 68.5 68.5 71.9 71.6 71.7 71.0 71.6 68.6 ]; I did scatter plot $(x_i, y(x_i)),i=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, but the output is not that informative. name = { 'ks1' 'ss1' 'ks2' 'ss2' 'ks3' 'ss3' }; [m, n] = size(X); % # of experiments, # of parameters = 3 conv kernel size + 3 subsamp for j = 1:2:n subplot(2,3,(j+1)/2) h = plot(X(:,j),y,'x','MarkerSize',10,'LineWidth',2); xlabel(name{j}) ylabel('Testing accuracy [%]') axis([2 10 60 75]) grid on end for j = 2:2:n subplot(2,3,3+j/2) h = plot(X(:,j),y,'x','MarkerSize',10,'LineWidth',2); xlabel(name{j}) ylabel('Testing accuracy [%]') axis([1 5 60 75]) grid on end So, my question is, how can I understand (and/or visualise) what is going on in this multivariate problem? To my mind a PCA keeps coming up as possible useful tool, even though I know it is used for visualising main orientations rather than helping me finding the maxima of my scalar fields.. Update I am currently running the 216 cases batch experiment, limited to 30 epochs training. Still, I would like to visualise my results. Actually, I do have a testing (and training) accuracy function per case, whereas above I just picked its maximum. This is an overview of the testing accuracy functions What I am trying to accomplish is determining the best configuration for a convolutional artificial neural network. The parameters I am considering here are kernel size ( ks ) and subsamplig ( ss ) factor for multiple layers ( 1 , 2 and 3 ), whereas $y(\cdot)$ is the testing (or cross-validation) accuracy.
