I think this is set in app/code/core/Mage/Cms/Block/Page.php. Look in the _prepareLayout() method (I am using magento 1.3, so this might be a little out of date). I see you have a few options to update. Edit the file directly. (not my recommendation, but the fasted way) Override the class in your own module Create an entry your theme's translate.csv file. This is the way I like to update verbiage under normal situations, but it may not be your cup of tea. So in app/design/frontend/your_package/your_theme/locale/en_US/translate.csv you can put a new line that says "Home","" and then presto. Edit your css file instead of php/phtml files. If you are halfway experienced with css you can likely just set the text-indent to -2000em and set a background image.
