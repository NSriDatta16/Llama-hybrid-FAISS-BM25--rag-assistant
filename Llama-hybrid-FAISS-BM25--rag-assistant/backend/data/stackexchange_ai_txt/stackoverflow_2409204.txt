It would seem overkill but Spring Forms handles this elegantly. That is of course if you are already using Spring MVC and you want to take advantage of the Spring Forms feature. // jsp form // the command class public class NumberCmd { private String[] friendlyNumber; } // in your Spring MVC controller submit method @RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.POST) public String manageOrders(@ModelAttribute("nbrCmd") NumberCmd nbrCmd){ String[] selectedNumbers = nbrCmd.getFriendlyNumber(); }
