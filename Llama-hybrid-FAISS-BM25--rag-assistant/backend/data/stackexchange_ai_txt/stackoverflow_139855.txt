using a good XML generator will greatly reduce potential errors due to fat-fingering, lapse of attention, or whatever other human frailty. there are several different levels of machine assistance to choose from, however: at the very least, use a programmer's text editor that does syntax highlighting and auto-indentation. just noticing that your text is a different color than you expect, or not lining up the way you expect, can tip you off to a typo you might otherwise have missed. better yet, take a step back and write the XML as a data structure of whatever language you prefer, than convert that data structure to XML. Perl gives you modules such as the lightweight XML::Simple for small jobs or the heftier XML::Generator ; using XML::Simple is just a matter of arranging your content into a standard Perl hash of hashes and running it through the appropriate method. -steve
