mySQL: Multi-column join on several tables part II

I am adding a 5th table to an existing join. The original query will always return a single row because the where clause specifies a unique ID. Here are the tables we are using: Table 1 carid, catid, makeid, modelid, caryear Table 2 makeid, makename Table 3 modelid, modelname Table 4 catid, catname Table 5 id, caryear, makename, modelname Here is the existing query I am using: SELECT a.*, e.citympg, e.hwympg FROM table1 a JOIN table2 b on a.makeid=b.makeid JOIN table3 c on a.modelid=c.modelid JOIN table4 d on a.catid=d.catid JOIN table5 e on b.makename = e.make and c.modelname = e.model and a.caryear = e.year WHERE a.carid = $carid; There are 2 issues that I need to solve - When there is no match on table 5, it does not return any results. It would seem that I need to do some sort of left join or split the query and do a union. When there is a match on table 5, it returns multiple rows. Since the criteria that would return a single row is not being used, I would settle for an average of citympg and hwympg. Can both objectives be achieved with a single query? How?
