Although the Golkar et al study stated, "did not alter our reported findings" (as quoted by Kodiologist), the notion that excluding 5 subjects did not change results is improbable. If those 5 had been included, the significance p-value would be increased, certainly. And, averages and other statistical numbers would differ. So, exclusions have an effect. I think, though, this is not in any way a scandal. As readers and reviewers and researchers, we need to understand how to interpret what we read. In cases involving exclusion, we might infer something like, "When this process is applicable, it succeeds...(insert reported results here.)"
