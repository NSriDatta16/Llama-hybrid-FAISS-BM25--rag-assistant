Go with static HTML. Every hour simply update a static HTML file with your output. You'll want to use an hourly cron to run a PHP script to fopen() and fwrite() to the file. There's no need to hit PHP to retrieve the page whatsoever. Simply make a .htaccess mod_rewrite redirection rule for that particular page to maintain your current URL naming. Although not very elegant, static HTML with gzip compression to me is more efficient and would use less bandwidth . An example of using cron to run a PHP script hourly: // run this command in your console to open the editor crontab -e Enter these values: 01 * * * * php -f /path/to/staticHtmlCreater.php > /dev/null The last portion ensures you will not have any output. This cron would run on the first minute of every hour. UPDATE Either I missed the section regarding your dynamic user profile information or it was added after my initial comment. If you are only using a single server , I would suggest you make a switch to APC which provides both opcode caching and a caching mechanism faster than memcached (for a single server application). If the user's profile data is below the fold (below the user's window view), you could potentially wait to make the AJAX request until the user scrolls down to a specified point. You can see this functionality used on the facebook status page.
