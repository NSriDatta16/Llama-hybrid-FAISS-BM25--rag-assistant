Short Time series Forecasting

I got a strange situation of working with a short time series. I want to predict number of cases of a particular procedure (Let's say Knee Surgery) that can be done in a hospital in a month. Less Sample size or data points because I have only 2 year data. Plotting the data showed me that the data doesn't have any trend, seasonality is not seen because I have few data points. Can any one suggest a best approach in this case.
