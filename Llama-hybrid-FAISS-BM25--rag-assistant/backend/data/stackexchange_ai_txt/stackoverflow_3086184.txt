Barplot visualising check boxes

I have to make a report of a survey where we have a question like this (all answers are checkboxes). What is you favorite cake(s) (please choose more than one): [] Tiramis√π [] Carrot Cake [] Cupcake Then the survey software exports into CSV like this: "username","likes_tiramisu","likes_carrotcake","likes_cupcake" "test01",1,1,1 "test02",0,1,1 "test03",0,1,0 "test04",0,0,1 I would like to make a barplot where every histogram represent the frequency of every cake. How can I combine a table like this: "likes_tiramisu" "likes_carrotcake" "likes_cupcake" 1 3 3 Could I just solve it with sum of all elements in each column? Is it conceptually valid?
