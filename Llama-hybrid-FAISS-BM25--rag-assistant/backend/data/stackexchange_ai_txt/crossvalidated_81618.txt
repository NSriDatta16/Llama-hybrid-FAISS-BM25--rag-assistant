How to apply Laplace rule of succession for any possible value in a range?

I am looking to have People rate certain items on a scale of 0-10 based on those items perceived utility to the particular Person performing the rating. Fractional values are permitted. Giving no rating on an item is also permitted; however, I prefer to rank "highly rated" items with more ratings higher than "highly rated" items with fewer ratings; so, I know I do not want to use the arithmetic mean. [Note: While this question may seem similar to one asked a few years back, the scenario is distinctly different in the fact that prior question limited ratings to 4 discrete values where this scenario does not involve discrete values.] I also want to take the ratings and come up with an average based on the Laplace rule of succession. However, the rule, as far as I can tell presumes discrete possible values, as opposed to the infinite choices in this particular case. Does a method exist for extending the rule to cover such a scenario?
