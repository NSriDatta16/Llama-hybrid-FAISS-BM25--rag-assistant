AS3 changing x value of a parent doesn't apply the x-change to its children?

So basicly I have a class which adds items and needs a drag and drop. I change the x value of the entire contianer class simply by this.x = something By drag and drop all the items slide across the screen. When I trace the x value of the container class it has changed, but the x value of the items stayed the same (although their x value on the screen definitely changed). Anyone have some tips on this one? Thanks!
