What does "gblinear" do in XGBoost?

For example, if I run a single round ( nrounds=1 ), how does XGBoost go about making predictions? I thought it would simply return a linear regression model, but I quickly shot that theory down by working out an example. Please note that I've already seen this and this and most of Google's top search results.
