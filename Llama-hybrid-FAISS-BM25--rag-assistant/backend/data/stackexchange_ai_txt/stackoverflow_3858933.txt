How do I query navigation properites using linq to sql and ef

I am trying to strongly type a query for 3 ef objects using linq to sql. There are one-to-many relationships with product and category. My classes contain navigation properties and look like this. public partial class Product { public int ID {get;set;} public string Name {get;set;} public virtual ICollection NpGroup {get;set;} } public partial class Category { public int ID {get;set;} public string Name {get;set;} public virtual ICollection NpGroup {get;set;} } public partial class Group { public int ID {get;set;} public int ProductID {get;set;} public int CategoryID {get;set;} public virtual Product NpProduct {get;set;} public virtual Category NpCategory {get;set;} } Trying to avoid the string based .Include(), how would I construct a query that returned a group equal to ProductID "1" but also included the names of the product and category? Something like: var context = ObjectContext.CurrentObjectContext; var query = from c in context.Group where c.ProductID == 1 //Include the names of the product and category of the group record (c.NpProduct.Name etc.) select c; I am probably missing the trees through the forest but I can not seem to get the syntax of ObjectContext.LoadProperty (if that is the right way to go). Any thoughts? Thanks.
