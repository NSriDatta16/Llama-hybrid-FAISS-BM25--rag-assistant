p and p+1 point to different places, as you rightly said sizeof(*p) units apart. You can't delete something that hasn't been allocated, but for example: A* p = new A(); p++; delete p-1; would delete the original allocation. Deleting p+1 when p+1 wasn't allocated originally is undefined; glib flips out with: *** glibc detected *** free(): invalid pointer: 0x0804b009 *** The implementation can't zero p+1 because p+1 isn't a variable to modify. The paragraph was saying that delete p; could be translated to free(p); p = 0; That doesn't make sense with p+1
