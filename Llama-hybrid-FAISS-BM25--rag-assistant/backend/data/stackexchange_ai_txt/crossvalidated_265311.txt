Actually a great starting point is the very detailed Wikipedia article on the Approximate Bayesian Computation plus the enormous number of references below it (many of them are available online). Check also the nice introductory blog entry by Rasmus Bååth and accompanying video and slides from UseR! 2015 conference . The Handbook of Approximate Bayesian Computation by Sisson, Fan and Beaumont is not yet available but it is ought to be published Chapman & Hall/CRC this year.
