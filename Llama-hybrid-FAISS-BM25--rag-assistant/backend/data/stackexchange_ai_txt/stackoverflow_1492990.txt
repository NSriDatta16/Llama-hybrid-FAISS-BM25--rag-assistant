Well, the linked document does say that localStorage is the same as globalStorage[location.hostname], with the exception of being scoped to an HTML5 origin (scheme + hostname + non-standard port) I don't want to claim that I understand 100% what that means, but the bit in brackets would suggest that the URL needs to have certain properties - in particular that the scheme and hostname are what Firefox considers an HTML 5 origin. I suspect that file:/// URLs don't match this, while your http://127.0.0.1/ does. edit : Looking at the W3C's description of the Origin property , step 7 looks like it might be causing the problem. Depending on how the localStorage handling is implemented, it may be expecting a 3-tuple as returned by step 12, but for a file:// URL the return value may be just about anything. So, er, I suppose it is by design. On reflection, chances are that this isn't really by design; there's no reason why localStorage shouldn't work for file:// URLs. It might just be a case of the output of one browser-specific implementation not matching the expectations of another. As for workarounds, would globalStorage not do what you want here?
