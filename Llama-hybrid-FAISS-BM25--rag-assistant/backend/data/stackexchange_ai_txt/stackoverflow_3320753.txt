How to group / compare similar news articles

In an app that i'm creating, I want to add functionality that groups news stories together. I want to group news stories about the same topic from different sources into the same group. For example, an article on XYZ from CNN and MSNBC would be in the same group. I am guessing its some sort of fuzzy logic comparison. How would I go about doing this from a technical standpoint? What are my options? We haven't even started the app yet, so we aren't limited in the technologies we can use. Thanks, in advance for the help!
