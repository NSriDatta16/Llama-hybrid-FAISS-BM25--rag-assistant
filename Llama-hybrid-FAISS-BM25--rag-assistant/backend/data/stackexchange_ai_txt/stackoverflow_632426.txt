I would replace all the date references with DateTime.ParseExact and Currency references with moneyDouble.ToString("c") . //I would use ParseExact over Parse when dealing with global date conversions DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact(date, format, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); Double money = 100.00; money.ToString("c"); There is obviously more elegant solutions but if you are looking for something quick and low impact..... Extra Reading about System.Globalization should give you some extra info if needed.
