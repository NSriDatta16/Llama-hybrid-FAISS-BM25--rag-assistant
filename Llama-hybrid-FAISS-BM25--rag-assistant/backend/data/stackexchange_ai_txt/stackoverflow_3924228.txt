const gives the compiler a clue that the item should not be changed and if the code attempts it then the compiler can flag an error. the function name is mentioned before the actual declaration the main() function needs to reference it before the compiler has actually come to compile it (as it later on in the code file). You can move the whole function before the main() to avoid this. double averageN(double decimals[arraySize]) is saying this function takes an array. It doesn't say that it create the array. If you look in the function, it takes the array, and adds calculated values into it ( decimals[i] = (0+(rand()%10)) ). This function also calculates an average over the array and returns that as a double. So to answer your big question what's wrong - read the last point and look at the call you are making - averageN(); - can you see how this is not the correct call?
