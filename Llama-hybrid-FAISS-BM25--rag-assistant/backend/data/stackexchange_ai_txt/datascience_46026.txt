Since you mention the neural networks ... Input weights in neural networks Giving more weight to some inputs in a neural network could be easily done by multiplying the input with some weights you predefine. Example in TF: (assuming inputs are arrays of numbers of size 3): input = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1, 3)) weights = tf.constant([2, 1, 3], dtype=tf.float32) # weights for input weighted_input = tf.multiply(input, weights) ... rest ot the network ... But, as others already mentioned, you should be careful with playing with weighted inputs in machine learning algorithms, in this case neural network, since those things should be learned by the model.
