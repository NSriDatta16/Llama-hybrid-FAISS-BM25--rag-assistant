Dependent variable standardization in neural networks

I am using a multilayer perceptron model to predict urban temperatures. I have standardized the independent variables before training the model. However, I have not standardized the dependent variable. I chose to do this in order to maintain the overall interpretability of the model results, however I am not sure if this is the way to do it or numerically I am making a mistake. What is recommended in your opinion?
