What's the best way to identify which nonparametric groups have the greatest impact on sales?

I am conducting a survey to improve our understanding of how to improve how we target certain groups of customers and want to identify which factor(s) most likely account for the sales (Total Sales Value, Frequency of Purchase, Units per Transaction, Average Price paid, etc.). I am expecting a sample of around 2,000 responses. Characteristics we are collecting include Age Range, Gender, Income Range, Education Level, Marital Status, Type of Job, and aspects such as Satisfaction (Likert Scale) with our products. I therefore have multiple groups of binary, ordinal, and categorical data to compare with the sales. Samples within each group are likely to be normally distributed, but the sample size is likely to be different (e.g. 18 to 23 vs. 24 to 30, or with differing sample sizes by income bracket). I am currently considering Kruskal-Wallis approach but am not sure whether this would help me find the answer Im looking for. I initially want to identify which characteristic most strongly correlates to the sales and then subsequently conduct further analysis to identify which specific group of customers within that category account for the sales. I don't have access to SPSS so I am limited to what can be achieved through Excel or StatPlus. I would sincerely appreciate some constructive advice. Thank you.
