Random forest and LASSO regression both give different variable importances

I have a dataset with 163 observations (all countries in the world with population > 1000000) and 290 variables related to their disease burden and performance. Because there are more variables than observations I cannot run a standard linear regression. Therefore I tried both a random forest and a LASSO regression. Both give different variables importances. Which one is the most reliable in this case?
