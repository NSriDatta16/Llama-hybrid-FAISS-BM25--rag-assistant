Check out Alloy Framework - It's a new PHP 5.3+ Hierarchal MVC Framework that works a little differently than most other MVC frameworks. The main differences to other framework projects are primarily: Modular Organization - single folder for a group of controllers/views/entities that are created for the same structure - "blog" or "events", etc. HMVC (Hierarchal MVC) - Allows module sub-dispatches anywhere within views or controllers - extremely useful for "wiget" type structures within layouts or nested views. Helps promote code re-use for common structures like "comments", "tags", "ratings", etc. More explicitness - view objects are explicitly retuned by the controller method for display instead of implicitly loaded, etc. Read more on the Architecture page of the manual. The URL Router is also very nice and borrows a lot of concepts from Merb and Rails.
