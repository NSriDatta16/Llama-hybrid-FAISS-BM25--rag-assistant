Reproducing comments as an answer: From Alex R.: For starters, using AUC (ranking-based) loss functions results in a non-convex optimization, with plenty of local maxima. Usually people re-transform the loss function with a surrogate that is convex. See here for example: On the Consistency of AUC Pairwise Optimization Wei Gao and Zhi-Hua Zhou From not_bonferroni: For another thing, the optimum wouldn't be unique. All that would matter is the rank ordering. For example, estimating logistic regression coefficients, a logit probability of $.01+.01x$ would produce the same AUC as $1000+1000x$. With a single predictor, all that would be identified is the sign of the coefficient. With multiple predictors, their sizes relative to each other might be identified, but there would be no unique solution
