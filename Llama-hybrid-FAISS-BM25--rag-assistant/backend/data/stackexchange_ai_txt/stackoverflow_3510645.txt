The URLs contain ampersands, which should be encoded as &amp; when not used for declaring entities. The parser assumes &autoload will start a new entitiy but it is never terminated with a semicolon. For working with the HTML, consider loading the fragment with loadHTML() ; and disable errors for that part: libxml_use_internal_errors(TRUE); $doc = new DOMDocument(); $doc->loadHTML($string); libxml_clear_errors(); echo $doc->saveHTML(); The above would work with loadXML too.
