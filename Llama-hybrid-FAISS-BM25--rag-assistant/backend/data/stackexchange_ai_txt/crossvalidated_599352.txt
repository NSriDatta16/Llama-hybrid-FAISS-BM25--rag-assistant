Even in linear regression, such an $R^2$ value can be totally fine, so I would not immediately dismiss your logistic regression model due to poor performance. I kind of like $R^2$ -style measures, but a big drawback that I see to them is viewing them like grades in school, where $0.5$ is an $F$ -grade that makes us sad while $0.9$ is an $A$ -grade that makes us happy, even through, for some problems, $0.4$ is outstanding performance, while $0.9$ could be rather pedestrian performance for other problems. Your performance is what it is. It is worse than a model that achieves $0.3$ and better than a model that achieves $0.1$ . If it does something useful for you, that seems like a win. If your model is not useful, perhaps because competing models have achieved superior $R^2_{McFadden}$ , then your performance is not good enough.
