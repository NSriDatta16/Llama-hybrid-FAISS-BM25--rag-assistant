I presume this is the issue where you have k samples size n of a population that are all random with a given mean m and sample unbiassed variance s^2. As you do not have the real population mean, NOR the population variance that is used in all the textbooks, you have to find a means to not only calculate this population mean (rather easy), but also have a good estimator of the population variance. I did not find a description how to do this in the HANDBOOK OF PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL PROCEDURES (2000 pages, really quite complete) and that leaves us two ways. Theory (approach each sample of the same parameter as RANDOM and thus state the population is a sum of the INDEPENDENT samples with a weight 1/k of each, giving you a resulting population variance if you pull another sample size n. Then multiply that population variance with n to obtain the population variance when pulling single size samples). Another way is to pragmatically create a program that simulates your population (does not have to be exact) to calculate variances of many sample sizes using your guessed formula and then see what method is actually (after 1000 repetitions, computers are patient) most robust. I propose you use the theoretical approach.
