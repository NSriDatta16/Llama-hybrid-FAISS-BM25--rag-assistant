Another solution (instead of overriding UIView and - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event ) could be the usage of UIGestureRecognizer. UIGestureRecognizers are very powerful and worth a look anyway. In this case you don't have to deal with inheritance, but can add it to any view. - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { if ((self = [super initWithFrame:frame])) { tapRecognizer = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(tapGestureDetected:)]; [self addGestureRecognizer:tapRecognizer]; } return self; } - (void) tapGestureDetected:(UITapGestureRecognizer*)recognizer { int numberOfTapAreas = [self.delegate numberOfTabAreas]; CGPoint p= [tapRecognizer locationInView:recognizer.view]; //... }
