I can't answer your question about the best way to organize your layers, but I can try to answer your question about how best to emulate partial classes. Here are a few thoughts: The first thing that springs to mind is inheritance. It's not necessarily the best solution always, but you may not have a choice since you may need to be able to have your objects be able to be treated like the base class. Composition is also a good choice (that is, wrapping the class in another class). This gives you a little bit nicer decoupling from your DAL, but can be tedious to implement. If you really just need to add a method or two onto an existing class, you might also consider using an extension method , but these can quickly create spaghetti code if you use them too much.
