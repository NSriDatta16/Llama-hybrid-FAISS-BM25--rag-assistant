Principal component analysis (PCA) is one popular approach analyzing variance when you are dealing with multivariate data. You have random variables X1, X2,...Xn which are all correlated (positively or negatively) to varying degrees, and you want to get a better understanding of what's going on. PCA can help. What PCA gives you is a change of variable into Y1, Y2,..., Yn (i.e. the same number of variables) which are linear combinations of the Xs. For example, you might have Y1 = 2.1 X1 - 1.76 X2 + 0.2 X3... The Ys the nice property that each of these have zero correlation with each other. Better still, you get them in decreasing order of variance. So, Y1 "explains" a big chunk of the variance of the original variables, Y2 a bit less and so on. Usually after the first few Ys, the variables become somewhat meaningless. The PCA score for any of the Xi is just it's coefficient in each of the Ys. In my earlier example, the score for X2 in the first principal component (Y1) is 1.76. The way PCA does this magic is by computing eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. To give a concrete example, imagine X1,...X10 are changes in 1 year, 2 year, ..., 10 year Treasury bond yields over some time period. When you compute PCA you generally find that the first component has scores for each bond of the same sign and about the same sign. This tells you that most of the variance in bond yields comes from everything moving the same way: "parallel shifts" up or down. The second component typically shows "steepening" and "flattening" of the curve and has opposite signs for X1 and X10.
