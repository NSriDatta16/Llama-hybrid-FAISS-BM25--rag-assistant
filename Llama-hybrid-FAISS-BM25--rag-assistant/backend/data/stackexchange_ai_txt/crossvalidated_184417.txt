Confidence intervals can be used equivalently to hypothesis tests, but highest density intervals are not the same as confidence intervals. Let's start with what $p$-value is by quoting Cohen (1994) What we want to know is "Given this data what is the probability that $H_0$ is true?" But as most of us know, what it $p$-value tells us is "Given that $H_0$ is true, what is the probability of this (or more extreme) data?" These are not the same (...) So $p$-value tells us what is the $P(D|H_0)$. In Bayesian approach we want to learn directly (rather than indirectly) about probability of some parameter given the data that we have $P(\theta|D)$ by employing the Bayes theorem and using priors for $\theta$ $$ \underbrace{P(\theta|D)}_\text{posterior} \propto \underbrace{P(D|\theta)}_\text{likelihood} \times \underbrace{P(\theta)}_\text{prior} $$ So if 95% confidence interval does not include the null value(s), than you can reject your null hypothesis: your data is more extreme than you would expect given your hypothesis. On the other hand, if in Bayesian setting your 95% highest density interval does not include null value(s), than you can conclude that probability of observing such value(s) is less than 95%. Kruschke (2010) can be quoted for comparison of both approaches The primary goal of NHST [Null Hypothesis Significance Testing] is determining whether a particular "null" value of a parameter can be rejected. One can also ask what range of parameter values would not be rejected. This range of non-rejectable parameter values is called the confidence interval. (...) The confidence interval tells us something about the probability of extreme unobserved data values that we might have gotten if we repeated the experiment (...) A concept in Bayesian inference, that is somewhat analogous to the NHST confidence interval, is the highest density interval (HDI), (...) The 95% HDI consists of those values of $\theta$ that have at least some minimal level of posterior believability, such that the total probability of all such $\theta$ values is 95%. (...) The NHST confidence interval, on the other hand, has no direct relationship with what we want to know; there's no clear relationship between the probability of rejecting the value $\theta$ and the believability of $\theta$. Posterior probability can be used and is used for testing hypothesis, but you have to remember that it provides answer for a different question than $p$-values.
