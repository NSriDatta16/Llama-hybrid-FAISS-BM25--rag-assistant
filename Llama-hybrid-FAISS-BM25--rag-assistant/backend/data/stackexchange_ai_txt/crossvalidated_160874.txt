How to calculate accuracy of PCA?

I want to compare different methods such as SVM and PCA to classify the data correctly. But I don't know how to calculate accuracy of PCA in R. Following the article "Genetic classification of populations using supervised learning" (2011), I want to classify different populations using machine learning and PCA. For SVM, I calculate accuracy with confusionmatrix(table,test[,1]) . But for PCA I have a problem.
