Ordinal versus binary data testing for significance

We have an independent ordinal variable which may or may not explain a dependent binary target. We would like to know if this effect is significant, for example linearly. Doing a logistic regression and testing the parameter for a significant difference from 0 makes sense. Someone proposed to compute the observed probabilities per ordinal group and do a linear regression or correlation test over this. I feel like this is wrong but I can't properly articulate why. I feel like you throw away a lot of information, mostly about sample size. What are other reasons why you shouldn't do this?
