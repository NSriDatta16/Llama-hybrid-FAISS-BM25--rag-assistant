The ideal way to get the related sentences would be to try to get a sentence vector for the sentences you want to categorise and then compare the vectors of your predefined keywords with the obtained sentence vectors . You can get the sentence vectors by just averaging the word vectors of the words present in the sentences . Once the sentence vectors are obtained , you can use cosine similarity to compare the keyword vectors and the sentence vectors . The one with the max cosine similarity will give you the result .
