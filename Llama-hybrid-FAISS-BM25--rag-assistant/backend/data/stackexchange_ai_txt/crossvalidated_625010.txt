Is it acceptable to take the mean of a bunch of median values?

I use a Bayesian latent variable model to construct a time series cross-sectional measure of corruption for all countries in the world from 1960 to 2010. For each country-year observation, I obtain a latent estimate $\theta$ . To illustrate, here is the code for the model: # run the Stan model mod.dyn Next, I calculate the median values for each column in the out$thetas object and then adding those median values as a new column named dyn.estimates to the data frame df. out I want to plot the average level of corruption for each year over time. To do so, I group the observations by year, and then calculate the average of dyn.estimates for that year. Here is my question. Is this mathematically/analytically defensible? That is, is it fine to take the mean of what are median values? Thanks.
