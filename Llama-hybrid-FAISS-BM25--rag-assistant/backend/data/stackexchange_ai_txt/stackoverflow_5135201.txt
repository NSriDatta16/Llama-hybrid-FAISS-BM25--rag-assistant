Java: Protect Trial/Demo Period

I searched, and only found a couple([ 1 ][ 2 ]) of answers here. None of them really answer my question though. My application will have a thirty day trial period. What's the best way to protect the program? I'm not worried about crackers, just Joe Average reinstalling the program. Setting back the clock isn't really a concern either.
