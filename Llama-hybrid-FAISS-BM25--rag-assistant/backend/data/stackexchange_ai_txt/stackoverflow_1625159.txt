Need advice on creating a new ASP.NET application

I am creating a new ASP.NET application that is heavy on UI. I am leaning towards the Web form model over MVC as I am very familar with it. I have a few questions The UI lets users do tasks such as reorder table rows, do drag and drop, interact with images etc and the changes are saved to the database without clicking on the "Save" button. I understand this can be done using AJAX. What architecture needs to be used (JQuery with a WS call? ASP.NET AJAX?). Is implementing this kind of functionality complex and time consuming? Is there any value in using a 3rd party toolkit such as Telerik or go with the native ASP.NET Ajax control toolkit? I want to have the same look and feel as other Web 2.0 applications out there. Are there any design templates that could give me a headstart? Any help is really appreciated. EDIT Can you also throw some light on the architecture of a AJAX ASP.NET application? I have always worked with apps where the business logic and the data layer were separate projects. It appears that a AJAX app tends to use a web service. Does this mean that BL and the DAL are now webservices? Can I use static page methods if i want to avoid a web service?**
