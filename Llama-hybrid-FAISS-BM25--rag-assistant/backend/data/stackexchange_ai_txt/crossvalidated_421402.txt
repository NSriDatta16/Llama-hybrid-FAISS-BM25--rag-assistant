I don't think kappa is the route to go here, because that requires calculation over multiple "ratees" (here drivers). For each particular driver, the agreement can be either a) One of two things or b) One of three things or c) One of four things, depending on what your interest is: A. One of two things - agree or disagree. Then you could use this as the dependent variable and use logistic regression. B. One of three things - both pass, both fail, disagree. Then you would use multinomial logistic or maybe ordinal logistic. C. One of four things - both pass, both fail, A pass B fail, A fail B pass. Here you would use multinomial logistics. For each driver you would have the DV (one of the three just described) and whatever IVs you wanted. Of course, if you have multiple pairs of examiners, things get more complicated.
