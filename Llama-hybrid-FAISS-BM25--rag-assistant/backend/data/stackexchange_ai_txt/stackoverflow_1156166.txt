In case anyone comes across this question again, I've found a solution: The trick is to use Mechanize , and a series of calls to Browser.submit() on the appropriate pages. The one hangup that others might also encounter is that ASP.NET pages (the biggest source of postback-based navigation, in my experience) also need a hidden parameter called __EVENTTARGET in the form, which won't exist when you use mechanize. The __doPostBack('foo') function on these pages gives the relevant value to __EVENTTARGET via a javascript onclick event on each of the links, but since mechanize doesn't use javascript you'll need to set these values yourself. I made up a quick little utility function to use within my scripts that does this: def add_event_target(form, target): #Creates a new __EVENTTARGET control and adds the value specified #.NET doesn't generate this in mechanize for some reason -- suspect maybe is #normally generated by javascript or some useragent thing? form.new_control('hidden','__EVENTTARGET',attrs = dict(name='__EVENTTARGET')) form.set_all_readonly(False) form["__EVENTTARGET"] = target I hope this is helpful for anyone who maybe comes across this question later.
