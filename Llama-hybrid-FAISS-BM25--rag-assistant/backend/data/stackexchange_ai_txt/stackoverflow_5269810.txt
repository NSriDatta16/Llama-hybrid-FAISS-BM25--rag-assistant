Explicitly set MySQL table storage engine using South and Django

I'm running into an issue that South creates the DB table for a new model as INNODB when I migrate but creates the table as MYISAM when another developer runs their own migration. The problem with this is that all my other tables are MYISAM so using the new tables leads to many foreign key constraint errors. How can I explicitly make sure the table is created using MYISAM? What could be causing the table to be created using a different storage engine in different environments?
