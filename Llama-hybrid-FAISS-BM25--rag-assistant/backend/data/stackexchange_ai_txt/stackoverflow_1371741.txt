You're treating frag_list as a linked list of Frag pointers, but you aren't putting in a terminator when you create the list. Try this: int main () { Fragment *frags = (Fragment *) malloc (10 * sizeof (Fragment)); int i, j; for (i = 0; i frag_list = (Frag *) malloc (1 * sizeof (Frag)); Frag *frag = fragment->frag_list; frag->seq = malloc (5 * sizeof (char)); strcpy (frag->seq, "55555"); frag->next = (Frag *) malloc (1 * sizeof (Frag)); frag = frag->next; frag->seq = malloc (5 * sizeof (char)); strcpy (frag->seq, "55555"); frag->next = NULL; // The issue is that when you malloc() a new block of memory, the compiler and/or the OS might null it out for you, but more likely it will just give you garbage. When you try to free() that garbage, you get a crash.
