Thanks kangax for your time and your extensive explanation! Sadly i could not get it working this way(it works for the alertbox though) But it led me to the idea to use a proxy-class. It's not the most elegant way because i have to provide every function from my object i want to use but it works AND it doesn't involve eval()! function proxy(obj) { this.obj = obj; this.Initialize = function(a, b) { return obj.Initialize(a, b); } } function test_it() { var myMaster = new proxy(window.document["Master"]); var ret = myMaster["Initialize"].apply(myMaster, [1, "VC2"]); alert(ret); } Again, thanks for your time!
