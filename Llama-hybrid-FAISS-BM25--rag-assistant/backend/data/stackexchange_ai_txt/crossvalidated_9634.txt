Imagine that you want to know the average height of men on earth. This average height exists but obviously you will never be able to know it (unless you're able to measure several millions men...). What you can do is measure hundreds or thousands of people and calculate the average height of these people. The average height among these people is probably not exactly equal to the average height of men on earth (because they are particular men in the whole population) but, if you did a good job (use a representative sample of the population), it should be close enough. The difference between the quantity that you want to know (average height of men on earth) and its estimation through your sample (average height of men in the sample) is the sampling error.
