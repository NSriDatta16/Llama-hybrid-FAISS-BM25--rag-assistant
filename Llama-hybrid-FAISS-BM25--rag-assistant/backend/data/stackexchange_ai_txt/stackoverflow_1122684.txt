My research eventually led to these packages: * StockChartX WPF o http://www.freedownloadscenter.com/Programming/Misc__Programming_Tools/Stock_Chart_X_Financial_Chart_Component.html o Rating: B. o Pros: + Very powerful + Nice looking + Has a WPF version, see http://www.modulusfe.com/stockchartxwpf/ + Real-time automatic technical analysis updating o Cons:No scroll with the mouse (for non-WPF version, WPF version has mouse scrolling) o Cost: US$350 (AciveX) to US$529 (WPF) o Notes: StockChartX uses a function named AppendValue (series name, date, value). You actually "push" data into StockChartX, so it does not matter where the data is coming from, be it a database, text file, XML file, or real time tick-by-tick data - it all goes into StockChartX the same way, simple, quick, and easy! * Dundas o Pros: o Video demonstration on charting (4 videos): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaDHjUTri7c * NetAdvantage o Pros: + incredibly powerful + supports financial charts including, Gantt and radar charts o Cost: >US$700 o Video demonstration: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW7pBNF51Mo o Video overview: http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/video/0,297151,sid92_gci1356440,00.html o Video tutorial on samples: http://www.infragistics.com/videos/get-started/intro-to-samples.aspx o Video tutorial on charting: http://www.infragistics.com/FullMovie.aspx?id=3476 * AnyChart o Supports financial charts o US$500 o For OHLC chart tutorial, see http://anychart.com/products/anychart/docs/users-guide/index.html?Chart-Types.html * Financial Charting Component (for .NET 2.0) v1.0 o NumeralTechnology o http://www.numeraltechnology.com/shop/ o Rating: C o Cost: US$350 o Gallery: see http://www.numeraltechnology.com/shop/custom.aspx?recid=14 * TeeChart .NET o http://www.steema.com/ordering/order_tchnet_n.shtml o Rating: Yet to try. o Cost: US$700 o http://demos.telerik.com/wpf/ * RadControls for WPF o Rating: A o Pros: very nice, does everything we want o Cost: US$999 * Chart Control .NET o http://www.chartcontrol.net/Chart_gal.htm * NextWave Chart for WPF o http://www.nextwavesoft.com/products/nextwave-chart-for-wpf * Barchart WPF o http://www.syncfusion.com o Cons: doesnt seem to be specialized for financial functions * DevExpress o http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Controls/Charting/screenshot_gallery.xml o Pros: design wizard that allows you to customize charts with the greatest of ease with onscreen design, see: + http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Controls/Charting/design.xml o Cons: + None. o Cost: + $249 for an individual component, or $1999 for the full enterprise version * Super Graph Library o http://www.supergraphlibrary.com/ Update: http://www.componentart.com/products/dv/
