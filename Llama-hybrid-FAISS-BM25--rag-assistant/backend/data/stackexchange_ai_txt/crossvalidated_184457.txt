Indeed, it breaks the 'time series' aspect. Maybe your time series are more or less random walks? In my opinion, 6 time points is too few... Besides bootstrapping, you can define your own perturbations based on your expertise of the time series. For instance, in finance you can study "multiscale" perturbations (but 6 points is too few for that). You can have a look at this paper for some perturbation ideas. Actually, you can try to play with your "features" vector (or the population) instead of the 'time'.
