File size limit for SQLite on 32bit system

I'm using sqlite as temporary storage to calculate statistic about moderately large data set. I'm wondering what will happen if my database exceed 2GB on 32 bit system. (I can't currently change the system to 64 bit) Does it use memory mapped files and break if size of file exceed addressable memory? (like mongodb)
