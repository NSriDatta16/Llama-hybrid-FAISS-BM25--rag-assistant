There are two solutions. As we know JBoss uses Tomcat under the hood as a servlet container. You can enable invoker servlet, that would save you from mapping the whole lot in web.xml. But beware, it will be naive to do that, and not at all encouraged . Secondly, you can write another servlet/filter and map just that in your web.xml for every url pattern, may be. Then that new servlet of your can forward the requests to whatever servlet it should. I hope you get my point.
