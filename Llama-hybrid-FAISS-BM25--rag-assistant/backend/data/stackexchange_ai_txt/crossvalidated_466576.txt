how to model price elasticity

I'm trying to model price elasticity based on price changes and I'm wondering what is the best way to do it. My data is at at the individual customer level and there's a 0/1 indicator for whether they purchased or not purchased. The price changes that I'm referring to occurs at different times and different amount depending on state (i,e TX had a 5% rate increase in June, but Washington may have had a 9% decrease in April). If I do a logistic regression of Buy/notBuy ~ price change + variable1 + variable2 +.....variableN, is my coefficient for price change what I would use as my 'elasticity'? Since it's logodds, how do I convert that to an elasticity level? Since there's different price changes at different time and at different amount, is it better to model at different price change buckets? appreciate any pointers on how to start.
