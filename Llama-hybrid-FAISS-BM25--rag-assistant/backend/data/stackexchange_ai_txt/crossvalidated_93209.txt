What is the different between those kernel? There are several differences. The linear kernel, for example, effectively works in input space while the others do not. The sigmoid kernel should be avoided for numerical reasons (it is basically inherited from neural networks). We need to find the linear separable line / hyperplane to classify our data. And to do that, we have to chose large margin to avoid any overfitting? What is overfitting? Overfitting means your model is fitting noise in the data instead of the underlying process. Such models have poor generalization performance (e.g. on unseen data). This is symptomized by high training accuracy but low test accuracy. As u can see in this image, there is a w. And in many reference, they said w is a line? $\mathbf{w}$ is the separating hyperplane in feature space. And what is that lamda?? You forgot to show an equation, so it's impossible to answer this as $\lambda$ can be used to signify a variety of things. What is SMO mean in SVM? Sequential Minimal Optimization. It is one of the common methods to efficiently solve the optimization problem associated to training SVMs.
