This is probably a social problem rather than a technological one. Firstly, do you want unit tests that result in 100% code coverage, or can you settle for less, and trust your developers to put in unit tests where they really matter, and where they make sense. You could probably get some kind of system in place that would do code coverage tests to ensure that unit tests cover a certain percentage of code. But then there would still be ways to game the system. And it still wouldn't result in code that was bug free. Due to things like the halting problem, it's impossible to cover ever path in the code.
