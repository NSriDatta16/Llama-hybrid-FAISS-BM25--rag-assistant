Turns out the issue is a problem with slash directions in the settings.py file. Usually, I create a relative_path() function in my settings.py file so I can easily set: MEDIA_ROOT = absolute_path('media') The version of Satchmo I was using encouraged the use of a DIRNAME setting instead: DIRNAME = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__).decode('utf-8') The issue was, using this technique, my MEDIA_ROOT was being set as such: MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(DIRNAME, 'media') But this was using the Windows backslashes instead of the Unix forward slashes. I've resolve it with: MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(DIRNAME, 'media').replace('\\', '/')
