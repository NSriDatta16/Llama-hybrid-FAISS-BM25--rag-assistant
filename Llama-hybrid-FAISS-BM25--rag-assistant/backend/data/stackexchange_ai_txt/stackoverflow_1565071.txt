Use a cryptographic algorithm like AES to encrypt the data you store in NSUserDefaults. Keeping the encryption key embedded in your app, either hard-coded or computed using a succession of operations over multiple elements would successfully deter any editing initiative over the values you store. To make things easier, you should write a wrapper method that takes a clear-text key and value, encrypts them, and then stores them in NSUserDefaults for you, and, of course, does the same thing in reverse when reading the values back. Do note, however, that this will be slower than insecure storage, taking into account the time to encrypt/decrypt, so consider applying the technique only to the most sensitive configuration options of your app.
