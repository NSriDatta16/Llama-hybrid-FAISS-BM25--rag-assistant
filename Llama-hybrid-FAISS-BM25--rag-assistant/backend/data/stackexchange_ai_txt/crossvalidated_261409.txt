Why linear regression has assumption on residual but generalized linear model has assumptions on response?

Why linear regression and Generalized Model have inconsistent assumptions? In linear regression, we assume residual comes form Gaussian In other regression (logistic regression, poison regression), we assume response comes form some distribution (binomial, poission etc.). Why sometimes assume residual and other time assume on response? Is is because we want to derive different properties? EDIT: I think mark999's shows two forms are equal. However, I do have one additional doubts on i.i.d: My other quesiton, Is there i.i.d. assumption on logistic regression? shows generalized linear model does not have i.i.d assumption (independent but not identical) Is that true that for linear regression, if we pose assumption on residual , we will have i.i.d, but if we pose assumption on response , we will have independent but not identical samples (different Gaussian with different $\mu$)?
