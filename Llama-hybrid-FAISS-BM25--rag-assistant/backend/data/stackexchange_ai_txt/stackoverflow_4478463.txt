You could use DataMapper. After writing Rails apps and tools for over a year I would - strongly - recommend using ActiveRecord. Even if you only ever use Model.find_by_sql("error prone hand written sql using fields that may change over time") instead of Model.find_by_last_name("Smith") Many smart people have spent many hours working on ActiveRecord and ARL. I beg that you leverage their work.
