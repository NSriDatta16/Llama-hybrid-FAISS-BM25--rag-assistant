How to decide on the correct number of clusters?

We find the cluster centers and assign points to k different cluster bins in k-means clustering which is a very well known algorithm and is found almost in every machine learning package on the net. But the missing and most important part in my opinion is the choice of a correct k. What is the best value for it? And, what is meant by best ? I use MATLAB for scientific computing where looking at silhouette plots is given as a way to decide on k discussed here . However, I would be more interested in Bayesian approaches. Any suggestions are appreciated.
