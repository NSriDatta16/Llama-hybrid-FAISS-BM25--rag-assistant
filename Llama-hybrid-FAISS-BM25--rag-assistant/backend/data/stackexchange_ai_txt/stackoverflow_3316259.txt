Jquery, getting DIV ID as it is being dragged using "draggable"?

I found another post about this but the solution there isn't working for me... I am trying this (having already instantiated the draggable option separately: $( ".masker" ).bind( "drag", function(event, ui) { testdragging = ui.draggable.attr('id') ; }); Just calling this: ui.draggable.attr('id') ; makes the entire class of DIV not draggable, if I simply remove this then it works fine, just can't figure this out, any advice is appreciated.
