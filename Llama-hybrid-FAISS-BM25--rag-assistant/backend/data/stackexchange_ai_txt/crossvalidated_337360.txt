In weakly supervised learning for object detection and localization, how does the neural network associate a particular object with its label?

I understand how an object detection algorithm (in particular neural nets) can localize one object. The question is how they can associate a particular object with a particular label when there are multiple objects in an image? Some related publications: Is object localization for free? Learning deep features for discriminative localization
