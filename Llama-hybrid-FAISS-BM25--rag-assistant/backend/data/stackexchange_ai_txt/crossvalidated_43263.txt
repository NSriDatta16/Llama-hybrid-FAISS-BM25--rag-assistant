I think the main advantage to modeling the arrival distribution as Poisson is the memory-less property. It greatly simplifies the subsequent calculations to be able to assume that the number of arrivals in a particular time interval depends only on the length of the interval, rather than when the interval occurs, how many people came before, etc. Of course, this assumption is not always appropriate. For example, modeling the number of patients arriving to a doctor's office for routine checkups could be considered memory-less, since it would tend to average out to a constant rate over a long period of time. On the other hand, this assumption would likely be inappropriate for modeling the arrival rate of patients to an emergency room, since this would be more likely to follow a boom-and-bust pattern.
