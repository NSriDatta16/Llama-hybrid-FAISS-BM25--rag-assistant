Find an element in DataTemplate applied to TabItem

I got a problem trying to find an element declared in DataTemplate, that after was applied like a ContentTemplate to TabItem object. I saw that there is already some solutions in regard of this problem, but no one of them actually works in my case, and I would like to understand why (obviously I make mistake in some place) Here is a sample code: This code is porgrammatically applied to the given TabItem object in following way : this.ContentTemplate = FindResource("TabItemDataTemplate") as DataTemplate; After I need access to the ListView element declared in DataTemplate, so I execute the codes found around in internet, and also on this site. Here is a short example: /* Getting the ContentPresenter of myListBoxItem*/ ContentPresenter myContentPresenter = FindVisualChild (this); // this.GetVisualChild(0) /* Finding textBlock from the DataTemplate that is set on that ContentPresenter*/ DataTemplate myDataTemplate = myContentPresenter.ContentTemplate; ListView repoListView = (ListView)myDataTemplate.FindName("repoView", myContentPresenter); Problem1: In this case ContentTemplate of ContentPresenter is Null, so code execution crashes. Prolem2: Ok, I think, may be I need to navigate throw TabItem content directly, so the code becomes, more or less: /* Getting the ContentPresenter of myListBoxItem*/ ContentPresenter myContentPresenter = FindVisualChild (this); // this.GetVisualChild(0) /* Finding textBlock from the DataTemplate that is set on that ContentPresenter*/ DataTemplate myDataTemplate = this.ContentTemplate; ListView repoListView = (ListView)myDataTemplate.FindName("repoView", myContentPresenter); this is TabItem object. But the strage things, that the ContentTemplate of this is completely different from that one assigned above. I'm sure that I missed something somewhere, can you help me to figure out the problem ? Thank you.
