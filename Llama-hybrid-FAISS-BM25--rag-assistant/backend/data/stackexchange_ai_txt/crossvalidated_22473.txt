Determining the right method to compare observed versus measured data

I'm trying to solve this problem out loud. I'm not great at statistics but I try sometimes to understand where things are and where they're going. I'm trying to figure out the best method to compare the two following datasets. The first is the actual observation and the second is of what my sensor determined the value was. Basically an object travels across the sensor that with properties. Each object can have anywhere from 2 to 5 components. We know the exact value of each one of those components. The big table below shows the data results from running those objects on the sensor. Observations are independent so observation 5 has no affect on observation 26. The dataset has 31 objects in it, and each object was measure using the sensor. We know the exact properties of the object and I put it under "Actual" Note: Total = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 All what I'm trying to figure out is if the sensor was adequate or does it need further calibration? The old way of doing things was to get an average difference less than 5% to be acceptable. I don't agree with that methodology as I believe it's prone to error and does not capture the essence of measurements. So therefore, I'm investigating better data analysis tools for the problem. Hypotheses: "Is the sensor performing adequately?" Is there an overall statistical difference between Actual and Sensor values? Is there a statistical difference between each observed pair? At which point is the significance broken? i.e. at which confidence interval do the two datasets become different? Analysis: The first thing I did was to compare the average differences for each column. I also did the mean of the absolute differences and here are the results: Difference between Actual and Sensor (%) Total 1 2 3 4 5 Mean of Diff 1.06 2.80 -4.00 7.12 -10.86 17.01 Mean of abs diff 7.31 6.96 7.56 8.52 0.70 1.10 These numbers don't tell me much really but they show somewhat of a relevant comparison. I then proceeded to do a two paired t-test using alpha = 0.05 with the following results: df Mean Actual Mean Sensor Var Actual Var Sensor pearson t stat P 1 tail t Crit 1 tail P 2 tail t Crit 2 tail Total 30 37,858 89,829,589 89,829,589 77,766,451 0.9463 1.4871 0.0737 1.6973 0.1474 2.0423 1 30 5,411.61 5,261 254,000 407,118 0.7829 2.1076 0.0218 1.6973 0.0435 2.0423 2 30 15,246 15,719 4,762,169 3,878,279 0.7845 -1.9103 0.0328 1.6973 0.0657 2.0423 3 27 17,943 15,396 40,196,438 33,216,653 0.4268 2.0742 0.0239 1.7033 0.0477 2.0518 4 1 6,770.00 7,600 14,257,800 20,480,000 1.0000 -1.5661 0.1809 6.3138 0.3618 12.7062 5 1 5,910.00 4,900 64,800 0.00 N/A 5.6108 0.0561 6.3138 0.1123 12.7062 I basically concluded that the means are not significantly different for "Total", "", "4", and "5". Am I correct on the analysis? I then did an F test analysis for two means to compare those results. Note that I wasn't sure if I needed to do the F-test but I did it to compare the variance. I concluded that according to the F test, it appears that my variance is high on all accounts that the results are statistically significant.
