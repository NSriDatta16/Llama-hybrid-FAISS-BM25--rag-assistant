I think it is easiest to think of $\delta$ as the time change in employment rate for the capital city residents, minus the change in employment for residents in the control cities (all non-capital), and also minus the change in employment for the non-capital city residents in target state S. The hope is that this controls for two kinds of potentially confounding trends: country-wide trends in employment (that would have nothing to do with the policy, like national economic booms/busts) and changes in employment of other people living in state S (possibly due to other events, like local economic booms/busts). Assuming the assumptions have been met, the interpretation is a counterfactual one. This is the expected effect of the policy on the average capital resident, relative to his employment without the policy. This post contains a nice graph of the intuition.
