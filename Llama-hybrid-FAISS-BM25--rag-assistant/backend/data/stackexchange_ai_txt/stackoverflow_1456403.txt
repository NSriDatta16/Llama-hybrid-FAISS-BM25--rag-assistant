I did have a similar experience with Selenium. We had a legacy system which we built a sort of testing framework around so that we could test the changes we were making. This worked great at the start but eventually some of the earlier tests began to fail (or take too long to run) so we started to turn off more and more of the tests. To fix some of the issues we stopped selenium from opening and closing a browser for each test i.e. the tests were broken up into blocks and for each block of tests the browser would only be opened once. This reduced the time taken to run the tests from several hours to 30 minutes. Despite the issues I think Selenium is a great tool for testing web-based applications. Many of the problems we experienced centered on the fact that the system we were testing was a legacy system. If you like test-driven development then Selenium fits in very well with that development practice. EDIT: Another good thing about Selenium is the ability to track what developer introduced the error as well as where the error is (source file). This makes life so much easier when it comes to fixing the error.
