Kruskal-Wallis takes N > 2 independent samples. With two groups, it reduces to the Mann-Whitney U. So the blog is accurate enough. To my knowledge, there is no analytical non-parametric solution when you begin adding covariates. In this case, I would consider: Ordinal logistic regression. It's an extension of non-parametric models to more predictor variables- and structures. However, it also requires some expertise to understand the model. See Frequentist version here though I'd always go Bayesian and use something like brm::brms . Quantile regression. Simpler and easier to interpret. Perhaps there's a meaningful transform of your dependent variable that makes it accessible to parametric (though making conclusions about raw data from analyses on transformed data often come with its own problems, unfortunately). For personal use, I would certainly not be afraid to do what you propose, but stakes are higher when it's research (as they should). I'm afraid I don't know of academic literature backing up the parametric-on-ranks approach other than at the most general level (see this blog for some literature on this in the context of analysis of Likert-type response formats). I often find answers to the question "would a journal accept this approach" to be more about politics and habits than substance.
