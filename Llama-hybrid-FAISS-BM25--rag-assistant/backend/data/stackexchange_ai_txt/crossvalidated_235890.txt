AUC ROC and Recall always gives the same value?

I am doing a binary classification task and I am calculating the AUC ROC and the Recall as follows : recall= metrics.recall_score(y_test,y_pred,pos_label=None,average='macro') auc=roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred) and I always end up wit the exact same value for both ( recall = auc )! I have no idea why this is happening .. any help ?!
