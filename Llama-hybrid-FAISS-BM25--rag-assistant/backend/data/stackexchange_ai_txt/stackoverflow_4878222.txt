If the efficiency you are looking to achieve is in relation to the number of round trips to the database then you could write a stored procedure to do the update or insert for you. In most cases however it's not really necessary to avoid the SELECT first, provided you have appropriate primary keys or unique indices on your tables this should be very quick. If the efficiency is in terms of elegant or reduced code on the server side then I would look at using some sort of ORM, for example Entity Framework 4.0. With a proper ORM architecture you can almost stop thinking in terms of the database records and INSERT/UPDATE and just work with a collection of objects in memory.
