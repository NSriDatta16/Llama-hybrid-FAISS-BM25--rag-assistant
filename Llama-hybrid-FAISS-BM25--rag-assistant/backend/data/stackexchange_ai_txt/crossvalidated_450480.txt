IMO, deep learning is under the machine learning umbrella, in that it is deep machine learning, instead of "shallow" machine learning methods (e.g., OLS, KNN, SVM, Random Forest). Deep learning and artificial neural networks can be used for regression problems, to add another OLS alternative path for you. Keep in mind that the more features/variables you have, the more data points you need for training and the more compute resources you will need to run the training on. Here are some good starting points: 1) https://machinelearningmastery.com/regression-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library-python/ 2) https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression
