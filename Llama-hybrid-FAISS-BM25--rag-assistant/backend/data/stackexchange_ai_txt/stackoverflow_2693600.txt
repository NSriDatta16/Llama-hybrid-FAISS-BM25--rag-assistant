Let's make toast American style: you burn, I'll scrape. --W. Edwards Deming. Instead of looking for an algorithm to troubleshoot your non repeatable builds, fix the root cause , make them repeatable by following good practices (Maven builds are 100% repeatable if you use it right): use the same version of Maven on all machines of a given project (distribute a packaged version) use the same version of the JDK (at least the same version for a given project) lock down plugins versions in your poms for build reproducibility enforce the above rules using the Maven Enforcer Plugin use a corporate repository (and only the corporate repository) avoid making builds non portable by adding non user specific things in ~/.m2/settings.xml put everything under version control (the effective pom should be identical on all machines) run clean builds on a build machine (the reference) I've used Maven in organizations with hundreds of developers without experiencing the problems you're describing. Actually, and I'm sorry to say that, the problems you are facing are not Maven's fault, they're just the result of poor development practices (I don't mean to be rude but that's true).
