Problem in Form authentication

I am using form authentication inmy ASP.NET 2.0 website. Today during testing i was faced major probleM. After authentication, i have default page createuser.aspx. From that page i am creating new user.It is working fine. There is logout button in which i am clearing all sessions and redirecting it in login page. All was working fine. During testing i used fiddler in which i drag and drop createuser.aspx url in request builder option of fiddler and after changing textbox value inside fiddler i click on execute. I was shocked the information is saved in database. It means i was missing some important thing in asp.net form authentication because after logout all sesission/cookies should expire and fiddler should not work. I hope you all understand my problem. Please help me to find out solution. I have doubt over authentication cookies. I don't know i am correct or not?
