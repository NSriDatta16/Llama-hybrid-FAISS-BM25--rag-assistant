How to pre-process an integer array to find an average of any subarray in O(1)?

This problem rephrases an interview question . Since this original problem seems too hard to me I am trying to solve a simpler one: how to process an integer array to find an average of any sub-array in constant time. Obviously, we can process all sub-arrays in O(n^2) . Are there better solutions?
