My personal method for designing a site is to first of all consider the needs of the site. What is the most important thing that a visitor needs to do or needs to know. Consider this site, the three big things you may want to do when you open the home page is 1. view some questions to answer, ask a question, or and log in. You are immediately able to do those 3 things quickly with minimal clicks and no searching. The second thing to do is to think about the impression of the site. If you visit a major bank's website they convey trustworthiness, if you visit a blog it conveys a sense of personality, when you visit a news website it can give you feeling of urgency or knowledge. Third you should consider brand recognition. There is a reason Pepsi's website is blue and Coke's website is red. If you see the stackoverflow logo somewhere there is a good chance that it would ring a bell (serverfault maybe not so much). This is a major design challenge that a lot of companies spend a lot of money on. Finally, think of the poor users. I personally have the attention span of -oooh a red car! If I can't figure out what your site does instantly I will be lost and want to go somewhere else. If I can't figure out how to do something I want to do in a few glances I will dread coming back. I hate digging around a website to find a login or a bit of help. An example is registration on a site I'm working on. The site just asks for an e-mail address. You put in your e-mail address and a confirmation is sent to your inbox. Click a link add a password and you are done. Your e-mail is your sign in. (Don't you hate it when your favorite username is taken?) You don't have to fill our your home address because we won't send you any letters, and we don't need your name because we aren't going to know you on the street. After this just look at other websites similar to what you are doing. Look at design blogs like Smashing Magazine . These all will give you inspiration, but don't think, 'Oh this website has blinking text, I should have blinking text!' or, 'This blogger says I should use this font for business websites, so I must use it.' You are smart enough to know better I think the most important thing is to use your own site. If you don't use it, you don't know what needs fixed or changed. Have others use it too, right in front of you. Don't say anything, just watch how they use it and if they struggle with anything.
