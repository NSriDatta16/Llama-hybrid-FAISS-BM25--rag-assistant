How many concurrent upload can a Rails App handle

We are expect to serve few thousands uploads within 2 or 3 minutes. Most of the uploads will be about 20 -> 200 Mb. Technically, I think upload has not much to do with Rails, but rather the WebServer (Apache/Nginx), so as long as the server can handle concurrent requests, then there not much work for Rails app to do (except to move the file to proper storage and to create database record to track the file). Is my assumption right? Normally, how many concurrent uploads a single Rails App process can be expected to handle? (Given the Rails App could take 20 ms with all the calculation, moving file and create database record, but the connection must be kept alive for 1 minute so that the file can be successful transferred)
