Predicting logistic regression in R with missing values

Can logistic regression provide a predicted value for observations with missing values? Here are the details: I have a file with about 10K rows, about 3K have all complete values for all variables. I ran a logistic regression ( glm ) to estimate coefficients and significance for each predictor Now when I try to predict the probabilities of the dependent variable using the fitted model, I only get values for the 3K rows that all have values for the independent variables I would like to have some predicted probability for all 10K rows, is that even possible? How do I do that in R? I have tried na.action=na.exclude/na.pass and that only provides values for the 3K rows.
