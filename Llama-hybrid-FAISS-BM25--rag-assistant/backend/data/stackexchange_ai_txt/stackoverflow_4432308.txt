If you want to slide a menu up and down and have it overshoot like the contacts application does, then do this: When a touch first occurs, record the Y position As they drag around, scroll the target using the difference between last Y position and the current one When the touch is released, use the last recorded difference as your velocity Scroll the target on every frame iteration using the velocity Decrease the velocity by using a friction multipler Stop scrolling when the next touch occurs (or when the velocity reaches 0) Some pseudo-pseudo code... lastTouchY = 0.0 friction = 0.98 touching = false target = Object() velocity = 0.0 onTouchDown(data) touching = true lastTouchY = data.y velocity = 0 onTouchMove(data) target.y += data.y - lastTouchY lastTouchY = data.y onTouchUp(data) velocity = data.y - lastTouchY touching = false onUpdate() if !touching target.y += velocity velocity *= friction if velocity
