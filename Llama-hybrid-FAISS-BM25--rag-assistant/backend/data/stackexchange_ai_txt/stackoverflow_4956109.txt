how should I organize mercurial repositories when migrating from svn

We have our project stored in subversion in following way: trunk (main development goes here) branches stable (production version of software) internal (old, internal version of software is kept here and only very rarely new code is commited here) How should I organize my mercurial repostories to host it? I have created three repositories, one for trunk and one for each branch as central servers, but since mercurial has branches, than maybe I am doing it wrong. At least it feels wrong, but when I tried to push single changeset from development local repo to stable local repo it pushed all my new changesets. That's not what I wanted. EDIT1 I had revision 623 in trunk and 620 in stable. I wanted to push only changeset 623 to stable. I tried hg push -r623 ../stable , but hg informed me, that 4 changesets were pushed.
