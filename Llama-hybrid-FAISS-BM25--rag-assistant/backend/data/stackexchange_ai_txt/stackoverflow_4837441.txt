You can use timeBeginPeriod to increase the timer/sleep accuracy. Note that this globally affects the system and might increase the power consumption. You can call timeBeginPeriod(1) at the beginning of your program. On the systems where you observed the higher timer accuracy another running program probably did that. And I wouldn't bother calculating the sleep time and just use sleep(1) in a loop. But even with only 16ms precision you can write your code so that the error averages out over time. That's what I'd do. Isn't hard to code and should work with few adaptions to your current code. Or you can switch to code that makes the movement proportional to the elapsed time. But even in this case you should implement a frame-rate limiter so you don't get uselessly high framerates and unnecessarily consume power.
