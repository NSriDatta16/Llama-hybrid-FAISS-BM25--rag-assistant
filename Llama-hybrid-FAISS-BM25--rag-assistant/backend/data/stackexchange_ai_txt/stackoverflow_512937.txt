I totally agree with Jason, but I don't think what you are trying to do actually contributes to test coverage. After all, rendering it and testing behavior will already cover whether or not it exists. Lots of developers go overboard when they first get bitten by the test-driven development bug. They want test failures to tell them exactly what is wrong so they don't have to dig in and debug. That isn't the primary purpose of testing; testing is for verifying correct behavior so you don't ship bad software. When something is wrong, then you can debug. There's no need to have a test harness so specific that the testing engine knows exactly what the issue is.
