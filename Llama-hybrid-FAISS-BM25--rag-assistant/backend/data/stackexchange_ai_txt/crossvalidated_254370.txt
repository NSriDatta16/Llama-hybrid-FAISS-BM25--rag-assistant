Calculate standard error for breeding population from summary statistics for male and female sub-groups.

I need to obtain a mean and standard error for energetics values for a bird population for use in a Monte Carlo model. The following data were obtained from the literature: males: mean = 3792.000 kJ/day, SD = 723.290, SE = 273.378, n = 7 females: mean = 3054.333 kJ/day, SD = 13.051, SE = 7.535, n = 3 I calculated the energetic demand for an average individual in the population (defined as 0.5 male/female pairs) by adding the means of the sexes to estimate energy consumption per pair, then dividing by 2. However, it isnâ€™t clear to me how to determine the standard error for the above mean. I can approximate it via simulation using R: pv ...~136.7. However, it seems to me there must be a more straightforward way. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
