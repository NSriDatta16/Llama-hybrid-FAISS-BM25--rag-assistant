The average correlation is not unreasonable. You're looking for an overall measure of similarity, so you might just put all of the measurements into one big basket and take the overall correlation; you might want to standardize the two sets of ratings first and then take the overall correlation. You might also consider looking at RMS difference rather than correlation. You may find some discussion of this in books on cluster analysis. If you have reasonably large sample sizes, just comparing the correlations would be fine. If some of the sample sizes are quite small, it'd best to do something Bayesian (shrinking the estimates towards the overall average), along the lines described here .
