When using dotCover in a TeamCity build configuration, is there an environment variable for code coverage percentage?

When using TeamCity to manage .net projects, we like to use dotCover to evaluate our code coverage. In the past using NCover , there was a way to retrieve the code coverage percentage using an environment variable. We liked this and we would set the Project description to use this variable so that from the dashboard (overview) you could easily see the code coverage. I believe NCover had some output variable that TeamCity made available. I don't recall exactly what it was, but I believe it was something like: %env.ncover.coverage% Does anybody know how to do this using dotCover with TeamCity? I realize it may actually be 3 values; 1 for Classes, 1 for Method, and 1 for Statements.
