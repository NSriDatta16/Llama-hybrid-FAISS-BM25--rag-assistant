although not a very elegant solution i sometimes wrap up static versions of variables which i require to change on the fly through the debugger in order to tweak stuff, then just comment out the corresponding #define when done with it, particularly helpful if load times are long and its just a few vars you need to tweak in order to test something. but then again for something like this you should probably consider data files that can be reloaded at runtime
