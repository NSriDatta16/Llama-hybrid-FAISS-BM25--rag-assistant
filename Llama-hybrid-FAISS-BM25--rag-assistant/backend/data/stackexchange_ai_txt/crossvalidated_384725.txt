SVM optimization problem: question about constraint

I am studying SVM algorithm and its optimization problem. When we are constructing optimization problem, we say, that we are searching for such separating hyperplane, so that we rescale $w$ and $b$ , so that $|w^T x + b|=1$ for those points in each class nearest to the hyperplane. After the rescaling, the distance from the nearest point in each class to the hyperplane is $\frac{1}{||W||}$ . So we state optimization problem $$\min_{ w, b} \frac{1}{2}{||W||^2}$$ s.t. : $$y^{(i)}(w^Tx^{(i)}+b)\geq 1, i=1,\dots m.$$ Question: I don't see which constraint ensures, that for the nearest point to hyperplane in each class is going to hold $y^i(w^Tx^{(i)}+b)= 1$ . I understand that there will be some point for which $y^{(i)}(w^Tx^{(i)}+b)=1$ , but I don't understand which constraint ensures that on both sides of margin there will be such point. I think I don't understand something simple here. If you have any explanation for this I would appreciate it very much.
