Asp.net MVC same view name, different paths

I want to have multiple path folder structure that contain same name views: /profile.aspx /admin/profile.aspx /user/editpost.aspx /admin/editpost.aspx /Controllers |- PostController.cs |- ProfileController.cs I want to be able to have all the regular pages in a folder and the admin pages in another folder. Do I need to organize my Views folder like: /Views /User /Story |- editpost.aspx /Profile |- profile.aspx /Admin /Story |_ editpost.aspx /Web |- profile.aspx or is there a way I can do this: /User /Views /Story |- editpost.aspx /Profile |- profile.aspx /Admin /Views /Story |_ editpost.aspx /Web |- profile.aspx Also, how do I code/organize/use separate controllers for /User and /Admin that potentially have the same name? Let me know if I have been unclear. Thanks!
