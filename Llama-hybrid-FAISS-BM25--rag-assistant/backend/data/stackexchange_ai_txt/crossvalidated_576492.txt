Using ML model and decision tree to create a new risk classification

The idea of this project was to use a Machine Learning model to find the best variables to include in a decision tree algorithm. After evaluating with caret a number of different models I found the one with the best accuracy (0.88) with my database. Then, I selected the most important variables used (Importance > 50%) and I included them in a decision tree analysis done with Rpart. However, the final accuracy of my decision tree is way lower than I expected (0.62). Why is that? How can I improve my decision tree accuracy? Am I following the wrong idea in combining ML and decision tree?
