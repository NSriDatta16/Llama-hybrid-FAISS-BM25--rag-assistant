Are you sure you don't want ? If you are going to generate grid in Javascript, then my advices would be: 1) Don't manipulate DOM in a loopâ€”it will be extremely slow. 2) Don't use string concatenation a-la out += ' '; This will also be slow. The best way is to push fragments into array and then join. 3) Wrap the cells into some container before inserting into DOM: inserting one element with lots of children is faster than inserting lots of unwrapped DIVs. 4) Use inline-block for positioning of cell divs. Floats will take significant time for recalculation on insert. 5) Don't bind click handler to each cell individually. Use jQuery .delegate() on the parent. 6) Don't forget rgba() in CSS, this way you can easily have your background visible See http://kod.as/lab/grid/ for the my PoC implementation.
