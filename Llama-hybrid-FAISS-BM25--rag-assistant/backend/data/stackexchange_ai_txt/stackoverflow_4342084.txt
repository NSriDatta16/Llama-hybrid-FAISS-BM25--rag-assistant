Inserting this string in the database should be no different than inserting any other string. Just use prepared statements or escape the string properly. When embedding that string on the page however do not escape it as it contains raw HTML code. In this case though it seems you could simply keep the video id Ahg6qcgoay4 as the embedding code itself should be the same regardless of the video.
