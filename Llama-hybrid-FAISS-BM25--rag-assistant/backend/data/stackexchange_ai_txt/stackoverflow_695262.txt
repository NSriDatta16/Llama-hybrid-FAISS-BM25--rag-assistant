Where does the browser fail as a client

Where should the browser be improved upon to help improve application experiences? For instance some of my main gripes are A) Different browsers will need different configurations / plugins (I dont want to download different JRE's, RIA platforms such as flash, silverright, gears so forth) B) I want to always be able to drag data from my desktop to a 'Webapp'. I don't like clicking browse for file and then uploading it. I think this is something that should be easily handled. Additionally based on the above point - I'd like for it to be very easy to drag information from a web page to my computer to be used in whatever shape form or matter needed. For instance I'd like if I could drag my user ID from stack overflow into my mail / crm client which would take relevant information and maybe even build a picture up of my knowledge. What else am I missing ?
