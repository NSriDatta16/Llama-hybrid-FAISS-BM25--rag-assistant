Monte Carlo method DyedPurple already showed that your simulation is not wrong and you should get a probability of ~0.84 for a run length of 1000. It is only when the run length goes towards infinity that you are almost certain to get gambler's ruin (If you have a stopping rule for some upper boundary, as in this question , then you can escape the gambler's ruin with some non-zero probability). In this answer, I show how you can compute it exactly instead of simulating it with a Monte Carlo method. (and there is also an approximate analytic solution by comparing the situation with Brownian motion). Computation as a Markov chain The problem is similar to this question Amoeba Interview Question or this question The Frog Problem (puzzle in YouTube video) The probabilities, $P_k(x)$ , to have $x$ money after $k$ tosses can be expressed in terms of the probabilities for earlier tosses: $$P_k(x) = \frac{1}{8} P_{k-1}(x-3) + \frac{3}{8} P_{k-1}(x-1) + \frac{3}{8} P_{k-1}(x+1) + \frac{1}{8} P_{k-1}(x+3)$$ With this formula, you can already compute the result for 1000 steps (see the R-code and the image below). Comparison with a diffusion process You can also model the amount of money as approximately a one-dimensional diffusion process or a Brownian motion (the solution is given in 1916 by Smoluchowski, more on that in the answer here https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/401539 ). The amount of money $M_k$ in step $k$ changes relatively to the amount in the previous step $M_{k-1}$ by the addition of a random variable $$M_k = M_{k-1} + \epsilon_k$$ In this case the random variable $\epsilon_k$ is a scaled and shifted binomial distributed variable that takes values $-3$ , $-1$ , $1$ , $3$ , with probabilities $1/8$ , $3/8$ , $3/8$ , $1/8$ . This variable has a variance equal to 3. We can relate this to a diffusion process or Brownian motion where the diffusivity is equal to the variance of the variable $\epsilon$ . The time to reach a certain point, the first hitting time, follows an inverse Gaussian distribution . Or since there is no drift it is a Levy Distribution. Then the hitting time is distributed according to a Levy distribution with parameters $m=0$ and $s = (10/\sqrt{3})^2$ . We can use the cumulative distribution function to model the fraction of cases that have hit the point of zero money after 1000 steps. Example The graph and code below demonstrate the computation with the Markov chain and the estimation with the Levy distribution. kmax
