Reshape Time series data for Conv2d Block

I am modelling my time series data into a supervised learning problem for the input to a conv2d block in pytorch from this tutorial . timesteps = 5 def to_supervised(train,n_input=timesteps,n_output=3): n_start = 0 train_X , train_y = list(),list() for _ in range(len(train)): n_end = n_start + n_input n_out = n_end + n_output if n_out How ever this code turns the input shape of (100,5) to (92,5,5). But what i am expecting it to make it a 4d array(batchsize, samples, Height, width) for the input of conv2d block. So i have changed the code a little bit timesteps = 5 def to_supervised(train,n_input=timesteps,n_output=3): n_start = 0 train_X , train_y = list(),list() for _ in range(len(train)): n_end = n_start + n_input n_out = n_end + n_output if n_out but it throws error IndexError: too many indices for array I saw many guides for multivariate sequence but I don't understand how to apply this on this case
