Best way to gather musical data

I am looking for a relatively large amount of jazz (and other) solos to use for data science purposes - probably somewhere up to a 100 transctipts. Although that is not that much and many pdf transcripts are available, I want the data to be in a format where I can easily access all the information in Python (which note was played and at what beat). Manually writing all that data would, however, be very tedious and time-consuming. Thus my question: does anyone know of any software that automatically reads pdf transcripts and puts it in a different file format, or alternatively of a website with transcripts already in a format in which I can access all the data easily from Python?
