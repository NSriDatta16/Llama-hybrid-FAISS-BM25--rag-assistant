For cross-domain communication there is no easy client-side way for you to retrieve results. Server-side support would be required - exposing additional services that you can hit on the client (for example by embedding a element into the page). This allows you to make GET requests to the server and get the result as JSON. One way to do it would be: Client creates This returns something like var myToken = "ABC123"; This value is inserted into the form, which is then submitted to the same server The server stores the results of the form under the key of the specified token Client creates Server fetches the form results for ABC123 and returns then as JSON
