You don't need to use a web role to access Azure Storage (Blob or otherwise). You can use a worker role, or you can even access it from a Windows Forms app running on a desktop, or a web/service app which isn't running on Azure. See the Azure SDK's StorageClient documentation for info on how to access Azure Storage - it's pretty easy.
