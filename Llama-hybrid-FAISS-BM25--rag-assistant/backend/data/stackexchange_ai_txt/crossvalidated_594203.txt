These posts refer specifically to time series forecasting - building predictive models using information about the trends and cycles in the historical data. Applying Kfold cross-validation risks (a) losing the temporal relationships due to gaps in the time series and (b) building models where future information is used in the predictions. Neither of the two Kaggle notebooks you reference are doing time series forecasting, even though the data could be considered a (multivariate) time series. They treat each time step as an independent instance and ignore any time-dependency between the instances - in other words as regular tabular data, so there's no problem using Kfold cross-validation in this case.
