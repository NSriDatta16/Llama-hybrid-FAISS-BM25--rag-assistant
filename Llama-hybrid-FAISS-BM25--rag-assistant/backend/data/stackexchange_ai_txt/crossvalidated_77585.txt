GA or ANN, and suggestions

I am working to approximate, to extrapolate rather, values of a function from a few known values. Here is what I have: Less than 100 known I/O pairs. A monotonously positive correlation.en Something that is not exactly Gaussian, Poisson, or inverse binomial. Right now I can choose between a genetic algorithm and an artificial neural network. If I use a genetic algorithm, then I will use it to approximate the relation with a polynomial or a rational function. If I use a neural network, I will simply find the first Google result for a C++ NN library (unless I am advised otherwise). Here are my questions. Suppose I have access to a long time (1-2 week max) as well great computational might (university clusters). Would I achieve a closer approximation with a GA or an ANN? Which would be faster? For those ANN specialists out there: I am unacquainted with the world of ANN technology. If I am looking for portability, programmability, speed, and adaptability for such extrapolation, which C++ toolkit would you recommend? Thank you.
