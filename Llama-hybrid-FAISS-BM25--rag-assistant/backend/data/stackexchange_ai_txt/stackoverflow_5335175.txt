Any amount of debugging is likely to slow down your program even to the point of running at one-tenth the speed. It has to send messages both to your listeners (you don't appear to have any) and the default listener, which forwards it to both Debugger.Log and the Win32 OutputDebugString - little wonder it slows down a bit :-) As to why the indent may be having a large effect, are you actually unindenting somewhere in that loop? If you're not, and you have 2000 items (as per your comment elsewhere), that's going to be quite a lot of space on the front of each line as you approach the end (an average of 1000 indents per line is likely to be problematic).
