References for longitudinal data analysis

So my goal is to study longitudinal data (data in time series) by applying some data mining techniques. Ultimately I want to be able to "predict" outcomes. For example, a study of patients along the years/months (repeated measures) can be used to predict some diseases using things like logistic regression, neural networks, etc.. I'm using R. However I'm having a hard time finding good references on this subject. I have a mathematic background, even though I've applied some data mining techniques before, I've never applied those to time series. If someone can recommend me some good theoretical references or hands-on examples in R, that would be greatly appreciated. Also if you know a relevant article on time series analysis, that would be great too. Thanks in advance.
