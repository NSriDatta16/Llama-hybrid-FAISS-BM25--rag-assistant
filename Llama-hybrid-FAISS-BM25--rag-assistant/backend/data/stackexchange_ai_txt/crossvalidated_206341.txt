@earth_space, Logistic regression will not work here at all. It's used when you have some categorical variable as dependent. you need to see variation in data and then you can use linear Regression analysis.here are the assumption of regression- http://www.statmethods.net/stats/rdiagnostics.html Other possible time series algos must also be checked starting from AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA etc.
