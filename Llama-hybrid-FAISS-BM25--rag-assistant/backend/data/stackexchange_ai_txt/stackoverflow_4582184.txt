How did the iPhone Alarm Bug possibly happen?

iPhone alarms didn't work in the new year of 2011! http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/31/psa-iphone-alarms-not-working-come-new-years-day-2011/ But only on January 1st. And January 2nd. And only if there were single-event alarms. (Recurring alarms still sounded.) How did this possibly happen? What contortions of code lead to this outcome? What absurd algorithms give rise to this inscrutable behavior? Is it related to November's daylight saving time related alarm foul-up? I don't know, and odds are, the only people who do aren't talking. For this question, don't be silent just because you're not positive. Guesses encouraged. Tales of similar mistakes strongly encourage. Extra points for pseudocode.
