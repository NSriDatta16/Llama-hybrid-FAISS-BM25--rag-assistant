Each Azure "project" (which is like an Azure account) is initially limited to 5 hosted storage accounts. Let's say you have one storage account for your actual content, and one for diagnostics. Now let's say you want a dev and QA storage account for each of those, respectively, so you don't damage production data. You've now run out of your storage accounts (in the above scenario, you'd need 6 hosted accounts). You'd need to call Microsoft and ask for this limit to be increased... If, instead, you used the Dev Fabric for your tables during development / local testing, you'll free up Azure storage accounts (the ones used for dev - you'd still want QA storage accounts to be in Azure, not Dev Fabric). One scenario where you can't rely on Dev Fabric for storage: performance/load testing.
