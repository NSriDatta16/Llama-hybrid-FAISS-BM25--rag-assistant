What is the difference between logistic regression and Fractional response regression?

As far as I know, the difference between logistic model and fractional response model (frm) is that the dependent variable (Y) in which frm is [0,1], but logistic is {0, 1}. Further, frm uses the quasi-likelihood estimator to determine its parameters. Normally, we can use glm to obtain the logistic models by glm(y ~ x1+x2, data = dat, family = binomial(logit)) . For frm, we change family = binomial(logit) to family = quasibinomial(logit) . I noticed we can also use family = binomial(logit) to obtain frm's parameter since it gives the same estimated values. See the following example library(foreign) mydata return: Call: glm(formula = prate ~ mrate + age + sole + totemp, family = binomial("logit"), data = mydata) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.1214 -0.1979 0.2059 0.4486 0.9146 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.074e+00 8.869e-02 12.110 And for family = quasibinomial('logit') : glm.quasi return: Call: glm(formula = prate ~ mrate + age + sole + totemp, family = quasibinomial("logit"), data = mydata) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.1214 -0.1979 0.2059 0.4486 0.9146 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 1.074e+00 4.788e-02 22.435 The estimated Beta from both family are the same, but the difference is the SE values. However, to obtain the correct SE, we have to use library(sandwich) as in this post . Now, my questions: What is the difference between these two codes? Is frm about to obtain robust SE? If my understanding is not correct, please give some suggestions.
