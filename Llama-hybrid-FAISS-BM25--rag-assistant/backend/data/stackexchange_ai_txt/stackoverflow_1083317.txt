I'd go with SQL Server Agent. It's well integrated with SQL Server; various SQL Server features use Agent (Log Shipping, for instance). You can create an Agent job to run one or more SSIS packages, for instance. It's also integrated with operator notification, and can be scripted, or else executed through SMO.
