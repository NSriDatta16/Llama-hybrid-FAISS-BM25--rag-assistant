I don't have any experience with web development, but using a class here is definitely better programming practice. Managing multiple parallel arrays is troublesome. For instance, whenever you insert a new item or need to move items, you need to remember each array. Furthermore, using a class here makes your code more organized, and hence more maintainable. I think it is certainly worth the overhead of implementing the class, especially once you've got the hang of using classes in PHP!
