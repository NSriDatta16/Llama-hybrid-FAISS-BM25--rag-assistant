How can i test the heteroscedasticity of time series?

I'd a problem on testing the heteroscedasticity characteristics of my time series sample with R Studio. I've tried the McLeod.Li.test to this end but it doesn't work. Can you inform me if this function is not yet available on R Studio and with what it's replaced because the error text posted was: Error in McLeod.Li.test(bitcoin): could not find function "McLeod.Li.test"
