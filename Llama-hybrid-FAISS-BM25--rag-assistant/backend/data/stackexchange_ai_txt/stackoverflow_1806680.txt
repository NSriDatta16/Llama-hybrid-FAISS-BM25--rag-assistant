Robert, this seems to be weird to me RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^$ http://backend/alphauser [P] the regular expression you made basically match anything fair enougth but it would not pass the URI to the backend. RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^/alphauser/$ http://backend/alphauser [P] or RewriteRule ^/$ http://backend/alphauser [P] I am not 100 % sure how mod_rewrite behave in a .htaccess file This would make much sense it my opinion, also you have to make sure you have mod_proxy and mod_proxy_http enabled or it won't work.
