How do I transform my data so that my regressions produce meaningful coefficients?

Hi I am a novice in doing regressions and programming in R in general. In my free time, I have started with a project of analyzing the impact of COVID pandemic on US counties. I have a data frame that contains the following columns: id of the county, change in spending in the county vs spending in the first week of January (in %), change in spending for each week vs spending last week (in %), median household income in the county, case rate for the county in the week and past 7 days average of new cases. What I am trying to determine is the link between the spending and the income and case rates. However, the problem is that the spending is given as porcentual change while the case rates are absolute values. Therefore when I run a regression of the change in spending on case rate, what I essentially get is the coefficient that says by how many percent does spending change in the week for one more case. I am guessing that is not ideal for data analysis. How would you change the case rate data so that it better corresponds to the spending data and the coefficients of my regressions can be more easily interpreted?
