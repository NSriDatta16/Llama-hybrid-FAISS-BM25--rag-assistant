I would call this the family size paradox or something similar Suppose, for a simple example, everybody had one partner and a Poisson-distributed number of children with parameter $2$: The average number of children per person would be $2$ The average number of children per person with children would be $\frac{2}{1-e^{-2}} \approx 2.313$ The average sibling group size for each individual (counting their brothers and sisters and themselves) would be $3$ Real demographic and survey numbers produce different numbers but similar patterns The apparent paradox is that the average size of individuals' sibling groups is larger than the average number of children per family; with stable population dynamics, people tend to have fewer children on average than their parents did The explanation is whether the average is being taken over parents and families or over siblings: there are different weightings being applied to large families. In your example there is a difference between weighting by individuals or by purchases; your conditional averages are pushed up by fact you condition on a particular purchase being made.
