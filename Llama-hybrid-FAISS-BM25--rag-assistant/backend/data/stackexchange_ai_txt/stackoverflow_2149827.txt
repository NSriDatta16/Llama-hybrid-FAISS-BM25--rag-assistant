jquery UI sortable: how to leave the original visible until the drop?

In the standard behavior demonstrated at http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ when you drag an item in the list a placeholder element is displayed where the item would be dropped. However, the original location of the item to be dropped is not indicated. I would like to leave the original location visible until the drop, so that the visual feedback is analogous to the way the original is left in place for the "semi-transparent clone" option depicted at http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#visual-feedback Is there any way I can do this with sortable? Thanks!
