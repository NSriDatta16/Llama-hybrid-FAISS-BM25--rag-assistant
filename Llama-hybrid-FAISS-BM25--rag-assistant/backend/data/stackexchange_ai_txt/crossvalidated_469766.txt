You can use Bayesian inference to solve your problem. If you answer the question "what is the proportion of Italian recipes?", you have a prior probability of Italian recipe $P(Italian)$ . Also, you can get prior probability of having tomato in recipe $P(tomato)$ . Then, you can calculate $P(Italian|tomato)$ as the proportion of Italian recipes among the recipes that contain tomatoes. In the same way you can get $P(tomato|Italian)$ . There are posterior probabilities. By default they should be calculated using Bayes formula: $$P(Mexican|tomato) = \frac{P(tomato|Mexican)P(Mexican)}{P(tomato)}$$ You can get it directly from your data. If you want to know what is the most probable cuisine associated with tomato, you can compare $P(Italian|tomato)$ , $P(Mexican|tomato)$ , $P(other\_cuisine|tomato)$ and choice the max one: $$answer = \underset{cuisine}{\operatorname{argmax}} P(cuisine|tomato)$$ Also, you can combine any number of hypothesis in Bayes formula, but it can be a little tricky at first: $$P(cuisine|ingr_1, ..., ingr_n) = \frac{P(ingr_n|cuisine)P(cuisine|ingr_1, ..., ingr_{n-1})}{\sum_{cuisine}^{C}P(ingr_n|cuisine)P(cuisine|ingr_1, ..., ingr_{n-1})}$$ where $$C = \{Italian, Mexican, other\_cuisine, ...\}$$
