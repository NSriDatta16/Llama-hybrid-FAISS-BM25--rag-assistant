NovaJoe -- I was pretty discouraged to review your link as it does appear to read that you need Enterprise Developer license... I think I figured it out. Read the first paragraph and first bullet point: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/Introduction/Introduction.html This would explain why all wired deployment methods work, but Wireless Distribution always fails. Enterprise developer account is required, it seems. >. But, this is not the case! I was able to successfully deploy by completing the following: removing app archive from xcode organizer in the xcode project: clean/clean all targets, then build and archive with the developer development certificate in organizer, select the re-added application archive, and select Share... For Identify, pick the Same Development Cert used to build the app and 'save to disk' You now will have an .ipa file that will work, but in order for the remote-install to register, you will still need the plist file that is generated (and pointed to the new .ipa) for the process to initiate. So to summarize -- follow enterprise process, then replace generated enterprise .ipa with non-enterprise .ipa
