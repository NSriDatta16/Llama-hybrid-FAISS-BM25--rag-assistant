Limiting fields returned in a LINQ query

A few days ago I asked a question about returning select fields from a LINQ query. Now, I want to add some grouping to the results and things are not working out. The following query returns the correct rows but I want to limit the fields returned. For example, I only want to see the Id and Name fields. var contactsFromDealers = Contacts.Where(x => x.ContactTypeID == 2).GroupBy (x => x.OrganizationName) and appending .Select (x => x.Id, x.OrganizationName) doesn't help. Any suggestions? Thanks!
