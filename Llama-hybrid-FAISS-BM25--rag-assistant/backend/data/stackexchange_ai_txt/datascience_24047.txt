averaging multiple scores on small chunks of data or raw score on single collated data

I am using IBM Watson tool to determine tones ( https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/ ) and personality scores ( https://personality-insights-livedemo.mybluemix.net/ ) on different files containing natural language. What would be the recommended strategy and rationale for choosing between: Getting scores from different files and averaging/manipulating them. Getting one raw score on aggregated data and using it.
