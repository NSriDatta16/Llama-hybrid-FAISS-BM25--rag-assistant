If you are using CMS page content as widget container: It is pretty simple, just add column_count parameter in {{widget type="widget_type" parameter1="value" column_count="your_value"}} directive. By the way widget it is a standard Magento block with some pre-configurations, so you can easily specify any block parameter within {{widget}} directive. If you want to use Widget functionality, you can create etc/widget.xml in your custom module with this XML: 1 1 5 The number of Products in a row text It will add a new field to widget form, where an admin user will be able to enter the number of products in a single products row Have fun with Magento =)
