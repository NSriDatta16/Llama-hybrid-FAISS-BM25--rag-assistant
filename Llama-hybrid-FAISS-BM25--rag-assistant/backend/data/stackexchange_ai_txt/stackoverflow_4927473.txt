There are many different ways to do this (if I understand what you are trying to do). As this is a rather general question I can only give general answers. Firstly as this is a tab bar App I would probably create an NSTimer in the App delegate to call the network connection every 60 seconds perhaps. The call that you are interested in is scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:(NSTimeInterval)ti target:(id)aTarget selector:(SEL)aSelector userInfo:(id)userInfo repeats:(BOOL)yesOrNo; This allows you to specify a method that is called every x seconds to run. You could also do this in a thread and sleep the thread for 60 seconds after the connection has been complete. If you are starting of iPhone development I would probably stick with the NSTimer for the meantime. As far as storage is concerned its kind of dependant of how much and the sorting that is needed if you use sqlite or not. It might even be possible just to use an NSDictionary stored in an NSMutableArray that stores the information with a timestamp. The problem with the timestamp thing is, after a certain time period is it considered read? If not a BOOL might be better, once the user reads turn the bool to false and make a call to the App delegate to reload the badge number based on the amount of entries with bool is true. Once again an abstract view of the problem. Let me know if you need more details.
