Hierarchical Logistic regression

I have performed a hierarchical logistic regression with four steps, with various health risk variables including cigarette smoking. How do I interpret a change in odds ratio in step 1 for cigarette smoking OR 5.75 to that in step 2 OR 3.98 while adding in other risk behaviors like use of alcohol and drugs. All odds are significant throughout the models.
