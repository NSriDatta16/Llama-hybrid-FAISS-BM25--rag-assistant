Not exactly. You can self-sign a certificate wih * as common name. Obviously, as higlighted by robert, users will get warnings, but this time the warning is about the fact that the certificate is signed by an unknown issuer. Just let your users accept it, possibly through a secure channel (send them an S/MIME or PGP message with your certificate and public key, for example) and warnings will be disabled too. When dealing with CAs, it's theorically possible to sign a certificate with as many as AltSubnectName fields as the websites you need to host on SSL, and that's one of the few ways to get SSL hosting.
