Moving Item in a table SWT/RCP

I have a problem with moving cell in a Table. Have someone an idea how to move rows in an SWT Table? I want to change the order by user interaction and I din't need to sort the entries. I would like to achieve this in moving a selected row up or down by buttonklick or with moving a table items by drag and drop. I am using eclips 3.6 and java 1.6 This is what I try with Drag and Drop but not working: Transfer[] types = new Transfer[] { LocalSelectionTransfer.getTransfer()}; DragSource source = new DragSource(table, DND.DROP_MOVE ); source.setTransfer(types); source.addDragListener(new DragSourceAdapter() { public void dragSetData(DragSourceEvent event) { // Get the selected items in the drag source DragSource ds = (DragSource) event.widget; Table table = (Table) ds.getControl(); TableItem[] selection = table.getSelection(); System.out.println(" drag "+ selection[0].getText()); } }); DropTarget target = new DropTarget(table, DND.DROP_MOVE | DND.DROP_DEFAULT); target.setTransfer(types); TableViewer tb = new TableViewer(table); tb.addDropSupport(DND.DROP_MOVE, types, new ViewerDropAdapter(viewer) { @Override public boolean validateDrop(Object target, int operation, TransferData transferType) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub return false; } @Override public boolean performDrop(Object data) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub return false; } }); The Item that I would like to move have more then a Column. The error that I became is : org.eclipse.swt.SWTError: Cannot initialize Drop When I will be informed in which new Item (the index in Table) is the item moved it will be sufficient then I can change the List of my objects and redrew the table. Any idea how to slove this problem?. Regards, Haythem
