How to use MSBuild to deploy an ASP.NET MVC application

I'm a complete noob with respect to msbuild but am encouraged to use it based on a previous answer to a question I posted a few days back . Anyhow, I'm looking for some recommendations on getting started with MSBuild ... and in particular, using it to automate the deployment of ASP.NET MVC applications. Thanks much!
