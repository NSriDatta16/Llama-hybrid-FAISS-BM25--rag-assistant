When I made it on mouse pressed, then tyhe copy is coming above the original(layer wise). When you got this far, simply adding a call to myItemCopy->setZValue( -1 ) would place the copy "behind" the original item. A different approach, and possibly "cleaner", would be to use QDrag and tell Qt how to paint your item during the Drag operation. See Qt's "Drag and Drop Robot" example for reference: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-graphicsview-dragdroprobot-example.html Happy coding! Robin
