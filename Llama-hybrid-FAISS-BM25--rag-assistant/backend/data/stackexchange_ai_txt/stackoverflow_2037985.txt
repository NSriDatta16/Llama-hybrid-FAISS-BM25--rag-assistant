How do you split a Visual Studio Solution?

I have a Visual Studio 2008 solution with >40 C# and C++/CLI projects that depend on each other. Working with that solution is quite slow, and usually I only need a few projects at a time. So I decided to split the solution into multiple solutions that contain 3-5 projects. I would also like to keep the "full" solution with all projects (it's handy for for automated builds or for big refactoring actions that affect all projects). (This is the main condition here. Otherwise, splitting projects into solutions is trivial, of course.) Is there any way to do that? My first idea was to create new empty solutions and add some of the existing project files into each of these solutions. But if I do that, VS can't find the project references any more (because they're not in the same solution). I can add the references as "normal" file references. But if I do that, my "full" solution doesn't work any more, because the dependencies are lost. EDIT: Thank you all for your answers. I'd like to clarify my question a bit: My solution contains 44 projects, not including tests. So splitting it into 2 parts isn't really what I had in mind, I was more thinking about 5-8 parts. That's why I would like to keep the "full" solution where VS can figure out the correct build order for a full build. Maintaining the build order for 8 separate solutions by hand (e.g. in a batch file) seems error-prone to me. Also I would like to group the projects "logically" (i.e. I would like to have the projects that are usually modified together in one solution). But that grouping does not always match the dependencies. For example, imagine I have the dependency chain A is referenced by B is referenced by C is referenced by D and imagine that A and D are often modified together but B and C rarely change. (Obviously, the interface of A that is used by B must remain unchanged for that.) Then I would like to have A and D in one solution, B and C in another. But that would only work if I could have an intact "complete" solution containing A,B,C and D if I want to build all projects from scratch. Once that build is complete, I could open my A/D-solution and edit/build only those 2 projects. But I fear there is no elegant solution for my problem. (pun not intended)
