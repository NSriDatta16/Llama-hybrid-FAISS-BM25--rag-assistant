iPad Application jettisoned while Allocations Instrument shows no unusual memory usage

I'm seeing my app being jettisoned due to low memory. In trying to track down the problem, I ran the app through the Allocations instrument. Unfortunately, I couldn't see any problem with the memory usage when it was killed. At the time of ejection, the app was playing a video, and had been for about 45 seconds. There were no touches or other events as far as I can tell that contributed. The crash report and a shot of instruments: Incident Identifier: AF9F802D-F9B9-406D-951F-675AEE9ACCDF CrashReporter Key: 0563d9f62086be9f13ffd2d60b3b0bec7c5d677e OS Version: iPhone OS 3.2.1 (7B405) Date: 2010-09-03 10:28:20 +0100 Free pages: 693 Wired pages: 22014 Purgeable pages: 0 Largest process: Wheel Processes Name UUID Count resident pages Wheel 18864 (jettisoned) (active) DTMobileIS 1697 notification_pro 72 notification_pro 72 syslog_relay 71 ptpd 253 lsd 162 notifyd 63 BTServer 213 CommCenter 187 SpringBoard 4281 (active) accessoryd 112 configd 356 fairplayd.K48 81 locationd 626 mDNSResponder 144 mediaserverd 1624 lockdownd 283 MobileStorageMou 72 syslogd 69 launchd 88 **End** Is there anything else I can do to trace the cause of the jettison? Does anyone know what the Count resident pages number in the crash report means? EDIT Is there any way of getting the count of resident pages as the app runs?
