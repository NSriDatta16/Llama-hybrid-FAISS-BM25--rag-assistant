Putting together some comments: A simple approach is to use color coding for the biological replicates, with the same color used for all the technical replicates performed on an animal or sample. (Use colors that can be distinguished by color-blind individuals.) That way, the reader can see all the raw data while easily distinguishing technical variability (dispersion of same-color values) from biological variability (dispersion among colors). If color coding isn't feasible, use other visual cues like shapes. One warning: For statistical analysis, I'd average the technical replicates in advance (meaning that three values for each group remain) and then only compare the means. It's generally better to include all of your technical replicates rather than taking the mean first. If you code each data point with both the animal and the group it belonged to, statistical software can do the within-animal averaging of technical replicates and then provide estimates not only of differences between groups but also of the magnitude of the technical variability. That can end up being very useful information.
