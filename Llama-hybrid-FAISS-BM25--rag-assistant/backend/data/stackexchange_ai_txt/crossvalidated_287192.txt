Need a good book on Dirichlet Process

Was curious if there is any good book on Dirichlet Process (DP). I'm reading the DBA 3 by Andrew Gelman and I didn't understand it well enough. I was curious if there is a book that go into it a bit more. To clarify, I think Dirichlet Process is chapter 23 and 24. I can't read through all the book before getting to 23 and 24 to read it. Also the book is a bit dry and assume previous chapter. I know there are currently youtube videos on DP in machine learning classes and it didn't seem like I need 23-24 chapters for it. Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning by David Barber have a suggested chapters to read for certain class and DP only requires 4-5 chapters in there. I'm reading some Bayesian hierarchical modeling in ecology and the book approach is first model it down then translate to Bayesian graphic model then breaks it down. I'd like the model focus first book instead of theory like BDA 3 seems to be doing.
