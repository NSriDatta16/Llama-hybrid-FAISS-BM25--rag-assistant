Which metric use to see how separate are the distributions?

I'm doing a dimension reduction, I would like to know which approach is separating better the classes, and How I can measure this? I have two approaches: How can I prove that my approach is separating 'better' than with PCA and How I can see which classes are more entangled with another. P.s.: I don't want to use any classification metric. I need to know how I can compare each distribution and see how entangled(correlated) are they. This My custom: And with PCA:
