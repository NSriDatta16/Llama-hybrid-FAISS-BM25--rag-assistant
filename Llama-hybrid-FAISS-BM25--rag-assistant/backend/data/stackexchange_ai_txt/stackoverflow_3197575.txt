You can use Change Tracking or Change Data Capture . These are technologies built into the Engine for tracking changes and are leveraging the Replication infrastructure (log reader or table triggers). Both are only available in SQL Server 2008 or 2008 R2 and CDC requires Enterprise Edition licensing. Anything else you'd try to do would ultimately boil down to either one of: reading the log for changes (which is only doable by Replication, including Change Data Capture, otherwise the Engine will recycle the log before you can read it) track changes in triggers (which is what Change Tracking would use) track changes in application There just isn't any Free Lunch. If audit is a requirement, then the overhead of auditing has to be taken into consideration and capacity planning must be done accordingly. All data audit solution will induce significant overhead, so the an increase of operating cost by factors of 2x, 4x or even 10x are not unheard of.
