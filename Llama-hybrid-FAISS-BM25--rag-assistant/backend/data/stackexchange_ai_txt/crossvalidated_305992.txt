For causal inference you want guarantees that your estimates are unbiased. This paper gives a procedure for generating confidence intervals for random forests, while this paper proves that they are consistent and asymptotically normal. Both papers however deal with regression forests, and not classification forests. It seems like a thoroughly possible extension, but I'm not aware that it has yet been studied in detail.
