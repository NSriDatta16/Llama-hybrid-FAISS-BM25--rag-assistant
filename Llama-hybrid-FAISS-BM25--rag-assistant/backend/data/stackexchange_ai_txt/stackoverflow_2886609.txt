How to make multiple windows using Win32 API

I see plenty of tutorials and articles showing me how to make a simple windows program, which is great but none of them show me how to make multiple windows. Right now I have working code that creates and draws a layered window and I can blit stuff using GDI to draw anything I want on it, drag it around, even make it transparent, etc. But I wanted a second rectangular area that I can draw to, drag around, etc. In other words, a second window. Probably want it to be a child window. Question is, how do I make it? Also, if anybody knows any good resources (online preferably) like articles or tutorials for window management in the Windows API, please share.
