Should estimates over a subsample be similar to the full sample when using panel data?

I am estimating the effect of $x$ on $y$; $y$ and $x$ are available both by city and by year. During the first period, $T_1$, both $x$ and $y$ generally increase. During the second period, $T_2$, both generally decrease. I have about 30 cities over 40 years. How can I use regression to attribute the average effect of $x$ on $y$ to the overall average increase in $y$ during $T_1$ and the same for the decrease in $T_2$? For example, I want to say something like during period $T_1$, $x$ can explain 5% of the increase in $y$ over $T_1$. How would I compute $x$? Normally, I divide the coefficient by the average difference between the last year and the first year, but that approach does not sound sensible if $x$ and $y$ both increase and then decrease. I find statistically significant results when I do the regression over the entire time period. However, if I break it separately to just subperiods, $T_1$ and $T_2$, neither are statistically significant and the coefficients change sign. Is that simply because the smaller sample makes the standard errors blow up? Should I find effects of $x$ and $y$ over subsamples of the panel?
