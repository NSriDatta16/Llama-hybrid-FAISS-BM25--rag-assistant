That's an example of an SVM classifier for 2-dimentional feature space. It means you've got only 2 real-valued features $x_1$ and $x_2$ and those circles and squares are objects. The painted objects are the support objects. You're right, for document classification you'd need to use more than 2 features, but it's more difficult to illustrate the concept in 3-dimentional space and impossible with higher dimensions. Also, for document classification you usually represent a document (an object) as a vector of features (not a single feature). These features could be tf-idf for instance.
