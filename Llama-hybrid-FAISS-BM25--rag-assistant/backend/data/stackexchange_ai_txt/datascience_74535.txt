There is an open source platform for visualization called Grafana, that is a very powerful and flexible software used also for monitoring time series. They support annotation . That tool is pretty powerful and versatile, you can read data from a variety of data sources . Then once annotated as in the picture, you can query the Grafana annotation database to retrieve all the annotations/labels that you put thanks to the Grafana annotation API . Bonus tip 1: you can add customised tags on your annotation so that you can get additional info on your data (e.g. anomaly_A, anomaly_B, flat_normal_data). Bonus tip 2: you can also show only one specific kind of anomaly still in the same platform thanks to this functionality. Future improvements: extension to this powerful features are in discussion, so that it will be even more easy to annotate in presence of diagrams displaying multiple time series at ones (e.g. anomaly of many time series ). Applications: anomaly detection labelling, medical signal annotation, stock market annotation, etc.
