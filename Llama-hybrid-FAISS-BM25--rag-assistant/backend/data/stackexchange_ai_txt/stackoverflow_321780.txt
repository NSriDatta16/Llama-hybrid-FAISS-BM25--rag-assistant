I wouldn't use it that often but it has its uses. I have used it to add a header that suppressed some warnings to all cpp files so that I could turn on /W4 or /Wall for the project and not have to edit all of the cpp files to include the warning suppression header first. Once eveything was working I DID go back and edit all the cpp files but for a proof of concept /FI was useful. Likewise you can use it to force a precompiled header into cpp files in some build configurations but not in all (in case you want to have a build configuration that DOESNT use precompiled headers and that makes sure that each cpp only includes exactly what it needs to). However using #pragma hdrstop is, IMHO, a better way to achieve this. I've talked about all of this on my blog here: http://www.lenholgate.com/blog/2004/07/fi-stlport-precompiled-headers-warning-level-4-and-pragma-hdrstop.html in a little more detail.
