How many samples do I need for OCR problems?

I am thinking about collecting samples of hand written digits (0 to 9) from people. I'll try to test different algorithms for optimal character recognition- some form of neural network and random forest may be! I have planned to collect 20 entries from each person (the same digit being asked to write twice) so that I can make a training set and a test set. Is my idea correct? How should I statistically decide how many samples will suffice?
