I had the same problem today. Curl comes with an outdated file to authenticate HTTPS certificates from. get the new one from: http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem save it into some dir on your site and add curl_setopt ($curl_ch, CURLOPT_CAINFO, dirname(__FILE__)."/cacert.pem"); To every request :-) IGNORE any dumbass comments about disabling CURLOPT_VERIFYPEER and CURLOPT_VERIFYHOST!! That leaves your code vulnerable to man in the middle attacks! December 2016 edit: Solve this properly by using Jasen's method mentioned below. add curl.cainfo=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt to you php.ini October 2017 edit: There is now a composer package that helps you manage the ca certificates, so that you're not vulnerable if your cacert.pem becomes outdated due to revoking certificates. https://github.com/paragonie/certainty -> composer require paragonie/certainty:dev-master
