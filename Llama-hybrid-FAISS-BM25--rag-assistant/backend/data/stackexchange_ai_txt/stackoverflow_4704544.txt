php PCRE regex to get only the file name that terminates in .txt

so I am trying to form a PCRE regex in php, specifically for use with preg_replace, that will match any number of characters that make up a text(.txt) file name, from this I will derive the directory of the file. my initial approach was to define the terminating .txt string, then attempt to specify a character match on every character except for the / or \, so I ended up with something like: '/[^\\\\/]*\.txt$/' but this didn't seem to work at all, I assume it might be interpreting the negation as the demorgan's form aka: (A+B)' A'B' but after attempting this test: '/[^\\\\]\|[^/]*\.txt$/' I came to the same result, which made me think that I shouldn't escape the or operator(|), but this also failed to match. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
