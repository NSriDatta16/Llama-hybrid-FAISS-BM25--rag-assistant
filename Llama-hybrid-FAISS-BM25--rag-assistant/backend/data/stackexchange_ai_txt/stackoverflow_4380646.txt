I tried the following CLEAN ALL - didnt work DELETE APP ON PHONE/ DELETE BUILD/ RESTART XCODE - didnt work THIS DID WORK Plug out phone Delete Symbol files folder /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1 (8C148) Restart xcode plug in phone Organizer pops up with message about Unknown IOS detected HIt Ok to collect Takes about a minute. the folder is recreated /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1 (8C148) App deployed to device fine after. I took the folder from Trash for /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1 (8C148) and compared it in Deltawalker to the new version of /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1 (8C148) and only timestamp differences. The number of files and size of each was identical. Theres 380 files in /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1 (8C148) POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR ME I had downloaded the GM seed of Xcode and iOS 4.2 and tested on another phone. My IPhone 4 I upgraded from ITunes like a normal customer. Then tried to deploy my app from this GM seed version of Xcode to public released version of iOS 4.2.1.
