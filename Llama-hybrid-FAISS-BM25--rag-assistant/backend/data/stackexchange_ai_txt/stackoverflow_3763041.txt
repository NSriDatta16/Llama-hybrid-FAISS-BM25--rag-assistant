If you are just trying to get the best predictive model, then perhaps it doesn't matter too much, but for anything else, don't bother with this sort of model selection. It is wrong. Use a shrinkage methods such as ridge regression (in lm.ridge() in package MASS for example), or the lasso, or the elasticnet (a combination of ridge and lasso constraints). Of these, only the lasso and elastic net will do some form of model selection, i.e. force the coefficients of some covariates to zero. See the Regularization and Shrinkage section of the Machine Learning task view on CRAN.
