Q function is an estimate of discounted reward for given state and action. Specifically, of the expected value of that reward. There's no direct reason to read Q matrix as a distribution. On the other hand, there's a traditional approach for randomized action selection that addresses the exploration-exploitation problem. It's name is softmax.
