Disable selection on table

I'm in the midst of implementing drag/drop functionality on a table. How it works: User left-clicks on a row; the row gets dimmed and a span is added to the DOM. The span acts as a place-holder for the row and follows the cursor as long as the user holds down the left mouse-button. The headache: When holding down the left mouse-button while moving the mouse; text and images in the table gets highlighted (selected). Is there any way to disable selection on elements, other than the CSS 3 user-highlight property?
