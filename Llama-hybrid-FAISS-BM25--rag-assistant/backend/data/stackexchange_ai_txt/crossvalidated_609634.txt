You interpret a logit-link beta regression output in a same way that you would interpret a logit-link logistic regression. We are modelling the expectation of the Beta-distributed Random Variable $Y$ , via a logit link. Your model is something like: $$ \text{logit} ( E[Y] ) = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \cdots $$ Let's say that $x_1$ is your $[0,1]$ proportional predictor, and $x_2$ is your binary predictor. Interpretation of $x_1$ : it's probably not useful to do the usual "an increase in $x_1$ by 1 results in a ..." interpretation. You may want to say something like "and increase in $x_1$ by 1 percentage point (i.e. 0.01) results in an increase in the odds by a factor of $\exp(0.01 \times b_1)$ ." Interpretation of $x_2$ : basically a standard interpretation: " $x_2 = 1$ (or whatever the class label is) corresponds to an increase in the odds by a factor of $\exp(b_2)$ ".
