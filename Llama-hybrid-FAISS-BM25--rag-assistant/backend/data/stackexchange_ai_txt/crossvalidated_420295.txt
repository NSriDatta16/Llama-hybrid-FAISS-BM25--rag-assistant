In additional to the reasons mentioned above, the distance of a point $x$ to a hyperplane defined by slope $\theta$ and intercept $b$ is $$\frac{|\theta^T x + b|}{||\theta||}$$ This is how the concept of margin in SVM is movitated. If you change the $\theta$ to include the intercept term $b$ , the norm of the $\theta$ will be affected by the size of the intercept, which will cause the SVM to optimize towards a small intercept, which does not make sense in many cases.
