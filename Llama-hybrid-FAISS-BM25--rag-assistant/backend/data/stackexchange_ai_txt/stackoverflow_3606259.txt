Does Perl language aim at producing fast programs at runtime?

I recently had a friend tell me "see perl was never designed to be fast" Is that true? The relevant piece of information I can find is this from Wikipedia : The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). But it doesn't directly talk about speed. I think that with all the text processing that it needs to do, speed of execution really matters for a language like Perl. And with all the weird syntax, elegance was never an objective, I agree. Was high speed of execution one of the design objectives of Perl?
