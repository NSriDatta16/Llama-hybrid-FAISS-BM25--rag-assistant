From a practical perspective, I have made the experience that most of the methods you mention (lasso, CART, MARS, etc.) remove redundant predictors to some extent . However, even applying those methods, redundant predictors can still have a negative impact on your out-of-sample predictive performance. Besides overfitting, usually throwing in all kinds of predictors you find increases to noise-to-signal ratio. And this makes it harder for all kinds to methods to create a good predictive model - even for the powerful methods like random forests. So it is important to reflect on the model you are building. One the other hand, the model-building human will not always know which variables are reasonable predictors. There is no free lunch here, unfortunately, and the best is usually to experiment a lot and learn to know your data well.
