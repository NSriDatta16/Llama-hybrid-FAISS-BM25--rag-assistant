What exactly is the bias when using training / validation / testing data?

So reading through this article , my understanding of training, validation, and testing datasets in the context of machine learning is training data: data sample used to fit the parameters of a model validation data: data sample used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data while tuning model hyperparameters. The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration. test data: data sample used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data What I am confused about is what exactly is the bias that is referred to in the validation and testing datasets? I am fairly certain the source of that bias is the training data, but it is not clear to me what exactly is the cause of that bias? My best guess is that the training data may not be completely representative of the whole population of the data, so the ability of the model to generalize to unseen data may be compromised as that data only knows the training data. Is this guess accurate or is there something more I am missing?
