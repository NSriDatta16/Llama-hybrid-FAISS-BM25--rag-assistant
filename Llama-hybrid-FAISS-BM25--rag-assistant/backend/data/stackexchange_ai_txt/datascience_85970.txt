My dataset would only contain data about earthquake occurrences and no data about non-earthquake occurrences as that would basically be any other period of time which is not kept in the dataset. It would be nice if you could specify the features used for the prediction. In that case, I assume a decision tree or logistic regression would not work as we don't have a dichotomous dependent variable (as the occurrence only gets into the dataset if an earthquake occurred). Here you are right!. So it's better to resort to anomaly detection algorithms for the same. Here are some examples Unsupervised anomaly detection Outlier detection Anomaly detection in python
