Comparing K-means and perceptrons doesn't make sense, they are different types of algorithms. K-means doesn't have a generalization ability at all, since it is an unsupervised algorithm, and generalization is a property of supervised learning algorithms . If you are changing it to behave like a supervised algorithm , than it will have poor generalization ability compared to the perceptron, because K-means will have a tendency to overfit the data since it is forced to assign a cluster to each of its data points. If you want to compare perceptron's performance to other algorithms, you should compare it to k-NN (K nearest neighbors), Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines.
