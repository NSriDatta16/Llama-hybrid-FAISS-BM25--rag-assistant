JGraph - overriding cell drag

This is quite a long shot, I know it's a question about a very specific package. I'm trying to stop nodes from dragging into a certain area of the graph. I have written code to detect when the mouse is dragged over a node, however it is a bit of a hack. I am trying to get the node that the mouse is dragging and its XY co-ordinates but have no idea how to do it. I can't find any methods to override this, the marquee handler doesn't get called for a node drag. I'm looking at overriding the BasicUI class, but don't know
