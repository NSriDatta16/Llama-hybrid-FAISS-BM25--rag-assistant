Drawing a Dragons curve in Python

I am trying to work out how to draw the dragons curve, with pythons turtle using the An L-System or Lindenmayer system. I no the code is something like the Dragon curve; initial state = ‘F’, replacement rule – replace ‘F’ with ‘F+F-F’, number of replacements = 8, length = 5, angle = 60 But have no idea how to put that into code.
