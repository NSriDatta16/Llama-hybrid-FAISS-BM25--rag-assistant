By the nature of the type of website I build, I usually include Auth and possibly ACL from the outset. Probably i28n too - from an early age I was encouraged not to put text in views, but to use system message calls. I don't use plugins - I've never had one that worked for less work than I could build one. I cut and paste my way from one project to another.
