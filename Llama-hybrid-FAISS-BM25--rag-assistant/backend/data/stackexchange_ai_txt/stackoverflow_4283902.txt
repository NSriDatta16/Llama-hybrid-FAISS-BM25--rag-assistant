It's pretty big hacking. gwt-dnd handles mouse events by MouseDragHandler class and it's tightly coupled with AbstractDragController, so you must provide your own implementation of this handler (just extend it) which will call onMouseDown and onMouseUp methods on your click events. But you must also override AbstractDragController, so you end up rewriting half of the library.
