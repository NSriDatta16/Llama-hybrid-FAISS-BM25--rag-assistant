GridSearchCV in general performs cross-validation (by default, 5-fold), and (by default) selects the set of hyperparameter values that give the best performance (on average across the 5 test folds). It (by default) uses the estimator's score method to evaluation performance on the test folds. In the case of KernelDensity , score gives the log-likelihood of the test data in the estimated density.
