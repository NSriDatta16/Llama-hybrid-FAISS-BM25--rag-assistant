If you are trying to determine if there is a significant difference in the average (or more generally center ) of the distribution of scores and you have scores on both questions by all subjects then you could use the Wilcoxon signed rank test which is a paired test. If not all subjects answered both questions the unpaired Wilcoxon rank sum test is a reasonable choice.
