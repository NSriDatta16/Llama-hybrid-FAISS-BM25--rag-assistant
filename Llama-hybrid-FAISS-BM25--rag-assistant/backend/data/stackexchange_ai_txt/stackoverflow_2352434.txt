from all possible solutions choose one that is easily testable. implement a test implement the code. Repeat until I have the functionality I need to actually solve the problem. Now check if the code is clean enough. Most of the time it won't. In that case, refactor until it is clean. Clean enough means: Either considerably cleaner then the average piece of code in the project, or as clean as I am able to write it. Whatever is reached earlier. Ok I have to admit, this is atleast how I try to write my code. Choosing the solution by testability as a side effect prefers the well designed solutions.
