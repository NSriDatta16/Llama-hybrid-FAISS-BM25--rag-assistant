You would do this as: memberThatIsAUShort = BitConverter.ToUInt16(tempArray,3) memberThatIsAShort = BitConverter.ToInt16(tempArray,6) These methods are both static (hence BitConverter casing), and already provide a startIndex parameter. Since BitConverter already knows the appropriate number of bytes for a short/ushort, you don't need to specify end indices. For details, see BitConverter.ToUInt16 and BitConverter.ToInt16 .
