cobertura vs clover

We are thinking about utilizing one of these tools in our development procedure. Our environment extensively uses mvn and eclipse. Which one in your opinion is the best utility for checking test coverage? I realize that it may depend on the situation to determine when it is better to use cobertura over clover and vice-versa. Thanks in advance
