Having used Telerik, DevExpress and Infragistcs I would say there isn't one that meets all my needs. Sure, they all have about the same components (grids, tabs, "user control du jour") but controls perform better than others within each suite. You really need to evaluate the specific problem you trying to solve and see which control from which vendor works best.
