Autocovariance - expectation across all time indices?

I am new to time series analysis and I came across the following definition of autocovariance: $\gamma_h(Y) = \mathbb{E}[(y_t - \mu_t)(y_{t-h}-\mu_{t-h})]$ It should tell us, how correlated are two rv's of our process at some specific $t$ and $t-h$. My question is: Is the expectation in this formula taken with respect to all indices of the stochastic process (then why is it not taken into account in the formula?), and if yes, why do we estimate the autocorrelation with the following formula? $\hat{\gamma}_h = \sum_{t=h+1}^T(y_t - \bar{y})(y_{t-h}-\bar{y})$, where $\bar{y}$ is the sample average. Doesn't the second formula estimate rather the average correlation of rv's in our process, that are $h$ time units apart, than the correlation between rv's at specific point in time $t$ and $t-h$?
