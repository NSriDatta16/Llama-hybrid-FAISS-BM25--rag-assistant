For time series forecasting using machine learning, is feature engineering only needed for the y variable or is it needed for all x variables also?

Say I am trying to predict house prices (y variable) using population growth and GDP (x variables) using XGBoost or Neural Networks. All 3 are time series. I understand that I have to feature engineer lags and also a rolling average of house prices and include them as additional features for better prediction. My question is, do i have to do the same (produce lags and rolling averages) for my x variables - GDP and population growth - and include them as additional variables?
