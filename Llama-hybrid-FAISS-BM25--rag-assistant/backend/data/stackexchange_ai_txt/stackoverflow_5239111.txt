SSRS 2005 Keep textbox and textfield together when page break occurs

Problem I don't have a details row or anything. I have simply a body and I dragged on textboxes for labeling textfields from my dataset. The problem is when one of the fields has too much data for the current page, it "page-breaks" at the start of the field leaving the textbox (label for the field) behind on the previous page. What I've tried Put the data field and the textbox label a) inside a rectangle - didn't work b) inside a list and the list inside a rectangle - didn't work c) inside a list with keep together property set to TRUE or FALSE - didn't work Question How would I group the textbox and the textfield so that regardless of where the pagebreak happens it includes its label?
