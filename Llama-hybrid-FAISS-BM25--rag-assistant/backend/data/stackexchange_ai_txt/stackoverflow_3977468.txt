To save the document to the database, there are two schools of thought. Save the file as a blob in a field in a row Put the file on a server filesystem that clients can access, and put the filename in the database I wrote a few blog entries that detail the pros and cons of each approach: http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/loufranco/archive/2007/12/03/images-in-databases-part-i-what-to-store.aspx http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/loufranco/archive/2007/12/04/images-in-databases-part-ii-web-images-are-random-access.aspx http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/loufranco/archive/2009/04/28/document-storage-database-blobs-or-the-filesystem.aspx What it comes down to is convenience (blobs) vs. performance (filesystem) -- the bigger the files, the more you would prefer using the filesystem. If you are using a current version of SQL Server, then there is a filesystem field type that you will give you the convenience as well -- so that is the best of both worlds, but isn't standard. As for getting the information out of the images, you need OCR. The best open-source OCR is Tesseract from Google. If you'd like to look at commercial options, my company, Atalasoft, sells OCR engines and we have a .NET wrapper of Tesseract .
