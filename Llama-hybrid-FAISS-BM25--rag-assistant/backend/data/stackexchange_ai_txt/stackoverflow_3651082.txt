I believe, the current version of Fullcalendar only supports displaying the events, not adding new events. So, you will have to create your own solution. From their webpage: DISCLAIMER: FullCalendar is great for displaying events, but it isn't a complete solution for event content-management. Beyond dragging an event to a different time/day, you cannot change an event's name or other associated data. It is up to you to add this functionality through FullCalendar's event hooks.
