@DMan, I agree that he can't create them in FlashDevelop but sure he can import them into FlashDevelop if he done them in Pencil or Synfig. The story here is that those animations/movieclips are SWF files not FLA and so they have an open format which can be dealt with easily by FlashDevelop. If you have the gut and courage to do it, you can really create animations manually by modifying a plain SWF file byte codes. The format to do it is somehow complex but it is possible, this procedure gives a simple approach: DefineShape (here you define your shape with its ID, bounds and a structure describes the shape precisely). PlaceObject: this adds the character to the display list. ShowFrame: here we tell Flash Player that its time to render the display list contents on the screen and that is our 1st frame. But of course, it gets more and more complicated with adding more effects/animations, that's why you may want to create an open source designer to be combined with FlashDevelop to complete your development framework.
