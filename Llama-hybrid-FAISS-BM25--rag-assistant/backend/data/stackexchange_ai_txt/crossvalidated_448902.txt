Decision tree- Alternative model to predict this data?

My data looks something this (for example): V1 V2 Type Calification T T 0 0 F F 0 5 T F 2 0 T T 3 5 T F 0 3 F T 4 0 Where V1 and V2 take the values TRUE or FALSE, type takes the values of 0 to 4 and calification takes the value 0 to 5. The variable that I want to predict is Type. I was using decision trees for each type, that is, a decision tree is made only for type 0, another for type 1 and so on with the other types. So the tree with the highest predicted calification would be chosen. For example, Suposse that the independent variables that I inserte are V1 and V2 (T, T), then In each tree the predicted calification will be as follows Tree | Predicted_Calification t0 | 0 t1 | 0 t2 | 0 t3 | 5 t4 | 3 So I choose the tree with the highest calification and thus the type, so that the predicted type would be 3. The decision tree for the type 0, 1 ,2,4are: The firts is for type 0 and the second is for type 1,2,3. Is there any other model that can solve this problem without the need to create so many decision trees? I know that this problem can be easily solved with if-else, but the goal is to perform this task through a machine learning algorithm
