It is not a requirement to extend OrmLiteBaseActivity . You'll just need to manage more of the utility functions yourself. Your best option would be to create your own DatabaseHelper inside your activity and to manage how many users there are of it and to discard it when it is done being used. Generally speaking, this is the utility that the OrmLiteBaseActivity gives to you. A mechanism which will manage your database objects for you. It's just a convenience. Example: private static Dao agentDao = null; public void someMethod() { if(agentDao == null){ helper = (MyDBHelper) OpenHelperManager.getHelper(getContext()); try { agentDao = helper.getAgentDao(); } catch (SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } I had implemented a method to return my DAOs on the class MyDBHelper. Take a look at the ORMLite Android Javadoc as well as the more general ORMLite Core Javadoc . There are lots of good examples out there.
