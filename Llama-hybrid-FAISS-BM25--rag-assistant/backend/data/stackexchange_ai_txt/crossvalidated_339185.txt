We came across an interesting phenomena a few years ago , when investigating Bayesian model choice with ABC. Which I think is related with this question. There is indeed a notion of sufficiency for Bayesian model choice that does not seem particularly meaningful outside the Bayesian approach. Given two models $$\mathfrak{M}_1=\{f_\theta(\cdot); \theta\in\Theta\}$$ and $$\mathfrak{M}_2=\{g_\xi(\cdot); \xi\in\Xi\}$$ and a sample $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ from one of these two models, a statistic $S$ is sufficient for model choice or across model iff the distribution of $\mathbf{X}$ conditional on $S(\mathbf{X})$ does not depend on either the model index (1 or 2) or the parameter value within the model. When such sufficient statistics exist, a Bayes factor based on $\mathbf{X}$ is the same as a Bayes factor based on $S(\mathbf{X})$. While this is a definition that is not Bayesian per se, I see no direct application outside Bayesian model choice.
