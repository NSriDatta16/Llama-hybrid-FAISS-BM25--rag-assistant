I had a similar problem and I have spent several days testing only to find no answer. Suppose we have a dropdownlist filled with colors. each time I change the value I make a partial postback with ajax to save the value and do a couple more things like checking stocks. I choose (in this order): red, white, blue, green. then I hit checkout and when I go back to my surprise the red color is selected. I go back again and I get white selected. then blue and finally green after going back four times. I tried at IE and FF and found there it works fine so it's not a bug in the code. it has to be something with the chrome. anybody can help with this? edit: I tried with another webpage I'm making and there it works fine but I can't find any differences between them that could cause it. Edit2: I found a way to "solve" it using ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript at the navigate event to write a script that sets the values correctly instead of doing it at codebehind . It's not a very elegant way but it worked for me and I hope for others with a similar problem.
