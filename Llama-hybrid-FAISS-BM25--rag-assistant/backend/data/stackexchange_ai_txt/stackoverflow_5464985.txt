For drag&drop: Examples: http://gwtquery-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/droppable/demo/GwtPortletSample/GwtPortletSample.html Check out the project at: http://code.google.com/p/gwtquery-plugins/wiki/DragAndDropPluginForGWTDeveloppers For GWT I suggest you stay away from GXT (it can be pretty daunting to ingest GWT and GXT all at once, believe me!). Plain GWT should be enough for your app. For domain data model Persistence is not that easy. Are you working all of this alone?! I've gone through a lot of trouble get things working together. So I suggest you use persistence packages like Datanucleus or Hibernate. Make your data model as simple as possible, it will save you time. Pretty big project you have there. Also, don't start from scratch. Search a GWT project in code.google.com which is maintained for you to accelerate development. Here is one example using GWT + Maven + Objectify. http://code.google.com/p/listwidget/ Good luck!
