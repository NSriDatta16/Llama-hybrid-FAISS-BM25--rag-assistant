How do you make CSS repeat-y repeat over a dynamic height?

I have the following HTML and CSS: Some content goes here .content { overflow: hidden; } .leftbg { background: url("./leftbg.png") repeat-y scroll top left transparent; margin-left: 0; float: left; width: 10px; } .innercontent { width: 600px; float: left; margin-left: 0; } .rightbg { /* similar to left bg except for the right side */ } The problem that I am having is the leftbg image is only repeating until it reaches the height of the paragraph in the innercontent div. I am accessing a database to grab the content for the innercontent div and hence the content will be of variable height. Is there any way to make it so that it repeats until it reaches the bottom of the leftbg (and rightbg) div? What I mean by that is for it to repeat until it is at the bottom of the innercontent div without setting the height as static (e.g. height: 200px;) because the height will be variable.
