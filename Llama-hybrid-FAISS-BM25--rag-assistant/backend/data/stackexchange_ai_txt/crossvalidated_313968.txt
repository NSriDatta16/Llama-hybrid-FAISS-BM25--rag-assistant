Forecasting costs with forecast interval using past performance

I'm trying to adopt a model for project cost forecasting in agile. Consider the following table of previous costs per sprint, along with story points completed: SP Cost Cost/SP 1 $4,632 $4,632 24 $1,128 $47 6 $2,680 $447 The average of Cost/SP across 3 sprints is \$1709 but (Total Cost)/(Total SP) is \$272. How do I name each of these averages ('sprint average', 'project average')? If I need to forecast the cost of the remaining 50SP with a forecast interval, what do I do? Using sprints, the average is \$1709, std deviation is \$1270, 68% confidence is \$21,466 - \$149,386 which is a bit extreme. Something close to $272 * 50 (\$13,600) makes more sense, but how to get a forecast interval for this?
