I use Zabbix extensively in production, which comes with a stack of useful defaults. Some examples of the sorts of things we've configured it to monitor: Network usage CPU usage (% user,system,nice times) Load averages (1m, 5m, 15m) RAM usage (real, swap, shm) Disc throughput Active connections (by port number) Number of processes (by process type) Ping time from remote location Time to SSL certificate expiry MySQL internals (query cache usage, num temporary tables in RAM and on disc, etc) Anything you can monitor with Zabbix, you can also attach triggers to - so it can restart failed services; or page you to alert about problems. Collect the data now, before performance becomes an issue. When it does, you'll be glad of the historical baselines, and the fact you'll be able to show what date and time problems started happening for when you need to hunt down and punish exactly which developer made bad changes :)
