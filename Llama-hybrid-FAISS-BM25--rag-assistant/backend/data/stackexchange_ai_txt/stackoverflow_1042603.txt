Heap As implemented by std::set ( c++ ) with comparison on the value (depends on the value stored), e.g. integers by value, strings by string ordering and so on. Good for ordering and access but not sure when you need to do reordering, is that during insertion, constantly and so on. You're not specifying what other constraints do you have. If number of elements is know and it is reasonable or possible to keep fixed array in memory then each position would be specified by index. Assumes fixed number of elements. You did not specify if you want operations you want to perform often. If you load up values once then access them without modification you can use one algorithm for creation then either build index or transform storage to be able to use fast access ...
