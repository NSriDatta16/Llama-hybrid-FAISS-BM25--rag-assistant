Detecting hand-written objects from images

Problem Statement: Identify the sub-region in an image with hand-written text/scribbling (Attaching an example for reference. Masked some text for privacy) Once I get the pixel values, I want to replace them with white pixels, so I remove the scribblings completely from the image. ( PS : I don't have a lot of training images to train a CNN. So, asking here in case the problem can be solved via a classical CV approach)
