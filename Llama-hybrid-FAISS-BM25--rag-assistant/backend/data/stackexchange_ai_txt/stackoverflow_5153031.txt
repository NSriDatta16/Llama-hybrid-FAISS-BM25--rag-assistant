I am working on a project in java for creating fractals (flame fractals). The user provides a script file in javascript, that takes care of the interpolation between fractals. Also, as input, one can provide a file that affects an animation in some way, so this is the way to make an animation change to some music, see for example http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imDPqR9cDL8 I can send you the source code if you provide me with an address.
