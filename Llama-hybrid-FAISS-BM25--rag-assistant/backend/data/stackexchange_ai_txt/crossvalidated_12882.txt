Classic hierarchical cluster analysis requires the proximity matrix to be symmetric. So, you have to symmetricize your matrix, for example, averaging elements above and below the diagonal. If it lacks triangular inequality, you can't use methods such as Ward, centroid, median, which are called "geometric" ones because they need distances be euclidean, - or metric at worst. Other methods, such as nearest neighbour, farthest neighbour, average linkage - you still can use them. Also, you might choose to rectify your dissimilarities into metric/euclidean by adding constant to all the elements. Iteratively add small value and check when the "double centrat" of the matrix looses negative eigenvalues. When it's lost, your dissimilarities got euclidean. Look here how to do double centering .
