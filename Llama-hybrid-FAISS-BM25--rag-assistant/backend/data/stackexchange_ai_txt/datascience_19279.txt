Basically it all depends on , which type of problem you are trying to solve. "Even the most experienced data scientists can’t tell which algorithm will perform best before trying them." So Here some parameter on which you can decide which algorithm you pick up for your machine learning problem. 1. Accuracy 2. Training time 3. Linearity 4. Number of parameters 5. Number of features Microsoft released a PDF cheatsheet of what machine learning algorithms to use, when. Download the cheatsheet (PDF) from its companion blog post titled “Machine learning algorithm cheat sheet for Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio“
