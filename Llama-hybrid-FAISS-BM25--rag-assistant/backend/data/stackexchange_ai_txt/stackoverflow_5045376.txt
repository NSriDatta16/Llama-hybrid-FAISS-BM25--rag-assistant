There is no concept of "active page" in CSS. In fact, the SitePoint Reference debunks this by saying: The pseudo-class does not signify a link to the active, or current, page—that’s a common misconception among CSS beginners. What the spec says is right: :active simply styles elements that are activated , e.g. clicked (as in the example given) or in some other way triggered such that the browser starts navigating to the link's target. Note that it doesn't just apply to elements; it may apply to any non-form-input element that's clicked. For instance, you can do this: p:active { color: red; } And any paragraph you click will flash its text red. Note however that the exact definition and implementation is left up to the browser, but in general , you can rely on elements having an activated state.
