Xml is not a fixed-width record format. It is very hard (read: don't bother) to edit the internals without re-writing it. In most sensible use-cases of xml this is fine and expected. If this is a problem, consider an alternative storage mechanism (a database leaps to mind), and simply import/export xml when needed.
