Time Series detrending with multiple polynomials

I'm currently working on energy demand forecasting using daily load data. I'm using data since 1990 and, in order to use ARIMAX models, I detrended the data (using a first-order polynomial) and then I removed seasonality. As we can see on this image , in the last two years there is (unfortunately) a different trend with respect the previous 15 years. I was thinking to use two different first-order polynomials to perform detrend: one fitted on the data 1990-2008 and another one for 2008-2010. What is the best way to do this? I'm not sure if I must use a spline or not. Can you suggest me the best-practice method to perform this kind of detrending? Thank you, P.S. I'm a computer scientist and I'm using R (and MATLAB). UPDATE This is the loess smothing with span 0.9 With span 0.5 and finally with span 0.1 I will try to perform detrending with span 0.5. ** UPDATE 2 ** This is the comparison with the time-series with the original detrend (top, a single first-order polynomial) and loess with span 0.5 (bottom). There is an important difference in the last years.
