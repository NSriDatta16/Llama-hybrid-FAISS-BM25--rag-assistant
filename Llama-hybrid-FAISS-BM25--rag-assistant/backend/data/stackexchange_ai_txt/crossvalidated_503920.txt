How to calculate the most stable component of the time series?

I have several datasets with monthly Sales. I was asked to estimate the 'fundamental' level of Sales. In other words, the portion of Sales that is relatively stable and 'smooth' over the time. My initial (and a very simple) proposal was to use Moving Average (e.g. 6 months). However, our new time series (orange line) will be often above/or below actual Sales (blue line). Next, I have decided to multiply Moving Average by the scalar (80% or 65%). This was just to lower the resuls. Unfortunately, I think this is not the right way to go: a) MovingAverageScalar80 (Grey line) is still above Sales sometimes. We can add min() function, but this may create sharp and jumping line. b) MovingAverageScalar65 (Yellow line) is more or less my goal. However, here we can see that the line is sometimes far from the actual Sales (e.g. up to 1966) Could you please suggest me any other techniqes I can use here? File with data: Dataset
