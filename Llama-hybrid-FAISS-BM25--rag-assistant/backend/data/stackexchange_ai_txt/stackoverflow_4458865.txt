How to drag an object from point A to B in DirectX with less frustration

I have to drag an object from point A to B like the scroll bar does it in Windows, the problem here is that the A and B does not have neither X or Y the same, so the movement is horizontal and vertical at the same time - diagonal. I did came up with an simple algorithm that based on the cursor position in a frame, updates the position of the object to be dragged. But for that I have to make the cursorX=objectX, and than calculate the objectY, or vice-versa. This makes the movement "less frustrating" for horizontal movement or vertical, respectively. So if the diagonal is close to the horizontal line, the part with cursorX=objectX makes it a better choice than with cursorY=objectY, and for the diagonal close to a vertical line " cursorY=objectY" makes it a better choice that the other one. The problem here is that I have to use a an general algorithm for both type of diagonals cause I have star polygon and the object has to be able to move from any corner to any corner. Here is the code I wrote, but it doesn't seems to move "right" as to be visual right and less frustrating for the user, I hope it will make more sens for the question. What I did at the end, used both methods as for vertical movement and for horizontal and devided by 2, so everybody is happy, bu that didn't do the trick: //calculating with x priority D3DXVECTOR2 resultPosX; resultPosX.x=nextMousePos.x; //firstCornerPos and secondCornerPos are the edges of a segment //on wich the object has to move resultPosX.y=prevObjPos.y+(nextMousePos.x-prevObjPos.x)*(secondCornerPos.y-firstCornerPos.y)/(secondCornerPos.x-firstCornerPos.x); //calculating with y priority D3DXVECTOR2 resultPosY; resultPosY.y=nextMousePos.y; resultPosY.x=prevObjPos.x+(nextMousePos.y-prevObjPos.y)*(secondCornerPos.x-firstCornerPos.x)/(secondCornerPos.y-firstCornerPos.y); //calculating the average result resultPos.x=(resultPosX.x+resultPosY.x)/2; resultPos.y=(resultPosX.y+resultPosY.y)/2;
