How to perform PCA in Matlab when number of dimensions is larger than number of observations?

I have a data matrix of say, $3000 \times 200$, i.e. I have $3000$-dimensional observations from $200$ subjects. How can I reduce the dimensionality to $1000$ in MATLAB? With bigger numbers, princomp() function causes an out of memory error . I tried princomp(data, 'econ'); but it only returns a $199$-by-$199$ matrix, so am I limited to the number of observations? I would appreciate an example of how to get the reduced data, if possible.
