Random walk on the edges of a cube

An ant is placed in a corner of a cube and cannot move. A spider starts from the opposite corner, and can move along the cube's edges in any direction $(x,y,z)$ with equal probability $1/3$. On average, how many steps will the spider need to get to the ant? (This is not homework, it was an interview question.)
