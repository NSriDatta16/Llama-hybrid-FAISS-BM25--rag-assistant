Create a header record in a table, grab back the ID of the inserted field. Create a file in your 'storage' directory with this id. To retrieve, for an arbitrary row, get the id, then retrieve the file with that id. Works for me, and lots of others. I think this is the most common way of doing this. That said, lots of SQL storage engines, SQL server included, have good BLob storage engines - though 500MB might be a bit much, especially if there's rapid turnover.
