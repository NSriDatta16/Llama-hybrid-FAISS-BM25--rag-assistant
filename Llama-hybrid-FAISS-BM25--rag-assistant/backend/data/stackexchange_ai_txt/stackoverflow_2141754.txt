how to save and retrieve cookies using ajax webservice calls

Hi I have web app which stores certain things on a page in a cookie when the page posts back in case the user doesn't finish what they're doing and come back later. But now I must do a javascript time-out and actively save the info to the cookie rather than wait for the user to postback. All my cookie code is on server side where I use Response and Request objects to read and write cookies and I want to leverage that. So I would like to just use ajax calls to a webservice. Is there a way for me to access Request and Response objects and read and write cookies to the browser via those objects during a webservice call? Or should I just go with javascript? EDIT: Sorry i wanted to specify that I would like to use jquery-ajax.
