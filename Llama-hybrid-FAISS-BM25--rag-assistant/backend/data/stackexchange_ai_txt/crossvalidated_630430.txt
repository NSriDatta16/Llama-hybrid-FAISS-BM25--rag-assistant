BIC not finding a maximum

I was trying to apply BIC to my dataset to find the ideal number of clusters and model that best fits my data, in order to use EM algorithm, but it´s not reaching a maximum, even if I increase the max number of components to 20. They keep increasing slowly but they don´t decrease. I have previously performed k-means and hierarchical clusterings which only required around 13 clusters. For context, I used PCA to reduce the dimension of my data (I had 35 variables and reduced them to 20 principal components). Then, I extracted the scores from those 20 components, and applied BIC. This is the relevant part of the code I used: data.transf The picture above was created using the command: plot(BIC, xlab="number of clusters") Is there something wrong? How should I proceed? It would be impractical to keep increasing the number of clusters more, as my dataset has 50.000 samples, and the code already takes a while to run.
