Mixed effects logistic regression type model in R - to use GLMER or not?

I was redirected here from stackoverflow - I'm struggling to figure out where to even put this question! I'm doing a project where I have students listen to 7 stimuli (all students listen to the same 7), and then say for each one whether that stimuli sounds more like PALM or TRAP. There are two groups of students, groupA and groupB (GroupA is younger than GroupB). I want to measure if the difference between their groups in their selection of choice PALM or TRAP across the stimuli is significant or not (i.e. do older students show a difference in their choice of PALM or TRAP depending on the stimuli and is this significant). I've been told to do a mixed effects logistic regression type model in R, but I've not used glmer much and I find it hard to use (not even sure if it's the right one to use). The only way I could get it to work was to put in the SUBJECT as a slope (?), but that doesn't seem right to me and the result is odd. I would really appreciate any suggestions because I don't really understand the statistics behind it and I don't know how to formulate the code because of this. My current code in R is this, where CHOICE = outcome resulting in choice of either PALM or TRAP, STIMULUS = stimuli 1 through to 7, GROUP = GroupA or GroupB, and SUBJECT is the participant ID (although I wondered if I should even keep this in) : table $GROUP GROUP) table $STIMULUS STIMULUS) table $CHOICE CHOICE) table $SUBJECT SUBJECT) contrast Response in the console: Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: CHOICE ~ STIMULUS * GROUP + (STIMULUS | SUBJECT) + (STIMULUS * GROUP | SUBJECT) Data: table AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 438.0945 507.8760 -202.0473 404.0945 431 Random effects: Groups Name Std.Dev.
