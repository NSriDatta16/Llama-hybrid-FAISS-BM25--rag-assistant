From MSDN (Package Class): Package is an abstract class that can be used to organize objects into a single entity of a defined physical format for portability and efficient access. And: A PackageRelationship ("relationship") defines an association between a source Package or PackagePart and a target object. A PackageRelationship can be one of two types, each of which can be one of two forms: * A package-level relationship (created by the Package.CreateRelationship method) relates a Package to either: o A target part in the package. o A target resource outside the package. * A part-level relationship (created by the PackagePart.CreateRelationship method) relates a source PackagePart to either: o Another target part in the package. o A target resource outside the package. So, when creating a Package , if you want to indicate that there is a relationship between an object to another part of the package, you should use a PackageRelationship to indicate what kind of relationship it is. A ZipPackage can also be used to work with Open Office XML files - in this use case, it is sometime useful to indicate relationships of objects to each other. See here .
