InnoSetup: Getting AppName in [Code] section

I'm creating an installer using InnoSetup , and writing some custom handlers in a [Code] section. In one of the handlers, I would like to be able to retrieve the value of the AppName (or, potentially, the value of other parameters) defined in the [Setup] section. Is there a way for me to do this? I've looked though the documentation , but I haven't found anything that would allow me to do this. Our InnoSetup files are actually generated by our build process, which stitches together fragments that are common between all of our programs and that are program specific, so it would be inconvenient to have to define constants in the code for each program. Is there any convenient way to do this? I'm looking for something like MyString := ExpandConstant('{AppName}'); Except {AppName} is not a defined constant. Is there some way to query for parameters defined in the [Setup] section?
