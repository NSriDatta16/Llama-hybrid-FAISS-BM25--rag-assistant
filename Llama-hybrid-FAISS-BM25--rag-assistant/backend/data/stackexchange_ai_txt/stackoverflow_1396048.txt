C# - elegant way of partitioning a list?

I'd like to partition a list into a list of lists, by specifying the number of elements in each partition. For instance, suppose I have the list {1, 2, ... 11}, and would like to partition it such that each set has 4 elements, with the last set filling as many elements as it can. The resulting partition would look like {{1..4}, {5..8}, {9..11}} What would be an elegant way of writing this?
