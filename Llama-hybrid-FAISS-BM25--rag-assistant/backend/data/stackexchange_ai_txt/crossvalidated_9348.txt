I can't think of any reason why Ward should favor any metric. Ward's method is just another option to decide which clusters to fusion next during agglomeration. This is achieved by finding the two clusters whose fusion will minimize a certain error ( examplary source for the formula ). Hence it relies on two concepts: The mean of vectors which (for numerical vectors) is generally calculated by averaging over every dimension separately. The distance metric itself i.e. the concept of similarity expressed by this metric. So: As long as the properties of the choosen metric (like e.g. rotation,translation or scale invariance) satisfy your needs (and the metric fits to the way the cluster mean is calculated), I don't see any reason to not use it. I suspect that most people suggest the euclidean metric because they want to increase the weight of the differences between a cluster mean and a single observation vector (which is done by quadration) or because it came out as best metric in the validation based on their data or because it is used in general.
