You are not missing, the text seems to miss explanation. The important takeaway is how do use Fuzzy logic where embedding values are nearly same for two classes. The example discussed: h1 =[-1.2,2.3] q~ = [.0293,.9797] q =[.03,.99] (assuming e =.001) Apply threshold (0.5) r =[0,1] Fuzzy encoding will be helpful when all classes have value below threshold. For eg: h =[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] q~ = [.1,.1,.1,.1,.1,.1,.1,.1,.1,.1] q = [.99,.99,.99,.99,.99,.99,.99,.99,.99,.99] r = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] Fuzzy encoding ensures that all classes with similar embedding value get same class. h = [1.2,1.3] q~ = [.475,.525] q = [.9,.99] r =[1,1]
