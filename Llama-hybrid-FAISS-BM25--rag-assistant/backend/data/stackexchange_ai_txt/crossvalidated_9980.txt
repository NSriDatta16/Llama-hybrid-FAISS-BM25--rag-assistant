Check the article by Wu Chen Hastie Sobel Lange - Genome-wide association analysis by lasso penalized logistic regression - 2009. They mention a 'swindle' that is not hard to implement + then you can simply work with glmnet (there is a new version out recently which promises a performance improvement but I haven't had a chance to check it out).
