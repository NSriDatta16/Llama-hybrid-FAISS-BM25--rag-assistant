What is state transition probability in an MDP? A matrix or a 3-D tensor?

I find the following written in places: $P$ is a state transition probability matrix, $P_{ss'}^{a} = P[S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a]$ ( notes by david silver - slide 24 and, sutton and barto) How is it that that is a matrix? Is not that a 3-D tensor? I think we would have a state transition matrix for every action and on the whole, it would be a 3-d tensor.
