There is no an elegant solution about this (at least I don't know it). You can do it with a Configure::write class for example: in your AppController's beforeFilter() you can add the following code: Configure::write('current_controller', $this->name); Configure::write('current_action', $this->action); later on in your behavior you can access them with Configure::read('current_controller'); Configure::read('current_action'); You can access it because you set them before any model iterations. For sure it's not elegant but it's working.
