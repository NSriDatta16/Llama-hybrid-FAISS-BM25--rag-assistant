I'm here again =)! It happens that right now I'm fitting a nested logistic regression and I have to choose the better model as well. Actually I don't know how to do stepwise with lme4, nonetheless I'm not sure it is advisble to use AIC to choose the best model (better fit). Take a look at this link ; is dissuss very briefly when AIC may be apropriate with hierarchical (nested) models. Just to provide some backgroud on the link, it is a FAQ about DIC, which is like AIC and is an output of Bugs. All in all, I don't know how to answer your question, but I can provide some guidance on how I choose my own models. I take a look at two things: ROC curves and fake data simulation. ROC curves are a good graphic way to compare the fit of models regarding true positive rates and false positive rates. Depending on what is more sensitive in your case, you can choose a model with higher true positive rate or higher true negative rates. If you use Zelig package, I think you can fit models with lme4 and plot ROC curves. The documentation has some nice examples of this. Another way (my prefered one) is to simulate data with parameters from the model estimated. Then, you check if the simulated data resembles the real data. This is a visual comparison, but can be very effetive. If you need reference on this procedure, Gelman and Hill's book is a standard texto book on this approach. For instance, assume you fitted the model: P(y=1) = 10 + 2*x Then you create a new variable, y.fake, which is for (i in 1:n) y.fake ~ rbinom(1,1, 10 + 2*x[i]) Then you check if y.fake resembles the true y. You can compute, for instance, the number of cases that the y.fake is equal to the true y. You can ran more than one simulation to take into acount sample variability and you can take into acount the variability of estimated coeficients as well. Hope this helps.
