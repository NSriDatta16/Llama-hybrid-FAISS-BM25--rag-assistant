Apostrophes Converted to Correct Text?

Goal: I need to be able to convert apostrophes to properly formed words. - at least for the most common words with apostrophes. To do this ideally I'd want a list of words and their implied conterparts (i.e. "don't" and "do not"). Issue: I'm creating a search algorithm based on natural language processing, but when users create content (or search) using an apostrophe, it causes issues for us. Mostly because if we were to simply remove the apostrophe we would have (don't -> dont) (doesn't -> doesnt), which officially is not an english word, and can't be translated by the NLP system. The ideal solution is simply a one to one mapping of what these items should be converted to, but I'm unaware of such a list. Please let me know if you know of one, and where I might be able to find it. thx
