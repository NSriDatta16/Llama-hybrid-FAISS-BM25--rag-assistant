What .Net controls are available for diagram markup?

We need to mark up diagrams of body parts to indicate the location and extent of injuries. For example, to shade an area of the body to mark a burn, or a diagram of a hand with an amputated finger. What 3rd party controls are available that would be suitable for embedding into a .Net application?
