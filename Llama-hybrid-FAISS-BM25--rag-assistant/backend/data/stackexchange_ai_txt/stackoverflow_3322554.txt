Clean autorotation transitions in a paging UIScrollView

I have a paging UIScrollView in which the user pages horizontally through images, like Apple's Photos.app. That works, but now I'm trying to add rotation support. I've got the view rotating OK and have managed to set the contentSize, bounds, and subviews' frames properly to adapt to the different orientations. So before and after the rotation, everything is OK. However, the transitions themselves are awkward. The first image rotates perfectly, as if the axis of rotation is in the dead center of the image (scrollview frame). The second image "swings" in because the axis of rotation is in the same place: the center of the first image. The farther away I get from the first image, the faster the "swing." I can probably mask this by overlaying an opaque UIView before rotation and hiding it after. But that's a hack. There must be an elegant way to do this...
