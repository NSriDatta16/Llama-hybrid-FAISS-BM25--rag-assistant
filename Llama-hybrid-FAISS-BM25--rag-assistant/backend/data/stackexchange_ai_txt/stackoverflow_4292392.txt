I would guess one have to make a balanced decision between performance and size. If you provide only a hdpi graphic, the OS would naturally have to use some resources on down-scaling it for lower-resolution devices. But if you provide both a hdpi, mdpi and ldpi graphic, it would require a bit more space. However, your fear for multiplying the APK size by three isn't too important in my opinion. First of all, if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic, adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic (which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size (there is approximately 3:4:6 scaling ratio )) will increase the size, but far from triple it (more close to double). Secondly, the graphics doesn't make up all of the APK size, so tripling the amount of images will not triple the APK size either. And finally: since Android now supports apps-to-SD, the size of your app isn't as crucial as it were in earlier versions.
