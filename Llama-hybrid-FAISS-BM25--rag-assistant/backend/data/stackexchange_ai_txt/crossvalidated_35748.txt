I don't think it is a good idea to drop the main effects given that the uplift models try to model the second order incremental effect on the top of the main effects (the response variable is not incremental since a particular subject cannot be in both test and in control in the same time.) The True Lift Model - A Novel Data Mining Approach to Response Modeling in Database Marketing by Victor Lo includes a simple example of using logistic regression - it includes both the main effect and the interaction terms. The step-wise variable selection that you are implying is possible but I believe there are better methods based on regularization (elastic net etc.) As for including higher order interactions, why not? - they are just additional variables. Real-World Uplift Modelling with Significance-Based Uplift Trees by Radcliffe and Surry states that variable selection is very important so I guess one should be careful with using higher order interactions. If I were to try this I would first build a good quality main effect model (based on the control dataset only by utilizing regularization, interactions etc.), then I would throw in the test/control interaction term and re-fit the model on the full training dataset (using the same tuning hyper-parameters)
