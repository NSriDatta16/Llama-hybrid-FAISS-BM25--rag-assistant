For large data in Windows C# programming, whether it be in WPF or WinForms, I have traditionally added nodes dynamically. I load the initial tree root + children + grandchildren deep. When any node is expanded, I load the tree nodes that would represent the grandchildren of the expanding node, if any. This pattern also works well with data retrieval. If you are truly loading data from a source of thousands or millions of records you probably don't want to load those all up front. No user wants to wait for that to be loaded, and there is not reason to load data that may never be viewed. I have typically loaded the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren node data as needed on a background thread, then marshal those data back to the UI thread and create and add the nodes. This leaves the UI responsive. You can visually decorate tree nodes to indicate they are still loading for the case where a user gets ahead of your IO to the data store.
