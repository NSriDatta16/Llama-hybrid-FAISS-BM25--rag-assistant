It sounds like the "linear combination" you want to calculate is a predicted outcome (log-odds, in your case) based on the modeled coefficient estimates and hypothesized predictor values. If you are working in the log-odds scale of outcomes, the point estimates of predictions for any specific set of predictor values will be the same in either approach, as the pooled coefficient estimates under Rubin's rules are just the averages of the estimates across the models of the values for the individual imputed data sets. For the associated variance of the estimate, it's simplest to work with the pooled model and its pooled (asymptotically multivariate normal) variance-covariance matrix. If you were to get point estimates of predicted values from each of the individual imputed data sets, you would have to re-apply Rubin's rules to get the corresponding variance estimate of the pooled estimate; see Section 2.3 of van Buuren's Flexible Imputation of Missing Data . Why do the extra work?
