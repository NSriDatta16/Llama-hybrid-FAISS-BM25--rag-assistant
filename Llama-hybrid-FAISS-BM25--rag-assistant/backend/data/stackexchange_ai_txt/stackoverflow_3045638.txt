The file contains binary data which must be run through a linker to generate an executable. It is essentially a bunch of machine code instructions with named sections (corresponding to your functions). From wikipedia's ' Object File ' article: In computer science, an object file is an organized collection of separate, named sequences of machine code[citation needed]. Each sequence, or object, typically contains instructions for the host machine to accomplish some task, possibly accompanied by related data and metadata (e.g. relocation information, stack unwinding information, comments, program symbols, debugging or profiling information). A linker is typically used to generate an executable or library by combining parts of object files.
