Multivariate regression and use of proportion type variables as DV in it

I have two very important things to know. Can anyone help? Question-1 If I have three categorical dependent variables and a continuous dependent variable, which are correlated (or associated), then if I conduct separate regressions with each dependent variable instead of a multivariate regression, what should actually be the basic problem? Shouldn't the change be only in the standard errors? Am I going to get correct p-values (I understand probably I will not) in both logistic regressions with the categorical DVs and in the linear regression? Question-2 If one of my dependent variables is in proportions (the one that is continuous as I mentioned previously), how should I analyze it? My interest is not prediction. I just want to see the effect of the independent variables. But still I am not feeling confident with linear regression. The predictions will surely give values outside the range of the proportions (0.00-1.00). Can logistic regression be an option? So that log(p/(1-p)) can be used as the dependent variable? So how do I define this log transform in SPSS?
