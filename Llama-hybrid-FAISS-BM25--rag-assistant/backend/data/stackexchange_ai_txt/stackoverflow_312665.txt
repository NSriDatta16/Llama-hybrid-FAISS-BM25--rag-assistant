Robert C. Martin, who recently released the book "Clean Code", states that the number of lines per method should be the absolutely smallest possible. Between 1-7 lines is a good rule of thumb. There's also a good point being made in the book The ThoughtWorks Anthology, in the essay “Object Calisthenics” by Jeff Bay. He suggests 9 pretty hardcore constraints that will make you a better OO developer in the long run. Read more about them here. To answer your specific questions, these are the constraints specifically to you: - No more than 10 classes per package - A maximum of 50 lines per class These constraints might not be ideal for all of your real projects, but using them in a small (hobby?) project will force you into a better practice.
