The main idea is to use image pyramids in these situations to decompose an image into a set of spatial component images e.g., object detection with high-resolution images. If you are more interested in this topic, you can read this article: Object detection algorithm for high-resolution images based on convolutional neural network and multiscale processing There is a good blog that explains well how to use pyramids in neural networks: FPN â€” Feature Pyramid Network (Object Detection)
