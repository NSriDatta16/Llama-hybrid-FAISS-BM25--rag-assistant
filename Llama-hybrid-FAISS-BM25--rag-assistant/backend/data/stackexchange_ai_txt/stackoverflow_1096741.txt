How to efectively organize your web project? (specially mutilanguage websites)

I have my project folder, for instance, myWeb . In it there are various folders like styles (for CSS), scripts (JS), php (for php scripts), and folders for 3 different languages, for instance: en (english), sp (spanish), cn (chinese). This sometimes gives me problems because the index or default page should be in the root directory but all my index pages are inside their language folder. Is there a better way of organizing this?
