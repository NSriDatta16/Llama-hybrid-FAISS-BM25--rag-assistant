Making HTTPS Requests in Twisted

I am trying to write a client that can make both HTTP and HTTPS requests depending on how it is configured. For normal HTTP, I have been using twisted.web.client.Agent and using agent.request(METHOD, HOST, HEADERS, CONTENT) to make the requests. What I care about is that host field, when I do HTTP it works doing something like " http://localhost:8000 ", but if I switch to HTTPS, I get an error: Failure: twisted.web.error.SchemeNotSupported: Unsupported scheme: 'https' I am aware of the existence of the client.getPage method, but I was wondering if there was any similarly awesome and high level methods that I can make requests with just like agent.request, but using HTTPS?
