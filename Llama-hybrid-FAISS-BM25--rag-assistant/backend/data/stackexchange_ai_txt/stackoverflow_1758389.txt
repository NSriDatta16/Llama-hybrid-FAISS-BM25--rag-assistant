I think your understanding of WPF and Silverlight is a little lacking. Silverlight is a subset of functionality and features that are found in WPF. Silverlight has a few features that are Silverlight specific. Silverlight on the desktop is simply a response to Adobe AIR by Microsoft. So with that said, implement your application with WPF if that's your choice. Don't let "buzz" drive your decisions about your application, that's what business needs and available skills in your organization should do.
