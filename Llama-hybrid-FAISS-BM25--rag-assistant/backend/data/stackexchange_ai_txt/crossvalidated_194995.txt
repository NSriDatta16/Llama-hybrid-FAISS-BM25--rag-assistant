Testing 3-way interaction of categorical variables in a meta analysis in R

I'm currently working on a meta-analysis using the metafor package for R. I have several categorical moderators, a few of which are multi-category, that I'm including in the analyses. When using one moderator at a time, interpretation of results is easy as the results for the referent group are represented by the intercept value (the categorical variables are dummy coded). This is all fine. The challenge I'm having is that I'm trying to determine whether or not a 3-way interaction exists, but because of the dummy coding I can't get estimates for the values and confidence intervals of the interaction that includes the reference group. This is an issue because I a) want to know what the influence of this 3-way interaction is and b) I'll be expected to report those statistics in a publication. Does anyone have any advice? I've thought about subsetting the data along one of the moderators (research method: laboratory or field), but I don't think that answers the question of whether or not the interaction of two moderators has an influence on the overall average effect size. I appreciate any and all feedback!
