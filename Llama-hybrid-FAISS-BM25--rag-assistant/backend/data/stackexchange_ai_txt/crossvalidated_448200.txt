Is PCA always recommended?

I was wondering if PCA can be always applied for dimensionality reduction before a classification or regression problem. My intuition tells me that the answer is no. If we perform PCA then we calculate linear combinations of the features to build principal components that explain most of the variance of the dataset. However, we might be leaving out features that do not explain much of the variance of the dataset but do explain what characterizes one class against another. Am I correct?. Should we always reduce dimensions with PCA if needed or there are considerations that need to be taken (as the one above)?
