Reorganizing many to many relationships in Django

I have a many to many relationship in my models and i'm trying to reorganize it on one of my pages. My site has videos. On each video's page i'm trying to list the actors that are in that video with links to each time they are in the video(the links will skip to that part of the video) Here's an illustration Flash Video embedded here Actors... Ted smith: 1:25, 5:30 jon jones: 5:00, 2:00 Here are the pertinent parts of my models class Video(models.Model): actor = models.ManyToManyField( Actor, through='Actor_Video' ) # more stuff removed class Actor_Video(models.Model): actor = models.ForeignKey( Actor ) video = models.ForeignKey( Video) time = models.IntegerField() Here's what my Actor_Video table looks like, maybe it will be easier to see what im doing id actor_id video_id time (in seconds) 1 1 3 34 2 1 3 90 i feel like i have to reorganize the info in my view, but i cant figure it out. It doesn't seem to be possible in the template using djangos orm. I've tried a couple things with creating dictionaries/lists but i've had no luck. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
