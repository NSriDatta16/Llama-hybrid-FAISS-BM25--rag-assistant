In case you did not follow the link provided by Durden , here is the basic approach to likelihood-free / approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) of $p(Q|x^\text{obs})$ : Simulate $Q$ from the prior $p(Q)$ Simulate $x$ from the sampling distribution $p(x|Q)$ Accept $Q$ if $d(x,x^\text{obs}) else reject where the value of $\epsilon$ is chosen as small as possible while allowing for a sufficient number of acceptance in an acceptable time.
