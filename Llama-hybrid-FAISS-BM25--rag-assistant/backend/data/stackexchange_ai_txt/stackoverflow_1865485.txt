This question seems almost like an inheritance problem (with respect to your organisation). Similar to what hasen j said, you need a base that contains everything that's in common, and then branch out from there - if you have a specific structure for some of your client's websites that is not in others, you'll use a sub-base git repository to represent the common functions among that specific subset. That way, if you want to make a change to all repositories, make it through the base repository. If you want to change a specific subset, change the sub-base repository created for that subset.
