Using the linear probability model (*), you can solve your problem using the given equation. When you've used the values to make a prediction, you'll probably get an unexpected likelihood (hint: what are the range of possible likelihoods? can they be negative?), which is one of the reasons why you'll learn logistic regression. Sometimes though this model can be usefull as well. (*) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probability_model
