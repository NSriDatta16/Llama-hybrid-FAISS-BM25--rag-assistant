Custom ContentProvider for encrypted storage

I have some encrypted storage (SQLite) and would like to implement my own ContentProvider. Precondition is: Access should be granted/possible only when works/started my application - in all other cases access has to be denied returning to user/application some intelligent message/return code So the question is: is it possible? If yes, please give me some hints how to start.
