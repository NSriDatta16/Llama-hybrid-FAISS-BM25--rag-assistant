I find that generics facilitate composition through generic properties without having to write different classes for each composition you want to leverage or having to create a lengthy inheritance tree. I try to favor composition to inheritance when I can, especially in a single-inheritance platform. I'd say your situation warrants a little bit of both. Perhaps something like the following: class Child { TParent Parent; } class Parent { IList Children; } class ParentAndChild : Parent { TParent Parent; } class Element : Child { ... } class Step : ParentAndChild { ... } class Script : Parent { ... } Something like this could facilitate much of the functionality in a hierarchy of double-linked objects.
