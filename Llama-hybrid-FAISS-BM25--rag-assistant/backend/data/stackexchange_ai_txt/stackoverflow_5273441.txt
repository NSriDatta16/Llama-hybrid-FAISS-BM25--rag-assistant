Changing Firefox properties before installation or with Add-on

I'm currently writing a documentation about setting up a special Server environment. To use this environment together with firefox it is required to change one property at the about:config window of firefox. Our customers have big networks and they just can't do that for hundreds of computers in that network. I'm now looking for a solution to easily configure that property network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris which has to be completely idiot-proof. This property is related to Kerberos Authentication. I thought of making a special installation package of firefox which already contains the property or to serve an Add-on or something like that. (Is there an easy way to do that?) Or is there a more elegant way to setting up firefox to work properly with kerberos? Any suggestions?
