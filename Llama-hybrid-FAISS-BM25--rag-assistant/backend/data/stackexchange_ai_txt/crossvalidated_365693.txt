What's done with the expectations in this proof?

This is a proof of the per-decision importance sampling (theorem 1) from the appendix of: https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1079%26context%3Dcs_faculty_pubs&ved=2ahUKEwjixPHjgafdAhXIzaQKHah5Ai0QFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw3sN_Eh-1yHqGBtfSoFY0Sx I should give some background that this is deriving a Monte Carlo importance sampling theorem in reinforcement learning. I am stuck at the step in brackets where the expectation is split into a product. I know this is possible for independent variables inside the expectation. Is it just that policies after the reward are independent of the reward and the policies are all independent by the Markov assumption and conditioning on state??? If so some insight as to this would be much appreciated because I don't understand how the earlier policies are not independent. Or maybe it's something else. Any insight much appreciated! Many thanks.
