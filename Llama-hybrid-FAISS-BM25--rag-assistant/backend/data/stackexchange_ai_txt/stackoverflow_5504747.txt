How to turn of the inner border for Facebook 'Like Button' in IE7/IE8?

I have seen that even on big sites like CNN, etc. have it. I tried targeting the element which showed up those edges in IE developer toolbar but it didn't work. Check out the link and hover over the 'like' button...it shows some kind of inner black border in all four corners. http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/
