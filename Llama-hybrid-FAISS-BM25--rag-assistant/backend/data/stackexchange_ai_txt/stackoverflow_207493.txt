My advice would be this: /garages Returns list of garages (think JSON array here) /garages/yyy Returns specific garage /garage/yyy/cars Returns list of cars in garage /garages/cars Returns list of all cars in all garages (may not be practical of course) /cars Returns list of all cars /cars/xxx Returns specific car /cars/colors Returns lists of all posible colors for cars /cars/colors/red,blue,green Returns list of cars of the specific colors (yes commas are allowed :) ) Edit: /cars/colors/red,blue,green/doors/2 Returns list of all red,blue, and green cars with 2 doors. /cars/type/hatchback,coupe/colors/red,blue,green/ Same idea as the above but a lil more intuitive. /cars/colors/red,blue,green/doors/two-door,four-door All cars that are red, blue, green and have either two or four doors. Hopefully that gives you the idea. Essentially your Rest API should be easily discoverable and should enable you to browse through your data. Another advantage with using URLs and not query strings is that you are able to take advantage of the native caching mechanisms that exist on the web server for HTTP traffic. Here's a link to a page describing the evils of query strings in REST: http://web.archive.org/web/20070815111413/http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?QueryStringsConsideredHarmful I used Google's cache because the normal page wasn't working for me here's that link as well: http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?QueryStringsConsideredHarmful
