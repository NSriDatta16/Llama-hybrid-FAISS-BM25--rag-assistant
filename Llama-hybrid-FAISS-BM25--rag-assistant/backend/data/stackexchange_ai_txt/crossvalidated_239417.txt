Let $X = X_2-X_1$ denote the difference of two standard Uniform random variables, which is well-known to be a symmetric Triangular distribution on (-1,1). Similarly, let $Y = Y_2-Y_1$ . By independence, the joint pdf of $(X,Y)$ , say $f(x,y)$ , is then: (source: tri.org.au ) Then, the average distance between random points in the unit square is: (source: tri.org.au ) where I am using the Expect function from the mathStatica package for Mathematica to do the nitty gritties, ArcSinh[1] denotes $\sinh^{-1}(1)$ , and the answer to the first few decimal places is 0.521405 ... P.S. The pdf of $U = X^2$ will be say $g(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}}-1$ defined on (0,1), but it is questionable as to whether making this transformation makes the integration any easier.
