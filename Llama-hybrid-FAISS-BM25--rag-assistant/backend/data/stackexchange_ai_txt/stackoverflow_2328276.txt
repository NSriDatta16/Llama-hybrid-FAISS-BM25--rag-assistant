Unfortunately, there isn't an easy way to import/export categories. I'm shocked that the functionality still doesn't exist for that (and for dropdown/multiselect attributes). If you are versed enough with using APIs and something like SOAP, you can certainly interact with Magento's API and quickly add categories from a CSV or something like that. But, you do have to develop it yourself. That is pretty much your only option at this point though.. http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/doc/webservices-api/api#category_api
