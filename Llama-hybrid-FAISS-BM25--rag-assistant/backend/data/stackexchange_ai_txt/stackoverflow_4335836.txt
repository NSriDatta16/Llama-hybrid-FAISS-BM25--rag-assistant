To use Window you need to create a new Window class in a separate file which you can then instantiate and show from your main Window's code. var childWindow = new MyChildWindow(); childWindow.Show(); To get the simplified window chrome set WindowStyle = WindowStyle.ToolWindow in MyChildWindow. If you're trying to create a contained simulated window inside your main window that needs to use a normal non-Window control. Silverlight includes a ChildWindow class but it's not built into WPF. To create something similar you can use a HeaderedContentControl which you'll have to style to look like a tool window by modifying the ControlTemplate. You'll also need to create behaviors like drag, resize and close on the control which is usually best handled by making it a custom control.
