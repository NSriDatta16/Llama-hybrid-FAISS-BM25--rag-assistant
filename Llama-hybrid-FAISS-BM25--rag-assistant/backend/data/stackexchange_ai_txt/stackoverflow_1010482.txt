How do you backup CRM3.0 when the 'ftcat_documentindex' is offline?

My organisation uses Microsoft CRM 3.0, and I am attempting to backup the database. The following error is preventing me from doing so, does anyone know how to resolve this issue? Error: System.Data.SqlClient.SqlError: The backup of full-text catalog 'ftcat_documentindex' is not permitted because it is not online. Check errorlog file for the reason that full-text catalog became offline and bring it online. Or BACKUP can be performed by using the FILEGROUP or FILE clauses to restrict the selection to include only online data.
