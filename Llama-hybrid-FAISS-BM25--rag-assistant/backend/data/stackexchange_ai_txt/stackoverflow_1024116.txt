Any answer to this question, or any proof of correctness of such an answer, highly depends on the data you're measuring. If your samples were taken at t 0 =0ms , t 1 =0.9ms and t 2 =2.1ms , but your choice of α is based on 1-ms-intervals, and therefore you want a locally adjusted α n , the proof of correctness of the choice would mean knowing the sample values at t=1ms and t=2ms . This leads to the question: Can you interpolate your data resonably to have sane guesses of what in-between values might have been? Or can you even interpolate the average itself? If neither of these is possible, then as far as I see it, the logical choice of an in-between value Y(t) is the most recently calculated average , i.e. Y(t) ≈ S n where n is maxmial such that t n This choice has a simple consequence: Leave α alone, no matter what the time difference was. If, on the other hand, it is possible to interpolate your values, then this will give you averagable constant-interval samples. Lastly, if it's even possible to interpolate the average itself, that would render the question meaningless.
