Help with my time series ARX model prediction?

I have created an ARX-model where I predict the nitrogen oxide levels based on past values of nitrogen oxide with past exogenous input values nitrogen dioxide, temperature, atmospheric particulate matter, etc. This might be a straightforward question, but I started to wonder if for example my ARX-model would be the following: $$ Y_{t} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}Y_{t-1} + \alpha_{2}Y_{t-2} + \beta_{1}X_{t-1}^{1} + \beta_{2}X_{t-2}^{1} + \gamma_{1}X_{t-1}^{2} + \gamma_{2}X_{t-2}^{2} + . . . $$ Where Y:s correspond to my past values of nitrogen oxide(NO) and the X:s correspond to different exogenous input values. Now if I have data available until time t on all time series and I want to make predictions until say time t+10, won't I need to first predict all the future values of exogenous inputs? After I have predicted the exogenous values I can start to predict the NO-levels with my model correct? So I'm predicting predictions with predictions? :) I'm very new at this and my question might be stupid x) Please comment if my question is unclear
