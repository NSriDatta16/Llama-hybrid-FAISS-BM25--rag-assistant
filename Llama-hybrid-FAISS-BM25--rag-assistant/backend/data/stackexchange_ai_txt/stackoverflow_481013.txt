I had a similar question which I answered myself (after some hours messing about) See - How do I tell if a Drag Drop has ended in Winforms? . Basically if you do as earwicker suggests you need to set the flag when the drag drop begins near the DoDragDrop call. You will need to unset the flag in both the DragDrop event and in the QueryContinueDrag if the QueryContinueDragEventArgs indicate a drop or a cancel.
