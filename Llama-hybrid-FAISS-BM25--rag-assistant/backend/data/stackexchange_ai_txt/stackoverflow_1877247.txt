Looks like the appended part is ok and should be used. See Yahoo's OpenID FAQ for developers : OpenID identifiers can be recycled over time, and OpenID 2.0 specifies that OpenID Providers append URL fragments to the end of an OpenID URL as a generation identifier. The entire OpenID URL with the fragment, if present, should be used to identify the user. For instance, the following two OpenIDs are unique and represent different users: http://openid.example.com/username#aa http://openid.example.com/username#bb
