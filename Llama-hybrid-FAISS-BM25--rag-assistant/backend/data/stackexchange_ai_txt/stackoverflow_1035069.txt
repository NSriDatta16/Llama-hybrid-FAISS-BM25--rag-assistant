The jQuery UI Sortable should allow you to move items up and down within a column: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ It's a little confusing because the jQuery site also has a Sortable page, with a demo that currently doesn't appear to work. You might also need the jQuery UI Droppable: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/ The Droppable will allow you to drag and drop from one column to the other. Here is the link for Droppable on the jQuery site (this demo does work): http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.7/Droppable
