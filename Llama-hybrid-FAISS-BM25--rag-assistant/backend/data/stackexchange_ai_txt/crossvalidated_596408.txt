I got the same issue while I am working with logistic regression in R, The issue seems that the predictor variable completely depends on some of the independent variables. I searched and found people are using GLM nets. I resolved my issue using the Quasi Binomial model in GLM function like: glm(Default~ROS+ROI+debt_ratio,data=ratios.complete,family=quasibinomial) get more about quasibinomial model here .
