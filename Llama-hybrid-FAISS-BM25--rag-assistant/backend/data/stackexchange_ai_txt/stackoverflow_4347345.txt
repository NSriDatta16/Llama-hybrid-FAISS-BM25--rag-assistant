I've met the same issue. Looking deeper in the wls classes i've found that WSMMessageContext does not contain right principal in the Subject. and in fact IllegalArgumentExeception is thrown, unfortunately this real exception is wrapped wrapped and wrapped a lot of times and we may see "GenericFault : generic error" that is the last wrapped in WSMAgentHook class that performs output in console. Unfortunately I could not move forward there and seems nobody use Custom Security Assert. So nobody may help us seems
