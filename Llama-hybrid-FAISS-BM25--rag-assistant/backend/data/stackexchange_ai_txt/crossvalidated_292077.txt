Learning vs. training

In my head, these two words (learning and training) seem to somehow have a fuzzy boundary between them. For example, the word learning for me conveys the idea of training; if I want to learn something, I train myself in it! When talking about machine learning algorithms, this happens too. I often find myself wondering if it's right to say "unsupervised training"! since, in my head, the word training is tightly related to supervised learning (here too can I say supervised training!). Is there a clear boundary I can learn or should I just train myself the words' uses as they are :-)
