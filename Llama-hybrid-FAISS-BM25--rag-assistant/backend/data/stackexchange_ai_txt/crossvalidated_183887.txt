Most likely, yes, a neural network can identify multiclass images. However, it might not be so straightforward. For example: say you have trained your NN to detect 3 possible fruits: passion fruit, pomegranate and guava. So you have 3 real-valued output neurons. If you show a picture with only one guava, the output can possibly be something like: G: 0.7 P: 0.4 PF: 0.1 This indicates that there is at least one guava, and there isn't a passion fruit. But it's not clear as for the pomegranate. You have to set a detection threshold.
