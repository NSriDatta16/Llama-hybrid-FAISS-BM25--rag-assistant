As Nick knows from his interest in the History of Statistics, early practitioners would detrend BUT had to assume the number of trends and where they began and ended AND that the series didn't simply require de-meaning to deal with level shift(s). Later on practitioners ( mostly econometricians) used an alternative , by differencing the data to deal with the non-stationarity BUT the question is how many differences and the order of differencing was tacitly ignored. Box and Jenkins suggested the optimization of all these prior approaches by pre-filtering using an appropriate ARMA Model for the X variable above and beyond any identifiably needed differencing unique to each series to create surrogate series that could be usefully analyzed with the CCF.
