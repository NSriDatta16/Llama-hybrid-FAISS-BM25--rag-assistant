Numbering a list via CSS, only if there are multiple items

I have an XML document that I'm trying to style via CSS. A relevant snippet of this XML looks like this: Not numbered first item second item third item I need to present the elements as an ordered list, but only if there is more than one element in the list. In lists with just one element, I need it to appear as a normal paragraph without any numbers. Right now I'm styling my list like this, but I don't know how to hide the numbers when there's only one item: senseBlock { display: block; counter-reset: sense; } prelim { display: block; } sense { display: list-item; list-style: decimal inside; } sense:before { counter-increment: sense; } I thought about using an adjacent selector like sense + sense to detect multiple items, but then that won't style the first element in my list. I've pretty much concluded that this is impossible without modifying the XML, but I figured I'd extend this challenge to the community before I give up. This only needs to work in the latest version of Safari for iPhone.
