The equation says that the distribution is an average of point distributions (Dirac delta functions). For univariate $x$ it's probably easier to think of the CDF and then go from there. The CDF is $$\mathbb{F}_n(x) =\Pr(X\leq x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^N I(X_i\leq x)$$ This is a step function. It takes a step of $1/N$ at each observation, meaning that there's a $1/N$ probability for each observation. It would be nice if you could have a density function rather than a CDF, but the CDF isn't differentiable, so you can't. What you can have instead is what's in the equation. If you naively tried to differentiate the CDF with respect to $x$ , you'd get zero at most places and infinite spikes at the observations. The $\delta$ notation is a way to say something like that, but rigorously. It says that you get the bootstrap distribution by averaging $N$ other distributions. Each of these other distributions has 100% of its probability at one point: $\delta(x-x_1)$ is notation for "a distribution with 100% probability on $x_1$ ". So, the notation says that the way you pick a number from the bootstrap distribution is to pick one of the $N$ observations, and then choose that number. The reason this isn't just pointless games with math notation is that it works in more complicated cases. If $x$ is a point on the surface of the Earth, you might have to think for quite a while to decide how to define the CDF, but it's easy to say the way you pick a location from the bootstrap distribution is to pick one of the $N$ observations, and then choose that location.
