Conditional selecting and pasting in excel

I am quite new to VBA coding so I was hoping you could help me with the following problem. I am looking for the best way to organize the following: From one set of data I am getting different sorts of documents (all have a certain document type) with their information (e.g. customer name, address, amount, VAT,...). From this file I want to select certain doc types (e.g. DG, EG, SA, ...) which defer every time and copy paste those rows pertaining to those items. e.g. of the data I am getting Customer Name Date Amount Tax Discount Doc Type 25739484 Bert 01/01/2010 100 15% 2% EG Now my question is: What is the easiest way to say for which doc types I want to have the data selected and pasted. (this file is for reuse accross the company). Let the users put them in different cells? Based on the doc types the users then select, how can I make the macro select those rows and copy them to a new file? Thank you so much!!! Ellen
