Being that you have C# experience, I highly recommend trying Asp.Net MVC as I feel it is the future of MS Web programming (I am not alone in this opinion... though it is just an opinion). If nothing else, the MVC (model-view-controller) organization is a well established and useful method of coding that is used accross all sorts of platforms like php, ruby on rails, etc. - not as much of an 'island' like Asp.Net WebForms (Asp.Net WebForms are still great). There are all sorts of great tutorials, the most famous being Nerd Dinner
