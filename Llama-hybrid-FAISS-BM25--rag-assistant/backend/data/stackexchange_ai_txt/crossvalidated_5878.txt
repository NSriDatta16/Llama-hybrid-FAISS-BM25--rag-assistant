I do not see why averages should not work. You might want to use winsorized or trimmed averages to guard against outliers, which are likely due to inability to tell exactly whether user is idle or not. Then for the estimated time remaining show the sum of the averages for each question. You could build more complicated and precise methods if you collected data on the completed time together with user characteristics. For that though you will probably need another questionaire, so unless you are expecting a lot of feedback in alpha and beta phases, I suggest using the simple averages. Sometimes simplest methods work the best.
