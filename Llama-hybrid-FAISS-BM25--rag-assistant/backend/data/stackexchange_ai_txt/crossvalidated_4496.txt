Adjusting axis properties in a time series graph

Consider the following code: require(zoo) data How can one: Adjust both the horizontal and vertical limits of the drawn axis to match the start and end of data (as an example, while the y value may vary between 20 and 1525, the axis shows 0 and 1500). Increase the horizontal resolution (at least add some minor ticks) when the time series spans more years than are mentioned. Using: plot(data2,xlab='',ylab='entropy (bytes)', xaxs = 'i', yaxs = 'i') I get: which is not exactly what I had in mind. The vertical scale doesn't start with the exact minimum (around 25), nor does it end with the exact maximum. The horizontal scale starts and ends in the middle. Hints?
