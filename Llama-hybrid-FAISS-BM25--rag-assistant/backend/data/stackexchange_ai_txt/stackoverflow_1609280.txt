I'm not sure if my organization structure fits your needs but I took a very different approach than the trunk/tags/branches model. Take a look at http://www.mattwrock.com/post/2009/10/10/The-Perfect-Build-Pard-2-Version-Control.aspx for details. Here is our structure: /prod /prod/app1/20090903 /prod/app1/20090917 /prod/app2/20090903 /sandbox /sandbox/users/mwrock /staging /staging/app1 /staging/app2 /trunk /trunk/libraries /trunk/desktop /trunk/docs /trunk/services /trunk/sql /trunk/testing /trunk/thirdparty /trunk/web Here we have the following root folders: Trunk : This holds the latest code revisions suitable for integration into the mainline. There is a single trunk shared by all projects and teams. Developers only have to checkout this single folder and they have everything they need. Sandbox : These are personal development areas used for branching long running changes that you want to keep separate from the trunk until they are ready to be merged back to the trunk. Staging : This is the final QA/UAT area. The trunk is copied here once development is thought to be stable and ready for final testing. This protects the release from development commited to the trunk by other teams. When a release is in this stage, you do not want unknown commits from someone else entering your code base. Prod : This contains production releases. Each application has its own folder under prod and each release has a folder named after the date of its release. The staging branch is copied to these release tags upon deployment and they represent a snapshot of the code at the time of release. The prod area is a historical record of exactly what was released and when.
