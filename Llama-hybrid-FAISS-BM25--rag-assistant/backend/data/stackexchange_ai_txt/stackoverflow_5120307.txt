I want to ask about what I need to make a Push Notification, I reed a lot of things and Succeeded send a push from my mac to my devices that exists in the organizer (using PushMeBaby source code). but also I'm confused about make it for other devices (all who has my app) and How I get their Token Device number ? Just in Big title tell me what I need. Thanks
