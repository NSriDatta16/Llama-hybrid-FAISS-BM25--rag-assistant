The model's reported degrees of freedom in the output will differ between 1 & 2, but this won't have any effect on anything else. For comparisons between models, so long as both were fit grouped or both ungrouped, there will be no difference. If you know the number of trials & the number of successes, your data are binomial, so you use logistic regression as @Glen_b notes (you can flip a coin between 1 & 2). If you know the number of successes, but not the number of trials, you can fit a count regression, (probably a negative binomial or other over-dispersed Poison). If you have a proportion, but don't know either the total number of trials or the number of successes, you will have to fit a beta regression. Beta regression is for continuous proportions, so it wouldn't be ideal, but if the proportions were based on a large number of trials, it probably wouldn't be too biased.
