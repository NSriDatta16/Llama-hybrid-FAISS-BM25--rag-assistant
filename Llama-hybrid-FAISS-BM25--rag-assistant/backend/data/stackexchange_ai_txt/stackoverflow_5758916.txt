Neural network and IDS

I am trying to get a grasp on the efficiency of neural networks over other artificial intelligence algorithms for use in intrusion detection systems. Most of the literature I’m reading isn’t giving a good comparison of neural networks compared to other IDS's. Do they work better (detect more true attacks and less false positives)? Are they more or less efficient? Another question is how new is NN in IDS environments? Are they used widely, is it old news?
