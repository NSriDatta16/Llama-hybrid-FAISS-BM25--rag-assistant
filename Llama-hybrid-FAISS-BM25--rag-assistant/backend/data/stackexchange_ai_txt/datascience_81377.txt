Methods to improve neural network to distinguish red from blue?

I have a lot of data where im trying to distinguish red data from blue, but all the features look like this basically (see imgur). They overlap a lot, and I can only get roc auc score of 0.65 . So far in terms of data-processing ive only used class weights to balance it. I have tried different kinds of dense/dropout networks, with the different features but only 0.65 is the best I can get, most hover around 0.63-0.65, no matter how many layers or epochs I add. For example a simple DNN/dropout yields 0.65: """ Dense(512, activation='relu'), Dropout(0.3), Dense(512, activation='relu'), Dropout(0.3), Dense(512, activation='relu'), Dropout(0.3), Dense(512, activation='relu'), Dropout(0.3), Dense(512, activation='relu'), Dense(1, activation="sigmoid") """ Some resnet modification I found online also only provided 0.65. So i have tried CNN and dense layer networks only, so far. Any hints or ideas I could do to get better AUC scores?
