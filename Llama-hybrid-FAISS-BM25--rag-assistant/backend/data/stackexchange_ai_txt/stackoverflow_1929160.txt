Silverlight/xaml - displaying child data in a datagrid

I have two tables in a database and using entity framework and ria services to display data in a simple datagrid. Here is the database/EF structure Cars Make ----- ---- CarId MakeId Car Make MakeId In my Silverlight datagrid I want to show the following two columns, for example Car Make --- ----- Escort Ford Megane Renault Rav4 Toyota I can easily bind to the Cars table and show cars but I can't work out how to display the Make taken from the child table The xaml that I am using to configure the datagrid is as follows: ...... The datagrid datasource binds to a DomainDataSource method "GetCars". I'm not sure if it is automatically loading the child table (not sure whether I have to explicitly tell it to or not, and have no idea how to do this in xaml). I'm sure I could ditch the xaml and do it in c# but I'm trying to be a good coder and do it in xaml.
