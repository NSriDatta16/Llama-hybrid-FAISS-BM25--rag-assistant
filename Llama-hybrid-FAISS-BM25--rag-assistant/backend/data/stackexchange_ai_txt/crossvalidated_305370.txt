I disagree that AI is just a "fancy" name for ML used for marketing, as some of the comments seem to say. The "immediate" aims of AI is to computationally solve problems that humans (or some other biological intelligent agent) can solve naturally in short time (something like a few hundred milliseconds). The examples include, face recognition, natural language understanding etc. I think Andrew Ng says it somewhere in this video . Also see this article that tries to clarify the difference.
