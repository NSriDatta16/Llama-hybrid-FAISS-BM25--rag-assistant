Neural network references (textbooks, online courses) for beginners

I want to learn Neural Networks. I am a Computational Linguist. I know statistical machine learning approaches and can code in Python. I am looking to start with its concepts, and know one or two popular models which may be useful from a Computational Linguistics perspective. I browsed the web for reference and found a few books and materials. Ripley, Brian D. (1996) Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks, Cambridge Bishop, C.M. (1995) Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, Oxford: Oxford University Press. some links, like this thesis , these course notes (University of Toronto Psychology Department), these course notes (University of Wisconsin Computer Science) and this slideshow (Facebook Research). Coursera courses are generally nice, if anyone knows anything relevant from them. I prefer materials with lucid language and ample examples.
