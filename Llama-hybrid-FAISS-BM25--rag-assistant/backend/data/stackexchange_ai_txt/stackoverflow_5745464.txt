Linking to Magento Admin from Outside Admin Panel

I'm trying to build some CRM tools that send emails to my sales guys and link back to pages inside the Magento Admin. I've been building the URLS like this: Mage::getUrl('*/quotes/edit', array('id'=>$quote->getQuoteId(), '_current'=>true)) The problem is it only sends them to the dashboard. I'm assuming it is because the setting for "_current" is changed when they login, thus invalidating the link and sending them to the default page. Any ideas on how I could make a link into the Admin that doesn't include the session in the url?
