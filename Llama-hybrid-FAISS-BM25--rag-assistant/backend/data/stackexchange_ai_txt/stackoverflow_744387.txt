Grid Control

I have been tasked to create a control that has hot spots that will allow drag and drop of images. These locations will change based on what is being dragged onto the control. After dropping the image on the control it will need the ability to move to a new location (either by drag and drop or using the arrow keys). The closest example of this functionality, which I can think of, is the Microsoft Windows desktop. When you drag an icon around it will allow you to drop it anywhere (snaps to the closest allowable hot spot) I am using .net 3.5 using C#. I am looking for ideas to start prototyping this control. What is the best Winform control to inherit from, or is a custom control from scratch the only way to go?
