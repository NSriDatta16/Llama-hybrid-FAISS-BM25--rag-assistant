If you look at QT documentation, http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/deployment-x11.html section "Creating the Application Package" they suggest to create a package like a Mac bundle, with a shell script to start it. You can do the same thing; you will have to create the libraries you need and include them in your package which will make it bigger unfortunately. At least this should encourage you to only link to the libs you need :)
