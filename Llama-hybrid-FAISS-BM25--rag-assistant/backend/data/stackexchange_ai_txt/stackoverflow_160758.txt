It is kind of specific to its domain, but f-spot has a nice way of doing this. It is photo management software, and if you click on one of the tags to find pictures by tag, it displays a bar across the top of your search results. You then can drag and drop tags onto that bar, and right click to select negation, and can drag the tags around in the bar to group into and and or clauses. I'm not sure how well that scales for tons of tags (or non-enumerated conditions), but it is dead simple to figure out and nicely interactive.
