According to the specification, only Get or Post are allowed: From W3C: The FORM element method = get|post [CI] This attribute specifies which HTTP method will be used to submit the form data set. Possible (case-insensitive) values are "get" (the default) and "post". See the section on form submission for usage information. ... For any other value of action or method, behavior is unspecified. User agents should render the response from the HTTP "get" and "post" transactions.
