CMS for more than 600 Content rich Websites

I've got a little history in CMS technology and I wonder if anyone could recommend a CMS-System (esp. WCM) for large content rich websites. Consider a hierarchical tree structure of sites with e.g. 4-5 levels, where you have about 10 to 15 trees of sites. e.g.: Organisation 1-n 1.1 Suborg 1-n 1.2 Special-Microsite 1-n You should further be able to share content & navigation within sites (trees) an attach own site-specific navigation and content to shared navigation - wich only appears in the site scope but not globally. When you could say about a system it rocks even with 500+ sites and complex permission landscape, please let me know.
