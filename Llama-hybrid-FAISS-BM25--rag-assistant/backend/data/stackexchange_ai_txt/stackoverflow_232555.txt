If you're simply looking to mount an ISO or something then it's done through the Disk Utility, simply drag it into the side-bar and then select it and choose mount. If you want to do it from code you can issue the hdiutil command, as shown here . I'm not sure if there's an API call to do it, but getting that command to do the work is quite painless.
