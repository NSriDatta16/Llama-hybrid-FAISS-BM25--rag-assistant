How do I measure the velocity of a swipe?

I'm developing a game that will use the force of the swipe as a variable user input. I read from the documentation that on the touchesEnded event, I can get the allTouches array which is a list of the user touches collected from touchesBegan. From this I plan to get the last two touches to get the direction of the swipe. I will also get the time interval between touchesBegan and touchesEnded, from which I will get the speed of the swipe. I will use the direction and the speed to calculate the force of the swipe. What I'd like to know is: is there a better way to do this? Is this already encapsulated in a library call somewhere? Thanks in advance.
