Well the problem here is incompatibilities between the DOM implementation in Firefox and IE. jQuery aims to let the developer avoid doing what you just had to do. Although I can't test out your code (because I don't have all the server-side business logic to populate the elements), you might want to try the following. You basically just need to replace your DOM calls with jQuery's API. Here we go.... Replace: var id = ui.draggable[0].previousSibling.innerText; //returns null for FIREFOX if (id == null) { //FIREFOX works with this id = ui.draggable[0].previousElementSibling.innerHTML } with: var id = ui.draggable.prev().html(); More info on the jQuery API can be found here: jQuery API . Specifically, the prev() and html() calls come from the Traversing and Attributes respectively. I hope I could help! Stephen
