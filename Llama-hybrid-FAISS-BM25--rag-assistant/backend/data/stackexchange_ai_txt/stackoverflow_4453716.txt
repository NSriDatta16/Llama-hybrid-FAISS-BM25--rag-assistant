It's possible but only for one single distinct compilation. For example, the following compiles one single file for Firefox: Because GWT generates browser specific versions, this means only one browser is supported in the compiled file. If you need other browsers change the user.agent and compile again. Note if you do want to support multiple browsers, you need to serve the correct version to the user, something GWT does for you if you use the normal compilation process. So I'm not sure if this is what you really want.
