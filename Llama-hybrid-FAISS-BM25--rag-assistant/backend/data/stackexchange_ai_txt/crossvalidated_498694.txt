What are the reasons why a regresion prediction with a threshold cannot be used as classification?

For example, lets assume there are two models: A logistic regression for whether or not it will rain the next day A linear regression for the amount of rainfall tomorrow What are the reason why and problems with using the prediction from the linear regression and applying a threshold value (>0) to it instead of using a logistic regression to predict whether or not it will rain.
