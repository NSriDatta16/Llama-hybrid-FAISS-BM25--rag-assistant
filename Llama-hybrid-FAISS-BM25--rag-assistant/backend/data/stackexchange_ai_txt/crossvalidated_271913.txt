In general, informing a prior requires a lot of judgment calls (and justification in the write up). There are several steps: Collect the relevant previous studies that could inform the present one. This step is much like collecting previous studies for meta-analysis. You want to be sure it doesn't suffer from the file-drawer problem, whereby you'd only use published research that happened to reach significance and not the unpublished studies that happened not reach significance. In your case, this step might be easy because you've already restricted yourself to considering one specific previous study. (But then be careful not to dismiss "inconvenient" results of previous studies.) Decide how to use the results of the previous studies to inform the present study. In general, previous studies might use different designs, different variables, different analyses. It's an artful translation from the parameters of different previous models to priors on the parameters in a new model. In your case, this step might be easy if your second study is the same structure as the previous study --- the mapping of parameters from previous analysis to new analysis is direct. If you have an MCMC-sampled posterior distribution of the previous study, then figure out how to inform the mathematically-specified prior of the new study. In general, this step is not trivial because the posterior distribution of the previous study is, presumably, a complex multi-dimensional distribution almost certainly with correlations of parameters, and probably with skewed and/or kurtotic tails. You need to decide what sort of mathematical distribution can reasonably approximate the MCMC sample. Then you need to put that mathematical expression in the prior of JAGS. In your case, since you're doing linear regression, it could be important to include the correlations of the parameters. If the structure of the second study is exactly the same as the first study, then you are, essentially, just collecting more data in the same study, and you can just collapse the two data sets into one. But presumably there is something different about the second study, so you can't just use the posterior of the first study directly and exactly for the second study, because if you did that's tantamount to saying you're just collecting more data in the same study. Instead, to capture the fact that there's something different about the second study, you should "relax" the prior, that is, make it more uncertain, because you're not sure how much the prior research really should apply to the second study. How much should you relax the prior? Well, remember the first sentence about a lot of judgment calls? Other respondents may, of course, have more specific recommendations and might even point to examples in the literature that use informed priors. I'd just say to keep the above in mind as you read those examples.
