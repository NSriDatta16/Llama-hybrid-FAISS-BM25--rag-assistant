I'm also still trying to figure out why many difflib functions return a generator instead of a list, what's the advantage there? Well, think about it for a second - if you compare files, those files can in theory (and will be in practice) be quite large - returning the delta as a list, for exampe, means reading the complete data into memory, which is not a smart thing to do. As for only returning the difference, well, there is another advantage in using a generator - just iterate over the delta and keep whatever lines you are interested in. If you read the difflib documentation for Differ - style deltas, you will see a paragraph that reads: Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code: Code Meaning '- ' line unique to sequence 1 '+ ' line unique to sequence 2 ' ' line common to both sequences '? ' line not present in either input sequence So, if you only want differences, you can easily filter those out by using str.startswith You can also use difflib.context_diff to obtain a compact delta which shows only the changes.
