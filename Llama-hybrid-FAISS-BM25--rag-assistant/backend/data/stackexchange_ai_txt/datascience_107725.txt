What are the differences between bert embedding and flair embedding

I read about BERT embedding model and FLAIR embedding model, and I'm not sure I can tell what are the differences between them ? BERT use transformers and FLAIR use BLSTM With BERT , we the feed words into the BERT architecture, and with FLAIR we feed characters into FLAIR architecture. What are the strengths of BERT embedeeing ? What are the strengths of FLAIR embedeeing ? In which cases would we prefer to use one model rather than another ?
