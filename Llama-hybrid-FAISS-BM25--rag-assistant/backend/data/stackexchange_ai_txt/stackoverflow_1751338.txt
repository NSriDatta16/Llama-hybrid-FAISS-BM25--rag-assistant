Embed Windows Media Player with visualization disabled

I'm working in a corporate environment where the primary mechanism of media playback is Windows Media Player. On our intranet we're serving MP3 files in an embedded WMP through Internet Explorer 6. I have no problems with embedding, playback, etc. The only issue is that I want to disable the visualization that is automatically turned on when I'm playing back an MP3. Note : I'd love to, but can't use an alternative in this case. Please don't suggest one. Here's a sample of what my current embedding code looks like, it's very slim and only works in IE. I'm working on updating it to be cross-browser, but that isn't in the requirements right now so it's a low priority. Ideally I'd like to retain the playback controls, but just turn the visualization off. If it's a big black rectangle, that's fine. Our users don't need the illusion that they are flying through a tunnel of sound -- they just want to listen to the audio. I've tried setting the uiMode setting, but none of the possible values listed at MSDN are the ones I'm looking for.
