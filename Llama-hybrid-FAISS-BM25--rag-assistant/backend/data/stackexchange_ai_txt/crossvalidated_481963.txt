Weighted Conditional Expectation definition in AdaBoost

I am looking at "Additive logistic regression a statistical view of boosting" paper ( https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/AdditiveLogisticRegression/alr.pdf ) In page 346, the authors introduce a definition for a weighted expectation. I do not understand the motivation behind this definition and how it is used to get to this result. It introduces this concept to minimize the following expression: Can someone explain the idea behind this please? Thank you
