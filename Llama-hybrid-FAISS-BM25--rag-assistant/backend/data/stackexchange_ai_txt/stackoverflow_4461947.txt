I think a .NET application consuming a VB6 COM component is viable in some circumstances. As an example, I had a .NET application that needed to do some fairly complex manipulation of Office documents. This is very difficult to achieve in .NET, as if you're not extremely careful in releasing references, the Office application will fail to quit as described in this KB article . In this case a pragmatic solution was to create a VB6 component that encapsulated all the Office manipulation, exposing a simplified API to the caller without any of the Office object model.
