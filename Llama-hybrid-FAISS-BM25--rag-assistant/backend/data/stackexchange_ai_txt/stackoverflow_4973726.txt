Silverlight InstallStateChanged does not fire

I'm developing an out-of-browser (OOB) app using Silverlight 4. For installation, I present a webpage with an install button to install the app OOB. When the user clicks the button, Application.Current.Install is executed, installing the app asynchronously. Problem is, after the install process is complete, the InstallStateChanged event should fire, where I have code which copies data from my XAP file to the Isolated Storage. But the InstallStateChanged never fires, even though the main page displays properly upon installation. I've tried this in Elevated Trust setting as well, no luck. Any thoughts on this?
