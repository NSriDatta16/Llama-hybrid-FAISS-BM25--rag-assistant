From the XInclude W3C Spec : The xi:include element has the following attributes: href A value which, after appropriate escaping (see 4.1.1 Escaping of href attribute values) has been performed, results in a URI reference or an IRI reference specifying the location of the resource to include. The href attribute is optional; the absence of this attribute is the same as specifying href="", that is, the reference is to the same document. If the href attribute is absent when parse="xml", the xpointer attribute must be present. Fragment identifiers must not be used; their appearance is a fatal error. A value that results in a syntactically invalid URI or IRI should be reported as a fatal error, but some implementations may find it impractical to distinguish this case from a resource error. So, " Fragment identifiers must not be used; their appearance is a fatal error. " Solution : Try to omit the href attribute and to use the xpointer attribute. However , be aware of the following text from the same spec: Support for the [XPointer xpointer() Scheme] is not mandatory for full XInclude conformance. Authors are advised that use of xpointer() and other XPointer schemes than element() might not be supported by all conformant XInclude implementations Finally, here is an example from the spec of using XPointer fragment inclusion: The following illustrates the results of including fragments of another XML document. Assume the base URI of the document is http://www.example.com/JoeSmithQuote.xml . Joe Smith 20040930 40 price-list.xml references a DTD which declares the id attributes as type ID, and contains: Normal Widget 39.95 34.95 29.95 Super-sized widget with bells and whistles. 59.95 54.95 49.95 The infoset resulting from resolving inclusions on this document is the same (except for the include history and language properties) as that of the following document: Joe Smith 20040930 Super-sized widget with bells and whistles. 40 54.95
