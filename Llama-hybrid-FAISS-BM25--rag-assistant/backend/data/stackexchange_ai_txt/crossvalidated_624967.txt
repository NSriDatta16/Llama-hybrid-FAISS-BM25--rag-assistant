Calculate price forecasts from forecasted returns

I have a question which makes me so hurt. Let's have a price time series $y_{t}$ for the same asset (for example, daily S&P 500 values) $y_{t}$ It can be trendy (trend stationary or difference stationary) or not (stationary for the first moment, for example). Currently, I can use 2 approaches: calculate the ARFIMA-GARCH model directly for $y_{t}$ and use it for the $y_{t+h|t}$ forecasts and also for quantile forecasting or calculate returns (simple or logarithmic), calculate forecasts $r_{t+h|t}$ and quantiles via ARFIMA-GARCH models too after that calculate $y_{t+h|t}$ based on $r_{t+i|t}$ (the same for quantiles too). If $y_{t}$ isn't a TS or DS series, this approach is fully useful (is it right?). But what about the TS/DS type series? Should I first detrend it and after that calculate the correct model and forecasts with backward transformation? What is the best and most correct way to forecast asset prices and quantiles for TS/DS time series using ARFIMA-GARCH models? Please, help. Also, I would be glad to get any links to books/articles describing TS/DS series forecasting based on series returns.
