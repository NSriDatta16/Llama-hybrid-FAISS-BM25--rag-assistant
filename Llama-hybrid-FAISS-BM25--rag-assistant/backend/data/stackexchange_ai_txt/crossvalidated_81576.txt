How to judge if a supervised machine learning model is overfitting or not?

Can anyone tell me how to judge if a supervised machine learning model is overfitting or not? If I don't have an external validation dataset, I want to know if I can use ROC of 10 fold cross validation to explain overfitting. If I have an external validation dataset, what should I do next?
