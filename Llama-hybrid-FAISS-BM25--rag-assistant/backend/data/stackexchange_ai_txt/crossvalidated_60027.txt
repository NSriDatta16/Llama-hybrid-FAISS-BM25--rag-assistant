Combinatorics problem applied to GAM logistic regression

I'm doing biomedical research and I need to set a GAM Logistic Model which get the maximum AUC score as possible. I have 4 disease markers; $Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, Y_4$ with different data in each one, and the model must have the following specification: $\text{Model} = \log(\text{Odds Ratio} (\text{Illness}~|~Y_j,Y_i)) = \alpha + \sum\limits_{i,j}^n f_k(Y_k) $ The problem is that I need to code in R all the possible combinations between this 4 markers without repetitions, in order to do multiple comparisons, such as: $\text{Model}_1 = \alpha + f_1(Y_1) + f_3(Y_3)$ or $\text{Model}_2 = \alpha + f_1(Y_1) + f_2(Y_2) + f_3(Y_3)$ etc. When I code each model manually I use sentences like these. This is an example for a model with only one marker: model=gam(group~s(y1),family='binomial') pred=predict(model,type='response') r=ROCEmpiric(group,1-pred) Where group is always in, as indicator of disease, and ROCEmpiric is a function which calculates the ROC value. Does anyone know the way to automate the calculations? It's seems ridiculous to write each function after doing the summation of permutations.
