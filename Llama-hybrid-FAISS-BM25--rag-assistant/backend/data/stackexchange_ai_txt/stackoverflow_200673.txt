How does Google Desktop Search manage to stay light and fast?

I always wondered what different methods Google Desktop Search is using so that it uses least CPU and memory while indexing a computer containing more 100,000 files on an average. In just few hours it has indexed the whole system and I did not see it eating up my CPU, memory etc. If any of you have done some research, please do share.
