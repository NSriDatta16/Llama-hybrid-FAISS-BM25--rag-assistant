As it turned out, writing my own calendar, based on jQuery's draggable/droppable UI component is not that hard, and is way more flexible and extensible. There are some WTFs along the way, mostly to do with weird behaviour of dragging/dropping in IE(7/8) and some weirdness around snap to grid behaviour in jQuery UI's draggable, but I think it would take longer if I just took an existing control and tried to customise it.
