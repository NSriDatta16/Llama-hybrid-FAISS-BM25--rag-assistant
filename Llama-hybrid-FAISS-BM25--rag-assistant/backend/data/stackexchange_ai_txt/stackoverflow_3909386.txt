Using unmanaged library

So in visual studio i have my solution with two projects, first one is managed c++ code and second one is unmanaged c++ library ( waffles ). I want to use classes from library in my managed code. If i simply add 'include "GMacros.h"', then i get 'cannot compile with /clr' error. Tried to wrap include in #pragma unmanaged/managed, but it doesnt seem to work. Is there anything i can do without editing external library code or writing any wrappers?
