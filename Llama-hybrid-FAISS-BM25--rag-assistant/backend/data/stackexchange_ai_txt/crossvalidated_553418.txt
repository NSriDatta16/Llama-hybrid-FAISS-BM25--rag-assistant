PACF on Smooth Time Series

I have generated a heatmap of sorts from events occurring on certain dates. This heatmap is made as a Gaussian mixture with a fixed standard deviation of 50 days for each event. The heatmap looks like this: There seems to be some 'clumping' going on so I wanted to check the pacf plot to confirm my suspicion. I am expecting to see a partial autocorrelation of one and almost one at lags 0 and 1 and then negative lags after this (correct me if I have misunderstood this) and what I get is this: This confirms my hypothesis which is nice but what is bugging me here is the extremely smooth behaviour of the partial autocorrelations. Is this to be expected for a 'smooth' function like mine, or is something awry? The reason I am worried is that I seem to get some very weird behaviour depending on which method I use, see here . For OLS for instance:
