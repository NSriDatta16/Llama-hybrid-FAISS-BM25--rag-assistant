I've been seeing the same thing lately. I haven't been able to determine the cause or reliably reproduce the bug, but perhaps it is related to the most recent update (I'm using the "cutting-edge" build 1631). I believe I began seeing the issue after the update (mid-March). Sometimes restarting TextMate has fixed it. Sometimes I cleared the font cache, too. As Allan noted in the ticket I filed , this is due to a bug in OS 10.6 with third-party external LCD panels: In that case the problem is likely with the automatic selection of font smoothing (based on display), see http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090828224632809 for more details and potential workaround. The reason restarting TextMate sometimes worked for me (and you, apparently), is because we restarted it without the external monitor attached. Running the defaults command in that Mac OS X Hints article fixes it properly. defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2
