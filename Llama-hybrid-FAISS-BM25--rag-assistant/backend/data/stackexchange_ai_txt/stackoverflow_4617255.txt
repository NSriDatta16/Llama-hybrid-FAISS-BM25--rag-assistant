steps to securing amazon EC2+EBS

I have just installed a fedora linux AMI on amazon EC2, from the amazon collection. I plan to connect it to EBS storage. Assuming I have done nothing more than the most basic steps, no password changed, nothing extra has been done at this stage other than the above. Now, from this point, what steps should I take to stop the hackers and secure my instance/EBS?
