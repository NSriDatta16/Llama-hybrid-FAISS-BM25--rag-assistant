specific VB Linq Query help

I am still new to LINQ, and I have wrestled with a query for several days and am ready to surrender to ignorance on this one. I need to: join 3 tables (on a total of 2 databases). Lets call them Table1 Table2 Table3 Table1 joins to Table2 on "org" the result joins to Table3 on "emplid" Filters (where): Table3.success = true Table3.appcode = "neo" Table1.empl_rcd = 0 start_date (one that I can pass in as a variable) end_date (one that I can pass in as a variable) Groupings: (I think grouping is how you would do it?) Form the joined-up table must only select the earliest (most distant past) "stamp" date field for each "emplid" grouping ("stamp" originally on Table3, "emplid" originally on Table3 and Table1) From the joined-up table must only select the latest (most recent) "effdt" date field for each "emplid" grouping ("effdt" originally on Table1, "emplid" originally on Table3 and Table1) Select: I need to select all the returned rows from the previous logic. I can figure out how to filter the final rows I'll need. Here is the last thing I got to execute, and it may give you an idea of what I was doing: query = (From j In db.table1s _ Join a In db.table3s _ On j.EMPLID Equals a.emplid _ Join d In db.table2s _ On d.ORG Equals j.Org _ Where a.appcode = "neo" _ Where a.success = True _ Select a.appcode, j.effdt, a.stamp, j.EMPLID, _ d.ORGANIZATION_DESCRIPTION, d.DEPARTMENT_DESCRIPTION, d.VP_DESCRIPTION, _ a.success _ Distinct).AsQueryable().AsEnumerable() If you can get me this far, I'll give you credit. But if you can do the next thing too, before I give out credit, I'll give YOU credit. then out of that result I need to return a count of unique "emplid" for each "org". So the very end result would look like: org | count | (other columns) ------------------------------------------------ 12345 | 15 | etc... 54321 | 7 | etc... thanks for helping out a noob.
