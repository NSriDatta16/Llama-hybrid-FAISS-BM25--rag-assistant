How (if needed) to free dynamic memory when marshaling CString from C++ to C#?

I have CString cs on C++ side and IntPtr ip on C# side which contains value of cs through marshaling mechanism. Then, I simply get needed String as Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi(ip) and everything works fine, but I am wondering should I and if should, how can I delete unmanaged memory occupied by ip, i.e. cs?
