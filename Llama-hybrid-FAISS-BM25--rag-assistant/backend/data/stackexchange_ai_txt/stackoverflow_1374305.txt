Resizable drop shadows with JQuery

I'm looking for a JQuery plugin that supports adding resizable drop shadows to divs, tables, text, etc. I really only want the shadow to resize when the user resizes the browser window (the elements with the shadows are not draggable). I've tried this plugin but it doesn't seem to shrink the width of a shadow when a user narrows the browser window. Thanks, Don
