Silverlight is not fetching data from my WCF RIA service

I just started learning Silverlight by walking through the labs posted on Channel9. When I tried to explore a little bit I found that my queries were not working as I thought they would. To recreate what I have done you would need to create a new Silverlight Business application, create a data entity that is pointed to the Adventureworks LT db, and generate the web services for those entities (including edit). I then simply drug a RichTextbox to Home.xaml and in Home.xaml.cs I added this code first to OnNavigatedTo and when that didn't work to the constructor. AdventureWorksDomainContext ctx = new AdventureWorksDomainContext(); EntityQuery query = from p in ctx.GetProductsQuery() select p; LoadOperation loadOp = ctx.Load(query); var paragraph = new Paragraph(); foreach (var product in loadOp.Entities) { paragraph.Inlines.Add(new Run { Text = product.Name }); } richTextBox1.Blocks.Add(paragraph); When I run the page I never see loadOp.Entities contain a value and I only see the query I expect, go across the wire after all my code has been executed. I feel like I'm missing something fundamental and this will make more sense if I can find someone to explain it to me. Thanks, Eric
