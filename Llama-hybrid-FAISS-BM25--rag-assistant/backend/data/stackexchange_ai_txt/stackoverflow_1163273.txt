There is no real answer to this question. It depends largely on your application's needs, and numerous other factors. I'd suggest reading some books on design patterns and enterprise application architecture. These two are invaluable: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture Some other books that I highly recommend are: The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code No matter your skill level, reading these will really open your eyes to a world of possibilities.
