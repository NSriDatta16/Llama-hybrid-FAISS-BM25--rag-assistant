In Oracle there can be significant storage space savings if your table has a number of NULLable columns and you place the NULLable columns at the end of the list. NULL values on the end of a row take up no space. e.g. imagine this table: (id NOT NULL, name VARCHAR2(100), surname VARCHAR2(100), blah VARCHAR2(100, date_created DATE NOT NULL) the row (100, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10-JAN-2000') will require storage for the values 100, some space for the three NULLs, followed by the date. Alternatively, the same table but with different ordering: (id NOT NULL, date_created DATE NOT NULL, name VARCHAR2(100), surname VARCHAR2(100), blah VARCHAR2(100)) the row (100, '10-JAN-2000', NULL, NULL, NULL) will only require storage for the values 100 and the date - the trailing NULLs are omitted entirely. Normally this makes little difference but for very large tables with many NULLable columns, significant savings may be made - less space used can translate to more rows per block, meaning less IO and CPU required to query the table.
