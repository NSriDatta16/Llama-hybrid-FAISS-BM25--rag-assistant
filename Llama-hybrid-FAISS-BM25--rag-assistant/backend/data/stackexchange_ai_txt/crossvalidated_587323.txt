How to correctly bucket data into quantiles: by index or by value?

I've been recently involved in a discussion surrounding the assignment of individual values to n-tiles. One way of doing it would be to rank all of the data in ascending order, dividing it into $n$ equal segments, and finding the the n-tiles. Everything that comes before the n-th index and after the (n-1)th index is said to be belonging to the n-th tile. By definition, this generates n-tile buckets that contain the same number of data points. Another way of doing it is by value: we find the n-tiles, and then attribute any data point whose value is between the n-th tile value and the (n-1)th value to the n-th tile. In this case, the number of data points in each bucket can be different. Let's consider the following example with quartiles: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 8 The 1st quartile is 0, the 2nd is 1.5 (average of 1 and 2), the 3rd is 5 and the 4th is 6. Using the method by index, the first five data points belong to the 1st quartile, the next 5 data points belong to the 2nd, and so on. However, if we were to use the "by value" method, we would have 7 data points belonging to the 1st quartile ( Which method do you think is best? I will post my reasoning in the answer, but I am genuinely interested in knowing what the established way if doing this is and why.
