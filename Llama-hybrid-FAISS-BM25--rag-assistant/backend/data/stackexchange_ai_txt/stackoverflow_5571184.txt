You should use System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebContro l when your control is going to have a UI component visible on the rendered page, as it contains the various plumbing code generate a UI (though still requiring considerable work from you to create that UI). System.Web.UI.Controls are for when your control will not have a UI on the rendered page (think some of the ASP.NET DataSource controls that reside in the toolbox, can be dragged onto a page, don't render anything, and act as a conduit for getting data to a GridView control that does have a UI). See this MSDN article .
