Having tables that aren't linked to others can be reasonable, but I'm not sure that's the case in the PHPBB database. Check the link below for an attempt at documenting the PHPBB database structure. It includes about 20 tables, which sounds like the linked tables you saw. Can you provide the names of the unlinked tables you're looking at? http://www.phpbbdoctor.com/doc_tables.php Table list: phpbb_auth_access phpbb_banlist phpbb_categories phpbb_config phpbb_confirm phpbb_disallow phpbb_forums phpbb_forum_prune phpbb_groups phpbb_posts phpbb_posts_text phpbb_privmsgs phpbb_privmsgs_text phpbb_ranks phpbb_search_results phpbb_search_wordlist phpbb_search_wordmatch phpbb_sessions phpbb_smilies phpbb_themes phpbb_themes_name phpbb_topics phpbb_topics_watch phpbb_users phpbb_user_group phpbb_vote_desc phpbb_vote_results phpbb_vote_voters phpbb_words EDIT - In answer to your question edit, there isn't a specific name for having 1/3 linked tables, and 2/3 unlinked. The main scenario I can think of off the top of my head for unlinked tables is having audit tables tracking the changes that occur over time in particular tables. There would be less audit 'unlinked' tables than linked though. The reason we're focussing on PHPBB is that's the example you've shown - it may be a quirk of the particular installation of PHPBB that you're looking at, this certainly isn't a normal thing to find. Can you use your tool with another database and see what results from that? Also in terms of the database you have run your tool against - is that a custom installation that your organisation has performed? My suspicion is that these unlinked tables that you can see have been added by custom modifications to the base PHPBB install, or are potentially unrelated tables that have been added to the database because it was convenient and available (e.g. the blog table). Your best bet is to ask the person who supports that installation of the database. In terms of your wider question - as mentioned above, its not a particularly normal pattern, but possibly a mix of addons and (mis)use of the database by other things would explain it.
