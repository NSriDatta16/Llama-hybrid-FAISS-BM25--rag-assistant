How to approach ranking and explaining business driver independent variables?

I'm looking at quarterly sales for a fortune 500 company, sales being the dependent target variable. My independent variables include things like marketing spend, sales volume, and competitor market share. My question is how can I answer what variables influenced why sales increased/decreased the most for the quarter? I'm currently thinking of running a classic regression model on weekly data for the quarter, then taking the variables that have p values I was also thinking I could use a random forest to rank the variables that explain the most variance. So if marketing spend and sales volume both increased with sales, which one was more important? I could use the random forest variable ranking to show this. Can I combine the two approaches, taking a linear regression with low p value variable and their coefficients, then ranking them according to random forest? Is there a standard way of doing this?
