First question: why is it important for third-party sites to have unbroken URLs to your site? Are they paying you for content? If they're not paying you for content, is there some benefit that you get by giving them content for free? This is a business decision, and perhaps you come to the conclusion that it's worth paying the overage fees to provide that content. Second question: how many URLs are actually linked from third-party sites? You could take the time to keep those URLs available, and switch everything else to S3 hosting. A Google "link:" query can help answer this. So, to solutions: first solution works if you have the ability to create 301 redirects. Simply set up a redirect for every URL that you want to move. Second solution is a reverse proxy, in which URLs on mysite.com are mapped to mysite.s3.amazon.com. I'm not sure that this is really a good solution; you'll be paying for bandwidth to proxy the files. Plus, if you have the ability to set up a reverse proxy, you have the ability to create 301 redirects. Third solution: move your site en masse, and have the domain name map to S3 (via CNAME mapping). Yes, you end up paying for a hosting service that you no longer use. And if you use dynamic content, it's not going to work (but perhaps then you pay the $30/month for S3). And finally, not a solution but a path forward: use a distinct domain name for additional static content. That domain name can be mapped via CNAME to an Amazon bucket.
