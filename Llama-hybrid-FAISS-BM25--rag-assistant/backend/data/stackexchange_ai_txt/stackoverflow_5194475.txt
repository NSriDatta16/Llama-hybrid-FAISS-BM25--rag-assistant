That sounds like hreview-aggregate to me. A simple recommendation doesn't necessarily have a numeric value, but you can arbitrarily assign one based on the number of people. The scale will keep changing, but the proportions will stay the same. Example: ... 90 out of 100 people recommend. So every time you add a new person, both best and count would change. That makes sense, since the best scenario would be everyone recommending. That may be a bit misleading, since people aren't really rating on a 100-point scale, but the average of 90% is still accurate.
