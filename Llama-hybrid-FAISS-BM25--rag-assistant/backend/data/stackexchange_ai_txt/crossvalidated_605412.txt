Do you hope to do research on statistical or machine-learning methods? Even if this class just proves conclusions that you've already seen, the mathematical techniques and frameworks behind these proofs are the same ones used by research statisticians to develop new cutting-edge results. This class is the first step towards making your own contributions to statistical methodology. It will also help you sanity-check a colleague's work when they say they've developed a "better" statistical method for some scenario. (How is it better: more efficient? more robust? etc. Does it actually work the way they think it does?) Do you appreciate beauty in math? I find that some of the math techniques or results themselves are beautiful. For instance, you can approach several common situations from totally different angles (MLE, MOM, Bayesian posterior mode, minimizing MSE...) and they all give the same answer (sample mean)! How cool is that? Do you only care about applications, not the "pure" math itself? Even so, a Math Stats course will give you a much deeper understanding of what these methods are doing. Personally, I had seen p-values and confidence intervals many times, but they did not really click for me until I took Math Stats. It will also help you learn to watch out for situations when the standard methods won't work and possibly develop your own solutions or workarounds. Do you want to work with data-minded colleagues but not analyze data yourself? Even so, you'll be better prepared to follow other people's new developments in statistics, AI, and machine learning, so you can sensibly decide whether they're useful to your work. For instance, differential privacy has been a recent hot topic in my areas of work, but it's not trivial to understand what it's even trying to solve or how it proposes to do so; some Math Stat background definitely helps.
