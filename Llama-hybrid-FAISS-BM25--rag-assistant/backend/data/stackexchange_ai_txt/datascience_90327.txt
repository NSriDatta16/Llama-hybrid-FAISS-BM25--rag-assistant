Python: SARIMAX Model Fits too slow

I have a time series data with the date and temperature records of a city. Following are my observations from the time series analysis: By plotting the graph of date vs temperature seasonality is observed. Performing adfuller test we find that the data is already stationary, so d=0 . Perform Partial Autocorrelation and Autocorrelation with First Seasonal Difference and found p=2 and q=10 respectively. Code to Train Model model=sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(df['temperature'],order=(1, 1, 1),seasonal_order=(2,0,10,12)) results=model.fit() This fit function runs indefinitely and does not reach an output. I am running on a on Google Colab CPU. How to fix this issue?
