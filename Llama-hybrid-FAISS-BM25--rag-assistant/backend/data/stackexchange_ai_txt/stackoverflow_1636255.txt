I found a page on google full of useful links An overview of Mobile modules for Drupal http://mobiledrupal.com/content/overview-mobile-modules-drupal Then theres the mobile theme and modules http://drupal.org/project/mobile_theme Adds the ability to choose a mobile theme in admin/build/themes/settings which is used for serving users on mobile devices. http://drupal.org/project/browscap The Browscap module provides a replacement for PHP's get_browser() function. get_browser() is difficult (or impossible) to configure for most users in shared webhosting situations, and requires attention to keep the underlying data (browscap.ini) up-to-date. This module avoids the configuration issue by storing the data in a database table, and the freshness issue by automatically retrieving the latest data on a weekly basis (if cron.php is run regularly).
