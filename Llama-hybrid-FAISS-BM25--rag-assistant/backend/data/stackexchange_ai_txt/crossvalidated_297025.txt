Calculate average slope in a quadratic

Let's say I have crop yield on y-axis and a measure of heat-stress on x-axis According to this graph, as heat increases, the yield also increases and after reaching a maximum (at heat = 0.67), the yield starts decreasing. I want to quantify the decrease in yield after crossing the maximum. A sentence like "After crossing the optimum heat-stress (x=0.67), the yield decreases, on average, by X%" I want to calculate the X%. At the moment, what I have done is: 1) calculate the mean yield of the maximum till the minimum which will be mean of yield from Heat-stress=0.67 till Heat-stress=4.6 (the highest x-value). Let's call this value mean.y' 2) express yield from Heat-stress = 0.67 till Heat-stress = 4.6 as a percentage of mean.y Yield.p = (Yield - Mean.y/Mean.y) * 100 3) Take the mean of Yield.p which will give me a percentage value which is in my case is 13% So I can write it as: "After crossing the optimum heat-stress (x=0.67), the yield decreases, on average, by 13%" Is this correct or could I express in some other way?
