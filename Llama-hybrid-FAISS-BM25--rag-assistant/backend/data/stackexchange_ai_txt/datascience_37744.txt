overfit a Random Forest

I am trying to overfit to the maximum a random forest classifier using scikit-learn to make some tests. Does somebody know what hyperparameters I can tune to do that? Or does somebody know which other model I could apply to achieve a overfitted to the maximum a non-linear model?
