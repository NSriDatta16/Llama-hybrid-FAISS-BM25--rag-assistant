I have found that this is often caused by caseSensitive file and module names. Are you developing on different platforms to your production (Windows vs *nix)? Check that your module names are in the form of Module_Lowercasenamesonlyworkhere . ------EDIT------ Try installing Alanstorm's ConfigViewer module or CommerceBug extension from his website, that will show you the "complied" config for all the admin modules. You can then see if your adminhtml nodes are being included. That's the only way that I'm aware of that will confirm that your config is being read by Magento, which sounds like the issue.
