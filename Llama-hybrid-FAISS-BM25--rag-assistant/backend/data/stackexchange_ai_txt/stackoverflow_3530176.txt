It's possible to embed graphics data in a couple of ways. Most modern browsers accept the data: url notation. An image can be embedded straight into a url. I took an example from this site . Cut and paste the whole line into the url bar: data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAOALMAAOazToeHh0tLS/7LZv/0jvb29t/f3//Ub//ge8WSLf/rhf/3kdbW1mxsbP//mf///yH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAQAA4AAARe8L1Ekyky67QZ1hLnjM5UUde0ECwLJoExKcppV0aCcGCmTIHEIUEqjgaORCMxIC6e0CcguWw6aFjsVMkkIr7g77ZKPJjPZqIyd7sJAgVGoEGv2xsBxqNgYPj/gAwXEQA7 You should see a folder graphic. Some older browsers don't accept this, and some such as IE8 restrict content in various ways, to static content for security reasons. The second way of doing the same is for the server to serve multi-part MIME. Basically a server would shove out a multi-part mime document consisting of the HTML body and then any inline images base64 encoded as separate parts. This is more suitable for email HTML although it might work through a web browser.
