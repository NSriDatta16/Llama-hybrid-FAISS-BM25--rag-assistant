I know this question is pretty much old but it remained unanswered. Perhaps the main question is not how to remove the seasonal cycle in the data but it is part of it, so I'll give it a try: To remove seasonality from a data set there are several methods, from simple monthly-aggregated averages to fitting a sinusoidal (or another appropriate harmonic) function with non-linear fitting methods like Nelder-Mead. The easiest way is to average data belonging to all Januaries, to all Februaries, and so on, i.e., you create a composited annual cycle, which then you can subtract from your data
