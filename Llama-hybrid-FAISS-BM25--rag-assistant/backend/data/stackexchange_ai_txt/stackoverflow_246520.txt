How do I find a user's Active Directory display name in a C# web application?

I'm writing a web application which uses windows authentication and I can happily get the user's login name using something like: string login = User.Identity.Name.ToString(); But I don't need their login name I want their DisplayName. I've been banging my head for a couple hours now... Can I access my organisation's AD via a web application?
