The issue becomes less contentious if you state the facts[1]. After all, all multivariate robust estimation procedures have at their core an outlier detection algorithm and all will in some form or another output a list of suspect observations. Stated otherwise, given a robust fit, identifying outliers is in principle not an issue. The main difference between robust estimation approaches and the testing approaches (Dixon, Grubbs) is that the latter can sustain at most a single outlier. In contrast, most state of the art robust estimation procedures have been designed to handle nearly 50% contamination (they can in principle be tuned to handle anywhere between 0 and nearly 50 percent outliers trading off robustness for computational costs).
