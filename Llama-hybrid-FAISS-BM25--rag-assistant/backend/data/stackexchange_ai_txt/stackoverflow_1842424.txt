An option you might consider would be a simple version number tied to class: public class Person { private Integer id; private Integer version; private String name; private String address; private String telephone; //additional class stuff... } Using this approach, whenever the name, address, or other attributes are updated, the version number is incremented by one. This preserves the original data under the previous version, and allows for easy retrieval of all previous version by id, which does not change.
