Because assignments have a value in Actionscript, which makes that syntax legal, and they don't have a value in Java, which makes it not. The difference comes because despite recent Java-izations, Actionscript is descended from ECMAScript. Other consequences of this design are the ability to make statements like this: var foo:Number = 0; var bar:Number = 0; foo = bar = 2; assertEquals(2, foo); assertEquals(2, bar); IMO, this is the best behavior it could have - it doesn't break compatibility with older versions of Actionscript, and it doesn't remove language functionality for the purpose of handholding, but it does bring a common error to the attention of the user.
