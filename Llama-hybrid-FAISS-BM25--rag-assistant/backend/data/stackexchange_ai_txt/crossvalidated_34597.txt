The EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) is an alternative. Newer observations receive higher weigths than olders ones depending on the decay factor $\lambda \epsilon [0,1]$ $ \bar{X}_t = (1-\lambda) X_{t-1} + \lambda \bar{X}_{t-1}$ To start the recursion, an starting value $X_0$ is required, depending on each case, this can be a mean over an "initializing" period. From this formula it's not clear why this is an exponential weight but this can be shown mathematically by replacing $\bar{X}_{t-1}$ (and so on) by the very same formula until expressing $\bar{X}_{t}$ as function of {$X_0,X_1, ...,X_{t-1}$}. You will find applications for volatility estimation of financial returns.
