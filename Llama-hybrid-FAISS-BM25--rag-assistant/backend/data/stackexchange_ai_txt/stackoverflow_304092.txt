You'll have HTML5.0 with local database-like features. However what do you mean by secure? HTML5.0 will be secure against cross-site issues, but the user will still have full access to the data, I don't think encryption is required. Google gears does fit, but its not a standard while HTML5.0 is, Safari supports 5.0, and I guess Opera and Firefox will too by mid 2009, if they don't already. Explorer, probably will have some buggy implementation so they can force developers to use Silverlight. Edit: Stephen, I see you need to destroy the cache after they leave, of course unless their machine has a proximity sensor this won't be possible :) But you could have your Javascript delete everything when they Logoff for example.
