Well you must first consider what type of data , the category of algorithm , and what branch of machine learning you will be doing ... for example: unsupervised time series on stocks supervised categorical classification of images etc. After this, you could select a few suitable algorithms for your use-case,(e.g. regression, random forests, or other suitable methods) and then generate some simulated data which would roughly approximate the data once you have it. You could then train and test the model on the simulated datasets, in preparation for the collection of real data. At this stage, it sounds like you need to gather more information about the use-case so you know the direction to develop.
