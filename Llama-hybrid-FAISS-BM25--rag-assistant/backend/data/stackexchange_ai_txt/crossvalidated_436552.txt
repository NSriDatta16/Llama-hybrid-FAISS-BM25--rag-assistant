Dirac Delta Function in Bayesian Optimization

I am reading a paper on Bayesian optimization which aims at selecting the batch of points $x_0,x_1,..,x_k$ to sample to obtain maxima or minima of the GP. So the first batch element is normal acquisition function and optimizing the argmax will lead to first sampling element as follows: $${x}_{1}= \textrm{argmax} \ \mathcal{\alpha} (\mathbf{x}; I_{0})$$ $ \mathcal{\alpha} (\mathbf{x}; I_{0})$ is just symbolic term for any acquisition function such as Expected Improvement, Probability of Improvement etc. For second element of the batch we need to marginalize (integrate out previous element) as well as optimize (argmax for new element) as follows $${x}_{2}= \textrm{argmax} \int \mathcal{\alpha} (\mathbf{x}; I_{1})p(y_{1}|x_{1},I_0)p(x_{1}|I_0)dx_1dy_1$$ where, $ p(y_{1}|x_{1},I_0)$ is predictive distribution of the GP $p(x_{1}|I_0)$ = $\delta (x_{1}-\textrm{argmax} \ \mathcal{\alpha} (\mathbf{x}; I_{0}))$ Similarly for the third element of the batch $x_3$ we need to marginalize the first two and optimize and for kth element marginalize all the previous k-1 and then optimize as shown by equation 2 in the attached paper. Now as per the post here marginalization makes sense because we are using predictive distribution of the GP and when we predict the future point we need to account for uncertainty based on previous predictions. but what I dont understand is what is the role of the delta function here? This post provides intuition of using delta function but I still cant make a connection. $$\delta (x_{1}-\textrm{argmax} \ \mathcal{\alpha} (\mathbf{x}; I_{0}))$$ Shouldn't the above expression evaluate to $\delta (0)$ ?
