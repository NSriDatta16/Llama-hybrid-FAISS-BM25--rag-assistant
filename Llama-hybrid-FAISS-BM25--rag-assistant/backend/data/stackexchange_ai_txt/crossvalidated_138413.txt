The relevant reference would be Shore-Sheppard (1996) "The Precision of Instrumental Variables Estimates With Grouped Data" . You can directly calculate by how much the standard errors in 2SLS are over-estimated by using the Moulton factor $$\frac{Var(\widehat{\beta}^c)}{Var(\widehat{\beta}^{ols})} = 1 + \left(\frac{Var(n_g)}{\overline{n}} + \overline{n} -1 \right)\rho_z\rho $$ where $g$ are the groups, $\overline{n}$ is the average group size $$\rho_z = \frac{\sum_g \sum_{i\neq k}(z_{ig}-\overline{z})(z_{kg}-\overline{z})}{Var(z_{ig})\sum_g n_g (n_g - 1)} $$ is the intra-class correlation coefficient of the instrument $z$ and $\rho$ is the intra-class correlation coefficient of the second stage error - clustering in the first stage error does not matter for this. From this you see that your 2SLS standard error depends on the number of groups and their average sizes, and the two intra-class correlation coefficients. If you need more information on this have a look at these lecture notes by Steve Pischke.
