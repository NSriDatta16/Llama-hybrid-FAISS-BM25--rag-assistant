Features extraction and classification

I'm implementing an ancient coins recognition system. I have used contours detection to extract features of coins. And I thought to use SVM for training images. My question is how I can give those features to SVM? I got to know that I have to save those features into a file and then that file should feed to the SVM. But, I don't have an idea to save features to a file. Saving features to a file means save the number of contours in the image, x, y, width and height of each contour right? Can someone please help me? I am stuck here for two months. Still, I couldn't find the solution for this. Once I save features to a file, do I have to give the coin name also to the same file or to another file? Appreciate your help a lot. Nadeeshani
