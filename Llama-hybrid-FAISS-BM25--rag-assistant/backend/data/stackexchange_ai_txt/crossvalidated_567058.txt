Combining earnings report data with customer satisfaction survey data

There is a popular Kaggle dataset on airline CSAT . It is a customer satisfaction survey using features of inflight services and travel procedures such as Gate Location , WiFi Quality , Flight Distance , Cabin Class etc. No one knows for sure, but it's believed to be taken from Delta, American and Alaska. Since these types of classification datasets are so common, I want to incorporate airline earnings report data to differentiate my analysis from other projects. How would I approach this? Would it even be possible since the airlines are unknown? Even if the airlines were known, I wouldn't know which data points belonged to which airline and I wouldn't know the years of the survey. Would I be better off with another source of data? Is this something I can locate by a paid subscription somewhere? Provided all this would even be possible, what would I be doing exactly? Would I be combining time series data (airline earnings reports) with my CSAT dataset? Earnings reports are only 1-4 quarterly values (not thousands of rows) so how would I use that information in my analysis?
