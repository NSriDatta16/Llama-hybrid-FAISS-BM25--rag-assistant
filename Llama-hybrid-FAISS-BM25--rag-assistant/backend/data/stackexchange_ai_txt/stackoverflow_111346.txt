RISKS is not security-specific, but some interesting security-related topics are discussed there. BUGTRAQ is a full-disclosure security mailing list that is worth skimming. (Every time a vulnerability is disclosed in a piece of software that ships with most Linux distributions, there is a barrage of disclosures from all of the various distributions. This negatively affects the signal-to-noise ratio unless you're using one of those distributions.) Some security-related blogs that may be interesting (in addition to Schneier on Security which has already been linked): â€¦And You Will Know me by the Trail of Bits , DoxPara Research (Dan Kaminsky) , Matasano Chargen , Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle , ZDNet's "Zero Day" .
