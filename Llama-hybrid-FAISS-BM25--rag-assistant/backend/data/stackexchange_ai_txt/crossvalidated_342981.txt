addressing multicollinearity and low levels in PCA

I am trying to build a multiple regression model to predict properties prices and I would like to cunduct PCA to choose the most relevant variables. I know that the the variables should be uncorrelated. What would be the best way to check and deal with multicollinearity? I have 80 variables. I have tried correlation plot and VIF function in r and deleted those ones with VIF around 10 (>=9.9 should I be more/less conservative??). After I created dummy variables out of my categorical variables I applied prin_comp I am new to stats so any help would be appreciated.
