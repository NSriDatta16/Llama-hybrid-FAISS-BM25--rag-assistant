It seems you understand it just fine: evidence against null cannot be immediately translated into evidence for any particular $H_a$ (unless $H_a$ is just the negation of $H_0$ ). For an obvious example, a significant p-value from a two-tailed t-test tells you nothing about the effect direction. If you need inference beyond null hypothesis testing, a small step forward is looking into confidence intervals, but the final answer is Bayesian analysis: then your posterior support for $H_a$ will be determined from prior support for $H_a$ and new evidence for it. In practice, this is often replaced with a qualitative discussion of probable effect sizes, power, and evidence ("we had good power to detect any effects larger than $c$ ..."). IMHO, this requires just as much effort and provides less answers than the Bayesian framework.
