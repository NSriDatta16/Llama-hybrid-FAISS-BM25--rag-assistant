Traditional neural networks do not approximate a probability distribution. While some outputs (softmax) or loss functions can look like probabilities or using techniques from statistics the model remains a point approximation with fixed weight values. This means you cannot use the model to approximate the uncertainty in a Bayesian way. To introduce uncertainty into the model, I recommend Bayesian Neural Networks and/or Bayesian Dropout.
