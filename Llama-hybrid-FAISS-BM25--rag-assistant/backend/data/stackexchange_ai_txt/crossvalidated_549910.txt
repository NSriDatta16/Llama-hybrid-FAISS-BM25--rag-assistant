Can logistic regression take continuous probability as label?

Let's consider logistic regression for binary classification, with label 0 or 1 . The loss function is -ylog(x) - (1-y)log(1-x) , where x is predicted probability for label 1 and y is the label. In sklearn, logistic regression only take discrete labels. Why can't y be a continuous value between [0, 1] ? Theoretically, Is there any mathematical problem if I label my samples like 0.75 being label 1 and 0.25 chance being label 0 ? The question is mostly inspired by the implementation of logistic regression in sklearn, which does not take continuous input. For continuous input, every distinct number is considered as a class https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/0d378913b/sklearn/linear_model/_logistic.py#L1517 .
