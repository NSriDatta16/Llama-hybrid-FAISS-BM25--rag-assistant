Historically the terms byte, nibble and bit indicate a unit of storage, a mnemonic or code...not a numeric value. Having negative mega-bytes of memory or adding ASCII codes 1 and 2 expecting code 3 is kinda silly. In many ways there is no such thing as a signed "byte". Sometimes the line between "thing" and "value" is very blurry....as with most languages that treat byte as a thing and a value.
