The specific problem may be flawed. But it is important to know that the distribution of the sum of independent normal random variables is normal. Here is a similar problem, but with very small probabilities of negative snack expenditures. Suppose we have independent random variables: $X_1 \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu_1=9, \sigma_1=2),\,$ $X_2 \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu_2=10, \sigma_2=1),\,$ $X_3 \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu_3=12, \sigma_3=3).$ The probabilities of negative values for these three random variables are computed in R (where pnorm denotes a normal CDF) as follows: pnorm(0, 9, 2); pnorm(0, 10, 1); pnorm(0, 12, 3) [1] 3.397673e-06 [1] 7.619853e-24 [1] 3.167124e-05 It is OK to model test scores, human heights, and other distributions as normal, but you have to be careful. Even though most of the probability in a normal distribution lies within $\mu \pm 3\sigma,$ the values do extend down to $-\infty$ and up to $\infty.$ So you have to be sure that probabilities of impossible negative events are negligible. (That is the point of @whuber's first Comment.) Then the distribution of the sum $S = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$ is $$\mathsf{Norm}\left(\mu_S = \mu_1+\mu_2+\mu_3,\; \sigma_S = \sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2+\sigma_3^2}\right).$$ Then the average $A = S/3$ is distributed as $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu_S/3, \sigma_S/3).$ I suppose you can find these formulas in your text or class notes, and then find some probability such as $P(A Note: By simulating what happens on a very large number of afternoon snacks with these three students, it is possible to approximate $P(A m = 10^6; x1 = rnorm(m, 9, 2); x2 = rnorm(m, 10, 1); x3 = rnorm(m, 12, 3) X = cbind(x1, x2, x3); a = rowMeans(X) mean(a); sd(a); sqrt(14)/3; mean(a The vector a contains a million average snack bills; a is a logical vector with a million TRUE s and FALSE s. Its mean is the proportion of its TRUE s.
