Principal component analysis is a technique to decompose an array of numerical data into a set of orthogonal vectors (uncorrelated linear combinations of the variables) called principal components. The first few principal components often suffice to grasp nearly all the multivariate variability of the data; therefore PCA is one of the data reduction / dimensionality reduction methods.
