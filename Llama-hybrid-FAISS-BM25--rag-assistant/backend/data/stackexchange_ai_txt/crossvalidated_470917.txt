I think it is best to avoid declarations about 'percentage change' and to use 'change' in weights. If median weight changed from 180 kg to 170 kg after a 3-month program of exercises, then it's clear that the median weight decreased by 10 kg. (If subjects weighed 280 kg to start, then a 10-kg average loss would be a smaller percentage. Would you expect heavier people to lose the same percentage of their weight over 3 months--or to take longer doing that?) Using R, suppose I have $n = 100$ differences d in weights during an exercise program designed to promote weight loss. $D = $ Before - After. d = x1 - x2 summary(d) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -9.434 1.307 11.390 10.709 20.622 29.961 stripchart(d, pch="|") Not everyone lost weight (one person gained 9.4 kg). The weight losses are not normally distributed according to a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, which shows a P-value about $0.003 shapiro.test(d) Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: d W = 0.95792, p-value = 0.002867 A one-sample Wilcoxon test on the differences d shows a negative shift in weights. (P-value near 0.) wilcox.test(d) Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction data: d V = 4530, p-value = 5.497e-12 alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 0 However, the differences show no outliers and no severe skewness, so with $n = 100$ observations, it seems OK to use a paired t test (one-sample t test on differences), as follows. The mean weight loss is significantly different from $0.$ I did 2-sided tests because some weight-loss schemes have turned out to be counterproductive; even if not intended, results might have been in the direction of a weight gain. After an afternoon of punishing exercises, a huge hot-fudge sundae may seem just the thing! Now, we look at a t test to see that there has been a statistically significant average weight loss of about 10.7 kg. (P-value near 0.) t.test(d) One Sample t-test data: d t = 9.5044, df = 99, p-value = 1.319e-15 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 8.472987 12.944201 sample estimates: mean of x 10.70859 The requirement for using the t test is not that the individual weight changes need to be normal, but that the mean weight change $\bar D$ should be nearly normal. With no outliers, no skewness, and 100 observations, it seems safe to believe that is so. By re-sampling 100,000 groups of size 100 without replacement from among the d -values, we can get an idea that averages of such values are indeed nearly normal. set.seed(2020) a.re = replicate(10^5, mean(sample(d, 100, rep=T))) hist(a.re, prob=T, col="skyblue2", main="n=100: Re-sampled Mean Wt Changes") curve(dnorm(x, mean(a.re), sd(a.re)), add=T, col="red", lwd=2) Note: Data for this example were simulated as shown below. In an actual study there could be outliers among the weight changes and overall skewness. set.seed(607) x1 = rgamma(100, 5, 1/30) x2 = x1 - runif(100, -10, 30) stripchart(x1, pch="|", main="Initial Weights")
