I was under the impression that XML is encouraged to be written in Unicode, in some Unicode encoding, and that certain Unicode encodings are specified to contain an initial byte-order mark. Without that byte-order mark, your file is no longer correctly encoded in a Unicode encoding and therefore no longer correct XML. XML processors are encouraged to be unforgiving, to fail immediately on the slightest error (such as an incorrect Unicode encoding). What kinds of XML processors are you looking to break? Obviously, stripping a byte-order mark from a UTF-8 encoded document makes that document appear to be ASCII encoded (not Unicode), and some text processors are capable only of using ASCII encoded documents. Is this what you're working with?
