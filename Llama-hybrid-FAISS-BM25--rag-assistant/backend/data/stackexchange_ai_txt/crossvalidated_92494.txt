The next section ARIMA modelling in R actually explains how auto.arima works to select an ARIMA model. The model selection of auto.arima isn't based on either ACF or PACF, but the minimization of AICc (by default, other available criterions are AIC and BIC). If a time series involves both AR and MA processes, it gets unclear to detect right $p, q$ orders even with the help of ACF and PACF. They are useful in initialising an ARIMA model, whereas they don't usually give us the best forecasting model and we'll go on trying other combinations of $p, q$. Certainly, it's a good starting point to understand the data generating process by looking at the ACF and PACF plots, at least in the conventional time series teaching.
