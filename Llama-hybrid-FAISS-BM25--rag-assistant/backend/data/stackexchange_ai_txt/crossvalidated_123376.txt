The $t$-test is not a very good choice to compare classifiers, since their performance is not normally distributed. I suggest considering the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test instead. For a thorough read on this topic please refer to this paper (available here ): Dem≈°ar, Janez. "Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets." The Journal of Machine Learning Research 7 (2006): 1-30. The above paper lists multiple arguments against using the $t$-test for classifier comparison.
