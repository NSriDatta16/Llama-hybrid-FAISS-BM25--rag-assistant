Estimate just the constant coefficient in logistic regression

How do I calculate the constant coefficient in logistic regression manually, i.e without having to use a calculator? My model is $g(Y) = X \beta + \alpha$ is it possible to calculate just the constant parameter $\alpha$ without performing the full regression fit?
