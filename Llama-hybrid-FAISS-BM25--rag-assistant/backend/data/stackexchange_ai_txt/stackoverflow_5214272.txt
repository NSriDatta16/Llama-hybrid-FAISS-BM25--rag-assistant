Cheat exclusive access locked files in Windows (7)

I am currently on a mission loading files into pagecache, and I want to load locked files, too. The goal is nothing more than pro-actively keeping a dataset in RAM, reducing loading times within third party applications. Shadow copies were my first thought on this, but unfortunately seem to have separated pagecaches. So is there any way cheating around the exclusive lock mechanism? Like fetching file fragment location on disk, accessing whole disk and reading directly (which I fear is another separated pagecache, anyways)? Or is there a very different approach to directing the pagecache, e.g. some Windows API that can be told to load a specific file into pagecache?
