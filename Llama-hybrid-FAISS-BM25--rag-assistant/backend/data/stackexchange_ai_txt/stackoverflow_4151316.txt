Unable to cascade delete a @OneToOne member

@Entity public class Organization { @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER) @OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE) @Cascade(value = DELETE_ORPHAN) private Days days; } I have the following entity definition and it generates a SQL to do a cascade delete on the @OneToOne entry when the parent object gets deleted. But it's not removing the "days" entry while deleting an Organization. This happens with h2, mysql databases, what could be the problem here.
