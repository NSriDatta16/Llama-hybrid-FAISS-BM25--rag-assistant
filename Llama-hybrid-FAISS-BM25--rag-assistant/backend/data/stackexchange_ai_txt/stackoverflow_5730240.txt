Android get bounding rectangle of a View

I'm implementing a drag and drop for an Android application. In order to know if the drop happens inside the drop target, I need to know the bounding rectangle of the drop target view. I would then see if the getRawX/Y() in the MotionEvent fall within this rect when I get the ACTION_UP action. I realize I can call getLeft/Right/Top/Bottom() on the drop target view, but these are relative to the parent's container. It seems I need to know the "real" or raw values so i can compare them to the raw x, y in the MotionEvent.
