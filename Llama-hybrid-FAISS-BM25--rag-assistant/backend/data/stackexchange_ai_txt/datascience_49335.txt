There are two options: Predict the chance of a datapoint belonging to an unknown or unk category. Any new categories that appear in the stream should be predicted as unk . This is common in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because there are always new word tokens appearing in word streams. Retrain the model every time a new category appears. Since you mention SGDClassifier , I assume you using scikit-learn. Scikit-learn does not support online learning very well. It would be better to switch a framework that better supports streaming and online learning, such as Spark .
