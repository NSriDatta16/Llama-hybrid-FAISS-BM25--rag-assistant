Why is the dendrogram structure different from what I see of my data in a 3D PCoA?

I conducted hierarchical clustering on a dissimilarity matrix computed from a series of species distribution models text and I seem to get different visible structure between the dendrogram and the 3D PCoA of the data. I have tried other clustering algorithms but cannot the structure always differs from the PCoA plot. Any idea why? The code I wrote for the dendrogram is here: overlap = read.csv(file.choose(), row.names = 1, header = TRUE) library(dendextend) hc End result is this: The 3D PCoA code is below: library(rgl) pcoa = cmdscale(as.dist(overlap), k=3, eig=T, add = TRUE) # run PCOA, add term is for negative eigenvalues pcoa_scores = data.frame(pcoa$points) #save scores to data frame colnames(pcoa_scores) = c("PCoA1","PCoA2", "PCoA3") plot3d(x=pcoa_scores $PCoA1, y=pcoa_scores$ PCoA2, z=pcoa_scores $PCoA3, xlab = "PCoA1", ylab = "PCoA2", zlab = "PCoA3", size = 3) with(pcoa_scores, text3d(x=pcoa_scores$ PCoA1, y=pcoa_scores $PCoA2, z=pcoa_scores$ PCoA3, texts = str_trunc(row.names(pcoa_scores), 15))) Since the 3D plot is manipulatable, I am not including an image and encourage others to play with the plot.
