The syntax !foo will run the last command that began with foo . Failing that, bash uses the readline library for input, which supports the history-search-forward and history-search-backward commands that can be bound to keys of your choice. I've edited my ./inputrc file to bind them to F8 and Shift-F8, so that they work like Windows' equivalent feature in the console when I connect with PuTTY: "\e[19~":history-search-backward "\e[32~":history-search-forward
