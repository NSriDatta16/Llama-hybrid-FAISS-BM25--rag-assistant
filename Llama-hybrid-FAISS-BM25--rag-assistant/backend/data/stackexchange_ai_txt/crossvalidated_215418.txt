Difference between Log Entropy Model and TF-IDF Model?

I would like to understand what are the differences/advantages in using TF-IDF or the Log Entropy model for represeting documents and queries in an information retrieval system using diferent weights. I've tested both of them and computed the recall and precision metrics and I've obtained very similar metrics in both of them. The Log Entropy model has shown a little improvement in precision. The developed information retrieval system is available in the following repository: https://github.com/yolanda93/information_retrieval_system For the development of this IR I've used the TF-IDF and Log Entropy models of the Gensim library and I've implemented the TF model based on the TF-IDF. Thanks!
