Since we are talking about visual data, I would suggest to perform a clustering of images features extracted from a pre-trained neural network on similar images for e.g. if its camera images model trained on imagenet, if its CG (Computer Generated Images e.g. cartoons) a model trained on similar dataset, and perform a T-SNE visualization, and visually examine the clusters. That can be a way to perform EDA on a image dataset. Example Image of T-SNE on Images Dataset: Link
