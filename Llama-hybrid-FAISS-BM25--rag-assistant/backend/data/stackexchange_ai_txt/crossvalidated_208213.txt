Logistic regression with binomial data in Python

This is probably trivial but I couldn't figure it out. I want to fit a logistic regression model, where my dependent variable is not a Bernoulli variable, but a binomial count. Namely, for each $X_i$, I have $s_i$, the number of successes, and $n_i$, the number of trials. This is completely equivalent to the Bernoulli case, as if we observed these $n_i$ trials, so in principle I can use, e.g., statsmodels logistic regression after I unravel my data to be Bernoulli observations. Is there a simpler way?
