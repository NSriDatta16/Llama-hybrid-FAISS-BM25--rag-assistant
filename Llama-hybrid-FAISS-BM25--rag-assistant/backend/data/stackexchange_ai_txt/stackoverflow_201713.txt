It's possible to embed video into SWFs with the Flash IDE but it's not a very good option: "Playback is limited to simple play and stop commands, and the video framerate must match that of the host movie, an important consideration that will require authoring for the lowest-common-denominator download speed." "The biggest limitations to embedded video are movies having a maximum of 16,000 frames and audio sync cannot be maintained beyond about two minutes." Those quotes are from this article . It's a bit old but as far as I know, what is said there about embedding video still holds true.
