The yellow curve looks like a probability distribution function (and it's shape is not that strange for these type of cases, e.g. scores). We can check this by extracting the data (for instance https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/ ) And we find: # data for pdf pdf = matrix(c(50.791730474732, 1.01010101010101, 75.2695252679939, 0.869104521478181, 101.560490045942, 0.728138970099154, 107, 0.708029761628537, 145.076569678407, 0.547063282132195, 174.087289433384, 0.456649187123919, 202.191424196018, 0.376320633594753, 215.790199081164, 0.34624963262023, 235.735068912711, 0.306185901898, 256.5865237366, 0.25603662969666, 281.970903522205, 0.236267730907854, 302.822358346095, 0.216421489009544, 327.300153139357, 0.186536111497827, 354.497702909648, 0.166798149952821, 384.415007656968, 0.157207604374526, 411.612557427259, 0.13746964282952, 442.436447166922, 0.137995575974137, 475.073506891271, 0.138552446362554, 508.617151607963, 0.159326805574891, 542.160796324656, 0.159899144585209, 571.171516079633, 0.170495150587034, 596.555895865237, 0.170928272000248, 623.753445635528, 0.151190310455241, 653.670750382848, 0.161801785078968, 676.335375191424, 0.152087490525469, 699.906584992343, 0.142388664593871, 722.571209800919, 0.122573359939363, 757.021439509954, 0.102959147369561, 781.499234303216, 0.0932757900598635, 803.257274119449, 0.0734450167834548, 824.108728943338, 0.0535987748851454, 854.932618683002, 0.0541247080297616, 891.196018376723, 0.0345414327037605, 931.085758039816, 0.0150200318653611, 992.733537519143, 0.0160718981545933, 1058.00765696784, 0.00708462883041761),36,byrow=1) pdf[,2] Which strengthens the believe that the yellow curve in your image was a probability distribution function and not a cumulative distribution function. There is still a difference between the plotted curve and the given CDF points (at top 5th (699.0), 20th(475.3), 40th(214.8) and 70th(107.0) percentile score) however if we would interpret the yellow curve as a CDF (instead of PDF) then the result is even further off (it has the dip which whuber mentions but also the yellow curve does not match the given percentiles). In the given diagram you score as 824 at the 98th percentile. Note: The distribution looks much like an exponential (at least the first part). You see this often in rankings of score boards (for instance: you could do the same with the reputation scores of the users on StackExchange). But also for instance in the wealth distribution of a given population. There are many variations possible, power law, Pareto, etcetera. So, the assumption of a normal distribution would not be so good. See the image of log(pdf) And now your many questions: (1) Yes, you can estimate a percentile score based on a given score. This requires an estimate of the CDF. This can be done either based on the yellow curve and the construction of the cdf that I made (reasonably accurate), or based on a exponential distribution and the given percentile scores (less accurate since the distribution is not purely a single exponential distribution, and the bump seems difficult to cast in a simple distribution). Yes, you can estimate the total entries using the previous answer. The top 50th at a score of 940.6 can be estimated by taking an average of the measurement points at 931 and 992, which is roughly 0.9984 and multiplying 50/(1-0.9983579) gives more or less 30k entries. This method is a bit problematic since errors (and we do make them with our simplistic data extraction from the image) tend to blow up for 1/(1-x) when x is close to one. (2) No definitely not normal distribution. Exponential works but there is a discrepancy between 400 and 600. This is not a-typical for real life distributions. Given your zero sum game mechanism with a bonus that only kicks in after 8 * 60 = 480 this seems to be the possible mechanism with a sum of two distributions.
