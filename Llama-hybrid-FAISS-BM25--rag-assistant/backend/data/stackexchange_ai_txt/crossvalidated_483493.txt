The correct way to fit a polynomial trend in time series (with R)

What is the correct way to fit a polynomial trend in time series on R? I've tried the following below and they all yield to different results: ## Modeling quadratic trend ## library(astsa) # need for jj dataset library(forecast) # approach 1 - with lm t_trend = time(jj) - 1960 # 1960 is start of TS summary( lm(log(jj) ~ 0 + I(t_trend^2) )) # approach 2 - with forecast::tslm summary( tslm(log(jj) ~ 0 + **I**(trend^2) )) For what it's worth, the results from approach 1 estimates are very different than the output from approach 2 and EViews. Approach 1 output Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) I(t_trend^2) 0.0075709 0.0001813 41.76 The results from approach 2 estimates are similar to EViews. Approach 2 output Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) I(trend^2) 4.597e-04 1.082e-05 42.49 Screenshot below is the output from EViews: LS LOG(JJ) @TREND^2
