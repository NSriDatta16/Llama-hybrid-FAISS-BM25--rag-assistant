SSB (SQL Service Broker) has a feature named Activation that enabled a stored procedure to be attached to a queue. SQL Server will run this procedure internally when there are messages to consume in a queue. The queue attached procedure can be a CLR procedure, enabling for managed code business logic modules to run (C#, VB.Net etC). An alternative to an internal activated stored procedure is to have an external client 'listen' on a queue with a WAITFOR(RECEIVE ... ) statement. This syntax is special for SSB and does a non-pooling block until there are messages to receive. Applications then consume the received messages as an ordinary T-SQL result set (like a SELECT). There is also a sample of an External Activator for Service Broker that leverages the event notification mechanism to know when to start an application for consuming messages from a queue. If you want to see a sample of T-SQL code that leverages SSB internal Activation check out Asynchronous procedure execution .
