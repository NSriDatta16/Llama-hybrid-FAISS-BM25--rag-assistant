Silhouette measures BOTH the separation between clusters AND cohesion in respective clusters. Intuitively speaking, it is the difference between separation B (average distance between each point and all points of its nearest cluster) and cohesion A (average distance between each point and all other points in its cluster) divided by max(A,B). It is a value between -1 and 1, the higher the better (negative value means that the point is more closer to the nearest cluster than to its own, which is quite a problem).
