How to choose the split in Random forest for categorical predictors (features)?

I understand how best split is chosen for random forest for numerical predictors (features). Numerical predictors are sorted then for every value Gini impurity or entropy is calculated and a threshold is chosen which gives the best split. But how best split is chosen for categorical predictor as there is no specific ordering?
