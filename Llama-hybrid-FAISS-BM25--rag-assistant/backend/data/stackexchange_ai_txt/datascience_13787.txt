You can make plenty of money as a software engineer. It depends on how good you are, and how scarce your skills are. If you transition to data science, you'll be starting from close to scratch, and will be paid accordingly. I don't know where you live, but you can currently make $150K in Silicon Valley as a data scientist or a software engineer. Search for salary surveys in your area. A certificate won't get you hired -- passing the interview will -- but it will help you get past HR. Maybe you should take the classes just to see if you enjoy it.
