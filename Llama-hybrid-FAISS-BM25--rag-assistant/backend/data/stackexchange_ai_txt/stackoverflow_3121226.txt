LINQ - can't figure out sorting grouped data

I have an array of Person pocos, populated below. I'm trying display them alphabetically by Province, then by LastName within the Province. I'm using grouping and I can get the Provinces sorted fine, just not sure how to order the people within the province group. This code: Person[] people = new Person[] { new Person() { FirstName = "Tony", LastName = "Montana", Age = 39, HomeProvince = "Ontario" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Bill", LastName = "Smith", Age = 23, HomeProvince = "Ontario" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Jane", LastName = "Doe", Age = 23, HomeProvince = "Alberta" }, new Person() { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe", Age = 23, HomeProvince = "Alberta" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Alex", LastName = "DeLarge", Age = 19, HomeProvince = "British Columbia" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Travis", LastName = "Bickle", Age = 42, HomeProvince = "Quebec" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Ferris", LastName = "Beuller", Age = 17, HomeProvince = "Manitoba" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Maggie", LastName = "May", Age = 23, HomeProvince = "Ontario" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Mickey", LastName = "Mouse", Age = 93, HomeProvince = "Alberta" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Frank", LastName = "Darabont", Age = 49, HomeProvince = "Ontario" } }; var query = from person in people group person by person.HomeProvince into g orderby g.Key select new { Province = g.Key, People = g }; foreach (var prov in query) { Console.WriteLine("{0}: ", prov.Province); foreach (var person in prov.People) { Console.WriteLine(" {0} {1}, {2}", person.FirstName, person.LastName, person.Age); } } Gives me this output: Alberta: Jane Doe, 23 John Doe, 23 Mickey Mouse, 93 British Columbia: Alex DeLarge, 19 Manitoba: Ferris Beuller, 17 Ontario: Tony Montana, 39 Bill Smith, 23 Maggie May, 23 Frank Darabont, 49 Quebec: Travis Bickle, 42 As you can see, the Provinces are listed alphabetically but how do I list the people within the province (i.e for Ontario I want this order: Darabont, Montana, May, Smith).
