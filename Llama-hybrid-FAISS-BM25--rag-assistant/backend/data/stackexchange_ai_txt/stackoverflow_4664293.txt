I think it will be possible but not trivial to set up for a bit -- maybe CDH3 final will include integration when it comes out. Advantages: Hive queries over hbase. Think joins and a easy way to do aggregates and simple operations on your HBase data. Why not just use Hive and not bother with HBase? HBase gives you a scalable storage infrastructure that keeps data online. StumbleUpon uses HBase for their live website. Hive is not a real-time query engine, so its data store could not be used for similar purposes. Hive over HBase gives you the benefit of both worlds.
