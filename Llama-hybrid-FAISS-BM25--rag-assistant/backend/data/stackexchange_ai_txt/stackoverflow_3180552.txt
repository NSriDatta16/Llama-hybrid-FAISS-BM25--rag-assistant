how to organize test cases with boost::test library?

I have a project of 50+ .H/.CPP files/classes. I would like to test every class with its own test case, which will include methods for testing of different aspects of every class. My classes are located in different directories, like this: /project /include /SuperModule Foo.h Foo.cpp .. Alpha.h Alpha.cpp .. /test // I assume that my tests shall be here main.cpp Makefile I would like to use boost::test as a unit-testing framework. How should I organize my files, how shall I name them, etc. Some hint or a link or a suggestion will be appreciated. Thanks.
