Can't fix non-normality and heteroskedasticity

I am attempting, via linear regression, to model a dataset.I've tried various transformations on the response/ and predictors, as well as WLS but the assumptions are not met. I'm looking for the possible existence of significance in variables, so from my understanding the normality of the residuals is needed to perform the requisite significance tests. There doesn't appear to be any multicollinearity issues. The response is a continuous variable that measure the total amount element T (arbitrary label) in soil, and the predictors are the plots of land where the soil is, weather data such as precipitation in inches, temperature etc, and the amount of treatment injected into the soil. The data is collected over ~50 months, each row of the dataset is the average monthly value of the predictors, and there are ~10 plots of land (so ~50 rows per plot of land). Please find below, images of the qqplot and the residual vs. fitted plot. The clustering of data in the residuals vs. fitted plot suggest to me that maybe another predictor is uncaptured driving the deviation from the assumptions but I am not 100% sure. Any and all suggestions are appreciated. PS: There are outliers in this dataset, so that may be an issue but there is no reason to suspect that they are a result of data misentry. Hope this explanation is clear, will answer any questions in the comments. Thank you all in advance.
