Seeking software recommendations for efficiently analyzing large 3-Level data with generalized mixed effect model

I am currently working on analyzing a substantial dataset using generalized mixed-effect models. The dataset has a 3-level structure: 400,000 individuals nested within 500 neighborhoods, which are further nested within 30 regions. I have attempted to perform the analysis using various software platforms including R's lme4 package, SPSS, and STATA. Unfortunately, all of these approaches have been unsuccessful. The computations either take an exceptionally long time or eventually result in errors such as "convergence failed." Interestingly, when I opt for a fixed effect model instead of a mixed-effect model, the results seem meaningful. This leads me to believe that I shouldn't abandon this line of analysis. Unfortunately, I don't have access to high-end computing resources at the moment. Has anyone encountered similar challenges? I would greatly appreciate any software recommendations or alternative methods for conducting this type of complex analysis without requiring high computational power. Thank you for your time and expertise.
