This is a heuristic for approximating skewness of the long-tail in non-negative valued distributions. You'll find it relevant for latency, time-to-resolve, and any log-normal distributions. With only non-negative values, and an assumed minimum of zero, the observed maximum is also the range of the sample set. If the average is closer to zero than to the maximum it indicates positive skew with a longer (fatter) tail on the right of the distribution. If the average is closer to the maximum it indicates negative skew with the long tail on the left of the distribution. Of course it might also be that the developer that printed that legacy code just needed a thumb rule metric to guess if the wheels are falling off the bus, and this was good enough. :) Long tail metrics are generally interested in the long right tail . The bigger the difference between maximum and average, the longer the right tail. Bigger values are worse.
