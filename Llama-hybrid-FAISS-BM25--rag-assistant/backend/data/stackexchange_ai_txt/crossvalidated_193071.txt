I would suggest creating multiple input features from the time series using relationships you know (or believe) to exist already in the data. For example, you state that the target output will vary: between mornings and evenings, and differs between weekdays, and between summer and winter,... So why not create a set of features that describes each of these 'cycles'. This may help to tease out both micro and macro variations rather than a single feature that describes all. For example... If you have trend whereby something of interest occurs around midday each day, then create a feature from $1..24$ that describes the hours in the day. Now the network will learn to trigger at around 12. Compare this to the case where you have this same data encoded as hours in a week $1..168$. Now the network has to try an learn to trigger on $12,36,60...$ which is significantly more complex.
