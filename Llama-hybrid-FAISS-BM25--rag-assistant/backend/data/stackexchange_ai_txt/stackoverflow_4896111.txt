Well @Nefsu you need to add those libraries to your project by adding an existing framework and then giving the path of the libraries you want to use. And if you have already added the libraries by drag and drop, than dont remove them just add existing framework by right clicking on groups and folders and add the libraries from the folder and you will be done
