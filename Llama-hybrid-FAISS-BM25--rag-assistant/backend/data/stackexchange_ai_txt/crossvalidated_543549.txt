I like the Wikipedia discussion on this topic, to quote: Credible intervals are analogous to confidence intervals in frequentist statistics,[2] although they differ on a philosophical basis:[3] Bayesian intervals treat their bounds as fixed and the estimated parameter as a random variable, whereas frequentist confidence intervals treat their bounds as random variables and the parameter as a fixed value... For example, in an experiment that determines the distribution of possible values of the parameter ${\mu}$ , if the subjective probability that ${\mu}$ lies between 35 and 45 is 0.95, then 35 ≤ ${\mu}$ ≤ 45 is a 95% credible interval. And further as clarification: Also, Bayesian credible intervals use (and indeed, require) knowledge of the situation-specific prior distribution, while the frequentist confidence intervals do not. So, to answer the question when does the γ% credibility interval have γ% coverage, likely yes if the sample size that serves as the basis for the prior distribution is very large. While it may still purport to be "subjective probability" based, it likely becomes increasingly indistinguishable from a rounded frequentist estimate. Otherwise, my answer is no. I would to hear other opinions/arguments, however.
