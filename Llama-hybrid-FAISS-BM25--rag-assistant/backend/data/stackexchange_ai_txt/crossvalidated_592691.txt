This is an interesting question. I am not sure about the meaning of the "mechanical relationship". But, it seems that it is a sort of "mathematical" relationship. You can read more about this phrase and its relation to the endogeneity problem in the article below, for example (paragraph 2 below Table 2), if you are interested in Finance. Ornelas, J. R. H., Da Silva, M. S., & Van Doornik, B. F. N. (2022). Informational switching costs, bank competition, and the cost of finance. Journal of Banking & Finance, 138, 106408. Personally, I am looking for the opposite phrase of the "mechanical relationship"! Any comments?
