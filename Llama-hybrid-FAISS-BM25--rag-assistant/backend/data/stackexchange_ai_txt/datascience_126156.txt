You probably have an assumption that biometric systems return one most likely match. For example, if you look at the definition of the identification task in face recognition, then the most common scenario will be to return the N closest candidates (open-set identification). This is also evidenced by the quality metrics used, which assess whether there was a correct answer among N objects. I don't want to be categorical by saying that any method of searching for a similar vector embedding in the database will be reduced to a comparison with a threshold distance. But any method will not be "perfect", because you will still have to compromise between errors of the 1st and 2nd type (Precision and Recall).
