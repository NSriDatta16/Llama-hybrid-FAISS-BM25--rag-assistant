There are historical reasons for browsers "lying" about themselfs. The main reason for this was user agent sniffing. Opera is the only browser which identifies itself as Opera, all other browsers use Mozilla/5.0 or the older ones Mozilla/4.0. The only thing you should know about this is: User agent strings cannot be trusted, feautre detection is recommended instead.
