The size of the database itself does not create performance problem. Practical problems in database size come from operational/maintenance issues. For example: De-fragmenting and re-building indexes take too long. Backups take too long or take up too much space. Database restores cannot be performed quick enough in case of an outage. Future changes to the database tables take too long to apply. I would recommend designing/building in some sort of partitioning from the start. It can be SQL Server partitioning, application partitioning (e.g. one table per month), archiving (e.g. to a different database). I believe that these problems occur in any database product. In addition, be sure to make allowances for transaction log file sizes.
