You shouldn't be storing multiple job ids in the same field. You want to normalise your data model. Remove the 'job' column from your names table, and have a second JOB table defined like this: id | name_id | job_id 1 1 11 2 1 12 3 2 11 4 2 14 where name_id is the primary id ('id') of the entry in the names table. Then you can do: SELECT name_id, job_id FROM JOB WHERE name_id = 1; for example. As well as making your data storage far more extensible - you can now assign unlimited numbers of job_ids to each name for example - it'll also be much faster to execute queries as all your entries are now ints and no string processing is required.
