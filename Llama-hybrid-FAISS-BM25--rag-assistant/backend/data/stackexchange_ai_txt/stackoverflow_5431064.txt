Swing Application Framework does not save program's session (window postition, size etc.) in Linux

I'm developing a tiny app in Java using Swing and Swing Application Framework (JSR 296). It should work under Windows and Linux. In Windows XP session (window postition, size etc.) is saved, but in Linux it is not! Program extends SingleFrameApplication. It should save window position automatically. No additional code was written for that. I traced framework sources but didn't find anything wrong. Session storage must save window state into .MyApp dir in home folder. The file is not present there. I have some user parameters which I save into xml manually using java properties, not session storage! This file is saved without any problems into .MyApp dir in home folder! Does anybody know why program does not save its state in Linux but in Windows it does? SOLVED: The reason was OpenJDK is incompatible with SAF. After I removed OpenJDK and installed JDK from Oracle windows became to save & restore theirs positions and dimensions.
