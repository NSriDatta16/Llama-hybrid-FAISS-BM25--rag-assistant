Neural Network Layer for Binary Outputs

I'm currently using an LSTM network to make a yes or no decision in a robot. The network has a single output with the values in training data being 0 for one decision and 1 for another. The problem is, I have to decide a threshold value between 0 and 1 for deciding what registers a yes and what registers a no. This requires some tuning. I thought if the result was rounded before being passed as the output this could help move the optimal threshold to .5 during training, however, I'm not sure if this would work, or if it has been done before (currently I'm using Pybrain for quick development so making this myself would slow down my project considerably). I also thought it might be worth splitting the output into 2 nodes, one for yes and one for no. Then adding a softmax layer- but I'm not sure if that's the best solution either. I'm training with RPropMinus
