Right. What are the attributes of your input layer? Unless I am mistaken, you have not flattened your image at all. So you have sent a 32 x 32 image directly to a dense layer, and not a convolutional layer. (As a side note, it could be that you are following a very bad tutorial, as this is not what good tutorials do). What you can do instead, if you are trying to compare the performance of a network with out convolutions to one with convolutions, is flatten the images . Then, run these two dense layers. Can you share which tutorial you are following? When I studied DNNs in school, we used this online textbook . It was written before Keras (or Tensor-flow, MXNet, anything) so it does not have Keras examples. But, between the Keras documentation, this book, and this forum, you should be able to grasp Deep Learning.
