bubble effect with share buttons

I could find tutorial and code for bubble effect with CSS and static images: http://aext.net/example/bubble-css I have also put together various sharing buttons to make a sharing bar: http://pollwidget.org/test.html My question is, how do I create a sharing bar with bubble effect? Because all these working buttons are got from embedding a javascript code from twitter etc, while the bubble effect is with static images. I am not looking for complete source code, but some hints and tips to get me started would be appreciated.
