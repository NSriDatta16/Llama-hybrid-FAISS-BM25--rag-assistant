You may look into Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Segmentation: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf Basically it does pixel wise classification using a hour-glass shaped CNN architecture. Each output pixel gives the region it belongs to as the result of the training, given an input image. But you would need pixel-wise annotation of the images. I think you can do that easily since you do generate the images by yourself and know where the cards are located in a pixel-correct fashion.
