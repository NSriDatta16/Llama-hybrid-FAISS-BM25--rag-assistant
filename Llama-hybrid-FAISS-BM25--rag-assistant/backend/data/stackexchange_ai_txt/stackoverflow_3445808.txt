Declare the variable inside the class and outside any function, but not necessarily static. public class YourClass{ Button cupcake = null; public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { ... cupcake = (Button) this.findViewById(R.id.cupcake1); ... } public void onClick(Bundle savedInstanceState) { ... } } Use static ( static Button cupcake = ... ) if you want the variable to be shared by ALL objects - aka ALL instances of the class - in your program. Otherwise, don't use static, so that the variable only belongs to that object.
