There has been quite a lot of work done regarding the statistical description of turbulence, trying to find correlations between certain quantities (pressure, velocity components) and the autocorrelation (in time) of these quantities. There has been some research done on the spectral analysis of turbulence as well. But there isn't that much insight to be gained from this statistical description of turbulence, and it has little application in terms of computing turbulent flows. There has been some data mining work done with ships to try and find the drag coefficients of ships hulls depending on the ships parameter and speed. This results in methods for approximating a ship's drag such as the Hollenbach method. But these regressions have their limits and are only good for very rough estimations.
