How to simulate the St. Petersburg paradox

I am trying to find the expected value of the game in the St. Petersburg paradox. The game has infinite expected value, but in my simulation the payouts are about 15 on average, which is way too small. Increasing iterations does increase the simulated mean but not much. Can anyone tell me or point to resources how to properly get such simulations to converge to their expected value, where events with very low probability are important? This is the code I used: payout_list
