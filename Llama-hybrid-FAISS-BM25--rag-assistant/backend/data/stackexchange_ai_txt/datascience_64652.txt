Given that background, how feasible would it be to apply machine learning here? What important limitations/considerations should be taken during this process? Can machine learning address the problem of PII in this case? Why or why not? I think that ML can be used to speed up the process (by annotating the most obvious types of PII), but ML cannot be trusted to reliably redact any and all occurrences of PII . Two main reasons why: Even for the reasonably simple task of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where state of the art ML perform very well, realistically the performance is never 100%. NER is not sufficient to remove any PII, and to the best of my knowledge there is no safe automatic method to do so. Consider the following example: "my girlfriend has a butterfly tatoo on her ankle" -> this is a PII, even though there is no named entity: if the text contains other specific details about this person, crossing this information with other sources can lead to identification of the author. If the goal is to satisfy some legal/contractual requirements, there is no other way than to have human annotators do it, possibly with the help of ML (and even human annotators will need very specific guidelines).
