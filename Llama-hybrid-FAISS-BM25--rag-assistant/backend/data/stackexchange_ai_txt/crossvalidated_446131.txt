This is often called algorithmic design or optimal design . The last name hints on some optimality criteria, and there are many to choose from! Much used is D-optimality. Some related posts here is Motivations for experiment design in statistical learning? and Is DoE applicable to collect data for machine learning model? , look at the links and references in there. There are many published books on the topic, one place to start could be Optimal Experimental Design with R . Bayesian ideas could also be useful. This stored search might be useful. Alternatively, if your question is more about product design, you could try to ask at https://or.stackexchange.com/ . Links/papers about machine learning and generative design .
