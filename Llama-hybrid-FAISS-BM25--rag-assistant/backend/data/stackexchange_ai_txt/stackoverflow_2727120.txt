Yes. Default template arguments may be specified any time, anywhere, so long as the declarations don't conflict with each other. They are ultimately merged together from the various declarations. Even this is legal: template class X; template class X; template class X { }; A similar example is given in ยง14.1/10. According to that paragraph, function default arguments behave similarly. Good luck on getting the forward declaration to behave itself and not barf on everything!
