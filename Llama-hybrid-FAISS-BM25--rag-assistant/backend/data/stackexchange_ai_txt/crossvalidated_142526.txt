If you haven't kept track of which measurements were taken on the same units, you cannot use any within-units analytical technique, e.g., McNemar's test. You will have to use a regular logistic regression model. If you know the times of the censuses, you can use those as a continuous predictor; if not, you can use census as a categorical variable. The assumption of independence is violated here, so your SEs, CIs, and p-values will be compromised, though.
