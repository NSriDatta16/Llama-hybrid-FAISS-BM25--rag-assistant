Statistical testing on discrete time series data?

I am trying to analyse some data which has 40 different subjects, 1 categorical factor with two levels (20 male and 20 female). The rate of tree cutting was recorded at 4 different time points for each individual (one value per individual per time point). So 4 cutting rate values per person. Upon visualizing the data in plots it seems that there is a negative relationship for one sex and a positive for the other (as in felling rate lets larger gradually between time periods for one sex and gets gradually lower for one). I want to know if there a difference between the sexes with respect to total cutting rates and b) is there a difference in tree cutting rates depending on time of day, and if yes, is the relationship the same for both genders? What statistical tests would be appropriate to test this sort of data and questions?
