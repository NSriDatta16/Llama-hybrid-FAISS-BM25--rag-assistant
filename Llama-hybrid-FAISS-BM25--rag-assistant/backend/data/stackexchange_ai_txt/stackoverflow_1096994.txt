Documenting a PHP extension with PHPdoc

I've written a PHP extension in C, and I want to create PHPdoc documentation so that my users will get inline docs in their PHP IDE (in this case, Netbeans) when calling my extension. Ideally I'd like to do this by embedding the PHPdocs in the C code, to keep implementation and documentation together. Assuming it's possible to embed PHPdocs into the C, what extra steps are needed to make the documentation appear in Netbeans (as it would for PHPdocs of PHP code)? edit: O'Reilly Programming PHP refers to the /* {{{ proto comment format being used in doc generation, though I'm not sure if the referred scripts generate PHPdocs: The {{{ proto line is not only used for folding in the editor, but is also parsed by the genfunclist and genfuncsummary scripts that are part of the PHP documentation project. If you are never going to distribute your extension and have no ambitions to have it bundled with PHP, you can remove these comments.
