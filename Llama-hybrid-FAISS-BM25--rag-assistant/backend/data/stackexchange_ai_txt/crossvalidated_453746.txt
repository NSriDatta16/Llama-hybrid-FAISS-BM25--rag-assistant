Stationarity of coefficients when sampling VAR by Gibbs sampler

I am using Gibbs Sampler for VAR and have noticed that some researchers check the stationarity of $\beta$ coefficients while drawing. I am not sure why do they do that? Bayesian VARs do not require stationarity. Probably it is connected somehow to Gibbs Sampler? I saw previous posts here and here but still cannot understand the issue. Is it a requirement or just a convenience? I am interested in IFRs and FEVDs.
