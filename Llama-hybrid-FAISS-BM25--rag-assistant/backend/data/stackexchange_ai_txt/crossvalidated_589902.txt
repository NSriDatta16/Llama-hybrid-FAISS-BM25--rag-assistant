In what sense is "Bayesian cross validation" Bayesian?

In cross validation, we repeat training the model with resampled training data and measure average of the errors from the different resampled training samples. So cross validation is basically a frequentist method. It measures generalization error of the training "procedure" rather than that of the finally trained model itself. The former considers averaging over virtual "training" data while the later uses only actually observed data to "train" the model (of course, the distribution of "future" data should be considered to estimate the generalization error in any case). This is an usual contrasting aspect of frequentist and Bayesian. Efton and Hastie also point this in page 218 of "Computer Age Statistical Inference". However, there are literatures on "Bayesian cross validation" where the procedure of cross validation is exactly same but the prediction is just based on the Bayesian posterior obtained by resampled training data (see, e.g., this ). So, "Bayesian cross validation" still estimates the generalization error in the sense of frequentist. It looks like a contradiction to the terminology "Bayesian". Is this my misunderstanding on "Bayesian cross validation" or cross validation in general? In what sense is "Bayesian cross vadlidation" Bayesian?
