Global data isn't as bad as many OO purists claim! After all, when implementing OO classes you've usually using an API to your OS. What the heck is this if it isn't a huge pile of global data and services! If you use some global stuff in your program, you're merely extending this huge environment your class implementation can already see of the OS with a bit of data that is domain specific to your app. Passing pointers/references everywhere is often taught in OO courses and books, academically it sounds nice. Pragmatically, it is often the thing to do, but it is misguided to follow this rule blindly and absolutely. For a decent sized program, you can end up with a pile of references being passed all over the place and it can result in completely unnecessary drudgery work. Globally accessible services/data providers (abstracted away behind a nice interface obviously) are pretty much a must in a decent sized app.
