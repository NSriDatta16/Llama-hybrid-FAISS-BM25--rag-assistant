What ways to perform CRUD operations in Scala with mongoDB

what are the methods/drivers i can use to perform CRUD operations? Atm, i am only successful with the Create function, ie DBObbject.put("field","value") Common sense suggests that find() should stand for retrieve, but using it gives the following error value find is not a member of com.mongodb.BasicDBObject All and any help appreciated. EDIT #1: I also was able to perform retrieve, but I retrieved the whole document, and not a specific field. var mongo = new Mongo() var databaseName = mongo.getDB("DBName") var collectionName = databaseName.getCollection("namecollection") var testdbObject = new BasicDBObject() testdbObject.put("userId", "5678") var cursor = collectionName.find(testdbObject) println(cursor.next()) EDIT #2: Field based retrieval. IMO, Can put inside loop and print all. Havent tried the loop thing. var result = collectionName.findOne() println(result.get("userId").toString) Thanks.
