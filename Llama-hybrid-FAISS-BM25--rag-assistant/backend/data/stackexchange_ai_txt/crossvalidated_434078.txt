So first off, I don't think using brms is particularly justified, especially since you are using default priors. You might as well just use glmer or similar methods if you are going to use default priors. With that aside, I think a mixed effect model might be interesting. You mentioned that physics and math might be similar, which makes me wonder if you could project the data onto a lower dimensional space via PCA. Since every person is quizzed in every subject, you could create a Subject by Category design matrix, where each cell is the person's average score in that category, and then do PCA. These are just thoughts. It would be better if we had actual data to work with.
