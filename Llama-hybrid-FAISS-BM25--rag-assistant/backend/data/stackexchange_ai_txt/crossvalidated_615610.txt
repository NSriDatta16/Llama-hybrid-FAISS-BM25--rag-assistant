Can I use standardised coefficients in ordinal logistic and Poisson regressions?

I ran some OLS regressions with standardised coefficients, but to test the robustness of my results, I also want to run an ordinal logistic regression, as well as a Poisson model, using count data. My dependent variable is a big ranking, which explains why I can use both OLS and ordinal regression (for the count model, I won't go much into details, but it is possible to use it if I tweak my dependent variable a bit). I can give more context if needed, but I think it would just add unnecessary details. I want to be able to compare my coefficients across my three models, for this, I wanted to use standardised data for my ordinal and count models. Can I do this ? Or is it not recommended to standardize data when the dependant variable is ordinal/count ?
