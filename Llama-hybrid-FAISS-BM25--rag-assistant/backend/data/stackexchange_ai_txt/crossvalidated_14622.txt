For, clarity: the term "binary" is usually reserved to 1 vs 0 coding only. More general word suitable for any 2-value coding is "dichotomous". Dichotomous predictors are of course welcome to logistic regression, like to linear regression, and, because they have only 2 values, it makes no difference whether to input them as factors or as covariates.
