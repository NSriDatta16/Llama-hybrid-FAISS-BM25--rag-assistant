Starting with the View may motivate you more, and is good because it helps put yourself in the mindframe of the user (always a good thing). It will also help you realize what you really do and don't need for the Model. Simplicity of Model is quite useful, and working with the View helps you realize that. It will also help you focus on the Model-View interface, which is very important and the primary means of interactions between the two. That said, I actually often start on the Model, because I can already envision the ideal View, and it is very easy to overdesign a View. Iterating back and forth between Model and View works well, so as to not over-engineer them. The concept of a Controller is overhyped; a Controller is the necessary code to make interactions between View and Model as elegant and clean as possible. It's thus something I would inadvertently make while refactoring, and would not start with (or only add to as necessary, keeping it very lean and simple).
