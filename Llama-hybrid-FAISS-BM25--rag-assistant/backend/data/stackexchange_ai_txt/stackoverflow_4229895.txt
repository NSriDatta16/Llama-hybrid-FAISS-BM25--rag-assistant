Horizontal Accordion -- trying to use .toggle and .animate

Forgive me if this is an inelegant way of going about this but I'm still learning jQuery and am following a path of thought here... So I started trying to build a horizontal accordion using .toggle and .animate. Technically, it works...but with one annoying flaw. Here's the scenario: If I click a box to expand it, then collapse it by clicking another box, that first box I expanded will then require two clicks to expand again. For example: click box1 to expand it click box2 to expand box2 while collapsing box1 box1 will now require two clicks to expand again Here's the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/banjodrill/rEPnq/10/ I'm assuming there's some fundamental flaw in the way I'm approaching this. If anyone has time, I would be grateful if you could take a look and help me understand what I'm doing wrong. Is it related to the fact that I'm using if statements in the toggle functions? Thanks very much
