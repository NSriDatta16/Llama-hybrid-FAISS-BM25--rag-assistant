C#: Is this benchmarking class accurate?

I created a simple class to benchmark some methods of mine. But is it accurate? I am kind of new to benchmarking, timing, et cetera, so thought I could ask for some feedback here. Also, if it is good, maybe somebody else can make use of it as well :) public static class Benchmark { public static IEnumerable This(Action subject) { var watch = new Stopwatch(); while (true) { watch.Reset(); watch.Start(); subject(); watch.Stop(); yield return watch.ElapsedTicks; } } } You can use it like this: var avg = Benchmark.This(() => SomeMethod()).Take(500).Average(); Any feedback? Does it look to be pretty stable and accurate, or have I missed something?
