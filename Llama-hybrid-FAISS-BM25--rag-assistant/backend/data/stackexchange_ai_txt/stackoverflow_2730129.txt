When is a query too big?

I'm monitoring calls and putting them into a database. I'm putting caller, called, start, end in database. There are an average of 70-80 calls a day (none in the weekend), so it comes to 350-400 a week. The program will be used for a long time, so after a year there will be many items in the database. A part of the program shows the calls in a graph (volume / day) and also in listbox (who called who). For that I'm using a typical "select * from table" to retrieve the info. When will the query be so big that the user will experience performance loss? Update: I need all the info from the table, so a select * was best to use according to some people. Each row in the database contains 1 int and 4 strings, simple data.
