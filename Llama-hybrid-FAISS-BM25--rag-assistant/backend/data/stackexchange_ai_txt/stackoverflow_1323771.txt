Probably the best first step is to determine whether it is the database that is taking the time or the front end. Red Gate tools can also be useful, although if you're not sure what they're telling you to fix, you may want to start at a more basic level. If it's the database, then SQL Server profiler is your friend. A few basic traces in there, paying particular attention to duration and reads will point you in the right direction, or at least help you identify the problem areas. On the web side, the trace flags can be particularly useful. Good luck! Dan
