Resources for combining traditional and mobile ASP.NET web development

As a developer of a traditional ASP.NET web application (non-MVC) who is getting requests for a mobile-friendly version, I'm wondering where I might find some wisdom about the best way to approach the problem. We currently mask most of our database access through web service calls. It seems like many shops would find themselves in this situation: We have limited resources and don't wish to create a maintenance headache by having versions of an application diverge greatly. Is there a set of best practices for taking an existing System.Web application and reorganizing code in order to accommodate adding mobile-friendliness. The general approach I'm thinking of is: Make small stylistic changes on the client using CSS or even JavaScript. Make any necessary changes in data, workflow, or markup in server-side code. Keep as much code as possible common to the two versions by organizing non-UI logic into separate assemblies. Conditional compilation would be used in code-behind where UIs must diverge. What are the gotchas that I'll run into with this approach?
