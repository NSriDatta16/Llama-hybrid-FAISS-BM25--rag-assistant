I forewarn that this is self-promotion, but I think that my package deserves more users than solely myself :) So, timeplot is a tool for plotting time series from logs. It has quite a few features, see the extensive tutorial (lots of pics inside). For example, you can use it to look at the effect of a heavyweight background process on 25%, 50% and 90% quantiles of your response times; or look at the number of users online throughout a day. It is designed "in the Unix way": you take an arbitrary log and write a quick-and-dirty straightforward awk or perl script that transforms it into input for the program (consisting of "events": discrete value impulses, continuous value impulses and start/stop impulses). It has been quite useful for me in analyzing log data, especially for diagnosing certain "infrastructural" performance problems: I look at plots of the system activity and I see what looks not the way it is supposed to look like.
