I need to extract the source and destination terms from the text documents using text mining / NLP / Information Retrieval ? Example input: I am travelling from New York to London. I am heading towards playground from home. I will be going to Sweden from Boston. I was flying from School to Home. The output can be as follows : S. No. | source | Destination ------ | ----------|------------ 1| New York | London 2| playground | home 3| Sweden | Boston 4| School | Home
