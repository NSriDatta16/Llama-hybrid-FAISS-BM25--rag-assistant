You can in theory use your network to find the optimal input(basically by performing gradient ascent/descent of your optimisation function on the input values rather than the weight). There are lots of papers trying to interpret CNNs based on this approach - eg finding the optimal input that triggers object class. In the statistical literature the general approach is called Response surface methodology However, you need to do causal inference rather than prediction based on correlations in your training data. ie you are asking "what would happen if my input was x instead of what I trained it on, y". the problem is that, observational data, which is I assume what you have, will have lots of spurious correlations, based on eg your current operating procedures. What you need is to run experiments. eg systematically/randomly running through grids of values of your sensor inputs. Bayesian Optimisation methods (as mentioned in comments and answers) aim to run the experiments as you go, modelling the uncertainty in different areas of the input space to prioritise where to do the next experiment.
