Working off Fragsworth's answer, I'd: Create a new table: NEW_TABLE Define the field1 as the primary key Insert rows into NEW_TABLE from the old table Drop the old table Rename NEW_TABLE to whatever the old table was called The primary key would stop rows with the same field1 value from being inserted, and be better overall for later queries.
