p-value for correlation

I tried to calculate it using simple Monte-Carlo. However, I am not convinced in the correctness of the results, so wanted to double-check. For vectors of length 10,000, how high Pearson R do I need, to get p-value of 0.1%? Also, is there another way to arrive at these numbers without using simulation, i.e. in a closed form? The null hypothesis is that the correlation is effectively 0, i.e. that the 2 time series are uncorrelated.
