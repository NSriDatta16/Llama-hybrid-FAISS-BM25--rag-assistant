State space form of time varying AR(1)

I would like to implement the model proposed in Dynamic modeling of mean-reverting spreads (Kostas Triantafyllopoulos, Giovanni Montana). They propose to model a time serie Y_t with the following equations: (1) Y_t = A_t + B_t * Y_(t-1) + e_t (2) A_t = Phi1 * A_(t-1) + nu1_t (3) B_t = Phi2 * B_(t-1) + nu2_t That can be expressed in a state space form: (1') Y_t = F_t * theta_t + e_t (2') theta_t = Phi * theta_(t-1) + nu_t with F_t = (1, Y_t-1) Phi = diag(Phi1, Phi2) I would like to use R to perform a bayesian update of this model. I have studied the package 'dlm' but in the book Dynamic linear models with R , written by Giovanni Petris (author of the 'dlm' package), it is written (page 113) "The matrix F_t of a DLM cannot depend on past values of the observations". However, it seams that it is the case in the model proposed above. Can someone understand this last sentence and eventually help me perform this implementation in R? Thank you Fred
