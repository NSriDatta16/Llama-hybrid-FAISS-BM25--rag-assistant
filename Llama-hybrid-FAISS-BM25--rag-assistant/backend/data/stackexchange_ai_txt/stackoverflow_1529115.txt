In theory, "yes" it is possible, though you might also need to implement your own JVM! The relationships between the JVM and some of the low level classes (Object, Class, Thread, etc) are such that these classes have to be implemented as part of the JVM. In practice, it is such a big task that you'd be working on it for the rest of your life, and the chances are that nobody would use your code even if you succeeded. That doesn't sound like "fun" to me. Such thing breaks some license? Not per-say. But if you ever tried to release it calling it "Java", Sun's lawyers would be after you for trademark infringement. You can only legally call your implementation Java if it has been validated against the Sun TCK. But I don't want to be totally discouraging. If you want to hack on the internals of a JVM or stuff like that, the JNode project is always looking for keen new people.
