Should I use Mako for Templating?

I've been considering a templating solution, although my choices are between Mako and Genshi. I find templating in Genshi a bit ugly, so I'm shifting more towards Mako. I've gone to wonder: what is so good about the fact that Mako allows embedded Python code? How is it convenient for the average joe? Wouldn't templating JUST suffice without having embedded Python code?
