Since you are trying to predict 3 classes (active, expired and deactivated), you have a multiclass classification problem on your hand. You should go for algorithms that can handle multiclass classification like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting algorithms, Neural Nets etc. A simple Logistic Regression cannot handle multiclass classification (though there are ways around it), so I would advise not to go for it. You can start with a simple DecisionTreeClassifier and see what are the results. Then you can gradually work your way up to Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Nets etc. Here is link to an article which gives examples of Binary classification, Multi class classification and multi label classification. Cheers!
