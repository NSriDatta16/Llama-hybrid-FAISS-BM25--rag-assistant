Cloning famous sites using Drupal. What are the limits?

We hear a lot about some "Drupal shops" demonstrating Drupals strengths by cloning some very famous websites using Drupal and only Drupal. I want to know, can Drupal really leverage the same strengths the original web app does? What are the limits of Drupal anyway? Thanks.
