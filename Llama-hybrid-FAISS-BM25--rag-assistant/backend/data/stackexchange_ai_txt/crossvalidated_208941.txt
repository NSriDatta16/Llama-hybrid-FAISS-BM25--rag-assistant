What is the difference and relationship between posterior distribution function and likelihood function in MCMC?

I am learning MCMC in class, and I encounter one question about the relationship between posterior probability and likelihood function. In our lecture, the professor asked us to take samples from the posterior distribution, however, he used the likelihood function as the target distribution $P(X)$ in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm . So I am confused why the sample generated by the likelihood using MCMC can be seen as a sample from the posterior distribution?
