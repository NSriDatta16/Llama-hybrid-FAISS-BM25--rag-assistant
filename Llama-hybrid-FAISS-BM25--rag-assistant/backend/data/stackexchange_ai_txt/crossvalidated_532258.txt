The answers by @JTH and @Edward propose different solutions, a binomial test of the null $p=0.5$ or a chi-squared test of the null of a binomial distribution with $p=0.5$ . These hypothesis are not equal, the later implies the former. But $p=0.5$ could equally be satisfied with four coins with unequal probabilities but $\bar{p}=0.5$ . That could for example be a betabinomial distribution. So if it is important to reject if the $p$ 's are unequal bet "fair on average", the chi-square test would be best, but if it enough to test the null of "fair on average", I would expect the binomial test to have higher power, since it does not spend power on some of the alternatives that the chi-square test must consider. So let us do some simulations to see if that is correct. We use R and for the tests, the functions chisq.test and binom.test . First, let us look at the quality of the chisquared approximate distribution under the null hypothesis: (All simulations based on 50000 replications) Shown is histograms on the natural and log scale, with the theoretical density superposed. The approximation seems good, except maybe in the extreme right tail. Then we look at histograms of the p-values, for both tests. Ideally, under the null they should be uniform, but here we have some discreteness: For the binomial test ( binom.test ) the discreetness is quite pronounced. Then we look at p-value distributions under an alternative quite close to the null, $p=0.55$ . For alternatives much farther from the null, the power is essentially 1. It looks like for the binomial test, the p-value distribution tends to be stochastically smaller than for the chi-square test, indicating that it tends to reject more often, so has higher power. Indeed, for the traditional $0.05$ level we get powers of chi-square test binomial test 0.32156 0.47896 confirming that. Finally, let us see at a qqplot of the two p-value distributions to see more rigorously if we have stochastic domination: We see that, except at the very upper end, the p-values from the binomial test are systematically smaller than the p-values from the chi-square test,confirming that the former will have higher power at all reasonable levels.
