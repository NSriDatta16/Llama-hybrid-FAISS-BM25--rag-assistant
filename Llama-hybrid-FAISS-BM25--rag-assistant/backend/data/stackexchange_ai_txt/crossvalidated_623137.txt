Different methods to calculate standard deviation

I am doing a study using Statistical Process Control and have to calculate the standard deviation. I am aware of a number of ways to do this. The first method is using the sum of squares (classic method). The second method is using the sum of squares but the denominator is replaced by n-1. The third method is using the Range average and a control chart constant d2 such as : Standard deviation(sigma) = Average Range / d2. The value of d2 from the control chart tables is 2.326. Why would someone use the third method as opposed to the 1st or second method? Can you point me to any text sources that explain this?
