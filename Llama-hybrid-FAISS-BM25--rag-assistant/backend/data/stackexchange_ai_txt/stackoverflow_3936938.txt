I typically see the former in use. These using statements are typically at the very top of a source file, making it easy to see at a glance what a particular file makes use of. It also allows you to easily see the start of new code, as the namespace signals the new stuff. The other way is a little bit less easy to follow from an organizational standpoint. The only benefit is that you could have different using statements in two different namespaces in the same file, but using two namespaces in the same place like that is bad coding practice, so it should be avoided.
