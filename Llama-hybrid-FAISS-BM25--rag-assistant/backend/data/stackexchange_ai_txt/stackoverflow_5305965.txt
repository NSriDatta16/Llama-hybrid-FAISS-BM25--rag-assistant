running code when two events have triggered

This is mostly a language-agnostic question. If I'm waiting for two events to complete (say, two IO events or http requests), what is the best pattern to deal with this. One thing I can think of is the following (pseudo js example). request1.onComplete = function() { req1Completed = true; eventsCompleted(); } request2.onComplete = function() { req2Completed = true; eventsCompleted(); } eventsCompleted = function() { if (!req1Completed || !req2Completed) return; // do stuff } Is this the most effective pattern, or are there more elegant ways to solve this issue?
