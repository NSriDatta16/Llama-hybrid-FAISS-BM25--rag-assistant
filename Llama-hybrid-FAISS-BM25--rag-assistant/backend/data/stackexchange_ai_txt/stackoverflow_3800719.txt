There was a record locking problem in one of the stored procedures in the .NET 2.0 implementation of SQL Server-based session storage. It looks like MS incorporated the fix in the .NET 4.0 release. Take a look here: http://sanjevsharma.blogspot.com/2008/03/improving-aspnet-session-state-database.html I'm 99% sure you can run the 4.0 version of aspnet_regsql -ssadd and still run ASP.NET 2.0 against it. I remember doing a diff of the 2.0 vs. 4.0 SQL script and the above fix was the only real difference. MS' implementation of the fix was a little nicer than (and clearly based on) the link above.
