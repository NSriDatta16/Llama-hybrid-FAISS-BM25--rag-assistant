Explainable AI solutions and packages in Python

I recently built a logistic regression for binary classification While I understand that logistic regression is inherentlt interpretable, I am trying to use explainable AI solutions to understand the predictions. For that, I am trying to make a list of all XAI solutions and compare the results against each other. As of now, these are below that I have identified XAI solutions a) SHAP b) LIME c) PFI d) Dependencies plots Python packages implementations a) Explainerdashboard b) ExplainX.ai c) Shapash Is there anything that you can add to the list? Would really be useful for beginner like me
