I second harshath.jr: you could very well have a server acting as a directory (exposing "origins" of each connected agent; origin being scheme+host+port as in draft-abarth-origin , with the scheme being either "ws" or "wss"). You could then initiate peer-to-peer WebSocket connections; the SOP being worked through thanks to CORS . Of course, this means that each agent (i.e. browser) would have to embed its own WebSocket server (Ã  la Opera Unite). In the mean time, do it the XMPP/IRC/etc.-way: no peer-to-peer connection but WebSocket connections to a central server (or network!) to pass messages to the connected agents (eventually using some specific WebSocket "subprotocol") EDIT: note that all of this is actually outside the scope of HTML5 (all of those things were once part of HTML5 but have been split away into their own specs)
