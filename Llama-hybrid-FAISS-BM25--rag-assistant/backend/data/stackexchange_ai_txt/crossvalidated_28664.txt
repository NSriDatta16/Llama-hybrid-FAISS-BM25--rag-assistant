How to detect variables discriminating a sample from the rest of the samples?

I have a traditionally structured data set where rows are observations and columns are variables. There are only a few observations but comparatively more variables. The observations are regions of a country and the variables are characteristics ( i.e. , population size, mean income, number of males, number of females, etc.). I need to find out which characteristics can distinguish one region from the rest. For example, I need to find out if population size distinguishes region 1 most from regions 2, 3, 4, etc. Which statistical methods are available to perform this type of analysis? Your help is appreciated. Just in case it is not clear, my data looks something like the following. A, B, C, D R1 8, 9, 5, 4 R2 5, 8, 4, 5 R3 7, 9, 7, 4 Where R1 = region 1, R2 = region 2, R3 = region 3, A = population, B = average income, C = number of males, D = number of females. My queries are something like this: how is R1 different from the set {R2, R3}? how is R2 different from the set {R1, R3}? how is R3 different from {R1, R2}? The expected answers look something like this: A make R1 different from {R2, R3}? {A, D} make R2 different from {R1, R3}?
