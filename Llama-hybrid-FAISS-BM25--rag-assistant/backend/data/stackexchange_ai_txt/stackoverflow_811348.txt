Here are a few things I've found to be important for recent grads as well as new hires that have experience: be proactive about including them in the corporate culture, don't assume they will fit in on their own include them in meetings even if they are only there to listen encourage them to interact in meetings when appropriate be careful when dismissing their ideas as bad I've seen this discourage people from mentioning good ideas later down the road
