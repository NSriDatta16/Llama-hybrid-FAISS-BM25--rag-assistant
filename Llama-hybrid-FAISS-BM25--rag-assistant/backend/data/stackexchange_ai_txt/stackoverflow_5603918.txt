PHP5: What PHP function outputs Users IP address, Platform and Browser?

Of all these functions that return current visitors info/ip only the first one seems to output: echo $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]; echo $_SERVER["HTTP_X_FORWARDED"]; echo $_SERVER["HTTP_X_CLUSTER_CLIENT_IP"]; echo $_SERVER["HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR"]; echo $_SERVER["HTTP_FORWARDED"]; Primary Question: Why the other functions dont output anything? Bonus Question: Are there any other cool functions in this regard for example a function that outputs the visitors used browser & platform?? Also usefull would be to get the visitors city, favourite beverage, favourite color in #RGB... :) Thanks for any suggestions!
