First the explanation of the numbers. The value of $t$ is provided to enable the calculation of the later values. Then you have a $p$ value $ Now some comments about your data The variables you are using are skewed and it might be better to take logs of both before calculating the correlation. As it stands at least some of the correlation is being driven by the states which have large population and large UFO numbers. A further advantage is that if you carried out more advanced analysis you would probably want to use a model on the log scale. You refer to outliers but what your graph shows on the present scale is some states which have high leverage (the best fitting line is being pulled to go near them) and one state which is quite some way from that line (the one at $x = 20$ with a low number of UFOs).
