Reversible markov chain

i have a question from a mid session exam. I was marked incorrect and I dont understand why. Question: Given a reversible markov chain P, with measure $\pi$ . Show that $P^2$ is reversible. Since P is reversible $\pi$ is the invariant measure. Since $\pi$ is the invariant measure $\pi P = \pi$ . Therefore, $\pi P^2=\pi PP =\pi P$ . Which is reversible given from the question.
