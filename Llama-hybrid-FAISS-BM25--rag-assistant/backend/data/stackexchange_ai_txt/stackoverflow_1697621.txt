What you're asking for is not naturally achieveable in native c++. All the visualization technology inside the visual debugger is organized around the CLR, hence either C# or C++/CLI. The one thing that can help in native land is the expression evaluator addin mechanism. Of course, it's designed to return a string and go away, but it's code, so you could in theory run any code, including displaying a window and showing the data you care about (after having read it from the debuggee). It's a bit of a bummer to see those great features missing from the native side, though.
