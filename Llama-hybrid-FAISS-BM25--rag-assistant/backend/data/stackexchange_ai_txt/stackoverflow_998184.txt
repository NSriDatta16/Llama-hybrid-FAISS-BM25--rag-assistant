According to the Python Socket Documentation the default is no timeout so specifying a value of "None" is redundant. There are a number of possible reasons that your connection is dropping. One could be that your user-agent is "Python-urllib" which may very well be blocked. To change your user agent: request = urllib2.Request('site.com/login') request.add_header('User-Agent','Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; it-IT; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/2008092313 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.5') You may also want to try overriding the proxy settings before you try and open the url using something along the lines of: proxy = urllib2.ProxyHandler({"http":"http://127.0.0.1:8118"}) opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy) urllib2.install_opener(opener)
