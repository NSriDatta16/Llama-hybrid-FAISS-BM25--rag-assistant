How can I write an SNMP agent or SNMP extension agent DLL in C#

I need to write an SNMP agent for my application. I read the CodeProject article on how to write an SNMP extension agent DLL using win32, but would like to know if it is possible to do it with managed code. Also, is it possible to write my own SNMP agent in managed code and run it along windows SNMP service? windows SNMP service is required to run on my server to provide the basic operating system management info. What C# SNMP library would you recommend? I found a few C# SNMP protocol implementations, but could not find sample code on how to implement an SNMP agent - most samples are only about querying other agents or sending traps.
