Analyse jQuery selector performance?

Is there an analytics tool of any kind to analyse the performance of selectors on a site (ie. number of iterations over the dom, average time taken for each search, number of searches etc.)? Either a desktop tool, or a jQuery plugin or anything? We are finding performance is being impacted by the number of selector searches jQuery is doing. When I search this topic in Google I found it hard to get past all the results for using Google Analytics in jQuery (This is not what I want!)
