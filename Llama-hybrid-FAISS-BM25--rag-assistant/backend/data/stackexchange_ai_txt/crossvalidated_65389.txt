I'm curious as to why the proportion can only take discrete values, but, given that it does, and that they are ordinal, I'd suggest ordinal logistic regression. If you have the raw data that made up the proportions, you could use (regular) logistic regression. EDIT: Given your revision, no, ordinal doesn't make sense anymore. An ordinal regression with 109 levels would be uninterpretable and almost surely over-fit. Now you could probably treat it as a continuous variable; some transformation may be necessary. Or, you could treat it as a bounded variable and use beta regression.
