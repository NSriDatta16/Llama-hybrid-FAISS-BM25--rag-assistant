LinqToExcel syntax

I am using the LinqToExcel project developed by MIT and hosted on Google Code at http://code.google.com/p/linqtoexcel/wiki/UsingLinqToExcel . It seems pretty straight forward and elegant. I was able to rewrite a method that used the MS excel interop library and the code was about 1/3 the size. However, I ran into an issue with trying to query a range of cells. VS2008 picks it up as a syntax error: //These lines are fine IEnumerable names = new List (); var excel = new Excel.ExcelQueryFactory(_excelFilePath); //This line shows a syntax error starting from c[0] names = from c in excel.WorksheetRange("A1", "AI1", headerName) c[0] == "IN" select c; The line - c[0] == "IN" - just seems strange. This should grab the value in cell A1. If I remove "c[0] ==IN" The syntax error goes away, but it returns no results. Is this syntax correct? Is the code on the linked page C#? UPDATE: After getting some answers, it seems the missing "Where" is indeed a typo. However, even with the "where" I couldn't get c[4] == "IN" to return cell A5. I was able to accomplish what I needed to by removing the entire where clause, which returned me the entire range specified. In the initial post, I was just trying to return a singe value - baby steps :) For the sake of marking an answer - how would I return just one cell in the range? Perhaps the == "IN" is some sort of typo, and not an actual construct of LinqToExcel? Thanks for your help!
