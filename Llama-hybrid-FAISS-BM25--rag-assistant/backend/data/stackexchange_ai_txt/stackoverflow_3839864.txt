I realize that if I setup the admin area separate from the site, this would require the user to discover that the admin panel is there before they could even try getting into it. How much security does that add? This is what you would call "security through obscurity." Generally speaking its only going to stop the less persistent of hackers. For anybody who is that intent on hacking your site, this will only provide a momentary delay in their success. Obscurity can still be useful when placed on top of an already otherwise-secure system, though. Use it to keep the average end user from seeing things they don't necessarily want or need to see.
