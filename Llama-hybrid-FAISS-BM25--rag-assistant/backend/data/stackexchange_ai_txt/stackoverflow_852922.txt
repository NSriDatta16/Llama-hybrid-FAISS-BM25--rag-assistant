What are the limitations for bookmark names in Microsoft Word?

I need to bookmark parts of a document from the name of paragraphs but the name of a paragraph is not always a valid name for a bookmark name. I have not found on Google or MSDN an exhaustive list of limitations for bookmark names. What special characters are forbidden? The only thing I found is that the length must not exceed 40 characters.
