Machine Learning on Small Dataset with Huge Variation

In 2018 the NCAA allowed players to transfer school more freely, so now teams want an advantage by getting transfer players. I want to create a model that can predict which transfer players can be good if they transfer to my favorite team. Unfortunately, due to various constraints like Covid kicking out the 2020 season, and NCAA rules, the number of samples where a player has had play time for an old team and then transferred to a Power 5 school, is close to around 40 players. However, these 40 players have had different outcomes where some succeed and some don't. Additionally, these 40 players can be subsetted to have around 9 different play styles. Ie if there is a feature like points some players don't score much but they play because they have good defense and that shows in other features like Steals; but players who score a lot usually tend to not get a lot of steals. However, both players can be successful despite different variations in data. So how would you guys approach this solution? I thought of doing PCA on the data because I have like 80+ cols and then doing a sci-kit learn neural network on the PCAs, what are your thoughts on this solution does it address issues with my data?
