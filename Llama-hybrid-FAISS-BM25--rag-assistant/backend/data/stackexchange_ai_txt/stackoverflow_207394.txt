I used MS Money for around 12 years. Eventually, I realized that all I was doing was correcting the spelling of store names after downloading statements from the web. Basically, the banks, credit card companies, and brokerages do an excellent job of keeping track of everything for you in real-time. I'm not trying to dissuade you from moving forward with your project, but if you're asking about what we're looking for in a financial tool - that's pretty much my answer. Perhaps someone (like yourself) could build an app that isn't just a glorified checkbook (like Quicken and Money), but more of a convenient way to aggregate all that data from the banks into one screen (on the web, maybe?). Nothing too fancy - just a way for me to know how much money I don't have.
