Based on your description, I don't quite understand why you need inheritance at all. Seems like you might be better off using composition instead of inheritance. I would suggest that you create components, controls, and code templates to handle the different issues then you can just drag in what you need. You can have just a single base form that overrides the methods/properties that you need overridden and provide an easy way (such as raising events) for your components/controls to do whatever custom work they need to do with them.
