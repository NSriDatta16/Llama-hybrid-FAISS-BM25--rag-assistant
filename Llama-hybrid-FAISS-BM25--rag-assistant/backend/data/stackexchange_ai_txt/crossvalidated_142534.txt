Contradictory input/output pairs when training neural network?

I think this question can probably be generalized away from neural networks, bu there goes: How should we handle possibly contradictory data? Suppose the neural networks maps n-bit strings to a bit. What if our training data contains something like 01101 -> 0 01101 -> 1 What is the effect of something like this? Should both instances be deleted as training samples? or How should we classify data that is not necessarily deterministic?
