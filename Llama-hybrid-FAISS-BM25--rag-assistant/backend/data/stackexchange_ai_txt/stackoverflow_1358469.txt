Logging in to eBay using HttpWebRequest fails due to 'The browser you are using is rejecting cookies' response

I'm trying to log in to my eBay account using the following code: string signInURL = "https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?co_partnerid=2&siteid=0&UsingSSL=1"; string postData = String.Format("MfcISAPICommand=SignInWelcome&userid={0}&pass={1}", "username", "password"); string contentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"; string method = "POST"; string userAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)"; CookieContainer cookieContainer = new CookieContainer(); HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(signInURL); req.CookieContainer = cookieContainer; req.Method = method; req.ContentType = contentType; req.UserAgent = userAgent; ASCIIEncoding encoding = new ASCIIEncoding(); byte[] loginDataBytes = encoding.GetBytes(postData); req.ContentLength = loginDataBytes.Length; Stream stream = req.GetRequestStream(); stream.Write(loginDataBytes, 0, loginDataBytes.Length); stream.Close(); HttpWebResponse res = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse(); StreamReader xsr = new StreamReader(res.GetResponseStream()); String responseText = xsr.ReadToEnd(); Obviously substituting my real username and password. When I look at the string responseText , I see that part of the response from eBay is The browser you are using is rejecting cookies. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? P.S. And yes, I am also using the eBay API, but this is for something slightly different than what I want to do with the API.
