Accessible, 508 compliant Ajax Loading Indicator

How do I make an Ajax Loading Indicator Accessible / 508 compliant. My pre-compliance strategy is like so: initiate ajax request, set timeout to show an indicator(div containing a paragraph with text and a spinner in the center of the screen) if the request doesn't finish within one second, if the indicator is showing when the request is complete, remove indicator. I've tried doing things like setting focus on the indicator text to no avail. JAWS version 9 (which does not support WAI-ARIA) is the target screen reader and I am using jQuery though any solution will do. Thanks!
