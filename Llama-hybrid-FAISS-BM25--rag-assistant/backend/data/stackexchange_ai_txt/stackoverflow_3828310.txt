Choosing the right neural networks is something of an art form. It's a bit difficult to give generic suggestions as the best NN for a situation will depend on the problem at hand. As with many of these problems neural netowrks may or may not be the best solution. I'd highly recommned trying out different networks and testing their performance vs a testing data set. When I did this I usually used the ANN tools though the R software package. Also keep your mind open to other statistical learning techniques as well, things like decision trees and Support Vector Machines may be a better choice for some problems. I'd suggest the following books: http://www.amazon.com/Neural-Networks-Pattern-Recognition-Christopher/dp/0198538642 http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/PRbook/#Contents
