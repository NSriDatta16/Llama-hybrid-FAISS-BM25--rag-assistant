Choosing inner cross validation strategy for modeling time series data

We know that forward chaining a.k.a. time series cross validation is more appropriate than standard CV techniques in a time-series dataset. However, there's relatively little discussion around the choice of inner CV loop of time series data when trying to evaluate the model's expected accuracy. Generally speaking, what type of cross-validation is appropriate for the inner cross validation (e.g. hyperparam selection) that occurs? Should this also always be done in a forward chaining manner for best results?
