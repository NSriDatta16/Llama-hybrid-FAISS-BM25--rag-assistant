Repeated measures with adonis in R

I have the following experimental design: 9 mice ( mouseID ) were assigned to three different treatments (n=3 per treatment level) and we estimated the composition of microbial species in the gut at 5 time points (by 16S sequencing). I would like to know if the community differs between the 3 treatment levels and was thinking of using adonis from the R vegan package to test for this. I have a couple of quesitions: 1. what would be the best matrix for the response variable? The raw matrix of read counts of species (OTUs) per sample? or some measure of beta diversity like Unifrac or bray curtis? 2. what is the best way of setting the model? In looking for answers, I have seen two model formulations online that appear to fit my design: adonis(matrix~treatment + mouseID,data=data,strata=mouseID) and adonis(matrix~treatment,data=data,strata=mouseID) which would be preferable for this design? thanks for any help!
