fitExactly not working in r-436

I just recently upgraded to 436 from 419, and have found that fitExactly will no longer have any effect. You can see an example here: (With 419) (With 436) The javascript config is in the page head. I checked the versions in between, and the latest it works with is 419. I could adjust the width in the Javascript configuration, but then there would be a gap left on the side of the dropcap I'm using it on, and the fact that I'm integrating it with a Wordpress theme that automatically applies sifr (other than the one in the example), meaning that each can't be adjusted by changing the width or font size. I would much prefer to use 436, especially due to there being less page shifting, so, is there a remedy? Thanks for your time.
