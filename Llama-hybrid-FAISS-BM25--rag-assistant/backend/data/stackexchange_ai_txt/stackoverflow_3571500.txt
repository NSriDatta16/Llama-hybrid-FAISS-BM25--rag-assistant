If by "script" you mean class, you would need to link both classes. if objectA is delegate of objectB, when objectB call a method from the delegate protocol: if ([self.delegate resposndsToSelector:@selector(classBdidSomething:)]) { [self.delegate performSelector:@selector(classBdidSomething:) withObject:self]; } On the implementation of ClassA: #pragma mark - #pragma mark Delegate methods - (void)classBdidSomething:(ClassB *)objectB { [objectB methodToBeCalled]; } If you get an error/warning (like warning: no '-methodToBeCalled' method found) when building on the line: [objectB methodToBeCalled]; It means that you have to import ClassB to into your ClassA, by doing: #import "ClassB.h"
