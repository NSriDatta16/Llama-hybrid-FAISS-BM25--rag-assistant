Here is an example that I'm aware of, although surely one can think of others on the same line. The goal is to encourage separation between the means of a mixture, the model is stated as $$ y_i \sim \sum_{j=1}^H w_j N(\cdot \mid \mu_j, \sigma^2_j) \\ \sigma^2_j \sim g(\cdot) \quad (iid) \\ w_1, \ldots, w_H \sim Dirichlet(\alpha) \\ \mu_1, \ldots, \mu_H \sim \pi(\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_H) $$ and $\pi(\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_H) \propto \prod_{j=1}^H f(\mu_h) \times \prod_{j where $h(x, y)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the distance between $x$ and $y$ .
