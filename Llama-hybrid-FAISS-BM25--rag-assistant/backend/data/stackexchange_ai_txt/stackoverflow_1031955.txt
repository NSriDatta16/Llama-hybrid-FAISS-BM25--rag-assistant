Eclipse Plugin - Popup Menu Extension

I am trying to add a new menu item to Eclipse's popupmenus. It really seemed straightforward enough in the examples and tutorials but the menu item itself is never visible. I expect this to work in all views and for basically anything that is a file. I am using Eclipse 3.4. This is the my plugin.xml configuration: Any idea why it is never visible? ----edit---- Turns out my plugin works just fine in version 3.4.2 of Ganymede, but not in the older version 3.4.0 that I previously used.
