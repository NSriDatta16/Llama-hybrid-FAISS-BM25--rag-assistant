Is the average of multiple function's minimum equivalent to the minimum of the average function of the multiple functions?

Sorry if the wording is confusing, I feel it accurately articulates the question although being a bit of a head teaser. Essentially I am running many cross-validated models. Each model produces a (marginally) different curve for the loss function against penalty parameter. I know I can average all these functions and find the minimum to obtain my desired value. What I would like to do, as it is computationally lighter, is to instead extract the minimum value for each function and then perform the averaging on these extracted values. Intuitively, it seems this could be equivalent, but I can't think of how to show this rigorously. If anyone could confirm/deny my intuition through a mathematical proof, it would be greatly useful to me. Thanks
