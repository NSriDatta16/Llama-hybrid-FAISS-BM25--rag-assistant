The are both implementations of the Data Mapper pattern. Whereas phpDataMapper is a more loyal approach to the pattern, I've found it to be a bit too idealistic and strict at times. OutletORM, on the other hand, is a lot more pragmatic and flexible (doesn't require you to extend any base classes for instance). It is also a more mature project. Doctrine is a great project but is huge and bloated for most simple uses. I'd go with Outlet!
