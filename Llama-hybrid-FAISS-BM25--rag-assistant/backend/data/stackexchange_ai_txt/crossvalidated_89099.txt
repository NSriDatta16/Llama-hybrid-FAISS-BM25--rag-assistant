From a Bayesian probability perspective, why doesn't a 95% confidence interval contain the true parameter with 95% probability?

From the Wikipedia page on confidence intervals : ...if confidence intervals are constructed across many separate data analyses of repeated (and possibly different) experiments, the proportion of such intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will match the confidence level... And from the same page: A confidence interval does not predict that the true value of the parameter has a particular probability of being in the confidence interval given the data actually obtained. If I understood it right, this last statement is made with the frequentist interpretation of probability in mind. However, from a Bayesian probability perspective, why doesn't a 95% confidence interval contain the true parameter with 95% probability? And if it doesn't, what is wrong with the following reasoning? If I have a process that I know produces a correct answer 95% of the time then the probability of the next answer being correct is 0.95 (given that I don't have any extra information regarding the process). Similarly if someone shows me a confidence interval that is created by a process that will contain the true parameter 95% of the time, should I not be right in saying that it contains the true parameter with 0.95 probability, given what I know? This question is similar to, but not the same as, Why does a 95% CI not imply a 95% chance of containing the mean? The answers to that question have been focusing on why a 95% CI does not imply a 95% chance of containing the mean from a frequentist perspective. My question is the same, but from a Bayesian probability perspective.
