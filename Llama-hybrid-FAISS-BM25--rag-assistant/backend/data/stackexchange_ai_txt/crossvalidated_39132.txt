Confusion related to calculation of pi

I was referring to this lecture http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_murray_mcmc/ . However, I didn't get how the pi value was calculated. Here is a screenshot As far as I know the integral gives the area under the curve. So I didn't get how the double integral is giving the value of pi using P(x,y). Also how did it convert to mean in the octave. I am just a beginner. So please some guidance is required
