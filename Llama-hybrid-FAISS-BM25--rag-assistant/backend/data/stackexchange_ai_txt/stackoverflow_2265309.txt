Find largest free memory block

There is sometimes a problem with running out of memory when it got fragmented. Is it possible to find the largest free memoryblock ? I use Delphi 2007 with FastMM. Developing on Windows XP running app on Windows 2003. Regards EDIT: I could add the info that the app is running on a server with 32 GB memory on a Windows Server 2003 x64. But the app is a 32 bit application so the theoretical max allocated memory for each instance is 2 GB. Many instances is run at once. I do not think it is the total physical memory that is to little. I guess when started the app got a 32 bit virtual memory space. This can then be too fragmented during runtime. I also found the method FastGetHeapStatus that returns a THeapStatus with some fields for free memory. Maybe I could use those. EDIT2: I found this How to get the largest available continues memory block . The code is C but maybe it could be translated to Delphi.
