product description not displayed properly on magento

I'm having trouble fixing the product description display on my magento store. It displays just fine with chrome. However, it is coming on top of the product details in firefox. Have a look: http://www.chefmaha.com/index.php/default/dessert/cream-filled-basboosah.html Any idea how to fix this? Thank you.
