Cox Proportional-Hazards Regression - can one extend the "window" of covariate observation?

I am wondering if anyone has used the Cox proportional-hazards regression model to see if previous exposure to a variable is correlated with an event? I am using the "coxph" function in the survival package in R, and following the Rossi example on Cox Proportional-Hazards Regression for Survival Data in R . I am interested in the correlation between week of arrest (3rd column) and employment status (last column) in the image below. However I'd like to extend the employment window in reverse, and ask if the person has been employed at a given previous visit. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions, in terms of R functions or how to re-organize the data? Thanks!
