Using Javascript (DOM) with ASP.NET

I have an asp.net page with several list boxes. I would like to include some javascript on the page that allows a user to drag individual list elements from one box to another. On a normal web page, the script to do this is reasonably simple, however, with the element IDs generated by ASP.NET, I don't know what identifiers to have my script look up? Any thoughts on how to do something like this?
