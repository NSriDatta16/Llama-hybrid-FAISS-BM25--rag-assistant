Magento XMLRPC API Fails Using finset Operator

Magento version 1.4.1.1 I'm trying to retrieve a product list filtered for a specific website using the XMLRPC API (catalog_product.list method call). The server returns "unknown error". I can call this same method and filter by status, sku, etc. But anytime I try to filter on a field that can contain multiple values (e.g. websites, categories, category_ids), I get the unknown error. I'm using C# and Charles Cook's excellent xmlrpc.net library. I've captured the XML being sent to the server as shown below. Can anyone provide any insight into why this is happening? This works: call 81a7c4fffec8e78a6fe4b3f15f3e5cd0 catalog_product.list status eq 1 This doesn't: call 5d7412249845e29458b63e3b03935445 catalog_product.list websites finset 1
