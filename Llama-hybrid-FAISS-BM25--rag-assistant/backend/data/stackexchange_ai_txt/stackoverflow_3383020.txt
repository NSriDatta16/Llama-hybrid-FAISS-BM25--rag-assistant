You are thinking procedurally instead of set based. You can probably write the whole thing as a single query: INSERT INTO target_table (column list) SELECT (column list) FROM source_table WHERE (parse your column) = (some criterion) It is much easier to write, and probably a lot faster too. If your parsing function is complicated, you can use put it into a user defined function instead of embedding it directly into the query.
