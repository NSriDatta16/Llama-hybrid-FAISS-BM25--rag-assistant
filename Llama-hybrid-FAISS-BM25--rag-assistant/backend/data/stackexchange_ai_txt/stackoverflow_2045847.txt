As is often the case with these questions, the answer is "it depends". Cookies are fine if you are only storing small amounts of string data. There are limitations (4k per cookie, HTTP header limit) and they are sent across the wire with every request and response. You might have to "re-inflate" your account/member info from data stored in the cookie. Users can opt to not accept cookies from your website. Session is strongly-typed (no re-inflation) and not transmitted with every request/response. There are several options for scaling up session storage if you think your web app will need it. Most small-medium sites use session with no problems.
