Python regular expressions assigning to named groups

When you use variables (is that the correct word?) in python regular expressions like this: "blah (?P\w+)" ("value" would be the variable), how could you make the variable's value be the text after "blah " to the end of the line or to a certain character not paying any attention to the actual content of the variable. For example, this is pseudo-code for what I want: >>> import re >>> p = re.compile("say (?P continue_until_text_after_assignment_is_recognized) endsay") >>> m = p.match("say Hello hi yo endsay") >>> m.group('value') 'Hello hi yo' Note: The title is probably not understandable. That is because I didn't know how to say it. Sorry if I caused any confusion.
