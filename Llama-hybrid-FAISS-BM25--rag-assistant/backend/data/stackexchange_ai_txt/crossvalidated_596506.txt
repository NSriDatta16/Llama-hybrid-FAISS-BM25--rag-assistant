Need help explaining Bayesian p-value plot

I'm working through Chapter 2 of BMCP and am having trouble understanding why the plot of a Bayesian p-value looks so unexpectedly "spiky" or multimodal. Here's my code np.random.seed(1337) # Observations are 20 draws from a biased coin-flip Y = stats.bernoulli(0.7).rvs(20) # Model the observations as a vanilla Bernoulli RV with pm.Model() as model: θ = pm.Beta("θ", alpha=1, beta=1) y_obs = pm.Binomial("y_obs", n=1, p=θ, observed=Y) trace = pm.sample(1000, return_inferencedata=True) posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace) # Plot Bayesian p-values az.plot_bpv(posterior_predictive, kind='p_value') And here's the output: Any pointers or links most appreciated.
