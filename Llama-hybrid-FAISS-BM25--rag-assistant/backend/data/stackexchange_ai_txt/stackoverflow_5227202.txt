Example of Python + Redland for RDF Storage and Retrieval

Would someone please point to an example of using Python to store RDF data using Redland / RDF, and later to retrieve the data. I see there is a lot of Redland documentation out there, and I'm sure it's excellent, but I'm quite new to RDF and don't have a strong grasp of C, so I can't quite make my way through it. Thanks.
