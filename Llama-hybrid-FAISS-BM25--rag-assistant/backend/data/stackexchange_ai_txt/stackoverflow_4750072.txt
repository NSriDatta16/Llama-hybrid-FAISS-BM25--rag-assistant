How to create a pagination photos?

I'd like to integrate a pagination in photo gallery project. Ex: > Let's say I have 13 photos and want to display on each page first 6 photos. So in total, I must have 3 pages of 6 photos each and each page number is clickable to display the maximum of 6 photos... How would I proceed the right method? Here's what I though: var totalPhotos:uint; var maxNumberThumbPerPage:uint = 6; var totalPage:uint; totalPhotos = tabPhoto.length; totalPage = Math.ceil(totalPhotos/maxNumberThumbPerPage);
