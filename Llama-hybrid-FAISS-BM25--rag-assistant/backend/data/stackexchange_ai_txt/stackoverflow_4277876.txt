what happens after authentication using openid

What happens after authenticating using openid? In a simple case, the user-agent is redirected to OpenID provider(OP). After optionally login to the OP, the user-agent again returns back to consumer page which is mentioned in the 'openid.return_to'. Now the consumer also verified and sent back a '200 ok' response. Now my question is what the user-agent should provide for the subsequent access to the consumer page. When returning 200, a cookie will be returned along with it? If so, what will be the content of that cookie? and every time the browser attach the cookie to access any page on the consumer domain? What happens if the cookie is stolen? Can someone impersonate me by using the cookie?
