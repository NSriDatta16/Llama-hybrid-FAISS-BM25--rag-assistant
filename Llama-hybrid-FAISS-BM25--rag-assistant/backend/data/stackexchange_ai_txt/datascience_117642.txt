You can create a map (dataset) of the normal combinations and then classify new samples as anomalous if they are not found in the dataset of the normal combinations. You do not need to use any machine learning for your problem. You can, but you do not need to. If you insist on using machine learning you can build a regression model that predicts the second value (XYZ) based on the first value (ABC) and if the real second value does not equal the predicted value, you can mark it as anomalous. Again, this is unnecessary, so I would recommend to just use a map and a simple script.
