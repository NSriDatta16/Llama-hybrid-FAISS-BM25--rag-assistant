To illustrate, it could also be stated that the X coefficient of 1.2 reflects the gap in estimated performance at the mean of Y for a student who is average on X compared to an individual who is 1 SD above the mean on X. This might be a point of confusion. Typically, you would interpret the 1.2 as indicating the expected change in Y when X changes by 1 unit, not by 1 standard deviation. This author seems to be using units of X and standard deviations interchangeably. Standardizing your variables so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is a common practice in some areas of social science. If the authors had done this with their X variable, then this interpretation makes more sense because a 1 unit change would equal a 1 standard deviation change.
