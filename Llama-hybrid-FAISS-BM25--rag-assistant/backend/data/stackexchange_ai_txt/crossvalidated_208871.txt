Here is a geometric argument that I think provides the required intuition. Let us consider a $n\times p$ data matrix $\mathbf U$, where each row is one sample of your random variable $\mathbf u$. Usual "centering" refers to centering the columns of $\mathbf U$; as your $\mathbf u$ has zero mean, the data matrix $\mathbf U$ will be approximately centered in this sense. Your operation makes row means (as opposed to column means) equal to zero; so I will call it "row-centering". Now, consider columns of $\mathbf U$ as vectors in $\mathbb R^n$. Each of these vectors corresponds to one of the $p$ variables (components of $\mathbf u$). Assuming that $\mathbf U$ is [column-]centered, the length of each vector is equal to the variance of this variable and the cosine of the angle between any two vectors is equal to the correlation between them. This $n$-dimensional geometric view is standard in linear regression, PCA/FA, etc. This was setting-up. Now comes the argument. So what you have before row-centering is $p$ vectors of equal length and the same angle $\mathrm{arccos}(p)$ between any two of them. The end-points of these vectors form a cloud of points; this cloud lies entirely in one "hyper-quadrant" of $\mathbb R^n$ (because the angles are all below $90^\circ$). When you do row-centering, you are centering this cloud of points in the usual sense . So you take this cloud of points and shift to zero. Now all vectors, instead of pointing in the sort-of-same direction, are suddenly pointing in various directions away from zero. In other words, correlations become close to $0$. To get a better idea of it, consider what happens when $p=2$. There are only two points, so after centering the angle between them is $180^\circ$, corresponding to correlation $-1$, as your formula says. For $p=3$ there are three points forming a perfect triangle; after centering the angles are $120^\circ$, corresponding to correlation $-1/2$. Etc. For larger $p$ you will quickly get to near-zero correlations. (There really should have been a figure here, but I don't have the time for that now.)
