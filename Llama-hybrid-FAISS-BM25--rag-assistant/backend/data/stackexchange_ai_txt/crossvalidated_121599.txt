Convert Daily Data to Monthly Data in Python : Time Series Analysis

I am new to data analysis with python. I have daily data of flu cases for a five year period which I want to do Time Series Analysis on. Am using the Pandas library. It is easy to plot this data and see the trend over time, however now I want to see seasonality. As it is, the daily data when plotted is too dense (because it's daily) to see seasonality well and I would like to transform/convert the data (pandas DataFrame) into monthly data so I can better see seasonality. Is there an easy way to do this with pandas (or any other python data munging library)?
