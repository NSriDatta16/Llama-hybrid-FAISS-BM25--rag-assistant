Predicting financial data (choosing a model)

it is my first time doing something with financial data. I have a dataset with account numbers and some other information about each client (some clients span more than one row since we have info for each month in a different row). I managed to clean and create some models, here are the confusion matrices, the classification reports and AUC: Logistic regression [[185847 62897] [ 1 1061]] precision recall f1-score support not buy 1.00 0.75 0.86 248744 buy 0.02 1.00 0.03 1062 accuracy 0.75 249806 macro avg 0.51 0.87 0.44 249806 weighted avg 1.00 0.75 0.85 249806 AUC train = 0.9168592981611143 AUC test = 0.9150300677458543 Random Forest Classifier: [[245503 3241] [ 960 102]] precision recall f1-score support not buy 1.00 0.99 0.99 248744 buy 0.03 0.10 0.05 1062 accuracy 0.98 249806 macro avg 0.51 0.54 0.52 249806 weighted avg 0.99 0.98 0.99 249806 AUC train = 0.9996866568080237 AUC test = 0.9139101966925902 Gradient Boosting Classifier: [[184940 63804] [ 3 1059]] precision recall f1-score support not buy 1.00 0.74 0.85 248744 buy 0.02 1.00 0.03 1062 accuracy 0.74 249806 macro avg 0.51 0.87 0.44 249806 weighted avg 1.00 0.74 0.85 249806 AUC train = 0.8800353734759541 AUC test = 0.8657829269466372 Voting Classifier (from all the three above): [[211316 37428] [ 213 849]] precision recall f1-score support not buy 1.00 0.85 0.92 248744 buy 0.02 0.80 0.04 1062 accuracy 0.85 249806 macro avg 0.51 0.82 0.48 249806 weighted avg 0.99 0.85 0.91 249806 AUC train = 0.9987531510931085 AUC test = 0.9160262741936392 Since I do not have any experience I am not sure which model is producing better results. Can you help me understand which one and why? Thank you!
