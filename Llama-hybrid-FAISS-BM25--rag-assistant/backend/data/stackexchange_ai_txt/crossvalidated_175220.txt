The R implementation of sofia-ml , RSofia provides a couple of options, rank and query-norm-rank, that allow for pairwise learning. It's a fast SVM implementation out of Google. It's more barebones than some other R packages, but once you get it up and running I've found that it is a nice SVM option.
