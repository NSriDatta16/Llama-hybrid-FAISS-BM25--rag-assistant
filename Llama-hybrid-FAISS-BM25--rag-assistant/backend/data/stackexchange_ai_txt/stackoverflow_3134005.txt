Creating and Editing Excel Documents (.csv) with Java

For this project I'm working on, I want to take multiple excel sheets and then merge them into one, manipulating the data as I please to make everything a little more readable. What would be the best way to open files, read their contents, store that content, create a new file (.csv), then paste the information in the organization of my choosing? I definitely need to stick to java, as this will be part of a pre-existing automated process and I don't want to have to change everything to another language. Is there a useful package out there that I should know about? Many thanks Justian
