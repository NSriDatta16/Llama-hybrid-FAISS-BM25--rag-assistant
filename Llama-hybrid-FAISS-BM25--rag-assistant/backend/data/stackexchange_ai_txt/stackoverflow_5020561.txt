Select * sql query vs Select specific columns sql query

Possible Duplicate: Why is SELECT * considered harmful? Probably a database nOOb question. Our application has a table like the following TABLE WF Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | +--------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ | id | int(11) | NO | PRI | NULL | auto_increment | | children | text | YES | | NULL | | | w_id | int(11) | YES | | NULL | | | f_id | int(11) | YES | | NULL | | | filterable | tinyint(1) | YES | | 1 | | | created_at | datetime | YES | | NULL | | | updated_at | datetime | YES | | NULL | | | status | smallint(6) | YES | | 1 | | | visible | tinyint(1) | YES | | 1 | | | weight | int(11) | YES | | NULL | | | root | tinyint(1) | YES | | 0 | | | mfr | tinyint(1) | YES | | 0 | | +--------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ This table is expected to be upwards of ten million records. The schema is not expected to change much. I need to retrieve the columns f_id, children, status, visible, weight, root, mfr. Which approach is faster for data retrieval? 1) Select * from WF where w_id = 1 AND status = 1; I will strip the unnecessary columns in the application layer. 2) Select children,f_id,status,visible,weight,root,mfr from WF where w_id = 1 AND status = 1; There is no need to strip the unnecessary columns as its pre-selected in the query. Does any one have a real life benchmark as to which is faster. I know some say Select * is evil, but will MySQL respond faster while trying to get the whole chunk as opposed to retrieving selective columns? I am using MySQL version: 5.1.37-1ubuntu5 (Ubuntu) and the application is Rails3 app.
