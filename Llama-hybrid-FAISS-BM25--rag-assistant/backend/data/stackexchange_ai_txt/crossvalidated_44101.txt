Did you try to convert your data to pdata.frame ? I have an unbalanced panel also, but purtest seems to work with unbalanced panel if the data is pdata.frame . But I might be wrong too:) However in ?purtest authors write: "object, x Either a 'data.frame' or a matrix containing the time series, a 'pseries' object, a formula, or the name of a column of a 'data.frame', or a **'pdata.frame'** on which the test has to be computed; a'purtest' object for the print and summary methods," So I guess if one uses pdata.frame the purtest "understands" that panel is unbalanced . Am I wrong???
