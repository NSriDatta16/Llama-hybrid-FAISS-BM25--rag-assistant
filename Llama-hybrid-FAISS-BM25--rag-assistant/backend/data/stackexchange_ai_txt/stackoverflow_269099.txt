RE: Why tables? Because some people are (still, after all these years) afraid of change. They've heard that using semantic HTML is a good thing (and don't usually fully grasp the concept). So they try to put together a layout using CSS having never done it before. They run into a few (well documented, and usually easy to solve) issues, throw their hands up, and go running back to tables. They then decide that CSS is 'too time consuming' ("I'm not willing to spend the time to learn it") or 'not practical' ("I don't get it. It's too hard") and that tables are the only true way. Through stubbornness and ignorance, they believe their own bullsh!t and convince their clients and peers. And their world remains happy and unchanged, fading further into the past and deeper into obsolescence* And that's "why tables". The end. (*except that they are well suited for coding HTML emails)
