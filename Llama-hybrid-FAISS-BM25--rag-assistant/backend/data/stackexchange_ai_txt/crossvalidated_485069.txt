The Generalized Linear Models with Examples in R book by Peter Dunn and Gordon Smyth contains an illuminating discussion of Tweedie distributions. If I maybe so blunt, and summarize your excellent question: What is the relation of $p$ and the underlying Poisson-Gamma model for a Tweedie distribution with $1 ? As you already note in your question, the Tweedie distribution with $1 can be understood as a Poisson-Gamma model. To make it more concrete what this means, let's assume that $$ N \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda^{*}) $$ and $$ z_i \sim \text{Gam}(\mu^{*}, \phi^{*}) $$ the observed $y$ is $$ y = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}{z_i}. $$ Dunn & Smyth give an example for this model, where $N$ is the number of insurance claims and $z_i$ is the average cost for each claim. In that case the model would describe the total insurance payout. The relation of $p$ to the parameters of the Poisson and Gamma distribution is \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \lambda^{*} &= \frac{\mu^{2-p}}{\phi (2-p)} \\ \mu^{*} &= (2 - p)\phi\mu^{p - 1} \\ \phi^{*} &= (2 - p)(p - 1) \phi^2\mu^{2(p - 1)}, \end{aligned} \end{equation} where $\mu$ and $\phi$ are the mean and overdispersion parameters from the generalized linear model definition.
