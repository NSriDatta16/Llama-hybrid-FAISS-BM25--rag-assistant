This is what I do for those type of commands: Drag a copy of the "Command Prompt" shortcut onto your desktop. Open the properties of the shortcut. Change the Target: field to: %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /k mysqldump.exe Change the Start in: field to: c:/program files/mysql/bin/ Hit Ok, then rename the short cut from "Command Prompt" to "Mysqldump". Then just double click the icon whenever you need that command. The "/k" option for cmd.exe leaves the window open.
