Why do people say linear SVM is a parametrized model and kernel SVM is not?

I am confused by what people mean when they say that linear SVM is a parametrized model and kernel SVM is not. Aren't both methods trying to compute a decision boundary using some optimization program? This decision boundary is a function $f$ which has some parameter attached to me, such as $w^T x + b$ or $\phi(w^T x + b)$ . I'm not quite seeing the reason why kernel SVM are not parametrized.
