Is it OK to have only a single class labels in test data for prediction with one-class-svm?

I have a data which has only a single class, namely, '0' . There is no 'not 0' class. The one-class SVM model was trained on a train dataset containing only a single class '0' . I do not unnecessarily want to find a random 'not 0' class to include in test dataset for prediction. What will be the output of this approach? How can we interpret the result? What if the specificity is 0 ? Is it normal or have sensitivity and specificity to be 0 ? In that case how do we plot ROC curve? After training it only on '0' class, I tested it on only '0' class (unseen and unlabeled data), and the model still gave '-1' for a few samples. Why did not it give all '1' ? I will appreciate an example on an arbitrary data.
