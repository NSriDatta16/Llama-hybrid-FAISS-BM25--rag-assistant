Both pygame and pyqt will work for what you want to do, but I'd recommend pyqt: you'll be able to use standard widgets (like listboxes, textboxes, menus, buttons, ...). I've never worked with pyqt myself, but I image that drag 'n drop is something built-in, which will be really useful for a card game. With pygame on the other hand you'll have to make everything yourself. This will give it more of a game feel as you can draw everything exactly like you want it to look like, but it'll take more work as you have to implement basic stuff yourself.
