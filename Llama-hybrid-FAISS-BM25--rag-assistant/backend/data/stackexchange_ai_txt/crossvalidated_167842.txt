Finally figured it out. user777, thanks for the insightful info! I want to put it very clearly in case anyone will face the same difficulties. Two main points: MOE establish prior mean as ZERO always. Even if you have initially sampled points where function values are in interval [-100, -101], anyway prior mean would be ZERO. Mean, Var are calculated separately from GP itself. So if you optimized hyperparameters of GP, that doesn't mean that if you draw a mean, it will fit well. Most probably, you will see some kind of mess (like the one on the picture), because this mean would be calculated using DEFAULT hyperparameters (covariance parameters), not optimized ones. Once you drag optimized parameters from GP and put them into calculation of mean, picture will be quite pretty. => Conclusions: 1. Extract hyperparameters from GP , use them in all related calculations. 2. Need preprocess functions: scaling and translations, in order it to be somewhere around zero with st. dev. around 1.
