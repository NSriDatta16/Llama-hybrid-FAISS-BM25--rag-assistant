What do you think about interpreter of usually compiled languages?

I worked with a C++ interpreter (CINT) and my experience was disastrous. It's full of bugs, strage behaviours, not standards... and I'm arrived to a conclusion: it's wrong to create an interpreter of a language born to be compiled because I think that the design of a language is strictly bounded to the fact that it will be interpreted or compiled. What do you think about it?
