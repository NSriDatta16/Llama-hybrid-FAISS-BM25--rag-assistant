Read John Lakos's Large-Scale C++ Design for some very good methods of analysing and re-organising the structure of the project in order to minimise dependencies. Ultimately the time taken to build a large project increases as the amount of code increases, but also as the dependencies increase (or at least the impact of changes to header files increases as the dependencies increase). So minimising those dependencies is one thing to aim for. Lakos's concept of Levelization is very helpful in working out how to split several large monolothic inter-dependent libraries into something with a much better structure.
