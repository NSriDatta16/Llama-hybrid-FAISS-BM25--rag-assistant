Logistic Regression with 3-level categorical factor

I am trying to analyze a dataset in which I have a binary DV, one continuous IV, one 2-level categorical IV, and one 3-level categorical IV. I initially thought of running a binary logistic regression, but then I didn't get all pairwise comparisons for the 3-level categorical variable (which I would like to have). This is the code I used to run the binary logistic regression in R . Because it requires a reference level for each factor, it only returns two pairwise comparisons (not 3) for my 3-level categorical factor: myregression Is there a better way to analyze this dataset? Should I do regression with the other variables and then just Chi-squared, ANOVA, or t -tests for the 3-level IV? However, I'm a little stuck because I can't look for interactions with the other variables with this approach. Thanks!
