Chrome Back button page refresh - ASP.net

I have an ASP.net application (c#). When a user is on a specific page, they click a link on this page that takes them to a child page, displaying the product details. If the user clicks the browser back button, I need the parent page to be refreshed to its initial state. ie all text boxes that had data typed need to be blank, any hidden fields reset etc. Basically i need a CTRL-F5 when a user clicks back. Disabling the back button is not an option. I need this only on certain pages. In IE and Firefox i can get this working without an issue. But with chrome the textboxes still contain their values as do the hidden fields. If I hit CTRL-F5 in Chrome, the page is correctly reset to its initial state. This is the code I have tried. and this: Response.Buffer = true; Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory(false); Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); and this: Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1)); Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(false); Response.Cache.SetRevalidation(HttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); I have also tried a variety of these in different combination, but with no success. thanks
