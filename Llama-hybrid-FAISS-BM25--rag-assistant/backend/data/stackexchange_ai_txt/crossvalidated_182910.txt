Sample size for entire population to determine sub population?

Let's say a bus company has 500 markets with an average of 10000 passengers each day but some markets as large as 100000 and some as small as 300. How would I determine the simple random sample size of the entire population so that with 95% confidence I could determine if demand in a given market increased by 10%?
