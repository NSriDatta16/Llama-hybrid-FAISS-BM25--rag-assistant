you are not dealing with a string, but with a json object. You are trying to evaluate a json object as string to create a json object. var personJSON = '{"FirstName":"Burak","LastName":"Ozdogan","Id":"001","Department":"Information Technologies"}'; var personBurakOzdogan = eval('(' + personJSON + ')'); this should work, although it doesn't make to much sense. this makes more sense: var personBurakOzdogan = { "FirstName": "Burak", "LastName": "Ozdogan", "Id": "001", "Department": "Information Technologies" };
