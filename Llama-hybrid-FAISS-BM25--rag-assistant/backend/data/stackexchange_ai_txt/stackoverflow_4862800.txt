You have to capture your event on touchstart if you want to get the fastest possible responsiveness. Otherwise you'll be doomed with this input lag. You have to remember though that capturing event on touchstart and responding to it makes it impossible to cancel action by dragging your finger out of responsive area. I have personally used this in my PhoneGap html/js based iphone application and it worked perfect. The only solution to give this almost-native feel. Now regarding your problem - have you tried to stop the propagation of the event? It should solve your problem. $('.button').bind('touchstart', function(e){ e.stopPropagation(); // do something... }); hope it helps, Tom
