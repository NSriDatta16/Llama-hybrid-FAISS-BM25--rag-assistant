For Perl, I have a module I call staging.pm , and use staging; is a pragma in my code which allows me to use experimental, not fully developed code in my development. This developmental code will be placed in a branch called "staging" off of the user library directory. The main thing that the module does is put my staging directory at the head of @INC . Once my code is mature--if it ever is--it will be moved into my user lib directory. As for scripts, they can be run from wherever they are and I use a directory named test off of the bin directory. So that's kind of my approach. I don't know how useful that is for you.
