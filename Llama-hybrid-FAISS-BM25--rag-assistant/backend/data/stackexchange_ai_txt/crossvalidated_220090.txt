To my knowledge, I think the result with Keras is in fact correct. Since you train the autoencoder with images of the same background, and only the ball is moving, the autoencoder will try to "generalize" the balls and thus produce the "blurry trail" on the reconstructed image. Therefore, maybe you should not focus on the reconstructed result, but check the nodes at "bottle neck layer" of the autoencoder.
