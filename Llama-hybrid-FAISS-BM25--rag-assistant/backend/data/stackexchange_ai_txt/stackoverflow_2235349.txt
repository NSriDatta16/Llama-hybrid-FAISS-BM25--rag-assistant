struct record { char *name; int refcount : 4; unsigned dirty : 1; }; Those are bit-fields; the number gives the exact size of the field, in bits. (See any complete book on C for the details.) Bit-fields can be used to save space in structures having several binary flags or other small fields, and they can also be used in an attempt to conform to externally-imposed storage layouts. (Their success at the latter task is mitigated by the fact that bit-fields are assigned left-to-right on some machines and right-to-left on others). Note that the colon notation for specifying the size of a field in bits is only valid in structures (and in unions); you cannot use this mechanism to specify the size of arbitrary variables.
