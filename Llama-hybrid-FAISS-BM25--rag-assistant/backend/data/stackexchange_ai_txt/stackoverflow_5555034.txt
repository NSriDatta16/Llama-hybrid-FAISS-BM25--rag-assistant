I asked the same question in Eclipse Papyrus's forum, where I got the following answer: "I'm not sure about the specifics of Papyrus, but in the UML specification, the 'fragments' relationship from Interaction to InteractionFragment is ordered (Figure 14.3), so that determines the order of the messages." Follow this link for the full message.
