Does the way the student went about the exercise indicate that they have paid attention to what was taught in class? You are right to look beyond "does it work"; look for general approach and "craftsmanship". Do you teach the importance of testing? Look for test cases. If they had freedom to choose their tools, did they choose wisely? (no plagarism, obviously)
