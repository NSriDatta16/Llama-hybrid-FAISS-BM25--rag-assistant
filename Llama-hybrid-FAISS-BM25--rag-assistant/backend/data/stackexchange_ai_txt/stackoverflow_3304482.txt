Did you check the status of the Organizer? From Xcode, go under Window->Organizer, and look under the DEVICES section on the left pane. It should show the connected devices, and provide a more detailed explanation (e.g., device is not enabled for development, OS installed on phone is not supported by SDK, etc). One possibility is that you are running 4.0.1 on your phone, but only have the 4.0 SDK installed.
