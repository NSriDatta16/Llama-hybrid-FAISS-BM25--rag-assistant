Vectors with fixed dimension and values (C++)

I would like to know the best solution in terms of performances for storing vectors/arrays of data (int or double), whose dimension is not available at compile time (it depends on the input from the user) but, once intialized, they will never change their dimensions, neither their values. In other words I was wondering if using something different than vector I can improve the efficiency, since I am sure that dimensions and content of my vector never change after initialization. Thanks Alberto
