Check out http://matthewturland.com/2010/05/20/new-spl-features-in-php-5-3/ It gives a good overview of the SPL DataStructures, what they are and when you want to use them. There is also benchmarks. If this is an object collection, I'd definitely consider using SplObjectStorage instead of the plain Array. If the Incidents should be in LIFO or FIFO order consider queues and stacks. If you need them in a custom order, consider a Priority Queue . Regarding the restrictions, you could use a State Pattern , e.g. access happens through the general IncidentCollection, but depending on it's owner property, a subclass is applied to handle changing of state. This requires the collection to have a owner property though. Because the individiual states are subclasses of IncidentCollection anyway, you could just as well use them directly though.
