Even without documents, you can still use Sharepoint as a platform for a portal with custom webparts (maybe some of them are based on site document libraries). It is a good portal platform and my companies research portal is sharepoint based, and it works pretty well. The good thing is that with these webparts based sharepoint portal, you can still take care of permissioning issues, and presentation customiztion issues (drag the webpart to a particular zone etc, which users do a lot, btw) relatively easily. Also, WSRP type webparts work pretty well with Sharepoint. And you are right, only if you have good Sharepoint devs, then it does make things easy for you and is a decent platform, docs or no docs.
