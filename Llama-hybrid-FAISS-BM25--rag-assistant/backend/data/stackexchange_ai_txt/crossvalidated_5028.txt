We can say that they are all related, but they are all different things. Although you can have things in common among them, such as that in statistics and data mining you use clustering methods. Let me try to briefly define each: Statistics is a very old discipline mainly based on classical mathematical methods, which can be used for the same purpose that data mining sometimes is which is classifying and grouping things. Data mining consists of building models in order to detect the patterns that allow us to classify or predict situations given an amount of facts or factors. Artificial intelligence (check Marvin Minsky*) is the discipline that tries to emulate how the brain works with programming methods, for example building a program that plays chess. Machine learning is the task of building knowledge and storing it in some form in the computer; that form can be of mathematical models, algorithms, etc... Anything that can help detect patterns.
