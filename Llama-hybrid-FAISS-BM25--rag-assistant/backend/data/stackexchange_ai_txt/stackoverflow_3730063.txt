In Ruby, some good ways to convert everything in array of hash values from float to int?

I have an array of hashes, and the values are all float numbers. What are some good ways in Ruby to convert them all to int? I have this way right now but wonder what other methods there are that are more elegant or clear: analytics.map {|e| e.keys.each {|k| e[k] = e[k].to_i}; e} Update: this is a run of the code: > @analytics = [{:a => 1.1, :b => 123.456}, {'c' => 765.432}] => [{:a=>1.1, :b=>123.456}, {"c"=>765.432}] > @analytics.map {|e| e.keys.each {|k| e[k] = e[k].to_i}; e} => [{:a=>1, :b=>123}, {"c"=>765}] > @analytics => [{:a=>1, :b=>123}, {"c"=>765}]
