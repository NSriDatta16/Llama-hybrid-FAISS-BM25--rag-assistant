I'm not too familiar with random forest but I think a possible explanation is that random forest picks up non-linear associations between control and treatment which are "invisible" to a test for differences in means or ranks between groups. If these non-linear associations are very important, than the associations detected by Mann-Whitney test may appear small. This is a simulated example. Protein p0 is very well associated to the Control group when it is lowly or highly expressed. This is picked up by random forest but missed by t-test. p6 instead is generally higher in Patient group but not too strongly (p= 0.05, t-test). I also add some noise proteins : library(data.table) library(ggplot2) library(randomForest) set.seed(1234) grp T-tests for associations: p0 shows no association, p6 weak association: p0 Instead random forest shows good importance for p0 : rf Some plots of the data: gg
