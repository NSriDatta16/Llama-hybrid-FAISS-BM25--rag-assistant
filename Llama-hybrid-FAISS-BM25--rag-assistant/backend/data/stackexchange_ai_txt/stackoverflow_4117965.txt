I am assuming from what you have written that you want to find the average displacement of all the feature points between the two frames. In that case all you have to do is compute the "hypotenuse" in a loop over the features, add up all its values, and then divide by the number of features. Ok, here's your answer: cvCalcOpticalFlowPyrLK(frame1_1C, frame2_1C, pyramid1, pyramid2, frame1_features, frame2_features, corner_count, optical_flow_window, 5, optical_flow_found_feature, NULL, optical_flow_termination_criteria, NULL); //here the features that I extract them double sumOfDistances = 0; for(int i = 0; i I am assuming here that corner_count is the number of features. You would need to make sure that is indeed correct. Also, I haven't tried to compile this. If I had made any mistakes, it would be up to you to fix them. However, if you are planning to do image processing more than just this one time, I suggest that you actually learn some programming. What I did here is very basic stuff. Without understanding this for yourself you will not get very far.
