One important concept in SVM is $\alpha$, (see this answer for details), the lagrange multipliers . For each data point $i$, there is associated $\alpha_i$. Most $\alpha_i$ will close to $0$, for non-zero ones, it is a support vector. Counting non-zero $\alpha$ is the way to go. Different software will have different implementations. Here is a reproducible example in R. library(mlbench) library(kernlab) set.seed(1) d=mlbench.2dnormals(100,sd=0.5) svp Here is the output for svp , and length(svp@alpha[[1]]) . Note there are $6$ support vectors in this case (as plotted in the figure, $6$ solid black points), and the length of $\alpha$ is 6, since it contains only none-zero values. > svp Support Vector Machine object of class "ksvm" SV type: C-svc (classification) parameter : cost C = 1 Polynomial kernel function.
