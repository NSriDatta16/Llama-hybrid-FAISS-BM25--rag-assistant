when i started with SP2010, i began by searching: New features in Lists and Document Libraries New search capabilities DocumentSets (they are very interesting!) Office Web Apps (Excel and Word web access) A little bit of FAST Search Engine Integration with silverlight Changes in the object model Workflows New tools in VS2010 (MSDN, codeplex, codeproject, stackoverflow, and several blogs from Sharepoint MVPs are good places to look for) I don't know if this would help but that's where I started.. if you need specific help you can find several groups in linkedin.. there are a lots of MVPs helping.. Good luck!
