I'm able to set up the authorized_keys file with the public key to log in. What I'm not sure about is the additional information I need to restrict what that account is allowed to do. For example, I know I can put commands such as: no-pty,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding You would want a line in your authorized_keys file that looks like this. permitopen="host.domain.tld:443",no-pty,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwardi ng,command="/bin/noshell.sh" ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC.......wCUw== zoredache
