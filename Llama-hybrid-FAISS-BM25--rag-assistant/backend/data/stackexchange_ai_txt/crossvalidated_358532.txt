PCA is not designed to do what you want. PCA is a data reduction method. A method that is somewhat similar to PCA but does look at the dependent variable is partial least squares. However, I am a bit concerned about two things: First, do you actually have only 20 cases, or is this a subset of your data? Second, from the names of the variables, it seems like some will be inherently related; in particular, radius, perimeter and area all sound like measures of size. If this is so, then you may be able to reduce the number of variables via substantive knowledge rather than statistical methods.
