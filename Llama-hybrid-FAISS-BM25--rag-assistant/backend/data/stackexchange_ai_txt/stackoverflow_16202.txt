@komradekatz, your solution below from MSDN for convenience for others looking into this. I do not like this solution because it uses the user agent to determine the version. This is not viable for what I need (I am writing a class library that needs to know whether .NET 3.5 is installed). I also question how reliable this solution may prove to be. Test for the .NET Framework 3.5 number2) return 1; } return 0; } --> On my machine this outputs: This machine has the correct version of the .NET Framework 3.5. This machine's userAgent string is: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; Zune 2.5).
