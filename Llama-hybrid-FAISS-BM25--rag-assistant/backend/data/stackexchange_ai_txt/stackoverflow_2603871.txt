'Programming by Coincidence' Excercise: Java File Writer

I just read the article Programming by Coincidence . At the end of the page there are excercises. A few code fragments that are cases of "programming by coincidence". But I cant figure out the error in this piece: This code comes from a general-purpose Java tracing suite. The function writes a string to a log file. It passes its unit test, but fails when one of the Web developers uses it. What coincidence does it rely on? public static void debug(String s) throws IOException { FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("debug.log", true); fw.write(s); fw.flush(); fw.close(); } What is wrong about this?
