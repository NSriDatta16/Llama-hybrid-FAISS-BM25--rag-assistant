When is the L2-norm likelihood function appropriate in Bayesian MCMC inference?

The following likelihood function can be found in reservoir simulation literature : $$P(F|k) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{||F-F_k||^2}{\sigma_f^2}\right)$$ Where: $k$ = model $F$ = data $F_k$ = simulation of data $\sigma_f$ = precision of data $F$ I am used to likelihood functions that are equal to the pdf of the model (e.g. likelihood function for coin flips is given by the binomial pdf). Can you offer any context or explanation of this type of likelihood function? I believe it has something to do with the assumption that the model misfit $|F - F_k|$ is normally distributed but I need more context.
