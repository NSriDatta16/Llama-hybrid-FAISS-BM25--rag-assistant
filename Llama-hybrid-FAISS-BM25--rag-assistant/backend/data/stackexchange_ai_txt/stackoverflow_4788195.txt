It should generally be safe to allow users to enter their own CSS code for their sites. Browsers already implement their own user agent CSS to enforce a common styling on unstyled elements. (From the CSS2 specification: "a user agentâ€™s default style sheet should present the elements of the document language in ways that satisfy general presentation expectations for the document language") Also, a large part of ensuring accessibility on a site is to allow customer user agent CSS. Just because this likely can be safely done does not mean it should be, however. Any user could easily set the background image for an element to an inappropriate image on the web, for one example. Providing the ability to do this only opens the door for malicious attacks on your site and should be generally avoided in my opinion.
