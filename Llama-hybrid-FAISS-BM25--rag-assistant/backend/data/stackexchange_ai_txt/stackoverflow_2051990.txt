What is the variable signifying the TFS project name?

I am creating a Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2008 build agent for a project of mine. For the working directory, we don't use the default $(Temp)\$(BuildDefinitionPath). Instead of Temp, we use a specific folder. That folder path includes the Team Project's name. Here comes my question. Is there a variable replacement for the Team Project's name. Example Working directory: D:\Builds\BuildAgents\AdventureWorld\$(BuildDefinitionPath) I want to replace AdventureWorld with a variable.
