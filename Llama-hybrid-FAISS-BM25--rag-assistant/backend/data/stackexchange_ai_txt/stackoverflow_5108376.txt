How do you cache javascript on iphone Safari using html5 localStorage?

I am building a mobile website that uses the main jquery library and some js of our own. Our website is too big and has too much data to be a simple offline/online web app. We need web connectivity. I'm trying to improve caching performance for caching a large amount of javascript for a mobile site. It is well known that that caching on the iPhone's safari is limited to files 15-25kb in size, and our minified js is around 125kb. I've thought about using the cache manifest, but this has the disadvantage that the browser requests the cache-manifest with each page load, and since we aren't using a single page web app, this adds additional requests to the server. Can we cache the javascript in localStorage (available in mobile safari and on the android browser) and then execute it from there?
