Affects of including generated data into "real" dataset

I was thinking about what the outcome of the following idea would be. Let's say that we have a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that has "successfully" (i.e., Discriminator is not able to differentiate between real and fake) mapped a noise distribution to the distribution of the "real" data set (e.g., human faces). If we take the generated images of the Generator and include them in the human faces data set, would this mean that the original 'real' data set can keep growing in size, and hence we are generating new valuable data that can be used to train other models? I've formulated the question in a very loose manner, purposely to invite someone to expose the immediate problems with it. Thanks
