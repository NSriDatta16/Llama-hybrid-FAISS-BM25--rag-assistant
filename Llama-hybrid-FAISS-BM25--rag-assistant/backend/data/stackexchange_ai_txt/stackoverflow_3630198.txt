Managing dependencies with Maven 2

I have a web application with more than 100 jar files dragged by Maven and things went a bit out of control. For example, I ended up with 3 versions of Spring core classes which caused the application deployment to fail sometimes (it seems the order of the jars loaded from WEB-INF/lib is not always the same with Weblogic): spring-2.5.6.SEC01.jar spring-2.5.6.A.jar spring-core-2.0.8.jar So I'm trying to clean-up the mess. I started using mainly exclusions but I wonder if I shouldn't rely on dependencyManagement element in my own pom files instead. What is the best practice about that? Also, the version of transitive dependencies is often not specified. For example, in spring-security-core 2.0.5.RELEASE pom file there is: org.springframework spring-core Which version of spring-core will be loaded if I don't specify anything? The latest available? Will it change over time? Thanks.
