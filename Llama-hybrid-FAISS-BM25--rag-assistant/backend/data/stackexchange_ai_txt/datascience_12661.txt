Neural Network for predict a set in a certain time stamps

I have a market transactions dataset including time stamps and goods as follow. John always buy milk and bread in Super Market. Besides that, he also buys some goods like the following: On Monday, John bought milk, bread {beer, chocolate}. On Tuesday, John bought milk, bread {potato}. On Wednesday, John bought milk, bread {chocolate, avocado, peanuts}. Can we answer the question: "What will he buy on Thursdays?". For example: He will buy {beer, avocado} besides milk and bread on Thursdays. Which one should I use? Supervised or unsupervised. Which model can I use to predict a set of goods in this case?
