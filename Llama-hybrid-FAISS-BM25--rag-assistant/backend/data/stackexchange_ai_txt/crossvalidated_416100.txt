Note that your initial model uses level means coding. The answers to your explicit questions are: Yes , if age goes up by $1$ (year, I assume), the crime score is predicted to increase by $0.38$ , holding all other covariates equal. No (not exactly), being female does not decrease the crime score by 10.3 if the survey participant is female holding other variables constant. Instead, if all other variables are exactly equal to $0$ (e.g., the person is in the process of being born), the predicted crime score for a female is $-10.3$ . Whether that's particularly meaningful is a different issueâ€”it's just part of the linear model. A concern on this thread (e.g., in the comments) is whether the two listed models are the same. The two models are indeed identical. Because there is a categorical variable here, suppressing the intercept just changes the meanings of the intercept and the difference between the levels to the predicted means for the two individual levels when all other variables are $0$ . It may help to read my answer here: How can logistic regression have a factorial predictor and no intercept? Note that the coefficients for age, college, and income are identical between the two models. The difference is the last two estimated coefficients. In the first, female = -10.3 & male = -8.01 ; in the second, the intercept is -10.3 , & the difference between male and female is 2.29 . These yield the same predicted values for all combinations of predictor values.
