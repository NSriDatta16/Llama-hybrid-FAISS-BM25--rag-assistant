You want your build to run as fast as possible, especially if you are doing continuous integration or if you have a large build process. We've recently started fighting with our IT department because the servers we use for building and testing are getting too slow. This is mostly because they have them all running as virtual machines and they've got too many virtual machines per host. Our complete build process (not CI build) is now taking over half an hour to run (most of this is deployment, not compile) and it's killing our QA staff as they have to wait entirely too long for a build. Take the amount of time your build process takes to run (in hours), multiply that by the number of times per year it is run, then multiply that by the hourly rate of the people that sit waiting for the build to finish. In our organization that's in the tens of thousands of dollars. It certainly makes the case for spending a little on a build machine.
