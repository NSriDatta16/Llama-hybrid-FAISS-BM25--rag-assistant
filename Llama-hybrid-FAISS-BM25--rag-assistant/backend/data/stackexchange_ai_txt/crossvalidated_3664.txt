You need to repeat the same process separately for length and weight, as these are completely separate outcomes with different units and methods of measurement. I'd start, as so often, by plotting some exploratory graphs. In this case a set of Bland–Altman (diffference vs. average) plots, one for each observer. If the plots for each observer look similar, I'd do a combined plot too. I'd look for any patterns in these plots, e.g. does the variability in the difference stay reasonably constant with the mean? (if not, i might consider some variance-stabilizing transformation). For each observer I'd then calculate the mean difference between early and late readings, to quantify whether there's a systematic difference, and the standard deviation of the difference as a way of quantifying how much each observer's measurements vary between late and early readings. I might then conduct a formal statistical test for the equality of the variances of the differences, such as the Brown–Forsythe test . If there's no strong evidence that the variances differ substantially between observers, I'd move on to ANOVA as I see has just been described by chl.
