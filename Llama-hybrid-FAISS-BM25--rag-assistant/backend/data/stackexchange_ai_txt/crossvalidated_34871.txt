Yes I think you may be worrying a lot about nothing. In time series the important time unit is the increment of time between two points in the series. Most time series analyses deal with equally spaced data. If the unit of increment is one second then it is possible that the minute containing the leap second is a little different because of the extra second. But more often the incremetn will be hours, days, weeks, months or years. In any of these cases that extra leap second in one of the time intervals really means nothing.
