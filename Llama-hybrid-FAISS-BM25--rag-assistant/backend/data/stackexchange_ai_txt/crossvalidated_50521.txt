What Machine Learning Algorithm would be appropriate for this scenario

I have a PHP/MySQL application that stores symptoms and the appropriate drug. What machine learning algorithm should I use to predict the drug for any symptoms. Also, what would be the format of the training set? Features: 2 (not numeric, string/character) Samples: More than 100 No Missing Values The Labelled data would be as follows: A combination of symptoms relate to a combination of drugs. So, (symptom1, symptom2, symptom3) --> (drug1, drug2) (symptom1, symptom2, symptom4) --> (drug2, drug3, drug4) In general, one ( or more than one ) symptom links to one ( or more than one ) drug: (symptom1, etc...) --> (drug1, etc ...)
