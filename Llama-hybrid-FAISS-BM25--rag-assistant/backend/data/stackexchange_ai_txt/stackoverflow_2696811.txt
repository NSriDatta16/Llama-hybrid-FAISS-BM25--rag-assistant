The most elegant solution that I could find would not reorder the data structure but merely access it in a different fashion. $scores = $data['score']; arsort($scores); $keys_ordered_by_score = array_keys($scores); Now you can, say, grab the display_name and "proffesion" that has the highest score by the following: $first_place = $keys_ordered_by_score[0]; echo $data['display_name'][$first_place], ' is a ', $data['proffesion'][$first_place]; Of course, if you really need to reorder the data structure, this idea is useless to you. Any of the other answers using array_multisort() will likely suit that need.
