PCA dropped to 2 comps to produce the plots. The data could be linearly separable in higher dimensionality, which is probably the case if we look at the accuracy of your linear regression. The difference between the scores, which is minimal (1 instance classified differently in some cases) can be attributed to things such as parameters for your decision tree, however what's confusing here is that you first applied train_test_split to seperate the data in train and test sets and later the scores were produced by CV. Did you apply that CV to your train set? CV fits your classifier from the beggining and uses 300 subsets of data to predict the rest. That has a stochastic component to it so small differences could be explained by that.
