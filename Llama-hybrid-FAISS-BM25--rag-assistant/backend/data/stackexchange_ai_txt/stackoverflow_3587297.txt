I think you have 2 alternatives. First, by core animation, you can set the alpha to 0 in about 0.5 or 1 second, the other way is to set the toolbar and navigation bar to hidden. If you're working with a navigation controller, you can call [self.navigationController setToolbarHidden:YES animated:YES]; or [self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES animated:YES]; this probably do what you want. "And bring it back if the user touches the screen." For this, you may implement methods like: – touchesBegan:withEvent: – touchesMoved:withEvent: – touchesEnded:withEvent: – touchesCancelled:withEvent: this will work if you're working on a UIViewController subclass only.
