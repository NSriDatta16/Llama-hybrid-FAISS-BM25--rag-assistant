versus (vs.): how to properly use this word in data analysis

This question is probably more about the English language than statistics, but I have decided to ask it here anyway. When we compare two groups of samples, let's say Treatment vs. Control , and we calculate not only p-values, but also effect size (or fold change), we want to know what is the baseline. In case of Treatment-Control it's quite obvious. So we understand that if fold change is positive, on average, values in the Treatment group are larger than in the Control group. But what about if one writes "Group A vs. Group B" . Can we make an assumption what is the baseline just by the order of the groups in the statement: right side of *vs* (Group B) or left side (Group A)? Another example: I measured two variables X and Y for a sample, and I plot them on a scatter plot, one dot per observation, variable X on the x -axis, and variable Y on the y -axis. How to properly describe the plot: " Y vs. X " or " X vs. Y ", or both statements are identical? I didn't find a good tag for this question and tried to create a "statistical-language" tag but don't have enough reputation. If you think it would be good and you can help, please do.
