Reduce dimension (Words) for recommender

I have made a related document finder natively in SQL Server. Currently I use the word as dimensions. Based on that i calculate the cosinus simularty to figure out related article. At the moment the dimension around 100k words . I tried to reduce it by stop word rare or frequent uses words(based on the corpus) only lower case take care of POS fix spelling errors use lemma I have exhausted all linguistic filtering possibilities known to me I am looking for further options. Mainly for options they can directly done in sql server (CLR are ok, phyton not) Pca or svd i think are good options but there is no implementation yet.
