I wrote Module Manager specifically to solve these issues. I do not recommend versioning app/etc/local.xml so that each environment can have different database credentials, but I do recommend versioning everything else using modman. Also, I recommend having modman run a script that clears Magento's cache and applies database updates such as the one found here . When used properly you can "svn commit" to your trunk and simply run "modman update-all" on your other environments (including live) to update. For a safer update on 1.4 you can run touch maintenance.flag; sleep 2; modman update-all; rm maintenance.flag
