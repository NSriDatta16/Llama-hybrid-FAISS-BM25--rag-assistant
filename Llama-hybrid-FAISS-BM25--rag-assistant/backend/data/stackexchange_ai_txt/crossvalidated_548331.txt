As a frequentist you have to construct statistics for which you know the distribution of (or at least the asymptotic distribution of) so that you can calculate p-values in order to do inference. Now what the appropriate statistic will be depends on the model and assumptions, and how correct the inference will be depends on if the data corresponds to the modeling assumptions (or how robust the inference is to specific deviations). In your case it looks like you have data with potentially unequal variances. The frequentist approach would be to either do a Welch's t-test or do weighted least squares. As a Bayesian you don't have to worry about existence of asymptotic results for a particular statistic; if you can correctly produce samples from the posterior you can do direct inference on the parameters in your model. "But I must take the variances into account don't I?!" you may be thinking. Recall that your samples of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are from the joint distribution which include the standard deviations. As an exercise for such a simple model you can derive the closed form posterior distributions (assuming conjugate priors) and you will see how the posterior draws of the $\mu$ s depend on the variances. So in that sense your colleague is correct looking at the posterior of the difference is sufficient. Although I think its preferable if the samples come from the same MCMC sampling.
