thanks so much for the input and suggestions. In the end I've decided to create a new DB table which has the sole purpose of existing to return results for this purpose so no joins are required, I just update the table when records are added or deleted to/from the master clients table. Not ideal from a data storage point of view but it solves the problem and means I'm getting results fantastically fast. :)
