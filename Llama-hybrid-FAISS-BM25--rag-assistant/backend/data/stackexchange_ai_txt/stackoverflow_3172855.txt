I am running Windows 7 x64 and have PartCover running properly. I got the source code from Shaun Wilde's fork (see the link in his answer to this question) and change the target CPU on all the projects from Any CPU to x86 and then build. After that I can get code coverage. I use nunit-console-x86.exe to run my unit tests in 32bit.
