JAXB Documentation Annotation

I have the following java class with the JAXB @XMLRootElement annotation @XmlRootElement(name="ClientData") public class ClientData { /** * The first address field of the person */ private String address1 = null; } which produces this xml fragment when i generate the xsd schema Is it possible to use a JAXB annotation so that the documentation details on the address1 field will be included as a xs:annotation/xs:documentention element in my final schema? The first address field of the person
