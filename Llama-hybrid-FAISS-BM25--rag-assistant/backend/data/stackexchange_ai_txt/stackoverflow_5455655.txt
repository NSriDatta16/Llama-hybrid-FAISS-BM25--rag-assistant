have the same problem which is related to the timezone on the Mac being set to New Zealand Standard Time. If you set your timezone to Sydeny the calendar comes right. Also if you execute the following DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd ddd") the day is one day out... To solve this problem add the following code to your App.xaml.cs constructor which rotates the days in the culture. Not elegant but at least the Mac now knows what day it is! if (new DateTime(2011, 3, 28).ToString("ddd") == "Tue") { CultureInfo culture = new CultureInfo("en-AU"); culture.DateTimeFormat.DayNames = new[] { "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday" }; culture.DateTimeFormat.AbbreviatedDayNames = new[] { "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat" }; culture.DateTimeFormat.ShortestDayNames = new[] { "Su", "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa" }; System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = culture; System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = culture; }
