Storing images above or below the web root?

I'm working on a web app where users can upload images which are associated with their account. I'm trying to figure out the best way to store these images in the filesystem taking into account organization and security. I'm using a JavaScript-based file uploader which has to save the images within the web root, but I'm wondering if it would be better to move the images above the web root for better security? Any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated.
