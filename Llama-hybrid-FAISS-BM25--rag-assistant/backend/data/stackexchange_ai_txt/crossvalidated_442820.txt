How to predict new data in Matlab neural network regression when output vs. target is not diagonal

In the ideal case, we expect the output vs. target plot to be diagonal. In Matlab, using the neural network regression app, the plot comes with the non-diagonal best fit (i.e., output=m x target+offset, where m is not 1). In this case, when we predict new data using this trained model, wouldn't the result be biased? Should we transform the predicted value by the model to a new value using the equation above (output=m x target+offset)? Is it possible to compute the confidence interval of the original prediction as well as transformed prediction? I will highly appreciate your response. Many thanks. One such plot can be found in the Matlab website ( https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/gs/fit-data-with-a-neural-network.html ). Screenshot:
