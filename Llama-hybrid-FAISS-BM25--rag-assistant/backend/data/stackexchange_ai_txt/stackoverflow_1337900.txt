AS3 -- Can upload several images to stage, want to size and move each separately

Currently each loader is a child of a sprite -- sprite.addChild(loader); Next I add the sprite to movieClip box which is with myBorder movieClip -- mainMovie.myBorder.box.addChild(sprite); Next I can drag the sprite using -- mainMovie.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,pickUp); mainMovie.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP,dropIt); function pickUp(event:MouseEvent):void { sprite.startDrag(); } function dropIt(event:MouseEvent):void { sprite.stopDrag(); } I want each sprite separate but I'm having trouble understanding where to use the "for while" loop. I only want to give the ability to upload 5 images at most. Can anyone here help me? Thanks Annette B.
