In principle, I think it is fine to use a permutation test with your data and hypothesis. It would just involve permuting the "group" labels between your respiration rates, and calculating a new average respiration rate for each "group" on each permutation. You then see whether your observed average rate falls outside the range of expected rates, or not. The only note of caution I would have with your particular test, is whether your data points are truly independent. For example, it may be that the respiration rate is actually more affected by the running speed in the previous minute, rather than the concurrent minute. This is for you - the designer and analyst of your study - to decide if this matters for your hypothesis test or not. There aren't really hard rules regarding exchangeability as it's dependent on your specific case. You just need to think carefully whether it makes sense to randomise your labels or not - for example, by permuting do you create 'impossible' combinations?
