How to click input type="submit" in newest firefox?

I made quite popular UserJS for Facebook, but since FF 3.6.13 version it doesn't work (for that version). I just have no idea how can I click such elements: ? Clicking such buttons with mouse redirects to another page. What my script does is searching for such elements with Xpath and then clicking them with simple acceptbutton.click(); It works great on Opera, Chrome and FF Probably using JQuery's click() function would help ,but I cannot use jquery in my userjs. I tried also acceptbutton.form.submit(); but it redirects me to wrong page. Edit : Ok i am adding code fragment var acceptbuttons = xpath(document,'//label[@class="uiButton uiButtonConfirm"]/input'); for (var i = 0; i Thanks for any help!
