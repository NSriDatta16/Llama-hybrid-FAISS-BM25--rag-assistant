In the current place I work, the version control system is one of the most advanced and matured. This is how we do. We have something called as a "main" branch which is the code base that will be in production. Note, the code base in one single huge gargantuan structure. Say if a new project comes, we will have to do a scoping for it and will book a release week. Now we have to starting working on it. So, we cut a branch from main called as feature branch. The team or the group of developers keep working in that particular feature branch. Note there will be a lots of feature branch cuts simultaneously from the main branch. Now once the development is over its customary to merge the code back to main. We will not do it directly as it might cause havoc due to obvious criticality issues. So we have a one more branch cut from main called pre-release. We merge all our code to that release base. And do a build on the full code base. The build should pass. When it does so, we extract a green timestamp (last passed build). Once the green time stamp is got, code will be merged from the pre-release branch to main and the release is finalized. Once the code is put into production and say if we face some bugs, we cut a branch from main called as bug-fix branch. Do all the changes. And merging it back to main; always follows the pre-release/green timestamp process. Its inevitable. Re-base. Ok, so initially I said that we would have booked when our feature branch has to be completed. During this time period, there will be lot of code update would have happened on main. So, its pretty much necessary that you keep updating your current feature branch to be in sync with main. For that a process called as rebase is done. Its like getting the latest code from main so that you are not working in a branch that is so outdated. In my current org, a rebase will be triggered every 2-3 weeks although policies recommend 1 week. More interesting features: Say I am currently working on a so called Feature branch and I want to get some code from one of the other teams who are also working in their own feature branch (this scenario although seems uncommon happens frequently). For that we will change our config-spec (ClearCase is our version control system), to point to those files required from the other project. Either LATEST can be used or a TIMESTAMP can be specified to extract those files coming from the other feature branch. After a good amount of time after the project goes live, the feature branch which we cut is pretty much not needed. It can be terminated from the system say after a years time should space be a constraint.
