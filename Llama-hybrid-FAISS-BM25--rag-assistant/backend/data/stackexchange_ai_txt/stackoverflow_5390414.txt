If you wanted to make your mutations green and you had a list of mutations (0 indexed): >>> seq = "ACGTACGT" >>> muts = [0,1,5] >>> mark_up = " %s " # use list comprehension to add mark up to muts >>> marked_up_seq = [ mark_up % seq[x] if x in muts else seq[x] for x in range(0,len(seq)) ] # rejoin marked up list >>> "".join(marked_up_seq) " A C GTA C GT" >>> With numbers for clarity: >>> seq = "0123456789" >>> muts = [1,3,4,9] >>> marked_up_seq = [ mark_up % seq[x] if x in muts else seq[x] for x in range(0,len(seq)) ] >>> "".join(marked_up_seq) "0 1 2 3 4 5678 9 " This isn't the most elegant solution, notice that the tags around 3 and 4 could be combined.
