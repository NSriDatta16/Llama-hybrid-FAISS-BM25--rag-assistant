Arrays in Azure Table Storage Entities (Non-Byte)

I'm looking to store arrays in Azure Table entities. At present, the only type of array supported natively is byte-array, limited to 64k length. The size is enough, but I'd like to store arrays of longs, doubles and timestamps in an entity. I can obviously cast multiple bytes to the requested type myself, but I was wondering if there's any best-practice to achieve that. To clarify, these are fixed length arrays (e.g. 1000 cells) associated with a single key.
