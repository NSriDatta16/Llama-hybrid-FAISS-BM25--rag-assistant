For Logistic Regression, should I avoid changing discrete independent variable to binary independent variable?

I am running multiple logistic regression to understand feature importance. One of the independent variables has a distribution (histogram) that looks like: Value Count 0 4000 1 25 2 10 3 10 4 1 There is, obviously, a long tail here. My gut instinct is to bucket this long tail into a single value such that the distribution becomes a binary categorical variable: Value Count 0 4000 Not_0 178 Is this the right instinct? I wouldn't want my coefficient from the regression to just be noise, which I anticipate the non-bucketed distribution would be susceptible to. Maybe I am misunderstand logistic regression though. Another choice might be not using this predictor at all due to the class imbalance.
