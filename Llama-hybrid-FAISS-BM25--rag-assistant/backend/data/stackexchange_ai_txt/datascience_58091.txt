To my understanding, the meaning of Andrew Ng's words is: since logistic regressions are linear classifiers, the only thing you can do to improve their performance is to increase the number of variables (i.e. adding more fetaures). Which means that, in order to get the same results that you would get with a Neural Network, you'd need much more input data. I 100% agree with you that the average Neural Network has way more trainable parameters than a logistic regression, but to reach the same performance of a Neural Network, a logistic regression would require much more of them.
