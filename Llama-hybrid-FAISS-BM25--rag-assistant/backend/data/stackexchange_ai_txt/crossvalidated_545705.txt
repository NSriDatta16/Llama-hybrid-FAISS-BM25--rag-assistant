I will give my answer based on Pearl's other book ( Causality ) First, some terminology: there are 3 types of queries: observational, interventional, and counterfactual. For observational queries, you only need a joint distribution For interventional queries, you also need a directed graph (e.g. a Bayesian Network(BN), and especially a Causal Bayesian Network(CBN).) As you quoted, CBNs are required to be able to see how the variables influence each other (hence a graph is used). On a high level, the takeaway should be this simple: you need a graph. The CBN is a BN where you interpret the probabilities in another way. For counterfactual queries, you also need to know the quantitative relationship between the different variables. So here you need a graph and a parametrization that describes these functional relationships. A causal diagram is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) This provides all we need to answer your first question Answer to question 1: TL;DR: SCM = causal diagram + functions for each edge The causal diagram is a graph that describes what variables relate to each other, whereas an SCM additionally gives a quantitative description of these relationships, P.S.: I cannot find "causal structural models" in the linked book with the search function. My guess based on Google searches (the term arises in a paper co-authored by Pearl) that they are the same
