How to calculate weighted average of hourly sales in a day

I have hourly sales data & want to aggregate it to a day level. Out of 24 hours, we are classifying 6 hrs as peak hours and 18 hrs as non-peak. Assume peak hr sales for a day as: $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_6$ Non-peak hr sales for a day as: $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_{18}$ How can we take a weighted average of peak hr and non-peak hrs to get the data to a day level? Ideal case would be to use the units sold in each hour as weights. But i don't have that information. What i have instead is a supply-demand information. Out of which, the trend of hourly demand follows the trend of the hourly price. From what I understand there are 2 ways to go about this: Use demand as weights and calculate weighted average (but demand is not equal to actual units sold) Use $$ \frac{\frac{1}{4}\sum_{i=1}^{6}X_{i} + \frac{3}{4}\sum_{i=1}^{18}Y_{i}}{15} $$ where $$ 15 = \frac{1}{4}*6 + \frac{3}{4}*18 $$ Which would be more accurate? Or is there a better way?
