How is the 'feature_importance_' value calculated in sklearn random forest regressor?

I have 9000 sample, with five features, and one output variable (all are numerical, continuous values). I used random forest regression method using scikit modules. I got a graph of the feature importance (using the function feature_importances_ ) values for each of the five features, and their sum is equal to one. I want to understand what these are, and how they are calculated mathematically. Can someone please explain?
