Integration testing may be done at a user interface level (via automated functional tests - AFT ) or service/api interface level. There are several tools in both cases: I have worked on projects that successfully used Sahi or Selenium for AFT of web apps, white for AFT for .NET WPF or winforms apps, swtBot for AFT of Eclipse Rich client apps and frankenstein for AFT of Java swing apps. Fitnesse is useful for service/api level tests or for tests that run just below the UI. When done right, it has the advantage of having business-readable tests i.e. non-developers can read and understand the tests. Tools like NUnit are less useful for this purpose. SOAPUI is particularly suited for testing SOAP web services. Factors to consider: Duration : Can you tolerate 8 hour test runs? Brittleness : AFTs can be quite brittle against an evolving application (e.g. ids and positions of widgets may change). Adequate skill and effort is needed to not hard code the changing parts. Fidelity : How close to real world do you want it to be? e.g. You may have to mock out interactions with a payment gateway unless the provider provides you a test environment that you can pummel with your tests. Some nuances are captured here . Full disclosure: The author is associated with the organization behind most (not all) of the above free and open source tools.
