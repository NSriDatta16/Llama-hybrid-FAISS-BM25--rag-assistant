Memcached allocates storage based on slabs of fixed sizes, and may therefore waste a lot of memory. If you have very small objects, it will select the smallest slab that is larger than your object, but that may depending on configuration be quite large. I think you can configure this to some extent, and it may be worthwhile testing with different values for the -n parameter to see if this makes a difference.
