Which hierarchical clustering algorithm?

I have a large distance matrix $3400\times 3400$. I need to cluster them hierarchically and then cut the tree into clusters (like a partitional approach). Which algorithm is most sensitive to finding natural clusters in the data based on the distance matrix? How can I evaluate the result? I am planning on using average silhouette coefficient of the tree at various levels to identify the 'natural' clusters from the tree. Thanks
