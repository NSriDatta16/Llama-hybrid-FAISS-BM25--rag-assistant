JQuery Dragging Outside Parent

I'm using JQuery's draggable(); to make li elements draggable. The only problem is when the element is dragged outside its parent, it doesn't show up. That is, it doesn't leave the confines of its parent div. An example is here: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jo6tC.png - it's as if the z-index for everything else has greater priority (and the element slides under everything). Here's the code: $('.photoList li').draggable({ distance: 20, snap: theVoteBar, revert: true, containment: 'document' }); And the li elements are placed in DIVs like this: Page 1 I'm positive the problem is it won't leave its parent container, but I'm not sure what to do to get it out. Any direction or help would be appreciated GREATLY!
