I found the Craftsman articles by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob) an excellent resource for learning effective unit testing. It focuses on Test Driven Development and walks you through the experience of a new coder learning how to test code. The first article can be found here and is called The Craftsman #1: Opening Disaster .
