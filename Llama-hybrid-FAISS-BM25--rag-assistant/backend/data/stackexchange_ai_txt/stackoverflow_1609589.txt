If it's destined for a socket, perhaps CFStringGetBytes() would be your best choice? Also note that the documentation for CFStringGetCStringPtr() says: This function either returns the requested pointer immediately, with no memory allocations and no copying, in constant time, or returns NULL . If the latter is the result, call an alternative function such as the CFStringGetCString function to extract the characters.
