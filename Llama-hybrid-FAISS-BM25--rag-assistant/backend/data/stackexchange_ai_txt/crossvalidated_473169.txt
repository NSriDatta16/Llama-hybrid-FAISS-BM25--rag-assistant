I will answer my own question because @Greenparker was kind enough to clarify it in the comments. Ideally, I should use the function batchSize in package mcmcse to estimate the optimal batch size. That's the default option in multiESS . In my specific case, the optimal batch size happens to be 1, as originally asked. (Beware that there is an error in function batchSize as available from CRAN (v1.4.1). This error allows the optimal batch size to be lower than 1, which shouldn't happen. The GitHub repo has it fixed: github.com/dvats/mcmcse)
