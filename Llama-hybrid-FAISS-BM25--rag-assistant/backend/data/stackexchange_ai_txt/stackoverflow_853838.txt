first, I would not confuse scrum teams and organizational structure. Organization -wise,your tech. writer can belong to any team. From Scrum perspective, i would dedicate time of the tech writer to the teams (the distribution depends on your sprint size) e.g. one day a week to each team or AM/PM (for 2 teams). That way, each scrum team knows how much and when the tech writer is assigned to them and can plan accordingly. I would also have the tech writer attend all the daily meetings if possible (with 2 teams, it should be doable). This way, the tech writer (or any scarce resource) would be a part of all the teams (scrum-wise). I think the only problem may be discipline to only work for the assigned team ad assigned times, but I am sure you will sort that our in a sprint or two. I am not sure about the planning meetings, but I am sure the person should take part in retrospectives Matej
