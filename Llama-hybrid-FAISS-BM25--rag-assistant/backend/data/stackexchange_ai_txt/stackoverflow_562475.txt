Not an elegant solution, but you could achieve it with a nested looping structure // select tables from database and store in an array // loop through the array foreach table in database { // select columns in the table and store in an array // loop through the array foreach column in table { // select * from table where column = url } } You could probably speed this up by checking which columns contain strings while building your column array, and also by combining all the columns per table in one giant, comma-separated WHERE clause.
