Because $\log p(y|a) = \log \sum_s p(s|a)p(y|s,a)$ is computationally infeasible to compute. The hard attention attention $s$ is a discrete random variable which can take on $T^L$ values, where $T$ is the number of words and $L$ is the number possible of attention locations. Therefore the sum cannot be realistically computed, and variational lower bound is used instead.
