iPhone apps with the same bundle identifier have access to the sMe keychain. So you could write data from app1 into the keychain and then access it from app2. You'd need to do smart updating of the keychain to keep flags of when the other app is open by using the right uiapplication delegate methods but it should be possible. Note that keychain is a key-value storage and not suitable for larger complex data. For that you should use server-client structure.
