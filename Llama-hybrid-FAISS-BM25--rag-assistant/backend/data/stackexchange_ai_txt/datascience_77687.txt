How to run neural network in gpu instead of cpu?

I installed cuDNN and cuda toolkit 11 in my machine. Now I installed tensorflow-gpu in pip3 of version 2.2.0. But while running neural network, cpu is being used 90% with four cores and gpu is being used just 7%-15% . But I want my cpu will not be used.
