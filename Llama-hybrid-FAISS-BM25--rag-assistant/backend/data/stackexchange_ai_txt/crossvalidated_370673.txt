Stanford NLP, being the wiz-kids that they are, take advantage of all information present in their annotators and models. That includes upper-case letters. They describe a few work arounds, such as a truecaser or models that are less sensitive to that lack of information below: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/caseless.html If your data is case insensitive, it will impact your results. I would suggest removing whatever piece of your pipeline is sanitizing case from your text, if you're able.
