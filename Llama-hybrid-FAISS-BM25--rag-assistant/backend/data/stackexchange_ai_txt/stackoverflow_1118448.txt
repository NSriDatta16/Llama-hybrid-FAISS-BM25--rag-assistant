The protocol field will be set to TCP (6) for each fragment. From RFC 791 - Internet Protocol To fragment a long internet datagram, an internet protocol module (for example, in a gateway), creates two new internet datagrams and copies the contents of the internet header fields from the long datagram into both new internet headers. ... This procedure can be generalized for an n-way split, rather than the two-way split described. Protocol is part of the header and will consequently be copied into each of the fragments.
