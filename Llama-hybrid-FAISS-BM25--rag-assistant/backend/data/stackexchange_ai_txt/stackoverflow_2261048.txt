BruTube_Videos vdo_obj=new BruTube_Videos(); Never call a constructor on an Activity . You never create activities -- you tell Android to start them. That is the source of your error. I strongly encourage you to get rid of the activities altogether, and have a single TabActivity holding onto Views -- one that is a layout for your edit form, one that is your ListView . Then, you will not get confused as to where the code goes, since there is only one activity. This is also more efficient from a programming, memory, CPU, and battery utilization standpoint.
