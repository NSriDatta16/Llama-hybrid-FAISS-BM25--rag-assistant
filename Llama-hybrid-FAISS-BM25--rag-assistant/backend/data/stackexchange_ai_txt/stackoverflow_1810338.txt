Using <> that way (interactively) in paragraph mode is going to be confusing. It won't return when you hit "return"; instead, it will read until it gets a non empty line (the start of a paragraph), then read until it gets an empty line (the end of that paragraph), then continue reading until it gets a non-empty line (the start of the following paragraph - which will be buffered, not returned) so it knows that it's discarded any extra empty lines. Perhaps you should be using: local $/ = "\n"; <> at the end of your loop instead. Or maybe POSIX::getchar().
