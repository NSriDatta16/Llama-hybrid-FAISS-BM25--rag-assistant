Does the size of database fields matter?

I have a database table, let's call it Countries. Countries all have names, short names and continents. Let's assume that the longest name of any country in the world is 54 characters long. Should I set the maximum size to 54 or should I set it to e.g. 64 or something else? Will my choice affect queries or storage in any way? I know this might seem like pre-optimizing, but I find myself often choosing 32, 64, 128, etc. and I'd like to know if that matters. Thanks
