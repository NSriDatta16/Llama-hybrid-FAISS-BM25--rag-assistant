How to determine if two time series are significantly related to each other

Based on our knowledge of other characteristics of these two variables, we have reason to believe that changes in admits to a ward has an impact on a certain bad outcome on that ward (these are counts collected monthly): > dput(admits) structure(c(3L, 4L, 3L, 22L, 54L, 74L, 35L, 58L, 59L, 45L, 38L, 52L, 37L, 29L, 39L, 27L, 14L, 4L, 6L, 15L, 31L, 10L, 12L, 14L, 11L, 18L, 36L, 33L, 42L, 35L, 20L, 28L, 22L, 54L, 26L, 41L, 26L, 41L, 40L, 34L, 31L, 23L, 34L, 22L, 21L, 11L, 29L, 13L, 27L, 40L, 41L), .Tsp = c(2010, 2014.16666666667, 12), class = "ts") > dput(badOutcome) structure(c(12L, 14L, 13L, 12L, 42L, 55L, 47L, 29L, 25L, 28L, 17L, 22L, 54L, 30L, 31L, 25L, 26L, 9L, 12L, 7L, 14L, 17L, 13L, 13L, 14L, 12L, 15L, 20L, 17L, 30L, 35L, 41L, 18L, 19L, 26L, 15L, 12L, 5L, 15L, 12L, 21L, 13L, 18L, 22L, 19L, 21L, 12L, 8L, 7L, 15L, 12L), .Tsp = c(2010, 2014.16666666667, 12), class = "ts") Since the data are serially correlated, my understanding is that the assumption of independence for regular regression techniques is violated. What are the steps then, and techniques, to determine if "admits" is significantly related to "badOutcome" ?
