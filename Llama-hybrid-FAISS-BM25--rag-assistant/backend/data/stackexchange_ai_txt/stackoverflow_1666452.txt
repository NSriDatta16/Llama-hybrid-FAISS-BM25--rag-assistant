volatile is a type qualifier not a storage class specifier , so it does not determine storage location at all; it affects the definition of a variable's type, not its storage. It simply forces the compiler to explicitly read a variable whose type is volatile from the variable's storage location (wherever that may be) rather than assuming that some previously read value in a register for example remains valid.
