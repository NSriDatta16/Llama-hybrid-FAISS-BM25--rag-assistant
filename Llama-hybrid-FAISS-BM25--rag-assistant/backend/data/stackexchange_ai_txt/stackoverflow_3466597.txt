If you are performing multiple shifts, you can use power operations. A bit shift is a multiplication or division by 2 n , and a power operation would be more readable than multiple multiplication or division operations, I think, but I'm not sure about the performance. I suppose this is a more elegant solution, but probably not a more efficient one.
