This question didn't garner too much interest, but I thought I'd answer it just as well in case someone comes across this in the future. I found that you can't drag elements between two tables, only within the same table - further inspection of the YUI2 examples I mentioned above were doing exactly this, dragging within a given table. I've since converted my tables to elements and styled them to look like a using CSS, and now I can drag from one 'table' to another. If anyone is curious to see some code for dragging and dropping, check out YUI3's docs here .
