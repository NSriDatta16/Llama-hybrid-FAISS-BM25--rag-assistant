The article you reference explains the point in the next paragraph. The names of the packages are used to indicate relationships to programmers' eyes but do not have any relationship in the eye of the compiler. As the article explains importing java.awt.* will not import any classes in java.awt.font they are completely separate packages that do not have any hierarchical relationship in the programming language. To import all the classes in java.awt.font you have to import java.awt.font.* and that does not import any classes in the parent package java.awt or in sibling packages like java.awt.color . So even though there is an apparent hierarchical relationship to the programmer there really isn't any in the language. To access classes in a given package you have to import them from their exact package. If packages were actually hierarchies then one might imagine that this would be the case. However the hierarchy is only there to organise the code and give hint to programmers that a given set of packages are intended to be used together.
