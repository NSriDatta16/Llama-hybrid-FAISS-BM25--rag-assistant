identifying low information features with $\chi^2$ distribution

On this site TEXT CLASSIFICATION FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS â€“ ELIMINATE LOW INFORMATION FEATURES , low information features are identified by using the BigramAssocMeasures.chi_sq function of NLTK. My question: What does $\chi^2$ have to do with this? How are the low information features identified by using $\chi^2$? I only know $\chi^2$ from independence tests. I am only just beginning with machine learning, so keep it simple :)
