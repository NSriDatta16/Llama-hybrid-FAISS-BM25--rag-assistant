Suppose $X_{t}$ and $Y_{t}$ are your time series. You can obtain their difference as: $$Z_{t} = X_{t} - Y_{t}$$ Then, you can test whether Z_{t} is white noise which implies that the two time series are not significantly different. You can find how to do such a test here: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Testing_White_Noise.html#:~:text=To%20test%20whether%20a%20set,successive%20noise%20samples%20are%20uncorrelated . You can also use change point models to see if there is a significant change point in $Z_{t}$ indicating the starting point of divergence between the two.
