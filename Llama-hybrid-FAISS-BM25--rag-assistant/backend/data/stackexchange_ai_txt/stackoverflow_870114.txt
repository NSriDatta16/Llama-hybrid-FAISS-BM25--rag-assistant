need help making tabs to be used by jquery tabs plugin

I am completely new to CSS and can not get around making tabs. We currently have tabs like this However, these tabs are made using a bad looking tag Below is the code that produced the image in above link Summary Reports &nbsp; Detail Reports &nbsp; However, I am trying to use more elegant method of jquery tabs plugin. This plugin changes div's to tabs. So I am trying to find out how to convert the tabs that I have into div's so that I can use them with the jquery tab plugin. I would appreciate some help that would at least get me started on this. Ideally I would like the html to be as simple as Summary Detailed Summary Info goes here: Detailed Info goes here: But I cant wrap my head around CSS that would do this.
