One thing you can do is ordinal logistic regression, where attitude is the dependent variable and sex is an independent variable. You will have to check the assumptions of the model, but this is a good starting point. One advantage of a regression model over anything that just compares the two groups on one variable (whether t or Mann Whitney or whatever) is that you can include covariates. For research on people and attitudes, this is often a good idea; e.g. you might want to include age, race/ethnicity, or other demographic variables, depending on what you are asking about (is it attitudes about Donald Trump? Peanut butter? Shakespeare? Elon Musk? Or what?)
