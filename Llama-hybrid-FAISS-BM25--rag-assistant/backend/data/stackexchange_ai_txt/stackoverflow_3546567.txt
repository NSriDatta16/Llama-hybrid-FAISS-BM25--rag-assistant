For a stats systems what's better in MySQL: InnoDB, Archive or MyISAM?

I want to store all accesses to a webpage with user-agent, script-execution-time, request-uri, full referer and some more variables. What I have been doing is use normalized MyISAM tables like: stats stats_user_agents stats_referers stats_requested_uris But in a normal webpage this takes some SELECT's and 1 INSERT . It's better use ARCHIVE tables? The stats records will be from 0 to some millions.
