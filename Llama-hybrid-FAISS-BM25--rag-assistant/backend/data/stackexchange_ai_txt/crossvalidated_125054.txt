The standard procedure is to calculate the PCA decomposition, and to keep those components which account for, say, 95% of the total variance. In other words, you calculate the eigenvalues and order them decreasingly. Keep those components for which the sum of the corresponding eigenvalues accounts for 95% of the total. If you would like to go for a more principled approach, you may consider probabilistic PCA , which has some additional advantages: you can handle missing values and is more robust when working with high dimensional data and relatively small data sets. An extension of this idea ( Bayesian PCA ) allows you to select the number of components from the data automatically.
