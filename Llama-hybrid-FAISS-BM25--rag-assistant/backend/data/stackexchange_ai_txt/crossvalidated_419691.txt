Regression model for categorical DV with more than 2 response options

I am soon going to start running a simple behavioral experiment where each response will be coded as belonging to one of 3 categories (or otherwise, as NA). I ran a similar experiment before, where the categorical responses fell into either the category 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' so we had coded them as 1 and 0, respectively, and we had fitted a logistic regression model with binomial distribution. I don't quite know, however, what kind of a regression model would be appropriate in cases where there is more than 2 different response options, and they are not ordered on a scale. I know this is probably a very basic question, but I am still in the process of learning. Thank you for your patience, Freya
