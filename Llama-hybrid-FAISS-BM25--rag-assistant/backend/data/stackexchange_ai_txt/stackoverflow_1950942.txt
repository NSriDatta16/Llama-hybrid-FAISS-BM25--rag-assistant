ASP.NET adding controls inside a loop

Pardon me, this really is a noob question but please understand that I do not have much ASP.NET experience. All I need to do is: 1) Open up the following SQL query: SELECT myid FROM mytable 2) For each record, generate this fragment of HTML: Its easy for me to use the classical ASP style loops but I need it in ASP.NET style, probably perform the operation in Page_Load event and use intrinsic ASP.NET controls.
