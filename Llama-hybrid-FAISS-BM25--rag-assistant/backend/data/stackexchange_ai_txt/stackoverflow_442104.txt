Your code works fine for me. Here's the output on my box: You might be in the following time zones: (GMT) Casablanca (GMT) Greenwich Mean Time : Dublin, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London (GMT) Monrovia, Reykjavik That's all the ones with the same offset at the moment, which is what your code clearly displays - if you want all the timezones, just remove the "if" part, as Robert says. If you think you should be seeing more zones, could you tell us which timezone you're in so we can work out what other ones should be displayed?
