What is the correct approach in this case for modelling data (logistic regression)

I'm making a logistic regression model but am unsure about whether it is right or not to do the following: I'm trying to predict if a person will buy a high cost hotel, given by hotel_spend > 250 . I know columns such as flight_spend and vehicle_spend are acceptable inputs to the model but am unsure if I could use total_spend as it contains information about hotel_spend which is used to create the target. This is highlighted by the last row where (hotel_spend == total_spend) > 250 . My head tells me I shouldn't do this as I'm using the hotel_spend to predict if they will spend a certain amount on a hotel. I'm looking for advice if this is acceptable or not. In my head I don't think should be done, just looking for other opinions. flight_spend hotel_spend vehicle_spend total_spend \ 20 49 33 102 0 59 0 59 65 100 40 205 150 250 50 450 0 300 0 300 hotel_spend_high_spend_label 0 0 0 1 1
