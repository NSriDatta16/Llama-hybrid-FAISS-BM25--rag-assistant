There are multiple options. One way would be to use a Chi-square test for the first case and a McNemar test for the second case. Note that the Chi-square test hypotheses is based on the difference of frequencies between the groups. Another option would be to use a logistic regression model for the first case with an additional random effect on the subjects for the second case. You may want to choose a logistic regression model (over a Chi-square test) because the it is much more flexible, allowing for a lot more to be tested and included in the model, compared to a Chi-square test which is very... non-flexible. Having said that, if you are only interested in frequencies you might want to use a Chi-square as it might have higher power (to detect a significant effect). The Chi-square test is based on the $\chi^2$ distribution while the logistic regression model is based on the binomial distribution, this might be another factor in choosing a model/test. Below are the results of a simulation for a simple example of two groups done in R, the second group is different from the first so we expect a significant result. The lines represent the average p-value for the studied effect for different sample sizes. Note that the Chi-square test has lower p-values than the regression model, so it is able to detect differences more frequently. rez=c() set.seed(69) for (i in seq(10,100,2)) { tmp=replicate(500,{ df=data.frame( "Group"=c(rep("A",i/2),rep("B",i/2)), "Improv"=c(sample(0:1,i/2,replace=T), sample(0:1,i/2,prob=c(0.1,0.9),replace=T)) ) tryCatch({ c(summary(glm(Improv~Group,data=df,family=binomial)) $coef[2,"Pr(>|z|)"], chisq.test(df$ Group,df $Improv)$ p.value) },error=function(cond){ c(NA,NA) }) }) rez=rbind( rez, c(rowMeans(tmp,na.rm=T), as.numeric(apply(tmp,1,quantile,c(0.025,0.975),na.rm=T))) ) }
