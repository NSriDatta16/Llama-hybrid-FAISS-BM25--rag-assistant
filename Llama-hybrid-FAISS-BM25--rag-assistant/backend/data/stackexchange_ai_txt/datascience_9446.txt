$R^{2}$ is a cursory measure of goodness of fit of a linear model to the data and it is used in regression analysis. It appears to be a popular choice when deciding between linear and non-linear regression models. It seems you intend to use kNN for classification, which has different evaluation metrics than regression. Scikit-learn provides 'accuracy', 'true-positive', 'false-positive', etc (TP,FP,TN,FN), 'precision', 'recall', 'F1 score', etc. for evaluating performance of a classifier. bonus: kNN are simple classifiers that are used when data shows local structure but not global structure, i.e. data with same label are found in multiple localized clusters in the data space. The key parameter to tune is 'k', which should be based on the size of these localized clusters as you would stand to achieve considerably different results with different values of 'k'. You can do a grid-search (also in scikit-learn) to tune your parameters (including 'k' of course). evaluation metric: accuracy or ROC or mean Average Precision or F1-score: There are several metrics to choose from and the choice is based on the task you are performing and what your priorities are. (you can look up these metrics for more details) but you can begin with accuracy for starters.
