What is the structure of the testing data file in libsvm?

According to the README file: The format of training and testing data file is: label index1:value1 index2:value2... My training file would be something like this: 1 1:120 2:29925 3:151 ... # values belonging to class 1 2 1:66 2:5577 3:114 ... # values belonging to class 2 3 1:249 2:77 3:73 ... # values belonging to class 3 The first column says to which class the values belongs. I don't get why should I put the label column in the testing file too: if the label says to which class the values should belong, how can I know in advance to which class they belong? My testing file is as follows: 1:118 2:114 3:110 ... 1:260 2:277 3:1422 ... If I have to put a label field in my testing file, what value should it have?
