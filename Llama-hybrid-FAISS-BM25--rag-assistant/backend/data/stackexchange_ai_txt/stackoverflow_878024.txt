I've got it half answered. I was missing a "this" before the broadcastMessage() call so once I changed it to this.broadcastMessage('myMessage', this) it started working. Still have the issue with 5 different instances (i.e. dragged-&-dropped 5 times from the library and named them different instance names) of one movie clip all calling the same broadcast message at the same time. I get the following output: Object: _level0.instance1.photo5 Object: _level0.instance1.photo4 Object: _level0.instance1.photo3 Object: _level0.instance1.photo2 Object: _level0.instance1.photo1
