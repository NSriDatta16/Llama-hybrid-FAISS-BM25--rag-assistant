Why should a business use distributed version control?

It seems that many people read about distributed version control and implicitly understand why it is a good thing for open source development, with many distributed developers all acting independently and in accordance with their own choices instead of mandate from management. But from this impression many people form the idea that DVCS is useful only in an open-source environment; they can't see how it would help an organization that releases a proprietary product and doesn't make its version control system accesible externally, or how it would help a single developer. What are some benefits a business can see if it chooses to use distributed version control such as git, darcs, or Mercurial instead of centralized version control such as CVS or Subversion?
