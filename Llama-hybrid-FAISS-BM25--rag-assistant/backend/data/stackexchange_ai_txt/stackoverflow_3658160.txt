I want to create a menu editor for my website using PHP and AJAX

I created menu.php which loads the menu items from a MySQL database, parses them through a function which creates the code for the menu items which are then displayed in order in an HTML list (tell me if this is confusing and I can post the code). What I would like to make is an admin page the would allow the user to reorder the menu items, BTW they are sorted by an order column. thanks in advance :) edit: The main part where I'm stuck is creating the user interface where the user can shift the menu items around (hopefully drag and drop) and then saving the new order to the database.
