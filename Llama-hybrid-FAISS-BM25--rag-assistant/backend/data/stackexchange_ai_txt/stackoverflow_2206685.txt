Hybrid Rails Caching Options, am I reinventing something?

Well, not really reinventing, however, we have a large content-based website which handles load (after we fixed the SQL pooling issue) to a certain point, then we just run out of steam. A lot of this is due to bad code we are trying to fix up, but a lot is just due to the level of requests etc. We were considering page caching, because well, it's damn quick (yep... :D) but that doesn't work because we have certain fragments within the page which are specific to the logged in user. But, not all hope is lost... I was wondering if it would be ideal to do the following: Page level caching, with sweepers to clean out the pages when content is updated. Replace the user-specific fragments with placeholders (and perhaps generic content like... 'View your Account, or Sign Up Here') When the users page loads fire off an async request (AJAX, or, some would call it AJAH), which requests the 'dynamic' fragment, then place the content placeholders with this fragment.. The main issue I can see with this is that users with JS turned off wouldn't see the content, but I honestly don't think we would be too affected by this, and IMHO people who disable javascript, for the most part, are idiots (yes, I said it!). I'd also be interested to know if I'm (no doubt) reinventing something, and if anyone can point me to a site which is already doing something like this it would be appreciated. Thanks awesome SO community!
