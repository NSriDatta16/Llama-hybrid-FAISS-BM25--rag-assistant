You could consider using randomized quantile residuals, which use randomization to average out the discrete patterns that appear in residuals from count response data. Randomized quantile residuals are the only type of residuals that are follow an exact normal distribution for non-normal generalized linear models. For example, if y is your vector of Poisson counts, you might use: fit Randomized quantile residuals were proposed by Dunn & Smyth (1996). An independent comparison study by Feng et al (2020) showed that randomized quantile residuals perform better than traditional residuals for diagnosing model problems for count models. Randomized quantile residuals are also used in the DHARMa vignette that you cite in your question. References Dunn PK, Smyth GK (1996) Randomized quantile residuals.
