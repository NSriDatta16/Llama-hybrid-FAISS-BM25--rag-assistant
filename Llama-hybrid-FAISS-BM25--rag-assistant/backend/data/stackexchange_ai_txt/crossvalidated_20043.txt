The variance increases as $\Theta$ moves away from zero because the variability of $e_{t-1}$ starts coming into play for the observation at time $t$, increasing the overall variability of $d_t$ around 0. The process is smoother than white noise, but "smoother" doesn't mean "less variable". It refers to the visual appearance of the time series plot. (You can formalize it mathematically, but let's not go there in this heuristic explanation.) Consider a sine function over $(0, 2\pi)$ - it's pretty smooth, right? Now consider a plot of 1000 Normal variates with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.1, evenly spaced over $(0, 2\pi)$. Much rougher, but still a lot less variable.
