If $\mathfrak R$ denotes the (non-trivial) support of the target distribution, $\pi(\cdot)$ , i.e. $$\int_{\mathfrak R}\pi(x)\,\text dx = 1,$$ and if $q(x,x^\prime)$ is the density of the proposal distribution, "rejecting all samples outside the prior support without appending them to the chain" ${}^1$ means simulating from $q(x,x^\prime)$ until $x^\prime\in\mathfrak R$ , i.e., simulating from $q(x,x^\prime)$ restricted to $\mathfrak R$ , with density $$q(x,x^\prime)\big/\mathbb P(X^\prime\in\mathfrak R|x)$$ Therefore the acceptance probability should be $$ \dfrac{\pi(x^\prime)}{\pi(x)} \times \dfrac{q(x^\prime,x)}{q(x,x^\prime)}\times\dfrac{\mathbb P(X^\prime\in\mathfrak R|x)}{\mathbb P(X\in\mathfrak R|x^\prime)}$$ Unfortunately the probabilities $\mathbb P(X^\prime\in\mathfrak R|x)$ and $\mathbb P(X\in\mathfrak R|x^\prime)$ are generally intractable (but can be estimated by unbiased estimators, leading to a pseudo-marginal resolution). ${}^1$ which I understand as rejecting proposals outside the prior support $\mathfrak R$ without duplicating the current value of the Markov chain.
