Is it better to discuss issues in the tracker, or the mailing list?

The book, Producing Open Source Software , suggests that it's better to have lengthy discussions in the mailing list, rather than in the issue tracker, for these reasons: More developers can see the discussion, so we're more likely to get valuable input. Mailing lists are designed specifically for conversations, issue trackers are less so. However, I see these disadvantages: Once discussion has started in the issue tracker it's difficult to persuade people to start using the mailing list (even if you start the thread for them, and paste the link). People who are not interested in the issue will receive emails, but then again, this is just the nature of mailing lists. So is it better to draw attention to the issue's tracker page via the mailing list (so that people may comment there), or, is it better to try and persuade people to use the mailing list instead?
