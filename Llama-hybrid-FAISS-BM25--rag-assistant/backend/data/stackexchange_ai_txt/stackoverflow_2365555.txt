Are you sure you know what you really need? You requested the code that would store the register value into the memory allocated by malloc ("pointed to by a pointer"), i.e. *(int*) storage location, yet you accepted the answer that stores (or at least attempts to store) the value into the pointer itself, which is a completely different thing. To store eax into the memory "pointed to by a pointer", i.e. into *(int*) storage as you requested, you'd have to do something like that mov edi, dword ptr storage mov dword ptr [edi], eax (I use the "Intel" right-to-left syntax for assembly instructions, i.e. mov copies from right operand to left operand. I don't know which syntax - right-to-left or left-to-right - your compiler is using.) Note also that in mov edi, dword ptr storage the dword ptr part is completely optional and makes no difference whatsoever.
