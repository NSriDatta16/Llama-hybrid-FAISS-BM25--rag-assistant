Let's start from the goal - the goal of game development is to create entertaining product. It should be accurate to the extend that it looks good and runs smoothly. The goal of a business software solution is to model a work process. It should be a tool which works fast enough. A stable product, which executes absolutely accurately and secure the tasks it should do. Since we target different goals, we use different approaches to build a game and a business software. Let's move to the requirements. For a game, the requirements are determined by the game designer. For a software product the business defines the process and the requirements. For a game the requirements are not final - shall we have small cartoon figures or real human models - this does not matter for the game engine for example. But for a software product, the requirements should be strictly followed and cleared to the maximum possible detail before development. From the different requirements come different software design and development approach. For a game the performance and gameplay are critical and the qualiity of the graphics and sounds (for example) could be reduced just to be compatible with weaker hardware. Also the physical model could be simplified just to run smoother and improve the gameplay. For the business software everything should be exact and cutting features means that your product will not be as functional as designed anymore. For a game, the security is not important - there is no critical customer data which should be saved. For a business software a good security system should be supplied - starting from data encryption (while saving on data storage or transferring through network) moving through backup system and mentioning (but not last) the compatibility with previous versions. I could continue with other aspects but I guess this is already too much for one post...
