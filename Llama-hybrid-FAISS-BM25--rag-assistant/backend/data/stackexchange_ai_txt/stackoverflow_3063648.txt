How does Android development compare to iOS development for an experience iOS dev?

I know iPhone development fairly well. From personal experience, how hard would it be for me to get into Android? I am concerned less about code than I am about distribution of my software, given the fragmentation of the Android OS on compatible devices. EDIT: Thanks for all the great input so far. I just have one more point to clarify. How does app distribution work in terms of carriers, app stores and how do I get my money from sales? Does Google or the Carrier handle it? Do I need to process credit cards myself? EDIT2: One last question. Does the Android App store tell the developer how many times the app was downloaded?
