A use case diagram contains one use case. In RUP, there's a use case domain model that displays the relationship between the different use cases. In a use case, you can also include and extend other use cases, which also displays a certain relationship between use cases. RUP stands for Rational Unified Process, it's a widely used development process, especially in a bit more formal organisations. It makes heavy use of UML diagrams. http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process
