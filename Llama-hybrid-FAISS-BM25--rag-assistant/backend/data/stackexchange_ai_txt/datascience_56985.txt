Feature selection before or after applying filter in Time-series forecasting

I'm predicting ozone concentration based on meteorological variables and ozone value of the previous day. I applied savitzky golay filter to get rid of noise in the time-series dataset. My question is, if I want to perform feature selection, do I do it before or after applying the filter? What is the logical order? Because the feature importance is different before and after applying the filter. Using XGBOOST, this is the feature importance before the filter: And this is after the filter: I'd really be grateful for any help or information.
