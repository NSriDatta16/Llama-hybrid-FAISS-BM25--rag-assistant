Is Java EE web development suitable for small start-up (with less human resource) looking to develop an web application ? Yes, I worked in a startup where I was the only full time programmer. What kind of difficulties may arise in Java EE web development, deployment & maintenance ? The same as in any other web development shop. Of course, the problems have their Java flavor. For instance, one bug we discovered was caused by different minor version of JDK used on the live system than on our test system. What kind of things should be kept in mind/ considerations to be made when moving from PHP background to Java ? Do not code the PHP way. Java's strength is OOP and its many libraries/ open source frameworks. Use that. Why Java web applications are not so popular today? ( or in case I perceived it wrongly, please list any major deployments beside linkedIn and ebay) I don't know why you think that, but Java is used everywhere. It is one of the few languages that Google officially uses. They use PHP as well, but it has a "lower" status. and Finally, What are some of the most important things to learn before starting web development in Java EE ? Use Java's strong points which I mentioned above. Updated after comment I cannot make the choice for you. If you are in doubt and in a big hurry you should not go with Java. This is common sense. However, it is an opportunity for your team to learn and grow. Maybe there is a PHP/other client for Cassandra. I knew a former PHP programmer in a startup, who switched to Java. Not saying anything bad about PHP programmers in general, but he did all kinds of strange things, such as not leveraging the power of Java web frameworks and writing lots of procedural code mixed with HTML and SQL. Obviously there are lots of Java programmers who would do the same thing. The point is that your team will probably learn new ways to do things and benefit from it in the future.
