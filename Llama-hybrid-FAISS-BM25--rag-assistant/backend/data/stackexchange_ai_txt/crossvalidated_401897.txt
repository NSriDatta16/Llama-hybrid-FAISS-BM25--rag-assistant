What model should I use? Time series count data grouped into provinces. R

I have daily observations on the count of a variable, with 1,000 daily observations across 15 different provinces, for a total of 15,000 observations. On certain days, there is an exposure, which may decrease or increase the count. I am interested in estimating the effect of the exposure. What is an appropriate model? I have so far tried a multilevel generalized model (lme4), with a poisson distribution and random effects for provinces (to capture spatial autocorrelation) and weeks (to capture temporal autocorrelation), together with the exposure variable and a few control variables. Is this a viable approach? What alternatives do I have? Further information: The exposure variable is generally 0 but is 1 for some provinces on some days (usually for 3-30 consecutive days). I have very no control variables currently, because there is no data available. My reasoning was that the random effects for provinces and weeks would capture a fair amount of the unobserved variation.
