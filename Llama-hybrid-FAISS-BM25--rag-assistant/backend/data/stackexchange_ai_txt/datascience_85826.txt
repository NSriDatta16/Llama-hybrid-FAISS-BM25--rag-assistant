You can make the same question with every Machine Learning algorithm, and still the answer will remain very similar. What's the advantage of Linear regression over Decision Trees? To answer this you could define them mathematically. In your case, the mathematical definition seems easy: weighted mean or geometric mean. When do any model works better by any other model? Give it a try in cross-validation. Sadly, scientific methodology in Machine Learning is done by try and error. Saying what will be the value of an hyperparameter previous to fitting the model is un reliable. You "prove" that an algorithm works in ML when you run it to through a set of datasets and it performs better than the rest. Coming back to your question, what happens in kaggle tends to be the most technical advanced thing. So if its there, its worth giving it a try.
