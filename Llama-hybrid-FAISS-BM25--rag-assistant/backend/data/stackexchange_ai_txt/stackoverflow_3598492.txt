Web application in SVG, performance issues and viability

We are a new startup that is going to develop a web app for the Fashion industry. We were thinking of going with canvas (are not bothered about IE support) but now after reading about Raphaeljs and jQuerySVG, we are intrigued as to the possibilities of building the entire interface & units in SVG. Here are the advantages that come to my mind: resolution independent ability to zoom the items and retain the shape and look browsers optimization coming on the way us not having to draw everything in canvas, we can make use of co-ordinates to draw the units (items) no need to learn XML; easy to learn and use? SVG is quite broad so should comfortably handle various design shapes like canvas, we can use HTML5 & CSS3 features alongside SVG (drag 'n drop, advanced CSS3 effects), even jquery effects as we are not going to make use of any complicated 3d rendering, so presumably there should not be too much of a performance hit with full screen vectors? Would love to hear your comments based on past experience as to the viability of SVG being used for an entire web application render. We have looked into canvas for almost two weeks and are convinced we can get all our needs from it but if SVG can do the same, it would be awesome and actually preferred(?). Cheers
