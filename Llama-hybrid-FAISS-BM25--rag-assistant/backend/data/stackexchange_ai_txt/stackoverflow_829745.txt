DeleteOnNull (Association attribute) for Linq to SQL in custom class?

Is it possible to add the "DeleteOnNull=true" on a custom class instead of modifying the DBML (generated) class directly? For example, let's say this is a part of my generated dbml class: [Table(Name="OrderDetails")] public partial class OrderDetail : INotifyPropertyChanging, INotifyPropertyChanged { // deleted for brevity [Association(Name="Order_OrderDetail", Storage="_Order", ThisKey="OrderId", OtherKey="OrderId", IsForeignKey=true, DeleteOnNull=true)] public Order Order { get { /* deleted */ } set { /* deleted */ } } } So is it possible to put the "DeleteOnNull=true" on a separate class? Is it is? How? I have tried the following without any luck: [MetadataType(typeof(OrderDetailMetadata))] public partial class OrderDetail { internal sealed class OrderDetailMetadata { [Association(DeleteOnNull = true)] public object Order; } }
