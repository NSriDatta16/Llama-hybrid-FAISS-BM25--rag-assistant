Exchangeability and data smoothing

If a non-i.i.d sequence of a continuous random variable that is exchangeable, is smoothed by taking rolling average, is the resulting sequence exchangeable? My intuition suggests that it is not. I'll appreciate solid explanations. EDIT: My first question was about non-i.i.d data but I am wondering if exchangeability will hold on data smoothing even for i.i.d?
