The heavy tails arise because in small samples, standard errors near zero have appreciable chances of arising and they are not associated with concomitantly small sample means that would cancel them out in the Student t statistic. To appreciate this, consider small samples from a uniform distribution (which produces no extreme values of any kind). Here, from a simulation of samples of size two, are plots of the absolute value of the mean $|m|$ and standard error $se:$ The points in the scatterplot are colored according to the inverse slopes, $t = m/se,$ which are the Student t statistics. The contour lines of constant slope are, of course, lines through the origin. Near the base the inverse slopes are nearly infinite. Notice the pattern: Large standard errors are associated with "typical" sample means (near $1/2$ ), where (accordingly) $t$ is not large. Conversely, the only way for $t$ to grow large is along the base of the triangle away from the origin where (a) the standard error is tiny but (b) the mean is not tiny. This picture is not peculiar to the uniform distribution: it's just plainer than the Normal case, shown next. (The horizontal line in the scatterplot is the expected standard error $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ you would use for a Z statistic.) As is well known, the standard error is uncorrelated with the mean. Nevertheless, it is still the case that The only way for $t$ to grow large (with any appreciable probability) is along the base of the triangle away from the origin at its center where (a) the standard error is tiny but (b) the mean is not tiny. That is, the heavy tails of the Student t distribution arise from the chance that a $(m, se)$ pair will be situated near the bottom left or bottom right of the scatterplot. In those cases the division by a near-zero standard error yields a huge value of the Student t statistic. In retrospect, this is obvious in samples of size 2, because there's a $1/2\times 1/2=1/4$ chance that both values in a sample will have the same sign. Because they have the same sign, likely they are closer together than your average sample: there are your principal contributions to the heavy tails. The effect holds in large samples but quickly fades away once it's unlikely for the entire sample to have a small range.
