Using LibSVM for One-Class-Classification

Why do the same instances, in training and testing, get classified as unknown in LibSVM? I'm using the linear kernel function nu=0.1, gamma=0.1 Here is the instance that is in both the training and testing set, yet is coming back as a unknown (-1) '0.00084 ','72 ','1 ','0',LEDs The first value corresponds to the inter arrival time of a packet of a WiFi LED Bulb, the second value is its framelength, the third is its datarate, and the fourth is its MCS index.
