How do I calculate prediction intervals for random forest predictions?

In regression problems random forests yield a prediction for each case by averaging the results of each single tree in the forest. I would like to draw a 95% prediction interval around each prediction. There is a nice option interval="prediction" for the prediction method of linear models, but there's no such thing for random forests (at least in the R package randomForest). Can I presume that the casewise predictions of the single trees are normally distributed and apply the formula http://mathurl.com/bbvuvx9 or should I determine it by bootstrapping? If so, how can this be done?
