I managed to come up with an example where a connection exists. It seems to depend heavily on my choice of loss function and the use of composite hypotheses though. I start with a general example, which is then followed by a simple special case involving the normal distribution. General example For an unknown parameter $\theta $, let $\Theta$ be the parameter space and consider the hypothesis $\theta\in\Theta_0$ versus the alternative $\theta\in\Theta_1=\Theta\backslash\Theta_0$. Let $\varphi$ be a test function, using the notation in Xi'an 's The Bayesian Choice (which is sort of backwards to what I at least am used to), so that we reject $\Theta_0$ if $\varphi=0$ and accept $\Theta_0$ if $\varphi=1$. Consider the loss function $$ L(\theta,\varphi) = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if } \varphi=\mathbb{I}_{\Theta_0}(\theta) \\ a_0, & \mbox{if } \theta\in\Theta_0 \mbox{ and }\varphi=0\\ a_1, & \mbox{if } \theta\in\Theta_1 \mbox{ and }\varphi=1. \end{cases} $$ The Bayes test is then $$\varphi^\pi(x)=1\quad \rm if\quad P(\theta\in\Theta_0|x)\geq a_1(a_0+a_1)^{-1}.$$ Take $a_0=\alpha\leq 0.5$ and $a_1=1-\alpha$. The null hypothesis $\Theta_0$ is accepted if $\rm P(\theta\in\Theta_0|x)\geq 1-\alpha$. Now, a credible region $\Theta_c$ is a region such that $\rm P(\Theta_c|x)\geq 1-\alpha$. Thus, by definition, if $\Theta_0$ is such that $\rm P(\theta\in\Theta_0|x)\geq 1-\alpha$, $\Theta_c$ can be a credible region only if $\rm P(\Theta_0\cap\Theta_c|x)>0$. We accept the null hypothesis if an only if each $1-\alpha$-credible region contains a non-null subset of $\Theta_0$. A simpler special case To better illustrate what kind of test we have in the above example, consider the following special case. Let $x\sim \rm N(\theta,1)$ with $\theta\sim \rm N(0,1)$. Set $\Theta=\mathbb{R}$, $\Theta_0=(-\infty,0]$ and $\Theta_1=(0,\infty)$, so that we wish to test whether $\theta\leq 0$. Standard calculations give $$\rm P(\theta\leq 0|x)=\Phi(-x/\sqrt{2}),$$ where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal cdf. Let $z_{1-\alpha}$ be such that $\Phi(z_{1-\alpha})=1-\alpha$. $\Theta_0$ is accepted when $-x/\sqrt{2}>z_{1-\alpha}$. This is equivalent to accepting when $x\leq \sqrt{2}z_{\alpha}.$ For $\alpha=0.05$, $\Theta_0$ is therefore rejected when $x>-2.33$. If instead we use the prior $\theta\sim \rm N(\nu,1)$, $\Theta_0$ is rejected when $x>-2.33-\nu$. Comments The above loss function, where we think that falsely accepting the null hypothesis is worse than falsely rejecting it, may at first glance seem like a slightly artifical one. It can however be of considerable use in situations where "false negatives" can be costly, for instance when screening for dangerous contagious diseases or terrorists. The condition that all credible regions must contain a part of $\Theta_0$ is actually a bit stronger than what I was hoping for: in the frequentist case the correspondence is between a single test and a single $1-\alpha$ confidence interval and not between a single test and all $1-\alpha$ intervals.
