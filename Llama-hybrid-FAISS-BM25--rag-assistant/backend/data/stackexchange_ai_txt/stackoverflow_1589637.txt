When choosing data structures you are trading off factors such as speed of retrieval v speed of update how well the structure copes with worst case operations, for example insertion of records that arrive in a sorted order space wasted I would start by reading the Wikipedia articles referenced by Robert Harvey. Pragmatically, when working in languages such as Java the average programmer tends to use the collection classes provided. If in a performance tuning activity one discovers that the collection performance is problematic then one can seek alternative implementations. It's rarely the first thing a business-led development has to consider. It's extremely rare that one needs to implement such data structures by hand, there are usually libraries that can be used.
