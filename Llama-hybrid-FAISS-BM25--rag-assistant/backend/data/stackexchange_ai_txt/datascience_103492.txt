PCA will generate „new“ (transformed) features which are orthogonal (non-correlated). However, since the original features are transformed, you can hardly claim to say a lot about the importance of (original) features based on PCA. One obvious alternative would be to use a random forest (RF) to determine feature importance . Using tree based models (like RF or tree based boosting) you do not need to care about collinearity in the feature space.
