How can I accept gzip-compressed content using LWP::UserAgent?

I am fetching some pages over the Web using Perl's LWP::UserAgent and would like to be as polite as possible. By default, LWP::UserAgent does not seamlessly handle compressed content via gzip. Is there an easy way to make it do so, to save everyone some bandwidth?
