How does one explain what an unbiased estimator is to a layperson?

Suppose $\hat{\theta}$ is an unbiased estimator for $\theta$. Then of course, $\mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta} \mid \theta] = \theta$. How does one explain this to a layperson? In the past, what I have said is if you average a bunch of values of $\hat{\theta}$, as the sample size gets larger, you get a better approximation of $\theta$. To me, this is problematic. I think what I'm actually describing here is this phenomenon of being asymptotically unbiased, rather than solely being unbiased, i.e., $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta} \mid \theta] = \theta\text{,}$$ where $\hat{\theta}$ is likely dependent on $n$. So, how does one explain what an unbiased estimator is to a layperson?
