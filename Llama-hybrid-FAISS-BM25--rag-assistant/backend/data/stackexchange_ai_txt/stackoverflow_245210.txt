A search turned up this article . I've pasted the relevant text below. Here's a forum post showing an example of prepared statements letting you assign a variable value to the limit clause: http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?98,126379,133966#msg-133966 However, I think this bug should get some attention because I can't imagine that prepared statements within a procedure will allow for any procedure-compile-time optimizations. I have a feeling that prepared statements are compiled and executed at the runtime of the procedure, which probaby has a negative impact on efficiency. If the limit clause could accept normal procedure variables (say, a procedure argument), then the database could still perform compile-time optimizations on the rest of the query, within the procedure. This would likely yield faster execution of the procedure. I'm no expert though.
