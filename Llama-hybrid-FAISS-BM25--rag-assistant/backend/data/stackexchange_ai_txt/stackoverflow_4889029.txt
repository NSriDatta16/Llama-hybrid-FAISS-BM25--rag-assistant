Retrieve email from twitter profile

Huh, after some searches on the net on how to retrieve user email address, the short answer is - there is no way. But, is there really no way of fetching user email? A hacky one or something? It's not meant for spamming or stuff like that, but, my application local user storage uses email as it's core ID, and I have to compare if that particular twitter account is already registered in database or not. I'm using this technique for facebook authentication and it works flawlessly, but client demands twitter login too, but I have no idea how could I compare it without looking at emails. P.S. I hope I've made myself clear enough, if not, don't hesitate to ask, this is actually pretty important at the moment. Thanks in advance!
