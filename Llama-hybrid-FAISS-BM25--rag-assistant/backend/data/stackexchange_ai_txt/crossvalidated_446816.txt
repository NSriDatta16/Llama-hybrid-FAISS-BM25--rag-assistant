Predict Future Progression of Time series Based on Set of Similar Time Series

I have recorded the download activity over time for multiple files (=observations). I have transformed the data to consist of the number of cumulated downloads at regular measurement intervals (e.g. hours or days). The observed files have been published at different points in time, i.e. there is missing data at the tail end. Example data: filename day0 day1 day2 day3 day4 day5 day6 file_01 10 15 18 21 22 22 23 file_02 13 19 22 23 24 24 file_03 11 16 18 20 21 file_04 15 22 26 28 Using the data of one file (e.g. file_04) as input, I would like to predict the likely progression of downloads based on the other files' downloads. What is a suitable statistical approach to do this? ++ EDIT/NOTE ++ The word "file" refers to the observed entity, not the way of storing the data. There is just one data set, each row containing the cumulative download numbers over time.
