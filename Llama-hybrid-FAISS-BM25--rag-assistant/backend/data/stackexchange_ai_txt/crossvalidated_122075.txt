Discrepancy between Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox Model

I have plotted Kaplan-Meier curves of survival times for cancer patients with above and below average levels of Copy Number Variation (CNV), and performed a log-rank test for each cancer type. I have also fit a univariate Cox Model for each cancer type, with CNV levels as the variable. There are several cancers which reach statistical significance in the Cox Model and not for the Kaplan-Meier curves. There is one cancer where the situation is vice-versa. What could be causing this effect and which test should I trust?
