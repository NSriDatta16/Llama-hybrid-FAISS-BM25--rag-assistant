Analysis of only one of the clusters found?

I conducted a Cluster Analysis (CA) on my data and found 3 clusters that make theoretical sense. The average silhouette width is low (0.1), which according to Kaufman & Rousseeuw (1990) is interpreted as "no structure". However, the first cluster's silhouette width is 0.75 (Strong structure), but the other 2 have a low silhouette width - thus receiving a low ASW. I want to analyze the clusters on my covariates (gender, age, etc.), for example, see if women use different cluster types than men. My question:Can I only use the first cluster type for my covariate analysis, and disregard the other two?
