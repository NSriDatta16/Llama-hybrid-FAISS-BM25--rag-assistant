There are several important interfaces for data-binding; in particular, IBindingList , which has the ListChanged event that DataGridView can listen for. Is it possible to change the concrete list to a BindingList ? That should give you most of this for free? You don't need to change the return type, as BindingList : IList , and DataGridView only knows about the actual object (it doesn't care that you call it IList ). The other pragmatic option is simply to reset the data-binding on the DataGridView - perhaps set the DataSource to null and then back: object tmp = grid.DataSource; grid.DataSource = null; grid.DataSource = tmp; // low-tech data-source reset
