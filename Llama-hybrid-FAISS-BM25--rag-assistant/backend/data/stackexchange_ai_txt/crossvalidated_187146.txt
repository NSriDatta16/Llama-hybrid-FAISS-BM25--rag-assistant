There are a few ways to evaluate this. First, you could run your model with priors that make no assumptions as to the relationship between $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\theta_3$, then examine the posterior distribution. You could also use model selection methods to compare the above model to one with a prior that explicitly assumes $\theta_1 > \theta_2 > \theta_3$ (this can be done using the sort() function in JAGS). While you suggest Bayes Factors, there is quite a variety of methods that would work well. WAIC is becoming a widely used method for Bayesian model selection, and it can be computed much more easily in JAGS than Bayes Factors. I would generally recommend going with the first option, but the second may be more valuable if you have a small amount of data.
