Drag-and-drop image gallery. When I was cutting my teeth on Win32 and MFC, this was one of my first projects. Pretty quickly I ported all my code into ActiveX controls. Then I rewrote the thing in Java. For kicks, I rewrote it again in pure Javascript. When I broke into .Net, I rewrote the thing again in C#. Last but not least, I used it as an exercise for learning Objective-C and UIKit. Why? It's a visually appealing toy, for one thing. It's nice to get instant gratification from your code, I think, and working with images is one of the most gratifying things I can think of.
