What is the best way to do loops in JavaScript

I have stumbled into several methods of looping in JavaScript, what I like the most is: for(var i = 0; i But as tested here ( http://www.robertnyman.com/2008/04/11/javascript-loop-performance/ ), it should probably be written so that the length is only calculated once. In jQuery there is a .each that you can stick a function. I like this a little better, because I don't have to type the array twice, like in the above solution. If JavaScript supported macros it would be a piece of cake to roll your own, but sadly it does not. So what do you guys use?
