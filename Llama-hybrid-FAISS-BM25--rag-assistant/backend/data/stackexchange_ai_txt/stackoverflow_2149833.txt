The feature data you mention (position, laplacian, size, orientation, hessian) is insufficient for your purpose (these are actually the less relevant parts of the descriptor if you want to do matching). The data you want to look at are the "descriptors" (the 4th argument): void cvExtractSURF(const CvArr* image, const CvArr* mask, CvSeq** keypoints, CvSeq** descriptors, CvMemStorage* storage, CvSURFParams params) These are 128 or 64 (depending on params) vectors which contain the "fingerprints" of the specific feature (each image will contain a variable amount of such vectors). If you get the latest version of Opencv they have a sample named find_obj.cpp which shows you how it is used for matching update : you might find this discussion helpful
