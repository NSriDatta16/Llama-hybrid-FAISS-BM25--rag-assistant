Hmm, sounds like a question many of us got asked at school when learning about Singletons. I'd suggest reading the following links. http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2006/01/20/singleton-inheritance.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/84eaw35x.aspx Many would strongly discourage inheriting from a singleton, but real-life programming often requires exactly such an approach. I personally would say, don't inherit from a singleton as a rule of thumb, but don't lock yourself into a design which blocks off such an approach. A pragmatic development approach is always the best approach...
