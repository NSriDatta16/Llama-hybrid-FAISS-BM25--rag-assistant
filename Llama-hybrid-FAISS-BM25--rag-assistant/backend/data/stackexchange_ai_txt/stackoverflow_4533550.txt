@Nawaz, your post is interesting, I never thought of this before. However, I believe the answer to your question is simple: think of C++ (or probably any language) security as a way to organize your code, rather than a police. Basically, since all the variables are defined in your own code, you should be able to access them ALL, no matter where you define them. So you shouldn't be surprised you found a way to access a private member. Actually, there is even an easier method to access private variables. Imagine you have a library with this class: class VerySecure { private: int WorldMostSecureCode; }; And let's say I am using your very secure class in my code. I can easily access the private member this way: VerySecury a; int *myhacker = (int*)(&a); int b = (*myhacker); printf("Here is your supposed world secret: %d :-) \n", b); How is that?!!
