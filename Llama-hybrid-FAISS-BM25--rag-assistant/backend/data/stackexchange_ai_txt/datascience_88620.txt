There are two parts to it. Does Keras means Tensorflow = Yes Does Tensorflow means Keras = No Keras is part of the TensorFlow API now. It was not so earlier From Keras official docs - Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research. Keras & TensorFlow 2 TensorFlow 2 is an end-to-end, open-source machine learning platform. You can think of it as an infrastructure layer for differentiable programming. It combines four key abilities: - Efficiently executing low-level tensor operations on CPU, GPU, or TPU. - Computing the gradient of arbitrary differentiable expressions. - Scaling computation to many devices (e.g. the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab, which spans 27,000 GPUs). - Exporting programs ("graphs") to external runtimes such as servers, browsers, mobile, and embedded devices. So, multiple things remain if you have to work on a large dataset/program Handling large dataset i.e. tf.data Distributed training, Performance tuning Tensorflow function, Graph, GradientTape TensorFlow serving i.e. post modeling stuffs Tensorflow for Browser, Edge, Mobile If modeling(only) is the point of discussion, you are good.
