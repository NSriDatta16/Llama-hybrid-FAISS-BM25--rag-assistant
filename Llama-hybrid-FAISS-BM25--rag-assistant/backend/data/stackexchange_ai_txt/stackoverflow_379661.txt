Good pattern or technique for webforms with 100s of fields

At my job, I have to implement web forms for loan applications with sometimes up to a hundred different input fields, and then save the application into the database for later retrieval. The person whom I replaced created a sql table with 100s of columns where each row represents a loan application and there is a column for every field. The problem with this is that I find myself having to type out the 100 fields a bunch of times, getting data from form, saving to database, retrieving from database, writing to output webform. And then whenever there is a change to the application, I have to make the change in quite a few places. So it can not only be cumbersome but error prone. Is there a good design pattern that handles this?
