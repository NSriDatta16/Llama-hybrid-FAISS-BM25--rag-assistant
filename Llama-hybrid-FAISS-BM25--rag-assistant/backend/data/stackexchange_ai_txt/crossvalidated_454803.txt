You can interpret the correlation as a measure of how well a straight line (linear relationship) fits the data. If you have a correlation of $\pm 1,$ then it is a perfect linear relationship. But what if the relationship is not linear? Here's an example: $$\operatorname{kinetic energy}=\frac{\operatorname{mass}\cdot\operatorname{velocity}^2}{2}.$$ A correlation between kinetic energy and velocity, particularly over a large interval, would likely be rather close to zero. However, the mutual information is quite large. So the concept of mutual information is more general, and can capture non-linear relationships, whereas correlation is merely a measure of mutual information if the relationship is linear . I say that. You can introduce a new feature, call it square-of-velocity, and then do a correlation with that new feature. The new relationship would be linear, and correlation would once again be a good way to measure the mutual information. Here's a more difficult one: $$Y=A\cos(\omega t+\theta). $$ Now the relationship between $Y$ and the phase angle $\theta$ is non-linear, and you cannot regain linearity by the definition of a new feature. Incidentally, I would encourage you to investigate Judea Pearl's concepts of causality in his book The Book of Why , and others. It will elucidate some of these ideas very clearly.
