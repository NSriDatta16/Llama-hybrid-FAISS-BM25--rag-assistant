The PHP error can be fixed like this (note the dot, it's used to "glue" the strings together): mysql_query("INSERT INTO stats VALUES (".$userAgent.")"); Also, you should do some SQL Injection protection, the user-agent string is user-defined (there are tools to modify it), so it needs to be sanitized. Further, the user-agent is a string so you need to put it in between single quotes. mysql_query("INSERT INTO stats VALUES ('" . mysql_real_escape_string($userAgent) . "')"); Another important thing would be error handling - echoing the error description is necessary to find bugs in your SQL syntax. mysql_query("INSERT INTO stats VALUES ('" . mysql_real_escape_string($userAgent) . "')") or die("MySQL Error: " . mysql_error());
