The problem is that for you are trying to apply the CLT, but you have no control over the rate of convergence. Your assumption that the CLT sufficiently applies so that the confidence interval is MLE +/- 1.96 * SD's is not true if you are getting a CI of (-0.1, 0.3). In fact, it is well known that CLT convergence in the binomial case is quite slow for p close to 0 and 1. Truncating the CI like you want will not result in a 95% CI. Either get more data so the CI is contained in [0,1] (for p close to 0 or 1, you'll need a lot of data, rates of convergence to the CLT are quite slow) or use a Bayesian technique.
