Passing Joda Time objects between the App layers

I'm considering using Joda-Time . I'm wondering if I should pay attention of what type of object my Interfaces are returning. Returning Joda-Time objects from my interface signature on the service layer means that every module that use it will have be dependent on Joda-Time instead of the common java.util.Date API. Are you passing Joda objects around your App modules or do you write wrappers in specific part of your app?
