Transforming a c# class into a visual control

I new to c# and windows form programming. Here is the problem i am trying to solve. I have to write an application that uses an multiple instance of an ActiveX control. Therefore, I dragged as many control as necessary to my Form. Now my problem is that i'd like to add some personalised methods to this activeX. The logical solution I thought was to create my own class derived from that aciveX and add some more members and methods to that class so it would work as desired. Now my problem is that the newly generated class doesn't exists as a control that can be inserted into the form. So How can a class become a control and then inserted into a form ?
