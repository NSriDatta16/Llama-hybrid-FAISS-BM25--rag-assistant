The csv.reader is not responsible for constructing the SQL statement whose fragment is being shown in the error message you posted -- some other part of your code must be the one that constructs this statement, and it's doing that in the wrong way. So don't think about csv.reader , but about what you do with the tuples it's returning to the rest of your code!-)
