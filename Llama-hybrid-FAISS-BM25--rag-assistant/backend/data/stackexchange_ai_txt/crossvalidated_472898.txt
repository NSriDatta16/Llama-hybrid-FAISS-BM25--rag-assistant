I am going to work this problem from the end to the beginning. When I make a suitable test on the salaries of the employees, should I take into account that I know that in general women earn less than men in the workplace's country? No. These are not analogous problems. You are assuming discrimination and you are likely going to land in Yule's paradox. It is not safe to assume that the wage differences are due to discrimination by sex. Imagine that you had a country with only three occupations. Two were white-collar jobs and the other was coal mining. Coal mining is dangerous. You would expect high wages. It is also a field women rarely enter into for a variety of reasons. You find that the country has a wage difference, however, there is no wage differential by occupation class. Within each of the three classes, there is no difference in average wages, but when the occupation is not considered there is. This is an area where the null hypothesis method shines because it does not assume discrimination, it must be shown. As the null hypothesis method is conservative due to insuring a maximum percentage of false positives, it is also a nice risk-averse tool. I worked at a place where the female employees were certain that there was wage discrimination. All salaries were tested by rank and the result was, in all categories, $\bar{x}_{female}>\bar{x}_{male}$ . It is dangerous to assume discrimination. Now as to your unfair coin problem, it would be problematic to solve. Presumably, your biased coins are homogenous, but what you are solving is difficult to define. What is your sample space? Twenty percent of your sample space would be made up of tosses where $\theta=.5$ , but eighty percent of your sample space would be made up of tosses where $0 . What would the sample made up of biased coins look like? Is the bias 50.0001 toward tails or 99.99999 toward tails? It also cannot be tested on the Bayesian side because the mass at $\theta=.5$ is zero because it has no width. In 96 occupations in the United States, women make significantly more than men, up to 40% more in some fields. If you assumed $\theta\le{.5}$ then you would miss that as they would show up as $.5$ because you have put zero mass at $\theta>.5$ . Some of those fields are very high paying, such as software engineering.
