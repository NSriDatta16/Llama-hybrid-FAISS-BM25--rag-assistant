Updates to App_Code or /bin/ always recycle your application pools I believe. If you're saying that you have a deployment scenario where .aspx.cs file updates do not recycle your application pool, and if you're able to refer to the page type itself, perhaps you can move your code into the .aspx.cs files so prevent the recycling from happening. That's may be an ugly choice though. One suggestion is to revise your design to reduce the number of source code updates that are required on a daily basis. Perhaps use XML or database storage, and design your application to be a little more generic, and less prone to binary updates. Or perhaps partition your application into several smaller virtual applications. The level of effort could be higher to do this, but in this case if your application is more compartmentalized, you won't have to recycle the entire app with each and every deployment. You'd only have to recycle the modules that were impacted with your deployment. Another suggestion might be to setup clustered server architecture. Schedule the deployments to apply to one cluster node, keeping only the other active while the scheduled update is occurring, and then roll out updates to the second node once the first node update is done the app pool recycled. Another suggestion would be to change your deployment times to less off-peak times, if that's feasible. Are the frequent updates happening just because there are a lot of development changes happening?
