The proper way is to declare variables exactly when they are first used and minimize their scope in order to make the code easier to understand. Declaring variables at the top of functions is a holdover from C (where it was required), and has absolutely no advantages (variable scope exists only in the source code, in the byte code all local variables exist in sequence on the stack anyway). Just don't do it, ever. Some people may try to defend the practice by claiming that it is "neater", but any need to "organize" code within a method is usually a strong indication that the method is simply too long.
