Some people like calling anything that uses data "learning". And in the hype cycle world of today, anything that is AI, ML, data science, or deep learning just sells much better than "mathematical optimization" which seems so 1970s or 1980s. I am not a big fan of this. It just adds more terms that cannot be distinguished well. I recommend to use the term "learning" only when you have an "input" and a "desired output" (e.g. class label). Methods like PCA and k-means then are not "learning".
