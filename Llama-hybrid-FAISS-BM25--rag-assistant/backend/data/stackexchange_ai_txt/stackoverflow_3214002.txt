Splitting a space separated list

This is a common task I'm facing: splitting a space separated list into a head element and an array containing the tail elements. For example, given this string: the quick brown fox We want: "the" ["quick","brown","fox"] .. in two different variables. The first variable should be a string, and the second an array. I'm looking for an elegant way to do this (preferably in Java).
