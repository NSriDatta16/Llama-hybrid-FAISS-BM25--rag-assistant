Is there any ranking neural network especially in R?

I know there are many neural network for classification and regression problems. I myself use caret package in R for those problem. But now I am looking for a neural network which can be used for ranking the prediction values. For example consider the widely used iris flower dataset which I myself used initially for my studies. The dataset has 50 samples of data for three species Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. Currently we can train this data set using any classification algorithm and predict a absolute result Sepal length Sepal width Petal length Petal width Predicted Species 5.1 3.4 1.4 0.3 I. setosa Instead of this absolute result I want a ranking with prediction accuracy with cut off (eg:>50% accuracy) Ranking Predicted Species 1 I. setosa(93%) 2 I. virginica (64%) 3 I. versicolor (43%) Can It be done using nerual network in R or any other machine learning system?
