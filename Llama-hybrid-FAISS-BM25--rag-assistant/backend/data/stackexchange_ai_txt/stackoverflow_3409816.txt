I'm the author of the post you linked to. Wrikken is correct, the content after the named anchor is not sent to the server unless something has mangled the URL along the way. On the client side, you need some JavaScript like this in your landing page to redirect the swfaddress links to corresponding URLs on another domain: var re = new RegExp('#(.*)'); var redirectFragment = re.exec(document.location.toString()); if (redirectFragment!=null) { document.location = 'http://new.html-site.com'+redirectFragment[1]; }
