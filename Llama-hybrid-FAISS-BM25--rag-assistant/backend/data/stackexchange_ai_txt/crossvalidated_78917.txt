First of all, I will give you a comparison between median and average. We say that the median is more "robust" to outliers than the mean. To get an idea of what robust means, consider the following data: 1, 1, 1, 2, 100. The median of this data is 1 with the obvious outlier 100 having the same effect on the median if it was 2 instead. The mean, however, is 21.2 and the value of 100 in the data had a large effect on calculating the mean. Now, in your case I would calculate confidence intervals. A 95% Confidence intervals has the following interpretation: if one calculates confidence intervals for independent samples which are taken repeatedly from the same population then 95% of the intervals will include the unknown true mean arrival time. If you're unsure about how to calculate confidence intervals, in this case you would likely use a confidence interval for a Student's t distribution which you can read about here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student 's_t-distribution#Confidence_intervals
