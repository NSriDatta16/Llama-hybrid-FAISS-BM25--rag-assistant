You are comparing two rates. You should reorganize your data, $X_i$ isn't really a predictor, it is also a response observed under other conditions (another time period.) So let $C=(Y_1, \dotsc, Y_n, X_1, \dotsc, X_n)^T$ , $P=(E_1, \dotsc, E_n, F_1, \dotsc, F_n)^T$ and let $\text{period}$ be the time period indicator. $n$ is the number of family names. Then a very simple model is mod0 but this does not represent the heterogeneity of effects of different names. So with $\text{names}$ as an $n$ -level factor, used as random, we get library(lme4) mod1 corresponding to your proposed model. Your null hypothesis is that the coefficient of $\text{period}$ is zero.
