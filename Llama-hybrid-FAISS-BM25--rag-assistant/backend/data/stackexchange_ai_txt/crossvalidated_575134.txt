Statistical test for forecast performance over multiple runs

Lets say I have a time series, create a training and test set, and I want to compare the predictive accuracy of two models, by measuring e.g. the mean absolute error (MAE) over the test set. I know that two sets of predictions can be compared with the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test or similar. In my case, I examine performance when a number of predictors is deleted (set at 0) from test set. My process is: I randomly sample a number of observations from the test set and set a number of predictors at 0, derive predictions for both models, and estimate the MAE. The process is repeated $N$ times, which leads to $N$ MAEs for each model. Which type of statistical test is appropriate to compare the two models? Is it valid to take the raw losses over the $N$ modified test sets and apply a DM test?
