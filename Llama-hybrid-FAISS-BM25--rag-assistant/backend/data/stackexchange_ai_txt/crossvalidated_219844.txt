Time series forecasting generally refers to numerical rather than categorical variables. They are also generally used with longer timeframes - based on what I can see, your dataset extends from 1970 to 2015 at the most. You could do some simple visualizations for a starter, to see if there are any obvious patterns. For example, you could consider creating a line graph for each topic. Count the number of times each topic appears in each 5-year interval (4 times for topic 3 in 1990, based on what I can see) and then look at how that changes over time. You could also transform your categorical variables into numerical ones by turning them into percentages, such as the percentage of journals that were about a specific topic. That would allow you to use more statistical methods (such as ARIMA / ARCH).
