How FlurryAgent.onPageView() works?

I'm testing Flurry on a simple Android app that has just a single Activity. I call the FlurryAgent.onPageView(); from the Activity's onCreate method. Is this the correct way to count page views? Also, I can't find the PageView report on http://dev.flurry.com/ , where is it? Thanks, Giacomo
