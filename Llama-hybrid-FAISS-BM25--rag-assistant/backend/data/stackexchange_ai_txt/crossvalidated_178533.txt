Bayesian analysis and Lindley's paradox?

I have this problem I am trying to wrap my head around that my friend's professor created. Can anyone give me some hints on how to get started, particularly in parts b and c? I have an understanding of conjugate priors and Driac function but have no idea how to apply it here. For part a) I calculated the answer 0.634. For b and c, I am kind of struggling to get started.
