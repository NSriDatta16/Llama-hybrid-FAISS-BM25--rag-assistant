On page 228 in this book on Survival Analysis by Liu et. al. the formula for the scaled Schoenfeld residual for observation i and covariable m is described as: $$ r_{im}^{\text{scaled schoen}} = \frac{r_{im}^{schoen}(\beta_m)}{V(\beta_m, t_i)} $$ Where $V(\beta_m, t_i)$ describes the variance of the coefficient for the variable $X_m$. This is estimated via the observed Fisher-Information-Matrix that you presumably already calculated in the Fisher-Scoring-step for the estimation of the coefficients (negative 2nd derivative of Partial log-Likelihood w.r.t. all coefficients). I think, intuitively this makes sense, as you scale the Schoenfeld residuals by the variance of the coefficient of interest. I am looking forward to your response on that - hope this short paragraph helps!
