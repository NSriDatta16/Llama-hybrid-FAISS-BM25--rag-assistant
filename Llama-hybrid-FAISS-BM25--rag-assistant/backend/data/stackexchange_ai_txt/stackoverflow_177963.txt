The problem is as soon as your struct/class is not extern "C", C++ compilers are free to rearrange and optimize the layout of your struct/class, so you might end up with an reordered struct depending on your compiler. There are preprocessor (e.g. #pragma pack) flags for C like behaviour, but they are not portable in most cases.
