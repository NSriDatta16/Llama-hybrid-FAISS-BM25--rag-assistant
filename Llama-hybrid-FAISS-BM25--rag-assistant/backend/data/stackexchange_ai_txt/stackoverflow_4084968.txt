Calling def in Ruby for exporting CSV

I currently have some code which iv used to export a table from the data I have require 'fastercsv' def dump_csv @users = User.find(:all, :order => "lastname ASC") @outfile = "members_" + Time.now.strftime("%m-%d-%Y") + ".csv" csv_data = FasterCSV.generate do |csv| csv 'text/csv; charset=iso-8859-1; header=present', :disposition => "attachment; filename=#{@outfile}" flash[:notice] = "Export complete!" end my question is how do I call it from my view and will this work with will_pagination. I know FasterCVS creates tables using the ActiveRecord so will_paginiation wont be of any use when trying to organize the table.
