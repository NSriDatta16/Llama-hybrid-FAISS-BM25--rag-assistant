How to visualize a lot (>1k) of time spans?

I want to graph some data, containing of an event ID and a date (minimum required resolution is one day). every event ID has multiple dates connected to it, so the min and max date give me a time span. Another useful information would be where in time most of these events took place (like a density graph over this time span). The problem is, that i have about 1500 different events, with each more than 100 dates connected. In sum i have 1.1 million event/date pairs. (the whole data set is much larger: 200k events with an average of 10 dates) Are there any good ways to visualize this data? I tried using dot-plots, but it is more a mess and you see more a black wall than any thing else. If there is no such solution i can break down the data into smaller chunks, but for example the top 10 events (having the most dates connected) sum up to 500k tuples. If you have concrete examples in ggplot2 or D3.js it would be perfect! This is an image, how a scatter plot of start date vs end date for the top 1500 events look like. The problem is that most of the events have the same (or similar) span. This is the same plot, but with more data. As you can see, the less common events have shorter span. Also the same data as in the last plot, but with a marker for the count of dates inside the span. As you can see there are two big blobs and the rest is quite small. now a scatter plot for all the data, you can clearly see there is a line with lots of events with only one date and as last image, this is the whole data set as density2d: and the same for all events with more than 10 dates: The problem with the last two plots is, that they do not count the occurences inside the span. they just show me where a lot of time spans are. How can i put the count of events inside the time span also into this calculation?
