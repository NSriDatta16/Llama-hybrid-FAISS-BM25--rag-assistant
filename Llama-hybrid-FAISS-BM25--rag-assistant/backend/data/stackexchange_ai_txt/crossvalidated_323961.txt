How to define multiple losses in machine learning?

I'm using TensorFlow for training CNN for classification. In machine learning, there are several different definitions for loss function. In general, we may select one specific loss (e.g., binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification, hinge loss, IoU loss for semantic segmentation, etc.). If I took multiple losses in one problem, for example: loss = loss1 + loss2 Does this belong to multi-task learning or multi-objective optimization? Should we add some trainable linear weights for the loss? loss = a*loss1 + (1-a)*loss2
