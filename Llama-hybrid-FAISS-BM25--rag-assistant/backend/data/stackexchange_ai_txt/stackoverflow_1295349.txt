Utilizing Console Interfaces for Hg, SVN or git

I've been spending a lot of time utilizing Mercurial . On windows, I've been using TortoiseHg and on Linux and Mac OS X, I've been (forced) to use the console interface. After spending time with the console utilities, I find (to my surprise) that I do like them. But, most of my usage has been superficial. I've been doing basic clones, pulls and merges with the rare but occasional commit. I've not done any heavy lifting with it. What I'm curious about is if regular users use the console interface of tools like Mercurial, SVN and/or git for real world, day-to-day development? Until now, I've never given the console program of SVN much thought -- I've always used TortoiseSVN . I realize that there is no real answer to this question (Hence, it's community wiki) but I thought other real-world insight would be beneficial. If others have successfully used these console programs, perhaps it's worth using them more. So, do you use the console programs on a regular day-to-day basis or do you only use them when you need to? Note: I do realize that people use the console programs. It is ridiculous to think they are not used. This question is focused on day-to-day use for average developers for average development. Average being that you generally use GUI interfaces and/or you are developing GUI applications.
