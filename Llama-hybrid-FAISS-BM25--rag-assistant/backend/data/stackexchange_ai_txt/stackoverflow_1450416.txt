The variables inside the brackets define the physical structure of your class. Those are the actual instance variables that store information. The stuff outside the brackets make up the class's interface — methods and properties. A property in and of itself does not reserve any storage space or affect any variable — it just declares a generic interface for accessing something. Remember that a property doesn't have to have an underlying instance variable — for example, the totalPrice property in a ShoppingCart class might dynamically sum the prices of all the items in the cart. Inside the implementation file, you tell the class how to actually do its work. For methods, obviously, you just supply an implementation. For a property, you can either provide accessor implementations yourself or ask it to synthesize accessors for an instance variable.
