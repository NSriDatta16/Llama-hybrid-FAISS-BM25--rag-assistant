Another option would be to create a temporary table, and use it to store all of your temporary variables CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp_vars( name varchar(64), value varchar(64), PRIMARY KEY (name) ); You could even create a stored procedure to manage everything, creating the table if it doesn't yet exist. One for retrieval and one for storage.
