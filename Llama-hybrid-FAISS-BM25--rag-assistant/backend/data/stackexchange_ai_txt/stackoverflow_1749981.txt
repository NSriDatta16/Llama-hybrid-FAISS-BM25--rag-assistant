Yes, your updated version looks okay - although I'd say you'd be better off storing a list in time order as well as the dictionary, to make life easier. I would strongly discourage you from using mutable structs though. Either use a class, or change the struct to be immutable. Example of making it a class: private class XmlMessage { public string Message { get; set; } public DateTime TimeRead { get; set; } } Example of making it an immutable struct: private struct XmlMessage { private readonly string message; private readonly DateTime timeRead; public string Message { get { return message; } } public DateTime TimeRead { get { return timeRead; } } public XmlMessage(string message, DateTime timeRead) { this.message = message; this.timeRead = timeRead; } } Of course you could make it an immutable class instead...
