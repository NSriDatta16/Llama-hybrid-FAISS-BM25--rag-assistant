A primary key is really a property of your domain model, and it uniquely identifies an instance of a domain object. Having a clustered index on a montonically increasing column (such as an identity column) will mean page splits will not occur, BUT insertions will unbalance the index over time and therefore rebuilding indexes needs to be done regulary (or when fragmentation reaches a certain threshold). I have to have a very good reason to create a table without a primary key.
