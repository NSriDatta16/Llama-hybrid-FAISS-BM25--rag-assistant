Since your outcome appears to be dichotomous in nature (absence or presence) and you have numerous predictors of interest, why not calculate unadjusted odds ratios by performing simple logistic regression between each of your potential predictor variables of interest with the outcome (1 = absence; 0 = presence, or vice versa). If your sample size permits (wide confidence intervals may deter you from doing this based on your sample size if it is too small), you could put all of the potential predictor variables of interest into a multivariable logistic regression and assess adjusted odds ratios for each of your predictors in relation to your outcome after controlling for all of the other predictor variables included in your model. I hope this helps!
