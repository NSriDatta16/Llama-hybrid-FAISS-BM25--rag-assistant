1. Traditional SVM Project point to higher dimensional space to separate two classes (initially inseparable in lower dimensional space) Find support vectors (on the edge of each class in feature space) Allow some soft margin for some points to lie in the region between support vectors (this is to avoid over-fitting) Final objective is to maximise the margin 2. One class SVM a. According to Sch√∂lkopf et al. Project point to a higher dimensional space Separate all the data points from the origin in the feature space using hyper-plane Unlike traditional svm where we use soft margin for smoothness, we use a parameter that fixes fraction of outliers in the data maximise the distance between the hyper-plane and the origin The points lying below the hyper-plane and closer to origin are outliers b. According to Tax et al. Project point to a higher dimensional space Separate all the data points from the origin in the feature space using hyper-sphere Like traditional svm where we use soft margin for smoothness minimise the volume of the hyper-sphere The points lying outside the hyper-sphere are outliers.
