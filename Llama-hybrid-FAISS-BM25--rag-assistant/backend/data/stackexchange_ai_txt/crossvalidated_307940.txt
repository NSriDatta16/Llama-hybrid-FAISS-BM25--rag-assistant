This question has likely been considered already on this forum. When you state that you "have the posterior distribution", what exactly do you mean? "Having" an available $-$ in the sense I can compute it everywhere $-$ function of $\theta$ that I know to be proportional to the posterior density, namely $$\pi(\theta|x) \propto \pi(\theta) \times f(x|\theta)$$ as for instance with the completely artificial target $$\pi(\theta|x)\propto\exp\{-\|\theta-x\|^2-\|\theta+x\|^4-\|\theta-2x\|^6-100\|\theta\|^5\},\ \ x,\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{18}\tag{1},$$ does not tell me what is the posterior expectation of a function of $\theta$ , e.g., $\mathbb{E}[\mathfrak{h}(\theta)|x]$ , posterior mean that operates as a Bayesian estimator under standard losses; the optimal decision under an arbitrary utility function, decision that minimizes the expected posterior loss; a 90% or 95% range of uncertainty on the parameter(s), a sub-vector of the parameter(s), or a function of the parameter(s), aka HPD region $$\{h=\mathfrak{h}(\theta);\ \pi^\mathfrak{h}(h)\ge \underline{h}\}$$ the most likely model to choose between setting some components of the parameter(s) to specific values versus keeping them unknown (and random). For instance, the fact that the rhs of (1) is known does not tell how to solve $$\int_{\mathcal H} \exp\{-\|\theta-x\|^2-\|\theta+x\|^4-\|\theta-2x\|^6-100\|\theta\|^5\}\,\text d\theta=\qquad\\0.95\int_{\mathbb R^{18}} \exp\{-\|\theta-x\|^2-\|\theta+x\|^4-\|\theta-2x\|^6-100\|\theta\|^5\}\,\text d\theta$$ and optimize over all such $\mathcal H$ 's. These items are only examples of many usages of the posterior distribution. In all cases but the simplest ones, one cannot provide answers by solely staring at the posterior distribution density as an available function and one need proceed through numerical resolutions like Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods .
