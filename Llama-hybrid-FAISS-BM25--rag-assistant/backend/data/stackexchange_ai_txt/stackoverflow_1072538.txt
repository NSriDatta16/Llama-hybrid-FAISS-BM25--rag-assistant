Neither XmlHttpRequests nor javascript frame manipulation work cross-domain these days; that would be sheer insanity. CSRF attacks these days usually consist of either the image tag like you mentioned or autogenerating a form that POSTs to another site. However, retrieving an anti-XSRF token (presumably a cryptographic nonce generated on a per-session basis) is next to impossible. Only if it's an exceedingly poor token that doesn't check the user session and IP address could a server-side language possibly be leveraged to retrieve it and then combine it with a client-side CSRF. Aside from tokens, plenty of people stop CSRF simply by checking the referrers and blocking all remote domains. Submitting CSRF with XmlHttpRequests is virtually impossible thanks to domain restrictions. At any rate, you don't have to worry about XmlHttpRequest being able to access a remote domain. The only time something like that could happen is if you have a XSS vulnerability, in which case, as EricLaw said, you're already hosed.
