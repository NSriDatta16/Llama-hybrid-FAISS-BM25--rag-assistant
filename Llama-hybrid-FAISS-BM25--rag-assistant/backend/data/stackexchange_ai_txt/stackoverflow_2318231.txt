I'm also curious on why you want to do this, but if you really have your reasons, you have at least two options: If you want to disable stack trace generation for your own Exception implementations, you can simply override the fillInStackTrace method: public static class MyException extends Exception { @Override public Throwable fillInStackTrace() { return this; } } If you want to disable it for all exceptions, you can use a byte code instrumentation agent to replace the fillInStackTrace method in the Throwable class. That will however only work for Java 6, since you in Java 5 are not allowed to replace a native method (fillInStackTrace) with a Java method using instrumentation.
