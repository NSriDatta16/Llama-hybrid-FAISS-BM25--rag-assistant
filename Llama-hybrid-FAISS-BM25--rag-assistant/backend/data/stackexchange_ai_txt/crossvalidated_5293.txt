Find out pseudo R square value for a Logistic Regression analysis

My name is Tuhin. I came up with a couple of questions when I was doing an analysis in R. I did a logistic regression analysis in R and tried to check how good the model fits the data. But, I got stuck as I could not get the pseudo R square value for the model which could give me some idea about the variation explained by the model. Could you please guide me on how to achieve this value (pseudo R square for Logistic regression analysis). It would also be helpful if you could show me a way to get the Hosmer Lemeshow statistic for the model as well. I found out a user defined function to do it, but if there is a quicker way possible, it would be really helpful. I would be very grateful if you can provide me the answers to my queries. Eagerly waiting for your response. Regards
