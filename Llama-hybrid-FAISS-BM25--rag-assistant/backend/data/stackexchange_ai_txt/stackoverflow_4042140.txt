CSS selector speed

According to new article from css-tricks there is a big difference between how you select your elements because they are selected from right to left. The article can be found here. http://css-tricks.com/efficiently-rendering-css/ I am about to create a page that have different documents on the same page: My question is, how should i go about the HTML for CSS efficiency or vise versa? Some heading Some paragraph Some heading Some paragraph There can be multiple of the same document type, i can therefore not use an ID. .document-type-1 h1 { } .document-type-1 p { } .document-type-2 h1 { } .document-type-2 p { } This will be "inefficient" since all p tags are found first... How would you go about it if this should be done faster and you should be able to move the same article to a new document type?
