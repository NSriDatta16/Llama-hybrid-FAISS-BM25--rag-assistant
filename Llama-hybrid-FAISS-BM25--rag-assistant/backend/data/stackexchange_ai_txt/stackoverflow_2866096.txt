Why not compute the average without the use of the AVG() function? For example: ([MEASURES].[MEASUREA] + [MEASURES].[MEASUREB] + [MEASURES].[MEASUREC]) / 3 Of course, this only works if this average will only ever consist of 3 measures. I would only really use the AVG() function if you needed to evaluate over a set: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms146067.aspx
