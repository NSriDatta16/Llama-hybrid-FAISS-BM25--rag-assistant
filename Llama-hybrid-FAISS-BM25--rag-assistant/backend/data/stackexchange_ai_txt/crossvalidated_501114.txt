Is there a way to know which feature is causing a split or present in root or decision node of a decision tree in Random Forest using Python?

Let's say I have 100 features f1, f2, .... ,f100 and I want to know if f3, f4, f5 caused any split or were present in a root/decision node of any decision tree in a random forest. I have close to 200 decision tree and I don't want to view each of these trees manually. I want to write a program in python which checks if f2, f3 or both are present in a tree and ultimately give me the number of trees they are present in. To be more illustrative, if i have 200 trees, i want to have information like f2 was present in 30 trees while f3 in 20 and so on.
