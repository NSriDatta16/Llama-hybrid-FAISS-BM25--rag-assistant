DOM methods and browser compatibility sites

Is there a site anywhere that documents all standard JavaScript DOM methods, events and properties and when they were introduced into the various browsers? I've used W3Schools' XML DOM Object Reference , but it's badly dated, it only tracks IE, Firefox, Opera and W3C, it's missing heaps of newer 'standard' methods, plus I'm certain I ran into something there that was wrong, but I can't remember what it was. Half the time I write something now, I'm never certain that the methods my code relies on have the coverage I expect and I don't have the resources to test in every version of every browser out there.
