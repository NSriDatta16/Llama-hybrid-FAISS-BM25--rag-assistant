jQuery has two methods called .toggle() . The other one [docs] does exactly what you want for click events. Note: It seems that at least since jQuery 1.7 , this version of .toggle is deprecated , probably for exactly that reason, namely that two versions exist. Using .toggle to change the visibility of elements is just a more common usage. The method was removed in jQuery 1.9 . Below is an example of how one could implement the same functionality as a plugin (but probably exposes the same problems as the built-in version (see the last paragraph in the documentation)). (function($) { $.fn.clickToggle = function(func1, func2) { var funcs = [func1, func2]; this.data('toggleclicked', 0); this.click(function() { var data = $(this).data(); var tc = data.toggleclicked; $.proxy(funcs[tc], this)(); data.toggleclicked = (tc + 1) % 2; }); return this; }; }(jQuery)); DEMO (Disclaimer: I don't say this is the best implementation! I bet it can be improved in terms of performance) And then call it with: $('#test').clickToggle(function() { $(this).animate({ width: "260px" }, 1500); }, function() { $(this).animate({ width: "30px" }, 1500); }); Update 2: In the meantime, I created a proper plugin for this. It accepts an arbitrary number of functions and can be used for any event. It can be found on GitHub .
