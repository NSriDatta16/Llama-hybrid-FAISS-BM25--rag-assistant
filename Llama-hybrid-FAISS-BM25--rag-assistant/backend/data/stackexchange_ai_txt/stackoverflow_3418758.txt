You could use a sub-select to get the next LogonDate, then determine the difference between them. SELECT a.PersonID, a.LogonDate, a.LoggedOnTime, (SELECT b.LogonDate FROM Agent_Logout AS b WHERE b.LogonDate > a.LogonDate ORDER BY b.LogonDate ASC LIMIT 1) AS NextLogonDate FROM Agent_Logout AS a If using MS SQL Server, remove LIMIT 1 and add TOP 1 here: SELECT TOP 1 b.LogonDate EDIT: Thanks to @JYelton for pointing out TOP 1 for MS SQL Server, and ORDER BY b.LogonDate ASC
