The question you may ask first is what defines "important feature". Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm, you need to specify a label first then the algorithm will tell you which feature is more important respect the given label . In other words, specifying different label will have different results for variable importance. Without using the label, algorithm such as PCA will define the variable that have large variance is important, which is another good starting point. This is intuitive because variable with large variance usually has more information and variable with zero variance means everyone is the same, and therefore this feature can be less useful.
