Yes. Simply remove the softmax function after the final layer or replace it with a Sigmoid, and your vanilla classification neural network becomes an object presence detection network. This transforms the problem from classification to multi-classification or regression, and multiple classes can be detected in an image in parallel without the requirement to predict only one or a fixed number of classes.
