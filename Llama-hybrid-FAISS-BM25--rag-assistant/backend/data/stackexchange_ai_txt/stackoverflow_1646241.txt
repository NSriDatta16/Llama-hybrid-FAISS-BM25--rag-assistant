Yes, the pragprog way is being agile. Many elements of the agile manifesto can be found in the pragmatic programmer book. Great examples of this include "there are no final decisions" and "code that glows in the dark". Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas (Ruby Dave) signed the agile manifesto. The main point I'd like to make is that few really experienced agile people put much stock in how "agile" anything is. Kent Beck was interviewed just a few weeks ago on the FLOSS podcast ( http://twit.tv/floss87 ) and it's clear from what he said and his tone of voice that the pioneer of extreme programming doesn't believe that the word "agile" carries much meaning these days in the industry. I have done lots of extreme programming and have find that everybody says they're "agile" - even people who didn't know what it meant five minutes ago. IMHO the term has become meaningless. It's a lot more clear cut whether a project follows the scrum rules or the extreme programming rules... I'd say pick a specific style because the "agile" umbrella term seems to mean less and less as time goes on.
