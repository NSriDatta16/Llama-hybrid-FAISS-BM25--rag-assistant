Core vector machine implementation

I came across the following article : http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume6/tsang05a/tsang05a.pdf , Core Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets. The approach looks very promising, however I have been unable to find any implementation of this method. Could anyone recommand me one ? If no such library exists, is there any good reason so few people got interested in it ?
