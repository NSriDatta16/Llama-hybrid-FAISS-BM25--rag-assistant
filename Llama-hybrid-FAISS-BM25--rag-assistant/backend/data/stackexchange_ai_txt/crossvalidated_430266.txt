Could someone help me to understand the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for discrete Markov Chains?

Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm Assume the Markov chain is in some state $X_{n} = i$ . Let $\textbf{H}$ be the transition matrix for any irreducible Markov chain on the state space. We generate $X_{n+1}$ via the following algorithm: (a) Choose a proposal state $j$ according to the probability distribution in the $i$ -th row of $\textbf{H}$ . (b) Compute the acceptance probability $\alpha_{ij} = \min\left\{1,\displaystyle\frac{\pi_{j}H_{ji}}{\pi_{i}H_{ij}}\right\}$ (c) Generate a uniform random number $U\sim\text{Uniform}(0,1)$ . If $U , accept the move and set $X_{n+1} = j$ . Otherwise, reject the move and keep $X_{n+1} = X_{n}$ . MY DOUBTS I know that Markov chains that are aperiodic and irreducible admit a stationary distribution. I also know that any distribution $\pi$ satisfying the reversibility condition is an equilibrium distribution. As far as I have understood, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm proposes a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is $\pi$ (the target distribution we are interested in sampling) and then simulate the Markov chain. However, I am a little bit lost as to the interpretation of the algorithm itself. Could someone interpret it step by step to me? I know such question is quite naive, but I am not able to understand it properly. Any help is appreciated.
