No process is going to help you improve what you do except actually getting everyone together and figuring out what is working and what isn't working. For the team I'm currently leading, we do this through a series of Retrospectives (of which I'd highly recommend this book ). The teams generally know what parts they want to improve - the trick is giving them the empowerment to actually measure and improve those things. Yes, you certainly still need someone looking at a Macro level. If you look at an organization like Toyota, they have a Chief Engineer who straddles that line between business and production (for a good explanation, see Scott Bellware's blog post ). In our organization we have someone similar - my boss was one of the initial developers of our product nearly 20 years ago, and stays highly active in the tech side, but is heavily invested in the customer side as well. My job is also to look at the teams as a whole to suggest improvements. To measure, we first make sure that any improvements we strive for are things our teams can actually change, and then use something akin to the SMART goals so that any improvements are measurable. We have a Big, Visible Wall which we post the notes from the retrospective on. This happens to also be where we hold our daily stand-ups, so it gives us focus on what is going on. For rolling up statistics to our executive meetings, we focus on code delivery - not lines of code delivered. I purposely kicked the team off measuring in nebulous units meaning that we don't report up that we worked x number of hours, or days, or whatever. What they do see is a trending chart of how well we are delivering our features and how we are improving. We'll also include interesting tidbits when the team feels they want to share it. The best part about all of this is that we can try things for a month, and then reevaluate it just 4 weeks later. This creates a much lower barrier to entry for trying new things, since the team knows that if it is impacting them, we'll either cancel it immediately, or we'll reevaluate and find better ways at the next retrospective. The bad part is that it isn't exactly what you are looking for. There isn't one metric or set of metrics we continually follow. We watch trends at all times, and measure the ones that we think are interesting - but only for a little bit, and only when the team is setting out to achieve a specific goal because of them. But in general, I'm quite happy with how it works, and I've seen a marked improvement in the involvement of the teams in improving the process. We aren't quite Kaizen , but we're getting better every day.
