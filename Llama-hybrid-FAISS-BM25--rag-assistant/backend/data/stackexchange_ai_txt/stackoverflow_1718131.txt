The UNIX way of doing this is to send email through the local mail-transfer-agent - simply invoking /usr/bin/mail is enough. The system administrator is responsible for configuring the local MTA to make sure email works properly. If you want to send email to the local user, just send it to their username - if they read their email somewhere other than locally, the MTA should be configured to forward it to them. If you just want to use the right "from" email address when sending email on behalf of a local user, so they get replies in the right place - again, just use their username. The MTA should be configured to do the right translation. This way of doing things is good, because it means that this configuration only has to be done in one place (the MTA), rather than having to manually configure every single application on the box that sends or recieves email.
