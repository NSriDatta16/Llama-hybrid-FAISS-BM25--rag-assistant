You can use multitouch in an image view and touch two points to mark the corners of the selection rectangle. You can then drag both fingers around to change the selection rectangle, and lock the selection when you lift one or both fingers. Another alternative is to put the image in a scrollview. Then zoom and pan the subview around inside the scrollview until the portion that just fits the full scrollview represents the selection. You can put the control buttons outside the scrollview, or have them fade out and fade back in after some amount of time after the user has stopped moving the selection around.
