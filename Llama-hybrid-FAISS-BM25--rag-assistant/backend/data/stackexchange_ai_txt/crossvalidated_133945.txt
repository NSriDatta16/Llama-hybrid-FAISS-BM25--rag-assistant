The U(0,âˆž) distribution does not exist, so you cannot use this notation. The notation $$p(\mu)\propto 1$$ signifies that the density of the prior distribution against the Lebesgue measure on $(0,\infty)$ is constant. There is no way one can set a specific constant value, since the density cannot be integrated, so the notation states that it can be any constant. The value of the constant does not and should not matter in any aspect of Bayesian inference. If it does you cannot use this constant prior.
