To be on the safe & elegant side, I would come up with unique identifiers (e.g. strings, or numbers) for my objects and pass them as mime objects. Resolving a string back into the corresponding object using QHashmap is fast enough for your purpose. The dirtiest (not recommended!) way would be that the identifier is the pointer address as int. If you pass mime data with user interaction, you never know where it goes. If the user drops your pointer onto another application's window, it should fullfill the user's expectations best. An application that gets a mangled up mime object and crashes for it is worst. An application that gets a descriptive string and enables the user to understand what he was dropping is probably best. I know that you can also, using the mime type, somewhat direct where the payload may be dropped and where not. the quintessence however is that you should stay within the mime concept . And that includes not passing a raw pointer.
