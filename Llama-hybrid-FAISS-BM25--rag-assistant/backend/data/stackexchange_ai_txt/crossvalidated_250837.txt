The random MCMC sample (of the difference of parameter values) is merely a high-resolution picture of the posterior distribution. The bigger the sample, the better is the picture. It can't ever become too high resolution in the sense of becoming inaccurate, so make your MCMC sample as big as you like. The only constraint is computer memory and processing. But how big is big enough? A larger MCMC sample will provide a smoother picture of the distribution, but there is always some degree of random "wobble" in the sample no matter how big. If your goal is to have a reasonably stable estimate of a credible interval such as a 95% highest density interval, then you need a large sample to get stable estimates of the tail densities. In DBDA2E (pp. 182-187) I recommend an effective sample size (ESS) of 10,000. ESS is different than the number of steps in an MCMC chain, but in your specific case rbeta generates independent steps and mcmcsize is essentially the same as ESS. Hope that answers the question you meant...
