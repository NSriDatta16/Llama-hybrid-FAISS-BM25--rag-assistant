If you have a reference to needle object why do you search for it? :) The problem domain and use-cases tell you that you do not need exact position of needle in a haystack (like what you could get from list.indexOf(element)), you just need a needle. And you do not have it yet. So my answer is something like this Needle needle = (Needle)haystack.searchByName("needle"); or Needle needle = (Needle)haystack.searchWithFilter(new Filter(){ public boolean isWhatYouNeed(Object obj) { return obj instanceof Needle; } }); or Needle needle = (Needle)haystack.searchByPattern(Size.SMALL, Sharpness.SHARP, Material.METAL); I agree that there are more possible solutions which are based on different search strategies, so they introduce searcher. There were anough comments on this, so I do not pay attentiont to it here. My point is solutions above forget about use-cases - what is the point to search for something if you already have reference to it? In the most natural use-case you do not have a needle yet, so you do not use variable needle.
