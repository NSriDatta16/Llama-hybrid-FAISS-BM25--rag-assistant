Personally, I create a random hash and store it in a "remember me" table. The table also has the user agent, user id and the IP address. I check both every time I re-login the user from the remember-me function. And if the user manually logs out, I simply remove that row from the table. Then if they login again, it creates a new random hash. There's really no way to combat someone sniffing packets with a remember me system (unless you use secure cookies with the HTTPS only flag set). So use a secure connection with HTTPS-only cookies. If you can't, then at least make the the hash random so if it is discovered you can at least generate a new hash to kill that login...
