When using the full sample, your estimate is a weighted average of the effects in the two periods. Unless the effect is the same in both periods, a regression using the full sample will give different results than regressions for each subsample. I had a concrete example of this in my paper " Broken or Fixed Effects? " with two coauthors, but, unfortunately, it had to be cut. The principles discussed therein, however, are just as applicable to your situation. Your fixed effects would be a time period dummy.
