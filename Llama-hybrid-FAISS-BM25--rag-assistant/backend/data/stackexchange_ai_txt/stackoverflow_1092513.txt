Edit It really looks like both packages are gone, but now we have a nice data structure, borrowed from R -- DataFrame in pandas package Quick tutorial (pay attention to section "Grouping") I don't know about complete reporting solution for Django (or Python), but make reporting with Django is quite easy with or without ORM: django-tables can give you very basic structure for handling table data (asc/desc server-side sorting etc) you can use standart django 1.1 queryset aggregates (django-reporting uses them) for totals/subtotals stuff. Personally I use django-tables and neithere's datashaping python package for quick summary/avg/median/IQR/filtering stuff because I have many different data sources (REST data, two mysql dbs, csv files from R) with only few of them in django db now. Pycha is one of candidates for me to draw simple charts. I don't like client-side ajax-based grids etc for reporting, but you can use it with django templates too.
