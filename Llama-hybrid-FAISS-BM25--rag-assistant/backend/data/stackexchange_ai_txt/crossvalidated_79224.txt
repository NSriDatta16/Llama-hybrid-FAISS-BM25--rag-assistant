In order to test for the effect of a change in a known variable (advertising spend) one needs to control for both known and unknown impacts that have affected sales. Weekly indicators are certainly known as is the history of the advertising variable. If the series has had a level shift or a change in trend in the history of the data prior to the advertising change then this needs to be empirically identified along with any one time unusual activity and incorporated into the model providing robust estimates of the model parameters. Furthermore there may be autoregressive structure in the tentative model residuals that needs to be addressed in order to render an error process to be Gaussian and any subsequent F or T test to be meaningful. With this in place one can then form a test of the importance of the change in the advertising variable as a Level Shift at the point of the change in advertising would be detected. Unfortunately simple solution tools like SPSS sometimes fall far short of providing this kind of analysis. The literature of the Interrupted Time Series may help you. Search for McCleary and Hay as possible sources to get you started. Unfortunately their work was done in the 80's and is not fully up to date with the modern concepts of Intervention Detection. EDIT: Figure 1 from Charles's reference showing a clear level shift(intercept change) and a possible (but probably dubious/insignificant) trend change. Again Charles a thank you for showing the clear need for Intervention Detection procedures.
