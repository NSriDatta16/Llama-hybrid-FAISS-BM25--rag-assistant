I stumbled on this today, and it actually solves my problem quite elegantly. screen allows the current terminal window to be split, where I can reduce one part of the window to just a couple of lines, where I keep my input, and just cat fifo in the other part of the window. Screen definitely rocks a lot more than I already knew (detach alone makes it one of the best tools ever).
