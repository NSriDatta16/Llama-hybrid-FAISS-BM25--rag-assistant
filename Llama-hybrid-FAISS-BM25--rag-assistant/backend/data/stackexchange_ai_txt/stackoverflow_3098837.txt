There's a bug in jQuery when setting the scope option of a droppable via the option function. jQuery maintains an array with all registered sortables (let's call it S for now), where each key is one specific scope. When you drop a draggable element into the droppable, jQuery then checks the scope attribute of the draggable and checks if the droppable you are trying to drag into is present in S[scope] . If it isn't it means that the droppable you are tring to drop into is not in the same scope as the draggable. The problem is that when you change the scope option by doing .droppable('option', 'scope', ...) , the array S isn't updated. Everything else (as far as I can see) is updated correctly (option attribute of the actual jQuery object etc), leading to "correct" results being returned when getting the scope option via .droppable('option', 'scope') . I found a couple of other people having the same question and no solutions came up, and this very question came up when i googled for solutions ( "jquery droppable scope option" ), so I thought it could be useful to provide a temporary solution until it is fixed. I made an extention function, not very well tested with regards to possible conflicts with other options, but atleast it's a start. $.ui.ddmanager.droppables is the array I called S previously. jQuery.fn.extend({ setDroppableScope: function(scope) { return this.each(function() { var currentScope = $(this).droppable("option","scope"); if (typeof currentScope == "object" && currentScope[0] == this) return true; //continue if this is not droppable //Remove from current scope and add to new scope var i, droppableArrayObject; for(i = 0; i Your example would then look like draggables.each(function(index) { $(this).draggable('option', 'scope', ''+index); droppables.eq(index).setDroppableScope(''+index); $(this).text( $(this).draggable('option', 'scope') ) droppables.eq(index).text( droppables.eq(index).droppable('option', 'scope') ); }); Here's the updated jsbin
