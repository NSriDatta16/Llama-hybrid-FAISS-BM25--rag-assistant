Sounds more like an issue of getting at the data, rather than storage. Setting up a view to give you the data you need, or using a data warehouse to store the data in a denormalized fashion is an option for reporting needs. For storage, like was mentioned, I would recommend using a table that has an artificial primary key and this table points to these other three references (venues, bands, and venueschedules), so one table ties the three together, and this way, you can write a query using this one that links to the other three to get at the data.
