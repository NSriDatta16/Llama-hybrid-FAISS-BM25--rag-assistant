How to solve MLE when noise variance is made learnable rather than fixed?

I saw some machine learning code assuming that variance of gaussian noise is a learnable parameter in linear regression problem. I'm wondering how is this solved theoretically? Below you see typcial MLE derviation of linear regression. Noise (epsilon) is assumed to have fixed std which is sigma squared, what if we learened it just like w? what is sigma(x) ?
