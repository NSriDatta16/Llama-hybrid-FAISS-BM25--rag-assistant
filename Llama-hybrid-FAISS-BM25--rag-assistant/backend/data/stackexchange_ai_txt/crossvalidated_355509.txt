Logistic Regression in SPSS: Step 0 is non-significant but Step 1 is significant? Help interpreting the output

Hey I'm doing a logistic regression looking at predicting if someone will commit one type of crime or another based on 11 ordinal variables (each variable is 0-2). I'm having some trouble interpreting the results of my SPSS output and wouldn't mind some advice. I've given some images of the output to make this clearer. At Step 0, the constant is not significant, and also only variable 4 is significant. I know this is poor, but I'm still not quite sure what this means (e.g. maybe its inappropriate to run the analysis at all. In the final image, when the variables are added to the equation, variables 2, 4, 5 and 8 are significant, which means they might be good predictors? My stats knowledge is based on ideal world scenarios where everything is significant, so I am finding it difficult to understand this data, so any help is appreciated.
