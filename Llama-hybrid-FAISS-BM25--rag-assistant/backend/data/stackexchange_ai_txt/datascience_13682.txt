logistic regression - why exponent (log ratio) is linear

I am new to ds and stats in general. I read numerous article to understand logistic regression. I got some idea why it works and how it fits to scattered plot of 1s and 0s when target variable is binary. however one piece of puzzle I still don't understand is how come someone derived that ln(p/1-p) = B0 + B1X1 + .. I see all articles assume that this is the link function and then go on talking about how it solves our regression problem for binary variable. but how this link function came about.
