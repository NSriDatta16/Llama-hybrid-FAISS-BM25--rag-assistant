The difference between the two should not be large. That said, Kim (2008) " Estimating classification error rate: Repeated cross-validation,repeated hold-out and bootstrap " that does present an investigation of repeated CV stipulates explicitly: " we obtain the $10$ -fold CV estimates $5$ times, and take the average as the final estimate " when presenting the results of repeated CV. To that respect, one of the first widely-cited papers to suggested repeated CV, Dietterich (1998) " Approximate Statistical Tests for Comparing Supervised Classification Learning Algorithms " the description of $5\times2$ -CV is based on five iterations of two-fold cross-validation and the subsequent averaging of the 5 measurements. So to answer the final question: it would more reasonable to report " means of 10 times 10-fold CV runs " rather than the means of 100 folds.
