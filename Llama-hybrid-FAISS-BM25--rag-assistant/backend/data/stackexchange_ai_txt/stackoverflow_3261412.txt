In your case each user will have it public key and private key. The user will sign the database record (string etc. ), a pdf or xml document using his private key. You get a signed database record (signed string etc.), signed pdf or xml document. You store the signed database record now as a binary record in your database. You store the signed pdf or xml as normal document in your storage location. And probably you need to add a field in your database to integrate this file to your application. For the library to do the signing, you may use AES, here you go with the implemented library of various language: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_implementations Anyway, I not sure any user who is concern on security will give your application his/her private key for signing. People usually use a trusted application to sign something before pass it out.
