If I understand the problem, you code in Java, GWT translates that to JavaScript, and you want coverage information on the Java program obtained from running the GWT-compiler version? If so, there's a way to do it. Our SD Java Test Coverage tool instruments Java source code to collect its coverage data. If you ran our SD test coverage tool, what you get is instrumented Java code. If you compile and run that with GWT, the instrumentation will still collect the data as if the program were running as Java . The instrumentation builds a trivial array of booleans at runtime. Normally that is dumped by the instrumented Java program to a file as it "exits" (for a variety of definitions of "exit"). The dump logic is pretty trivial (loop over the array and write the values) and customizable. Writing the equivalent for the Javascript code should be pretty easy. With the exported instrumentation data, our SD Java Test Coverage tool will display your test coverage, on your original source code, as though you had executed the Java code itself. And it will be accurate.
