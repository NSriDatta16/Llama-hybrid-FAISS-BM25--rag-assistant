Because $â„’$ is evaluated by computing a value for each row of $X$ (and summing or taking the average; i.e., a commutative operator) for a given set of weight matrices $W$ , the arrangement of the rows of $X$ has no effect when using full-batch gradient descent Complementing @Josh's answer, I would like to add that, for the same reason, shuffling needs to be done before batching. Otherwise, you are getting the same finite number of surfaces.
