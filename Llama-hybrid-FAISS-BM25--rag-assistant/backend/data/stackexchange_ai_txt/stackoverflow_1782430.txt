Objective-C / Xcode project : Where to put structs?

I always try to keep my Xcode projects very well organized but I recently asked myself where to put struct data types. Normal I use a lot of classes even when a struct would do. Since classes are always separate files there are much easier to organize and easier to find. Where do you put your structs?
