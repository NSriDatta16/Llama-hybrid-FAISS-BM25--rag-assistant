Is it advisable to drop certain levels of a categorical variable?

Let's say that I have one categorical variable with six levels, and I then create five indicator variables in order to represent the six levels. If two of the five variables are insignificant, then do I drop these two? I assume not, but I was not sure. I was thinking that it might be better to test the full (all five variables) versus the reduced (just the three significant variables) model and, if that was not significant, then just leave all five of the variables in. I was not sure what to do. Oh and I meant for this to be in the context of fitting a logistic regression model.
