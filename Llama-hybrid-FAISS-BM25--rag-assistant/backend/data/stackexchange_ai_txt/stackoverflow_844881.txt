Fastest Dijkstra algorithm for j2ME

Can anybody help me to make j2ME implementation of Dijkstra algorithm faster ? I have two loops, one inside another. Like this while(for each item in Q) { //...do something. //the following loop is to find the minimum for(all un-visited nodes in Q) { //.. do something to get min. } } I have almost 23000 nodes and 50000 edges connecting them...The inner loop executes an average of 169330131 times after all improvements mentioned below. This takes 5 minutes to complete on my w910i mobile and more than minutes on my emulator. This looks too much for me. Any suggestions for improvement? I have the following improvements already implemented. Using array instead of vector. Make sure that the inner loop does not consider the visited nodes. All my visited nodes are at the end of the array and I node know the count. So, I can easily skip them altogether.
