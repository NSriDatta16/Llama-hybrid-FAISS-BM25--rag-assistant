Don't add the jNice class to your form element. Use the following to run jNice: jQuery(function ($) { if (!($.browser.msie && $.browser.version You can also use the IE conditional markup suggested by others: IE conditionals are a better solution because they won't fail in the event of browser spoofing (where the browser pretends it has a different user agent). However, they don't produce valid XHTML (afaik) and aren't as flexible.
