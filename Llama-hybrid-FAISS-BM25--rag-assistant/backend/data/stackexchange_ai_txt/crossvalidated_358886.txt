Detecting whether image contains object or not

I've been able to train a CNN for binary classification. It detects whether an image is more likely to contain object A or object B (it returns 0 or 1). How would I go about building a network that detects whether object A is in an image or not (and nothing else)? Do I need to give it training data that doesn't contain A? I only need to know if an object is contained in the image, not where it is.
