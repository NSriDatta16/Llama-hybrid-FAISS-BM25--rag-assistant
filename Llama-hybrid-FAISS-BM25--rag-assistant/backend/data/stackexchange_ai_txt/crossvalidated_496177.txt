This is a bit related to When do posteriors converge to a point mass? If the prior is covering the entire range then $\hat{\theta} \xrightarrow{P} \theta$ , the parameter estimate will converge to the true parameter. So a Bayesian type of estimate will converge to the true parameter and the sample distribution of the estimate will converge to the distribution of the true parameter. If the prior is also equal to the true distribution of the parameter (this doesn't need to be the case) then the convergence of the sample distribution of the estimate to the sample distribution of the true parameter will also be convergence to the prior distribution. (and the variances will equal)
