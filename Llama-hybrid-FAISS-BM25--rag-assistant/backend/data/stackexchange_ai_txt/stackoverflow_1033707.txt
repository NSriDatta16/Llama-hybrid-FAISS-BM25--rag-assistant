The approach #1 should work. I did it several times. But if you want to make your drag and drop simpler I would suggest using JLists(without scroll panes) for your orders. You will be able to implement D&D within lists as well as between them if needed. To customize how order looks you can use renderers. On top of lists you can use panels or labels as tour headers. So I would create specialized TourView component with header on top and JList on the bottom. Then add many of TourViews to panel as you thought in case #1. In all cases, except when using JTable, you have to implement column enlarging yourself.
