Haddock losing part of the documentation?

I have the following function: -- | Exponential moving average. ema :: (Fractional a) => a -- ^ Alpha -> [a] -- ^ Input data -> [a] -- ^ Output ema alpha xs = scanl1 (\a b -> a+(alpha*(b-a))) xs Haddock takes the above and generates the following HTML: ema :: Fractional a => a Input data -> [a] Output -> [a] Exponential moving average. What happened to "Alpha" ?
