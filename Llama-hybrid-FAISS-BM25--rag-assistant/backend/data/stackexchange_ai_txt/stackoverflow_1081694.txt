A few ideas: You can keep a history of the IP address(es) that have historically been used to login to a given account. The lockout mechanism can be helpful, but be a little more lenient on those recognized addresses to avoid making a user's bad day worse. For the other situation with one IP trying the same password on many accounts, keep track of whether the same IP address has had a number of invalid attempts on different accounts, and lock out that IP for an hour or so. In the case of a botnet using many IPs to try the same password on many accounts, keep track of whether there has been a barrage of IP addresses attempting the same password. If so, temporarily make it so that password must be entered twice in a row even if it's correct. (Normal users will just think they mistyped their password.) As mentioned, if an attack is detected, temporarily require a captcha or some other security question (in addition to pretending a valid password was incorrect on the first try). While captcha-reading tools are possible, I don't think they're prevalent just yet, and OCR requires a lot of CPU time.
