The average age of observations in a model is calculating by attributing age 0 for the current observation at time $t$, age 1 for the first past observation $t-1$, age 2 to the second past observation or the observation $z_{t-2}$, and so on. In the end, if the model goes back to observation $z_{t-m}$ and it has one observation for all the intermediate periods between $z_t$ and $z_{t-m}$, the average age $AA$ will be: $\large AA = \large \frac{\frac{(r_0 + r_m).m}{2} }{m+1}$ Knowing that, by the one of the criteria above, $AA(r_0)$ = 0, one can write: $\large AA = \large \frac{\frac{(r_m).m}{2} }{m+1}$ where $r_m$ is the age of the last observation, and $m$ is the index of the last observation. So, if the last observation is $z_6$, $r_m$ = 6, and $m$ = 6.
