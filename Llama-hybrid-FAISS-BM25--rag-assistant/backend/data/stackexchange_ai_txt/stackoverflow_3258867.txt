background-color not covering full screen with xsl in xhtml

When I tried to convert my website to xhtml, things went perfectly until I realized that IE doesn't support it. I went to the xhtml FAQ's section about IE , and tried out the workaround there, using an identity transformation to trick IE into rendering it as html in quirks mode. Unfortunately, this seems to make firefox (and possibly other browsers?) display the css background only over the text of the page. So here is the code: test.xhtml: This is a heading. This is a paragraph. backgroundexample.css: body { background-color:red; } copy.xsl: The effect of this is that the background only displays over the text, not the whole page. I could not find the problem here or by googling, so please tell me if this has already been asked (and i am therefore bad at searching).
