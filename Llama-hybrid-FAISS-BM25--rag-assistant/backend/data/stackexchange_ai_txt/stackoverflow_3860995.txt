Coldfusion seems to get caught up loading UDF's

I am currently running too many sites on a server and I don't think the template cache can handle it. But, what really seems to be the biggest drag is when I load my UDF library per site. I say this because whenever I run Fusion Reactor to see where the holdup is, the stacktrace is always sitting on the template that loads the UDF's. Is the only cure for this more RAM and a higher template cache, or is there a better way? Maybe I am wrong as well, could there be another issue?
