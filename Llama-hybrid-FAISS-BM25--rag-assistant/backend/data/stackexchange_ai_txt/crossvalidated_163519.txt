How to use Singular Value Decomposition for time series?

I want to represent a time series using the SVD algorithm. Below are some representations from this presentation . The SVD representations is formed by summing k "eigenwaves" corresponding to the first k eigenvalues. But how can I compute the first k eigenvalues when the time series is a one dimensional vector (n*1 matrix)? When I apply SVD to a one dimensional vector I get only one eigenvalue.
