Ext 2.2 is not fully compatible with IE9 as it uses some pretty terrible user agent sniffing to adapt. You can take a look at one of my bug reports in the forum that explains the issue. Depending on the features you need to use you might not notice this, but if doing drag'n'drop and other stuff depending on certain mouse behavior then things will break. Hopefully Sencha will take to their senses sometime soon about feature detection, because except for this it's a pretty time saving product..
