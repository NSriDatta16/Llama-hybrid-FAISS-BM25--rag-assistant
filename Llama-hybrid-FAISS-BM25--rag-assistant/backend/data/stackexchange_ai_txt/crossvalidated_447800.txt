What is the difference between multinomial logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis?

I am new to machine learning and I am studying classification at the moment. Is it correct to say that logistic regression with more than two classes (i.e. multinomial regression) and LDA are both methods for classifying new points when having more than two classes? Or are they different things and itâ€™s not fair to compare them? I know that in LDA we use Bayes theorem and we suppose that the distribution of the predictors is approximately normal in each of the classes and is more stable than the logistic regression model, but do they do the same thing in the end? Sorry if the question sounds silly, but I am majorly confused.
