This usually had to do with cookies, or other HTTP request headers that your browser sends. The web server can not distinguish b/w a human-driven web browser, or code-controlled "webclient" as long as they send exactly the same headers. In a human-driven "session" authentication (entering username/password) usually causes some cookies being sent from Server to browser, and you keep being "logged on", as you browser keeps sending those cookies back to the server when making consequent requests. So, if your webclient can send (post?) the credentials correctly, and keep on with storing and resending cookies (and/or "referrer"/"user-agent" headers) as needed, it shouldn't be any different (in the end it's just request, and response chain of HTT-Protocol). There may be safe-guards in the particular "control" you're using to prevent it (or the API) from being used by malware though. "A program is trying to send e-mail on your behalf, are you sure you want to allow this?" prompt, and the accompanying 5-second delay in MS Outlook is such an example. So, if a particular API you're using has this kind of a prompt/precaution, you may not take care of things totally silently.
