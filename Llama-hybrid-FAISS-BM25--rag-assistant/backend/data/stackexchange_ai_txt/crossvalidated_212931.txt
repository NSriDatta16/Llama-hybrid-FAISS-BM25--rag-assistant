Your link unfortunately doesn't work but, have you tried basic Latent Dirichlet Allocation ? This generates topics for you, along with the words and frequencies that define those topics. These models can be fed in an initial list of topics, and by adding documents you can set a penalty for whether or not to introduce new topics. In general, clustering topics is a difficult task (PCA generally only explains a few percent of the total variance). I would strongly recommend trying something like LDAvis . Otherwise, if you're interested in richer document details, you'd wanna try word2vec models , which you can try to cluster after forming vectors for your documents.
