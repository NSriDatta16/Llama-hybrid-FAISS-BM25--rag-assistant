You can find a very good taxonomy of the most important ML methods in the table of contents of the book Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Patrick Murphy. Given your background in statistics, I'm pretty confident that you will find that book resourceful. It has both introductory descriptions and in-depth explanations of almost any kind of ML method.
