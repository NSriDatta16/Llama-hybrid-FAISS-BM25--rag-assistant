Inference in Normalizing Flow model: NICE(non linear independent components estimation)

I was recently reading Y. Bengio's paper on NICE ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516 ). In the paper, authors have taken a view that a good representation involves easy learning of the data distribution. The proposed method therefore transforms the original distribution $p_X(x)$ into $p_H(h)$ using a bijective mapping $f(x)=h$ . This is modeled by a neural network containing special type of layer called coupling layer. Overall, the paper is an interesting read and is very well written. Hence, I decided to implement the model. I coded the equations in section 5 and maximized $log(p_H(h)) + \sum s_i$ using Adam. However, there are certain this that are unclear to me. How to draw samples from the model? The paper says that ancestral sampling can be used. I'm not sure how to do that. (so sample $h \tilde{} p_H(h)$ , then afterwards how can I get $x$ ?) Also, how to sample $p_{h_d}$ in the first place , given in section 3.4 How to use this model for inpainting as described in section 5.2. What is the upper bound of the optimization problem. It seems like its unbounded on upper limit because of $\sum s_{ii}$ .
