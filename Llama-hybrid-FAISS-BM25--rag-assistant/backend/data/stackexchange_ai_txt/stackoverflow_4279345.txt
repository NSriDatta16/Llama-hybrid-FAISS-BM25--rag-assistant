Yes you should worry about not including your script file several times and not to declare the function several times... For the first part, you may want to look into changing your html structure so the js file is only included once (even though js files are cached by the browser, and the second time may not actually go to the server -- depending of several factors... there's still a penalty) Now as for declaring your function only once, remember that functions are also object (1st class citizens) in js, so you can test if a function is already define as if you were testing an object.... if(!window.myFunc) { window.myFunc = function(){} }... You may want to look a bit into functions and scoping in js.. here are some links http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/09/explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures/ http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/02/24/video-crockonjs-3/ http://www.slideshare.net/douglascrockford/crockford-on-javascript-act-iii-function-the-ultimate
