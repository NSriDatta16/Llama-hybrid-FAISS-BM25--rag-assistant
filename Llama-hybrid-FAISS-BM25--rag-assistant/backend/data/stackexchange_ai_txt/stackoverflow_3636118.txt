Display DIVs over iFrame containing Flash

I have a some trouble with iFrame. Basically, I have drop down basic CSS menu and right underneath it I have iFrame with flash from external website. Unfortunately whenever the menu drops down it goes underneath the iFrame. Is there a way using jQuery , JavaScript or CSS to prevent the menu from disparaging behind the iframe? Many Thank Dom
