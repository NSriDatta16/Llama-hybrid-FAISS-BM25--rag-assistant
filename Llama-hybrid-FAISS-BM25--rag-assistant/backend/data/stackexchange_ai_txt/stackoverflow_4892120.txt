You could countermand the warning pragma: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; my @ulist = qw(1 2 5x 4 3); my @slist; { no warnings 'numeric'; @slist = sort { $a $b } @ulist; } Pragmas are lexically scoped, including inversions of them. So the no warnings statement will last until the end of its enclosing block. (And as was pointed out in the comments, you can disable just the relevant warning too!)
