Difference between DataTable.Load() and DataTable = dataSet.Tables[];

I have a doubt i use the following piece of code get data from a SQLlite data base and Load it into a data table SQLiteConnection cnn = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=" + path); cnn.Open(); SQLiteCommand mycommand = new SQLiteCommand(cnn); string sql = "select Company,Phone,Email,Address,City,State,Zip,Country,Fax,Web from RecordsTable"; mycommand.CommandText = sql; SQLiteDataReader reader = mycommand.ExecuteReader(); dt.Load(reader); reader.Close(); cnn.Close(); In some cases when I try to load it Gives me "Failed to enable constraints exception" But when I tried this below given piece of code for same table and same set of records it worked SQLiteConnection ObjConnection = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=" + path); SQLiteCommand ObjCommand = new SQLiteCommand("select Company,Phone,Email,Address,City,State,Zip,Country,Fax,Web from RecordsTable", ObjConnection); ObjCommand.CommandType = CommandType.Text; SQLiteDataAdapter ObjDataAdapter = new SQLiteDataAdapter(ObjCommand); DataSet dataSet = new DataSet(); ObjDataAdapter.Fill(dataSet, "RecordsTable"); dt = dataSet.Tables["RecordsTable"]; Can any one tell me what is the difference between two
