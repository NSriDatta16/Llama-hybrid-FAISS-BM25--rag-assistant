I'm afraid that's just how accelerometers work, here on earth there will always be 9.8 Gs pointing at the ground. If you can assume that you have a working compass, just take a vector of length STANDARD_GRAVITY , rotate with the current orientation taken from the magnetometer and subtract this from your accelerometer's vector. Keep in mind that you should also dampen the values you get back from the accelerometer, use a running average of the last few values.
