Nonparametric methods for count data?

I have data where the dependent variable are counts of an event. I am modeling the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using a negative binomial model, but I was also hoping to try some machine learning or nonparametric models, specifically ones that will handle nonlinearity in the responses and predictors. Any suggestions? Thanks.
