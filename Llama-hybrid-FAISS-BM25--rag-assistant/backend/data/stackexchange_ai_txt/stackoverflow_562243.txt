Things in life are not perfect and if you start nitpicking, feathers will be ruffled and relationships soured. The best method is to pick your battles carefully. If something is small enough ignore it and live with it. If it is big and worthwhile (i.e. the management sees ROI in backing you) go for it. This is apt for your situation... God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.
