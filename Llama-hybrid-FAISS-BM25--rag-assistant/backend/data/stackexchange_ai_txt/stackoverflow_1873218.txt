JDO is indeed a standard but, from an adoption point of view, it's a big failure. Hence JPA which is where things happen now and which is attracting much more attention. Anyway, not sure this is what you're looking for but did you check EclipseJDO ? This Eclipse plugin makes easy and fast to develop transaction applications in Java using JDO drivers. This tool integrates the JDO enhance command in JDT building process. It gives the developer the necessary toolbox and wizards to make a Java application JDO persistent just by checking boxes, completely integrated within the development life cycle within Eclipse. Of course, it targets to support all JDO compilant drivers. DataNucleus has an Eclipse Plugin too but I'm not sure it does much more things. Maybe someone from DataNucleus will confirm this. Oh, BTW, good luck with your travel through the Java galaxy ;)
