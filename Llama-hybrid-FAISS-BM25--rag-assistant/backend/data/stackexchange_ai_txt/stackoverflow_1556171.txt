From a high level the answer is to not setup your prices inclusive of tax. The Magento system expects you to setup prices without tax. All calculations in the system will be based on that. If you want prices to display with tax, you should override and/or create new Blocks and phtml templates that display price information. You want to change what is shown to the user, and not change what is used in system calculations.
