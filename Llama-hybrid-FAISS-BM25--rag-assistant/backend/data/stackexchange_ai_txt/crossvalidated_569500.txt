I think the concern motivating this question is that the example shows up in the chapter on Other Mixture Models for Categorical Data . That chapter follows a series of chapters on Models for Matched Pairs (10), Analyzing Repeated Categorical Response Data (11), and Random Effects... (12), which establishes a section dedicated to repeated measures data. The dataset's existence within this section implies it should be that type somehow (prototypically, repeated measures or hierarchically nested data). In contrast, however, the data do not appear to have that character. I think what Agresti is doing is using these data to illustrate a different issue. The simplest model for count data is a Poisson model. There is a sense in which Poisson regression 'should' be the right model to use. However, the Poisson distribution makes a very strong assumption that the conditional variance is always the same as the condition mean. That assumption is typically violated in the real world. If so, we can ask why and we can ask what we're supposed to do now. One reason the variance can be 'too high' is that the data come from heterogeneous units (e.g., patients) with different attributes (e.g., age, sex, family history, etc.) that are relevant to the outcome but which are not included in the model. These attributes could average out, in which case the mean can still be the same, but the data will still spread out further (i.e., the higher conditional variance). There are various ways to handle such a situation. One is to use a 'quasi-Poisson' likelihood with an ad-hoc adjustment. Another is to use the negative binomial distribution instead of the Poisson, which allows the variance to be independent of the mean. But another way is to have a latent normal distribution of units (i.e., random effects). This can be done even though there is only one response value per unit. Agresti uses this dataset to illustrate this approach and how it compares to the default Poisson and the negative binomial. Thus, a GLiMM is appropriate (and these data make sense to show in this chapter) even though the data are neither repeated nor nested.
