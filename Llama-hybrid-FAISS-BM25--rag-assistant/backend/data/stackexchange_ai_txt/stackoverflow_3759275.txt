It's youtubes way of preventing you from grabbing their flv files automatically. You can't get the file from your server because the download link (which you got from your browser, or how did you find the flv link) is locked to your browser. Which is why when someone other than you try to call the link we all get the 403 HTTP forbidden, even with a spoofed user-agent. Try to use cURL and show the headers, you'll see what I mean.
