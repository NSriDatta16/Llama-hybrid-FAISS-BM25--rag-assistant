Books on command interfaces / interactive visualizations

Note: marked as community wiki. Note: before voting to close "not real question" -- the question is: What are the common interactive visualization design patterns? Exposition: I have this gigantic real time simulation. I'm working on interactive visualization tools to monitor the simulation. I'm familiar with OpenGL but not used to writing HCI / visualization type code. So I'm curious: what books/articles should I be reading? I'm looking for the "The C Programming Language / SICP / Design Patterns" type of equivament resource for writing interactive visualizations. "Interactive" is important -- I don't want to just generate pretty pictures; I want to generate pretty pictures and be able to interact & probe the visualization. Thanks!
