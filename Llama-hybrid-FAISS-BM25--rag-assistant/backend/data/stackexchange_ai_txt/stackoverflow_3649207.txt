Creating a login page in java console application using a txt file

I am creating a java console application and i need to use a notepad (txt) file to store PIN, AccountNo and Balance. When the user enters the PIN (from BufferedReader) it should get validated from the notepad file and login to thge system. However, the code fragment which I used below only displays Enter PIN, and when i click on Enter, the program exits. Could you please tell me what is the mistake which I have done here? BufferedReader getIt = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); String userPIN = ""; try { // Open the file that is the first command line parameter FileInputStream fstream = new FileInputStream( "D:\\Studies\\BCAS\\HND\\Semester 1\\Programming Concepts\\Assignment\\AccountInfo.txt"); // Get the object of DataInputStream DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(fstream); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in)); String strLine; //Read File Line By Line System.out.println("Enter PIN"); userPIN = getIt.readLine(); while ((strLine = br.readLine()) != null) { // Print the content on the console# if (userPIN.equals(strLine)) { System.out.println("You have login!"); } } //Close the input stream in.close(); } catch (Exception e) {//Catch exception if any System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage()); }
