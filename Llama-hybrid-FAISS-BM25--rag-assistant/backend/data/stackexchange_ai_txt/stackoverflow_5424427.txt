I've implemented this small helper function to filter buffers by their major-mode (defun buffer-mode (buffer-or-name) (with-current-buffer buffer-or-name major-mode)) (defun filter-buffers-by-mode (mode) (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (x) (and (eq (buffer-mode x) mode) x)) (buffer-list)))) You can pass 'sql-mode as the argument and you'll get a list of all open sql buffers.
