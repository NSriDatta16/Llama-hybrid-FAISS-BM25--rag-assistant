IronCow Task Deletion Permissions Problem

I'm using the IronCow managed API for RememberTheMilk (http://ironcow.codeplex.com/) and I'm trying to remove tasks using my program. I've already logged in and downloaded the tasks list, but when I later try to remove one I get the following exception: [IronCow.RtmException] = {"User not logged in / Insufficient permissions"} I'm removing tasks using this code (rtm is my logged in RTM object, myTask is the Task object I'm looking to delete) TaskListCollection tlc = rtm.TaskLists; foreach (TaskList list in tlc) { TaskListTaskCollection taskListsTasks = list.Tasks; foreach (Task task in taskListTasks) { if (!(task.IsDeleted || task.IsCompleted) && task.Name == myTask.Name) { list.Tasks.Remove(task); } } } the line it errors on is list.Tasks.Remove
