What is the best way to create derived properties

I have a datamodel with to-many to-many relations. Using the example of employee database let say the entity division is related to department which in turn is related to employee. The employee has an attribute salary. How best to have a attribute at the level of division which is derived from the salary attribute. For example average salary or maximum salary. I would need those attributes to sort the list of departments.
