How to call a method of another Class?

EDIT2: I try to summarize my problem and the solutions: I've got a TableViewController named DetailedViewController. My intention was to activate TouchesBegan to recognize actions like sliding etc, and normally, the method touchesbegan is replaced with the DidSelectRow method. In many posts on stackoverflow, subclassing the UITableView is the only possibility to realize this. So i created a SpecificTable with .xib file and i used this as a subclass of UITableViewController by adding the SpecificTable as the nib-file. Selecting a row works fine, and also the TouchesBegan method (i called a method IN the SpecificTable.m with an Alert.) But now i want to call a Method in the UITableViewController (DetailedViewController) where moveToNextItem is declared like -(void)moveToNextItem:(id)sender { [self.navigationController pushViewController:bbarChart animated:YES]; } But by calling this method with [self moveToNextItem] the App crashes by touching. (in the Debugger-Mode, the App crashes in the line of [self moveToNextItem]. What is the right way to call the method of DetailedViewController.m?
