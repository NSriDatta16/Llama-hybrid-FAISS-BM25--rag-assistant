Principal Component analysis (vector space or inner product space?)

(WARNING: This question might seem dumb) I see that the optimization problem in PCA involves the notion of inner product. For example, to solve for the loadings in second principal component, the constraint is that loadings should be orthogonal to loadings from first principal component. Since the notion of inner product (for orthogonality) is involved, I would expect the observations to lie in an inner product space or Hilbert Space. But all text books state that the observations lie in Vector space. My knowledge from functional analysis is that vector spaces are not endowed with inner products and only inner product spaces (and Hilbert spaces) are endowed with notion of inner products. So when text books state that the observations lie in vector space, do they mean that they lie in inner product space (or Hilbert space)? Or am I missing something? Thank you.
