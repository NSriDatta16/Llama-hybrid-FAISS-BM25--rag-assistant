In layman's terms, fit_transform means to do some calculation and then do transformation (say calculating the means of columns from some data and then replacing the missing values). So for training set, you need to both calculate and do transformation. But for testing set, machine learning applies prediction based on what was learned during the training set and so it doesn't need to calculate, it just performs the transformation.
