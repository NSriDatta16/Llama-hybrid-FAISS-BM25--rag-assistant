Doing logistic regression using R

I need to do a logistic regression using R on my data. My response variable ( y ) is survival at weaning ( surv=0 ; did not surv=1 ) and I have several independent variables which are binary and categoricals in nature. I am following some examples on this website http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm and trying to run some models. Running the model: > mysurv2 summary(mysurv2) Call: glm(formula = surv ~ as.factor(PTEM) + as.factor(pshiv) + as.factor(presp) + as.factor(pmtone), family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = ap) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.2837 -0.5121 -0.5121 -0.5058 2.0590 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.01135 0.23613 -0.048 0.96166 as.factor(PTEM)2 -0.74642 0.24482 -3.049 0.00230 ** as.factor(PTEM)3 -1.95401 0.23259 -8.401 Adding the na.action=na.pass at the end of the model gave me an error message. I thought that this would take care NA's in my independent variables. > mysurv Since this is my first time to venture into logistic regression, I am wondering whether there is any package in R that would be more suitable? I am also tryng to understand the regression coefficients. The independent variables used in the model are: rectal temperature: (PTEM)1 = newborns with rectal temp. below 35.4 0C (PTEM)2 = newborns with rectal temp. between 35.4 to 36.9 0C (PTEM)3 = newborns with rectal temp. above 37.0 0C shivering: (pshiv)1 = newborns that were not shivering (pshiv)2 = newborns that were shivering respiration: (presp)1 = newborns with normal respiration (presp)2 = newborns with slight respiration problem (presp)3 = newborns with poor respiration muscle tone: (pmtone)1 = newborns with normal muscle tone (pmtone)2 = newborns with moderate muscle tone (pmtone)1 = newborns with poor muscle tone Looking at the coefficients, I got the following: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.01135 0.23613 -0.048 0.96166 as.factor(PTEM)2 -0.74642 0.24482 -3.049 0.00230 ** as.factor(PTEM)3 -1.95401 0.23259 -8.401 In my other analysis, I found that newborns: a) with higher rectal temperature b) do not shiver c) good respiration and d) good muscle tone at birth were more likely to survive. I am a bit confused with the coefficients I am getting above. I am wondering whether whether I am not interpreting the results correctly or is it something else?
