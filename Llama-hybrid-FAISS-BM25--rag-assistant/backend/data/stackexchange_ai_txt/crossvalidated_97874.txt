When performing WLS, you need to know the weights. There are some ways to find them as said on page 191 of Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis by Douglas C. Montgomery, Elizabeth A. Peck, G. Geoffrey Vining. For example: Experience or prior information using some theoretical model. Using residuals of the model, for example if ${\rm var}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2x_i$ then we may decide to use $w_i=1/x_i$. If the responses are the average of $n_i$ observation at each $x_i$ or something like ${\rm var}(y_i)={\rm var}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2/n_i$, then we may decide to use $w_i=n_i$. Sometime we know that different observations have been measured by different instruments that have some (known or estimated) accuracy. In this case we may decide to use weights as inversely proportional to the variance of measurement errors.
