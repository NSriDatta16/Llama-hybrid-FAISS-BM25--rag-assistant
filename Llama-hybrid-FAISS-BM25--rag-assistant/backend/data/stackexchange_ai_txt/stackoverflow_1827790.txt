jQuery not completely removing draggable/resizable

I'm trying to clone a draggable/resizable element with jQuery. The original element behaves as it should. When I clone it and then try to remove draggable and resizable via the 'destroy' call, it fails to remove the added classes and divs. You can see it in action (or inaction) at the following: jsbin example One of the textareas should be draggable and resizable and the other should not. As you can see the behavior is anything but expected.
