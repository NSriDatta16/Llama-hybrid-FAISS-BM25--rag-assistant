The clusplot uses PCA to draw the data. It uses the first two principal components to explain the data. You can read more about it here Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues . Principal components are the (orthogonal) axes that along them the data has the most variability, if your data is 2d then using two principal components can explain the whole variability of the data, thus the reason you see 100% explained. If your data is from a higher dimension but has a lot of correlations you can use a lower dimensional space to explain it. The difference you see between the graphs is plotting them along the PCA components. x You can play around, add dimensions and change the correlation structure and see how you get different results.
