Cassandra replicates on writes, yes, but it also uses Hinted Handoff , Read Repair and Anti Entropy to to reduce the inconsistency window. If you plugin a new node with auto_bootstrap set to true that node will get the appropriate data from the other nodes in the cluster. From cassandra.yaml (storage-conf.xml in 0.6.x) about auto_bootstrap: Set to true to make new [non-seed] nodes automatically migrate the right data to themselves.
