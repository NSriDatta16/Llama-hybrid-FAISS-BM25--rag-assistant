One of the ways to solve this "search" problem is to first start with some meta-heuristic algorithm like Genetic Programming and once the program is able to create a "near" function (of decent fitness), start with traditional machine learning regression algorithms of degree identified by GP. You will still need to perform cross validations for fitting your n-degree polynomial model. Few things you need to make sure while running GP is that not to provide functions which should not be used else GP has the tendency to create complex models mimicking decision tree + linear + quadratic etc.
