I don't think getRow() should be correct. getId() would be my choice, because the row ID may not be the same as the generated primary key. I don't believe that any implementation in java.sql is thread-safe; Connection certainly is not. Be sure to make your INSERT in a transaction context. You need to pay attention to your isolation level. Check the javadocs for java.sql.Connection if you don't know what that means.
