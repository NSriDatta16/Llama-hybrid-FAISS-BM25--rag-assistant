The Pragmatic Programmer is a good fit here. A little high level, but lots and lots of important, valuable, and clear wisdom. It's language-agnostic. As for PHP, personally I'm not much of a fan, I think there are other languages that are much better at supporting decoupling. Python, Java, C#, Scala â€” even JavaScript, with a CommonJS runtime such as Node.js . That said, you asked about PHP, so my advice would be to find some well-designed Open Source apps and see how they did it. Unfortunately I don't know any specifically, but there must be some.
