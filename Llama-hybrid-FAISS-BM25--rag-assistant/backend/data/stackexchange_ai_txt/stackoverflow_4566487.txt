Not sure why you say choosing both date and time would be a bad idea (are you against composite keys?) A bigger problem for you is that time does not store milliseconds. See this bug for more data on that: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=8523 Also, there seems to be something missing from the key that identifies the Stock such as Ticker. Since the ticker can change over time, it might be a good idea to introduce a surrogate for it such as StockID. You would do this in a table called Stock or similar. Then for your Trade table, I would suggest using StockID, Date and Time (but store the time in something other than the TIME datatype so you can store milliseconds. Ask another question if you need help with that). The order of the keys in the PK is important for both storage and retreival. For retrieval, you want to put the most selective keys for your query first. So if you tend to access all the data for a stock at once (or for a set of stocks), put StockID first so the index can be used to find them quickly. If you tend to access all data for a given interval, put Date then Time first. For storage, its better to be appending so having Date and Time first is a good idea here too. In case you want to access mostly in date ranges, but sometimes by Stock, put a secondary index on StockID.
