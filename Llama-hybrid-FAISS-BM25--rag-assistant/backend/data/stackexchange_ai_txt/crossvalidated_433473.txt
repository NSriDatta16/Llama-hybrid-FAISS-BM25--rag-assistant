Let's begin by examining $a$ and $b$ . $a$ is really a proportion of time, which runs from $0$ to $1$ . If $a_{it} = 1$ , then you have 1 (presumably important) entity in your time window. Likewise if $a_{it} = 0$ , then presumably that particular entity is somewhat unimportant. Similarly, $b$ is also a proportion running from $0$ to $1$ , with a value of $1$ indicating one dominating (presumably important) entity, and $0$ indicating a presumably unimportant entity. You can also assign a weight to $a$ and $b$ to adjust for the fact that $a$ matters more than $b$ . Let's call those values $w_a$ and $w_b$ . Let's make $w$ also between 0 and 1, so we can keep the notation nice. Now, since $a$ and $b$ have the same support set, we can take a weighted average to get an measure of importance, let's call it $I$ . Then $I_{it} = w_a*a_{it} + w_b*b_{it}$ With $I$ running from $0$ to $1$ . For each entity, if $I_{it}$ exceeds some predetermined value, then it is important. Each timestamp would be assigned a count of how many important values it has. There is one immediate danger that I can see A time stamp with 1 important event either has one important event and a bunch of miniscule events, or 1 important event and no other events at all. Therefore, it may be worth keeping track of the ratio of important events to all events within a timeframe, so you have an idea which case you're in. Hope this helps.
