This might be rather in the field of linguistics than related to data science, but nevertheless: To my knowledge, the "gunning fog index" as measure for understandability is intended for english language only, per definition. For some tools intended for german, see https://klartext.uni-hohenheim.de/hix (page in german), which refers to a german SMOG index. There are implementations of SMOG listed in PyPI, but you may need to find the appropriate values to configure them for german language.
