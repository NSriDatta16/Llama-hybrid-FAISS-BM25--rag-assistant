Node next = null; is a sort of pointer to a NodeObject. It's like declaring a variable not still initialized. In this case the object will probably be instantiated later. If you put an already existing object to a null value, if there aren't other references to the same object, then the garbage collector deletes it. I have been programming at basic level for quite a while but I have trouble understanding class data type. when we say int a = 9; it means a is of data type int meaning it can contain only integers. like wise for String, boolean, double, float etc. Pay attention that int and Integer are different in Java. int is a primitive type and it isn't an object. Integer is an object you can instantiate with new operator.
