Both answers are correct the macro recorder can be activated but it is pretty much useless since it records little to nothing. It seems that the ppt programmers at MS really take issue with customers being able to customize powerpoint. Executing repetitive tasks or just formatting an object the way you want it (and not being stuck with the pre-cooked options that MS in its infinite wisdom or shall I say bloody arrogance believes is all you need) has become almost impossible. The only way out is to program the ribbon or create an add-in which has to be done in Visual Studio (VBA will not cut it).
