One example is the bitfields facility in D's standard library which generates code for bit field manipulation starting from a user-specified layout. The Tuple facility is another example. It generates a tuple based on user-provided types and optional names. There isn't a lot of generative umph in there save for injecting the named fields, but I think it's an illustrative example. Without knowing of Lambert's exploit I just added memoize to the standard library - see here for the documentation, here for the code, and here for the related newsgroup discussion. Another facility I worked on is a higher-order function that tabulates an integral or real-valued function (e.g. offers fast exponential). That's not ready for release yet. Once object creation will be allowed during compilation, it will be easy to create e.g. regular expression engines that do all automata generation during compilation.
