Are there any open source and free calendar UI reusable components?

We need to implement scheduling subsystem. And we plan to integrate subsystem with our desktop and online applications. But we would like to reuse as many components as possible. One component that we want to reuse is the one for displaying date periods, calendar with events. Most scheduling systems like Outlook, Google Calendar have similar events displaying approach and we hope that this approach is already developed as independent reusable component. Are there calendar/scheduling components where creating events, draging-and-droping them, displaying day/month/year periods, etc. are available? Probably, Google Calendar is the most close to the component we are looking for. In most we are interested in Java-based components. Our server application is based on Java Struts2 and jQuery for client-side scripting. And desktop application is based on SWT. We are interested in both online and desktop calendar view components. Thanks!
