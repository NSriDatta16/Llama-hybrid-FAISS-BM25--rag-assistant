I would never checkout the whole project. Typically, I am only interested in one branch at a time, maybe two, occasionally three. I always have trunk checked out and updated. If I need to check the operation of a released tag (maybe for bug investigation) I check it out, investigate and delete. Branches stored under branches typically have a much shorter attention span, that is, they are created and used feverishly for a short period and then never touched again.
