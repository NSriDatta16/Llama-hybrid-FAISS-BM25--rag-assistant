How to handle revised economic data in time series analysis?

Economic data often get revised after first release, usually 1-3 months. Obviously we cannot use the revised value in the month it's first released. How do we use the revised values in time series analysis like arima? Suppose we want to regress X vs it's lagged values, and all values are revised 1 month after first release and no further revises. Is the following correct way to do the regression? Is there any packages to do so? X_May ~ X_Apr_first_release + X_Mar_revised + X_Feb_revised + ... Edit: @GeoMatt22 the above equation is not by year, the clearer version is: X(t) ~ X_first_release(t-1) + X_revised(t-2) + X_revised(t-3) + ...
