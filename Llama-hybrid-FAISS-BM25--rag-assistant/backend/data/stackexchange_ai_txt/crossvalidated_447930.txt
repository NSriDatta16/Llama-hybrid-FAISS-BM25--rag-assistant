How do you interpret the result of pca and biplot?

PC1 PC2 PC3 Electricity -0.48 0.12 -0.77 Fertility 0.49 -0.04 0.11 Life_exp -0.50 -0.01 0.51 Pop_dens -0.12 -0.99 -0.07 Child_mort 0.51 -0.08 -0.35 Questions: Do you need to use absolute value for PC1? I am kind of confused. Electricity and Life exp are roughly equal weight, Child_mort and Fertility are roughly equal weight as well. (If I get it right) If you use absolute value for PC1, does that mean you have four features I just mentioned are roughly equal weight? How do you interpret PC2?
