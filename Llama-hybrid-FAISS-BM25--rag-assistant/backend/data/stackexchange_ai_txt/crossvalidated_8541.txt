Resources about Gibbs sampling in hybrid Bayesian networks

I've been trying to get my hands on a substantial resource for using Gibbs sampling in hybrid Bayesian networks, that is, networks with both continuous and discrete variables. So far I can't say I have succeeded. I'm interested in hybrid networks where there are no constraints regarding discrete children having continuous parents. Gibbs sampling is a very widely employed method in approximate inference in Bayesian methods, and yet, I can't seem to find detailed resources that focus on hybrid networks
