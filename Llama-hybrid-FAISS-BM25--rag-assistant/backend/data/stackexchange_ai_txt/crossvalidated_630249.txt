Binary logistic regression results interpretation when one IV is ordinal

I don't know how to interpret the ordinal variable 'Stress' in my binary logistic regression analysis.'Stress' was measured on a 10 point scale where 1 is 'Least stressed' and 10 is 'Most stressed'. The outcome variable is prosocial behaviour. Edit: I now understand that the variable 'Stress' is not significant (p>.05) but I still would like to know how to interpret it in the case of an ordinal IV being significant. The coefficient is positive (+) which might mean that higher the stress, the higher the likelihood of prosocial behaviour? Could it be this non-specific? How to understand each 'stress' variable in comparison with the other stresses? There are supposed to be 10 (from least to most). Another edit: The seven, eight, night, most (in the table) refer to numbers 7, 8, 9, and 10 (numbers on the scale). So all participant selected one of these numbers (7, 8, 9, 10) to indicate their level of stress. The other numbers on the stress scale weren't selected at all. So none of the numbers referring to lower levels of stress (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were picked. This is why only 4 levels are mentioned in the tables. None of the other levels of stress are present in cases of my data set .
