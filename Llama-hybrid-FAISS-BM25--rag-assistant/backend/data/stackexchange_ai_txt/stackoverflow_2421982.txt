Is it really a big improvement for a webpage to minimize HTML, PHP or CSS files or it doesn't make any big difference?

I saw this HTML minifier in Ajaxian and it made me wonder if its really a big improvement for webpage to minimize HTML, PHP or CSS files or it doesn't make any big difference? (assuming that they are 100 lines long in average)
