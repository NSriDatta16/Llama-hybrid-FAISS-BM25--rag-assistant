Here are some suggestions for optimizing the training time for an SVM with a large dataset: Use a more efficient implementation of the SVM algorithm, such as the LibSVM library, which can be faster than the default SVM implementation in scikit-learn. Use a linear kernel for the SVM, as this can be faster to train than more complex kernels such as the polynomial or RBF kernels. Use the n_jobs parameter to specify the number of CPU cores to use for training the SVM, which can speed up the training process. Use a smaller sample of the dataset for training the SVM, as the processing time will be proportional to the size of the dataset. Use dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA or LDA, to reduce the number of features in the dataset, which can also speed up the training process. Use a coarser grid for hyperparameter tuning, such as increasing the stepsize for the values of the hyperparameters, as this can reduce the number of combinations to be tested. Use a more efficient algorithm for hyperparameter tuning, such as Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms, which can find the optimal hyperparameters in a more efficient manner. Use regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the SVM. Grid_search (RandomizedSearchCV) extremely slow with SVM (SVC)
