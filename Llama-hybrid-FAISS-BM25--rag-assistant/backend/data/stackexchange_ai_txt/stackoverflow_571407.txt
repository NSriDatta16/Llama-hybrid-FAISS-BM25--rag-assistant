WPF: How to implement Drag and Drop with nested (hierarchical) controls

Using WPF I've succeeded at implementing drag and drop to rearrange items within a list(view or box) and also to drag and drop items between lists. Now I am trying figure out how to implement drag and drop with NESTED lists. For instance I have a listview containing projects and each project item contains another listview of tasks. I want to be able to drag and drop to rearrange the order of projects and also to reorder tasks and move them between projects. I have code that successfully does one of the other, but I can't figure out how to do both. It seems like there is some sort of painful solution that would involve hit testing and maybe the z-order of the nested lists, but I can't find any examples of this. Can anybody offer any pointers? FYI: The working code that I currently have implemented is based on the following two excellent articles on WPF drag and drop: http://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/?p=53 http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/ListViewDragDropManager.aspx
