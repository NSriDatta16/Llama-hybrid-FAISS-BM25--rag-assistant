If you check the documentation for TOP : TOP (Transact-SQL) , specifically the first two paragraphs under Remarks, it explicitly states that TOP does not order the rows. As such, the order you've imposed yourself is the one used. Unfortunately, your ordering is incomplete. It only happens to produce what you want sometimes. The correct way is exactly what you've figured out, you need to order by USERID as well.
