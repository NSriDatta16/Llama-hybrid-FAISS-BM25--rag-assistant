hts in R: Convert data.frame into a gts object

I'm a month-old user of RStudio. Currently, I'm working with hierarchical time series analysis with the hts package. After reading my .csv data below, WEEKNUM SITE OPERATIONS ATTRITION 1 201502 DAVAO PRODUCTION 0 2 201503 DAVAO PRODUCTION 3 3 201504 DAVAO PRODUCTION 8 4 201505 DAVAO PRODUCTION 6 5 201506 DAVAO PRODUCTION 9 6 201507 DAVAO PRODUCTION 4 7 201508 DAVAO PRODUCTION 9 ... 592 201623 WM TRAINING 0 I've tried creating the matrix out of it with these codes: Then a matrix was successfully created, however the values were rnorm generated: How do I replace them with the original grouped series values? Or how do I start hts better, with my data import? Thanks and more power! :)
