Passing the shell-command to RSH daemon inside an "ACK" packet

Writing a program on C, using libnet and libpcap to impersonate an RSH client and inject my own command on the server machine, running RSHD. As I understood, the command should be in the 'payload' of the ACK packet, but in the format, that RSHD will pass it to the shell. How should I assemble the packet to achieve this?
