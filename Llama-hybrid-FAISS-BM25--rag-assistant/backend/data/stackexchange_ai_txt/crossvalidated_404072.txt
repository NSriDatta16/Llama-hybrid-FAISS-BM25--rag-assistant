The confusion matrix that you use to calculate RI is different than that of accuracy. Definition of confusion matrix in the Rand Index (RI): +--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | TP: | FN: | | Same class + same cluster | Same class + different clusters | +--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | FP: | TN: | | different class + same cluster | different class + different clusters | +--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+ Another difference between these two is that unlike accuracy, RI is mainly used for clustering (unsupervised learning). The best link to learn RI is Introduction to Information Retrieval book: https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-clustering-1.html Accuracy is sensitive to cluster naming; however, RI is not.
