Entity Framework 4: Inheritance (table per type) - Derived table has a composite PK

Is it possible to have "table per type" inheritance in the Entity Framework 4 if the derived table has a composite primary key? Here is my table setup: TABLE: ConfigurationKey (Base Entity) PK: Id TABLE: ConfigurationKey_Device (Derived Entity) PK: ConfigurationKeyId (FK to ConfigurationKey.Id) PK: DeviceId (FK to Device.Id) For what it's worth, ConfigurationKey is going to be abstract and other types are going to derive from ConfigurationKey. Using the EF designer, I have: Added the inheritance rule Deleted ConfigurationKeyId from ConfigurationKey_Device Deleted the FK linking ConfigurationKey_Device to ConfigurationKey Updated the mapping of the ConfigurationKey_Device.ConfigurationKeyId column to the inherited Id property. The error I am now getting is: Error 3003: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line xxx:All the key properties (ConfigurationKeys.Id) of the EntitySet ConfigurationKeys must be mapped to all the key properties (ConfigurationKey_Device.ConfigurationKeyId, ConfigurationKey_Device.DeviceId) of table ConfigurationKey_Device. Thanks, Chris
