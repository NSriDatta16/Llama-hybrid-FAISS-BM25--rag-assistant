If your COM object needs to believe that it is in a single-threaded environment, use STA. You are guaranteed that the creation and all calls will be made by the same thread. You can safely use Thread local storage and you don't need to use critical sections. If your COM object can be accessed by many threads simultaneously, use MTA -- there will be no guards put in place.
