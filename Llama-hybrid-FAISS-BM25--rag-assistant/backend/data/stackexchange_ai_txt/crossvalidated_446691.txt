Parameter Estimation via MCMC

In general, we use MCMC method to sample from a distribution which is hard to compute. In Bayesian setting, we sample from the posterior distribution of the random parameters defining the underlying distributions via MCMC. My question is, by using MCMC, how can we estimate the parameters? What are the methods out there?
