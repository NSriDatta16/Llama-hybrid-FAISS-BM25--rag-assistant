How can I set the focus for a DevExpress XtraGrid so the mouse wheel works right away?

The UI for my WinForms app is centered around a DevExpress XtraGrid. Usually, the first thing a user wants to do is scroll the grid, so the normal instinct is to move the mouse wheel. But currently, you have to click a row in the grid first, which is annoying. I tried to use BaseView.Focus method, but this did not work - still had to click a row before the wheel would work. Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?
