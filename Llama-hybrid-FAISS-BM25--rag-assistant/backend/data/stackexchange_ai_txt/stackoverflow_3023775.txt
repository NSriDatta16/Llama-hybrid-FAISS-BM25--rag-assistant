Resources for setting up a Visual Studio/C++ development environment

I haven't done much "front-end" development in about 15 years since moving to database development. I'm planning to start work on a personal project using C++ and since I already have MSDN I'll probably end up doing it in Visual Studio 2010. I'm thinking about using Subversion as a version control system eventually. Of course, I'd like to get up and running as quickly as I can, but I'd also like to avoid any pitfalls from a poorly organized project environment. So, my question is, are there any good resources with common best practices for setting up a development environment? I'm thinking along the lines of where to break down a solution into multiple projects if necessary, how to set up a unit testing process, organizing resources, directories, etc. Are there any great add-ons that I should make sure I have set up from the start? Most tutorials just have one simple project, type in your code and click on build to see that your new application says, "Hello World!". This will be a Windows application with several DLLs as well (no web development), so there doesn't need to be a deploy to a web server kind of process. Mostly I just want to make sure that I don't miss anything big and then have to extensively refactor because of it. Thanks!
