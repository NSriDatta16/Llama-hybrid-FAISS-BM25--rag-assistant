It is not the case that $n^{-1} \sum \epsilon = 0$. However, it is the case that $n^{-1} \sum \epsilon \to \mathbb{E}(\epsilon) $ (due to the law of large numbers), and the assumption about the error term is that $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon) = 0$. In other words, $\hat{a} \to a$, meaning that the sample average is a consistent estimator for $a$.
