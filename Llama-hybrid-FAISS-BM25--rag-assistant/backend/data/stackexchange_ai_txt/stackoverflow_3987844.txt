How to create a quality splash screen odd shaped like VS 2010?

I've seen some neat splash screens like VS 2010, Adobe products, etc. I know in VS.NET you can set a transparency color, etc. but I have never been able to make one look nice that didn't have some type of jagged edges or color issues on the edges. For example, I could create a black circle with magenta as the transparent color and I've tried various aliasing options in Adobe PhotoShop CS4. Can anyone steer me or provide an example of how to make a nice one like we see on VS 2010's startup? Thank you
