How do I fix a categorical predictor at a mean value when predicting from a regression model with multiple categorical predictors in R?

It is my understanding that when predicting from a multiple regression model with continuous predictors, the other predictors are often fixed at their mean. What is the equivalent method for a model with all categorical predictors? I am running a GLM of the form: continuous response variable ~ categorical predictor1 + categorical predictor2 + categorical predictor3 So, my question is, how do I fix categorical predictor1 & categorical predictor2 at their mean values to determine the effect of categorical predictor3? I suspect that the answer may relate to the coding of my categorical predictors. Currently, they are 2-level and 3-level factors that are coded as text (e.g., Age has two levels, Female and Male). Do I need to re-code 2-level categorical predictors as 0,1 and 3-level categorical predictors as 0,1,2? ***Note that my original plan was to use emmeans to compare means between groups for a single model. But it turns out there is substantial model uncertainty among the models in my candidate set (several models with delta AIC emmeans is not fully equipped to produce means and contrasts for model-averaged objects. Therefore, I think I need to employ the predict.averaging function from MuMIn to get model-predicted means, but this involves holding some variables constant at their means (see example of what I mean here: https://rdrr.io/cran/MuMIn/man/predict.averaging.html ). Any advice would be very much appreciated.
