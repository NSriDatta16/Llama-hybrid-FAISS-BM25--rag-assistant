What the reviewer may be referring to is the bottom legend of your figure. It goes from 1 to 12, with 4 right in the middle, which is discomforting. This makes your absolute log expression values difficult to interpret, because when a gene goes from bright green to black, its expression level is multiplied by 16, but when it goes from black to bright red, it is multiplied by 256. In short, I don't think your figure could be "more informative", but the information could be more intuitive. As explained by @fosgen, Z-scores are centered and normalized, so the user can interpret a color as $x$ standard deviations from the mean and have an intuitive idea of the relative variation of that value. Like @fosgen, I think you should go for standardization by gene (standardization by cell type does not make sense to me in that context). Black will be the average expression across different cell types (set to 0) and the color distribution will be symmetrical on both sides. Showing the (relative) gene-wise variation of expression is standard in the field, but you might have specific reasons to show the (absolute) log2-microarray measurements, in which case you can expose them to the reviewers. But I would still straigthen the color gradient to ease interpretation.
