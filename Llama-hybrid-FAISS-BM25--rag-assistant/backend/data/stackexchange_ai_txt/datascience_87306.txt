How will my CNN results be affected by large discrepancies between the number of samples in some of the classes?

The number of samples in my dataset range between 3800 and 100,000 per class. Was wondering if my neural network will be more biased towards the classes with a higher number of images. I'm trying on the pretrained resnet152V2 model from Keras.
