JQuery ajax - is it possible to return two different sets of data on success?

Using this ajax request I am returning a view fragment of populated html to insert into a particular div within the layout. my question is how do I declare #theDiv, I have the id available at the point where the view fragment is constructed (within the view_Controller). Ideally I would return some json at the same time for instance, specifying:#theDiv, and any other parameters such as which nav bar element should be active etc.... $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "controller/view_Controller.php", data: dataString, cache: false, dataType: "html", success: function(html){ $('#theDiv').html(html) }; });
