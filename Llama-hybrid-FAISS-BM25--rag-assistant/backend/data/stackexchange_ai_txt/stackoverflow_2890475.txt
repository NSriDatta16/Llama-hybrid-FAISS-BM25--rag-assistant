Disable Code analysis warnings .NET

In visual studios i can run code analysis on my .NET project. I am running basic correctness and have 85 warnings. Which is a little much. Also majority of them are in external code. How do i disable specific warnings so i can focus on the more important warnings? I tried the below but it does not recognize code analysis warnings. (I first tried w/o the CA) #pragma warning disable CA1820 CA1065 CA2100
