I would say that your presentation of the Mann-Whitney U test is slightly sloppy, although in practice it hardly matters. Intuitively, you are in the right direction, but it wouldn't hurt to be more correct. Mixing of concepts "There was no significant difference between females’ opinion (mean Likert score: 3.06 ± 1.095) and males’ opinion (mean Likert score: 3.00 ± 1.113 ) of the importance of being asked x (U = 5813, z = 0.587, p = .5552)." This sentence might be confusing because it is combining three concepts. It is talking about: General differences between distributions: "There was no significant difference between females’ opinion ... and males’ opinion" For this, if you just want to test whether there are any differences, you might better use a chi-squared test. Means of distributions and their error estimates: (mean Likert score: 3.06 ± 1.095) ... (mean Likert score: 3.00 ± 1.113 ) You write scores with confidence intervals or with expressions for the error. For these types of statistics, to compare significance, one would expect something like a t-statistic, instead of a U-statistic. A U-statistic: (U = 5813, z = 0.587, p = .5552) The U-statistic (and related z-score) is a test for equivalence of distributions, but it is only sensitive to a specific type of alternative hypothesis. The Mann-Whitney test is only sensitive for the alternative P(X>Y). A chi-squared test relates to all possible differences between the distributions and might be more intuitive when you wish to express whether the opinions differ. Use the Mann Whitney test when you wish to specifically test the idea that one variable is larger (higher order) than the other (personally I would not do this when you only have 5 categories and variations might be occurring in more than just differences in order). Why Mann-Whitney test is not presented appropriately One aspect is that the Mann-Whitney U test is not a test for differences between means. This, Mann-Whitney U test is used to test differences in means, is a bit implied when you mix those three concepts (described above) in the same sentence. The Mann-Whitney U test relates to the question of stochastic dominance $P(X>Y) \neq 0.5$ and not to the question of different means. On the one hand you can have different means but no stochastic dominance. On the other hand you can have stochastic dominance but not different means. They are different things. In practice they may coincide: for instance, if you envision the same distribution with only a shift in the location then you get that the difference in means will coincide with a difference in stochastic dominance. But in your case I would not use that assumption with 5 points. You are comparing the means of a Likert scale by converting the categories into a scalar number. This might seem right since both the 'Likert scale' and the 'number system/scale' have an order . However, something that is not equal between them is a concept of scale or distance . This does not mean that you can not compare the means. The resulting 'mean' of that scale is a number which you can compare for different groups. However, you need to be careful in the interpretation (the same would be true if you are dealing with actual scalars). Comparing means becomes tricky when distributions differentiate on more aspects than just a shift in the mean. If the distributions are different in more ways than just a shift then the differences in the mean are dependent on the scale. The difference in the mean will not be invariant for a change in the scale. For instance take your distributions: SD D N A SA men 7 15 28 13 8 women 21 17 82 34 18 If you assign the values $1,2,3,4,5$ to those categories then you will get averages $$3.064 = \bar{X}_{women} > \bar{X}_{men} = 3.000$$ but if you assign values $e^2,e^4,e^6,e^8,e^{10}$ to the categories (or anything else that increases the weight of the fifth category) then $$3092 = \bar{X}_{women} About the Mann-Whitney U test Intuitively you can consider the Mann-Whitney U test as comparing something like an empirical joint distribution (the numbers in the cells are the product of the numbers in the margins, e.g. the upper left number $147 = 7 \times 21$ ): $$\begin{array}{cc | cccccccc} &&\text{SD} &\text{D}&\text{N}&\text{A}&\text{SA}\\ & &7 & 15& 28 & 13 & 8\\ \hline \text{SD}&21& \color{gray}{147} & \color{blue}{315} & \color{blue}{588} & \color{blue}{273} & \color{blue}{168}\\ \text{D}&17& \color{red}{119} & \color{gray}{255} & \color{blue}{476} & \color{blue}{221} & \color{blue}{136} \\ \text{N}&82& \color{red}{547} & \color{red}{1230} & \color{gray}{2296} & \color{blue}{1066} & \color{blue}{656}\\ \text{A}&34& \color{red}{238} & \color{red}{510} & \color{red}{952} & \color{gray}{442} & \color{blue}{272} \\ \text{SA}&18 & \color{red}{126} & \color{red}{270}& \color{red}{504} & \color{red}{234} &\color{gray}{144} \\ \end{array}$$ And the question is: Do I get more observations in the upper right corner (men more often higher than women, blue) or in the lower left corner (women more often higher than men, red)? This table relates to the probability that two random men and women from your sample will be equal (gray) or different, men>women (blue) or men You get the following score if you compare how often the men's score is higher than the women's. $$\color{blue}{315+588+273+168+476+221+136+1066+656+272}+\frac{1}{2}\color{gray}{(147+255+2296+442+144)} = 5813$$ You get the following score if you compare how often the women score higher than the men. $$\color{red}{119+574+1230+238+510+952+126+270+504+234}+\frac{1}{2}\color{gray}{(147+255+2296+442+144)} = 6399$$ The distribution of these scores can be imagined by considering randomly ordering the two categories. This is what Mann and Whitney did and they showed that the distribution of the U score is approximately a normal distribution . Graphical representation It may help to plot the percentages of the results. You can see that for women and men you have more or less similar frequencies in the 'strongly disagree' and in the 'agree' and 'strongly agree' categories. It is in the categories 'disagree' and 'neutral' that you see that men are relatively more often in the disagree category and less often in the neutral category (or from the other perspective women less often in the disagree category and more often in the neutral category). These differences are not very large. We can also see this based on a chi-squared test for the equivalence of the two distributions ( $\chi^2 = 5.9037, df = 4, p = 0.2065$ ). But it might be interesting for further investigation to see whether men are often less nuanced (less often 'N') in comparison to women, and in place of that more often slightly negative (more often 'D').
