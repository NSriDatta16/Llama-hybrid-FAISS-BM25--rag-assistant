I think your question could be further defined. The first distinction for churn models is between creating (1) a binary (or multi-class if there are multiple types of churn) model to estimate the probability of a customer churning within or by a certain future point (e.g. the next 3 months) (2) a survival type model creating an estimate of the risk of attrition each period (say each month for the next year) Which of the two is correct for your situation depends on the model use. If you really want to understand the attrition risk over time and perhaps understand how (possibly time-varying) variables interact with time then a survival model is appropriate. For a lot of customer models, I prefer to use discrete time hazard models for this purpose because time is often discrete in databases and the hazard estimate is a probability of the event. Cox regression is another popular choice but time is treated as continuous (or via adjustment for ties) but the hazard is technically not a probability. For most churn models, where a company is interested in targeting those x% of customers most at risk and the database is scored each time a targeting campaign launches, the binary (or multi-class) option is normally what is needed. The second choice is how to estimate the models. Do you use a traditional statistical model such as logistic regression for the binary (multi-class) model or a machine learning algorithm (e.g. random forest). The choice is based on which gives the most accurate model and what level of interpretability is required. For discrete time hazard models, a logistic regression is typically used with splines to introduce non-linear effects of time. This can also be done with neural networks and many other types of ML algorithms as the setup is simply supervised learning with a "person-period" data set. Further, cox regression can be fit with traditional algorithms like SAS proc phreg or R coxph(). Machine learning algorithm GBM also fits cox regression with a selected loss function. As has been mentioned, ML algorithms for survival analysis using random forests and other tree based methods have also been developed and there are many within R.
