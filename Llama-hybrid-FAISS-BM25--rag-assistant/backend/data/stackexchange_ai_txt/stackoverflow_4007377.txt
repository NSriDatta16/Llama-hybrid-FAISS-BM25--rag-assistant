omg you most likely just solved the misterious problem that almost killed me ^_^ i was trying to re-create an swf file from a dump: `[SWF] Header: Version: 10 FileLength: 623 FileLengthCompressed: 454 FrameSize: (180,160) FrameRate: 8 FrameCount: 10 Tags: [69:FileAttributes] AS3: true, HasMetadata: false, UseDirectBlit: false, UseGPU: false, UseNetwork: false [09:SetBackgroundColor] Color: #666666 [86:DefineSceneAndFrameLabelData] Scenes: [0] Frame: 0, Name: Scene 1 [83:DefineShape4] ID: 1, ShapeBounds: (-100,1100,-100,1100), EdgeBounds: (0,1000,0,1000) FillStyles: [1] [SWFFillStyle] Type: 0 (solid), Color: FFFF0000 LineStyles:`(and so on) using as3swf (a library which uses almost only bytecode inside itself) but today (with a fresh-downloaded flex sdk 4.1) all i got was a strange trace (recieved many times): [SWF] Version: 10 FileLength: 21 FileLengthCompressed: 21 FrameSize: (14,14) FrameRate: 50 FrameCount: 1 Tags: and the strangest thing for me was that it was a trace of global storage ByteArray variable that most likely was only read during the runtime, but the information it was storing didn't have just some part missing - almost every value changed so thank you for your answer, it explained a lot for me)
