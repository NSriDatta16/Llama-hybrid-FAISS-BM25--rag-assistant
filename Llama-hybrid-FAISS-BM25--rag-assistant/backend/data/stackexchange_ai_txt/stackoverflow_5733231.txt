Bitmap scaling to fit different screen size/density

I do not really understand all those things about pixel density and device independant pixels and I want to know if I should worry about this. More specifically, here is how my application work right now: For the “layout screens”, I’m using RelativeLayout or LinearLayout and I never use pixels or dp, so I guess that this will look good on every device For the main game screen, there is only a SurfaceView on the screen. With the values given by onSurfaceCreated() (pixels or dp? I don’t know), I compute the size and position of every element of the game, then I load the Bitmaps (with BitmapFactory.decodeResource() and then Bitmap.createScaledBitmap() ) and put them on the screen with drawBitmap() I tested on my phone (480 × 800 hdpi) and on the emulator (240 × 320 mdpi), and both looks good. My questions are: Is this the right thing to do? I do not understand how (and why) I could use the fact that some devices are hdpi and others are mdpi. Should I provide different bitmaps for different screen densities, and why? (right now I have everything in res/drawable-hdpi ) What size should my .png have? Can I create them much bigger (2 ×) than their expected size, in order to be sure that this will not look blur or aliased?
