There are a number of methods for this. Here's a list: You can build a Regression model and observe the p-values of the coefficients of each variable. Pearson Correlation Spearman Correlation Kendall Correlation Mutual Information RReliefF algorithm Decision trees Principal Component Analysis (which you have tried) etc. You can search for other methods with these keywords: feature selection, variable importance, variable ranking, parameter selection They are all almost the same, just different terminology in different fields. However, the issue that you MUST pay attention here is "10" observations are almost nothing. It will be extremely difficult to trust any outcome, regardless of the method you use.
