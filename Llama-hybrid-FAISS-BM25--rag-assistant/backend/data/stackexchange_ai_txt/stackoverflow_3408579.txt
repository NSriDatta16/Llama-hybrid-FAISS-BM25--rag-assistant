Found it! 0xA3 gave me the hint I needed with: "you are not using the version of the code that you think you are using" When I added the Collections reference to the Organization project, it did not checkmark the Collections project to compile in the Configurations Manager. In other words, my Collections DLL was not compiling unless I did it by hand. Thank you, that's what I meant by an extra set of eyes. :-)
