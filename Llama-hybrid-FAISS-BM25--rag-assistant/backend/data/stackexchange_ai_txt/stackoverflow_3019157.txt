I am trying to read all lines of code from a .java file, excluding comments. (Are you trying to extract the code, or simply count the lines of code?) A simple line-by-line approach you is probably not going to be entirely accurate. For example consider this: /* The next line is wrong: res = 1 / 0; */ A line-by-line analysis will conclude that the second line is code ... when it is actually comment. Another problem with trying to use regexes is that there are all sorts of edge cases. For example: System.err.println("/* hello mum "); System.err.println("*/"); Or \u002f* This is a comment *\u002f I'm not saying that regexes cannot be used. I'm just saying that your code will be simpler and probably less fragile if you use proper Java parser.
