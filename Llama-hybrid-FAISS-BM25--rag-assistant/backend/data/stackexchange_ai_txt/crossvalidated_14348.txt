Are you running a statistical arbitrage strategy? If so, there are other (perhaps more relevant) questions at hand. For example, say your test shows that the two stocks' returns are cointegrated (you are using returns, right?). If the cointegrating vector were such that the two legs of your position don't have opposite market value, then you're potentially holding a whole lot of exposure to generic stock market beta. That's not good for statistical arbitrage purposes, since it's supposed to be a market-neutral strategy. Instead, I would difference the two returns series yourself, and then run a stationarity test against that difference series. This way, you'll be testing whether going short one and long the other will yield a reasonably safe stat arb. So basically, because of your particular situation, you need to enforce (IMHO) that your two legs be equal magnitude and opposite direction. There is a small simplification even there, and I suppose you could beta-adjust the two return series to give you a beta-neutral position (slightly better than just MV-neutral) but that could be overkill. The pair trade usually goes down with equal market values in the two directions.
