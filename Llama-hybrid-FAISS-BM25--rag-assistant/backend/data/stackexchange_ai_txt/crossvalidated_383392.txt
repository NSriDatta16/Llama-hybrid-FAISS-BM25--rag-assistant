Identifying treatment selection and outcomes with logistic regression

We have 300 patients who underwent either surgery or a non-surgical treatment. We listed serious complications, regardless of what treatment they received. Other descriptive measures include age, sex, weight, smoking status, etc. We want to answer the question: "Does surgery increase the risk of having a serious complication?" We also want to answer the question: "What variable(s) predict surgical treatment vs non-surgical?" For the first question, we plan to run a multiple logistic regression with any serious complication as the outcome and treatment choice as the main effect. For the second question, we plan to run a multiple logistic regression, with treatment choice as dependent and the descriptive variables (age, sex, etc.) as independent variables. This should tell us whether patients who smoke (for example) have a higher chance of being assigned a non-surgical method of treatment, correcting for age, weight, etc. Does our method sound correct or are there any glaring holes in our approach?
