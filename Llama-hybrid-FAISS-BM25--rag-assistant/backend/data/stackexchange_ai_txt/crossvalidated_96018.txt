Joint Confidence Interval

Given the following model: ${\rm Wage}_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 {\rm Married}_i+\beta_2{\rm Female}_i+\beta_3 {\rm Married}_i \times {\rm Female}_i + \varepsilon_i$, I am interested in finding $\beta_1+\beta_3$ for different quantiles of the dependent variable (i.e. on average, how much more/less does married females make compared to single females for a given quantile). I already have the results of the quantile regression model, and I calculated $\beta_1+\beta_3$ for all quantile levels. However, I am trying to find a confidence interval for $\beta_1+\beta_3$ to determine whether this quantity is statically significant for a given quantile level. One thing that came to mind is the Bonferroni joint confidence interval. Using this method I was able to find a lower bound for the joint confidence interval for each of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_3$, but I am not sure how to find a confidence interval for the sum of the two covariates. Would it be correct to sum the two confidence intervals that we got (I didn't find evidence that support this approach)? Is there a way to determine such a confidence interval? Appreciate your help. Thanks.
