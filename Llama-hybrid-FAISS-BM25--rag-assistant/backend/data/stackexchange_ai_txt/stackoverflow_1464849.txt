You can override the Zend_Db_Table_Abstract:: _fetch() method and modify the generated Zend_Db_Table_Select in there before retrieving the rows from the database adapter. As far as I know all fetch* -methods and find() in Zend_Db_Table_Abstract boil down to this generic row-retrieval-method (besides Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::fetchNew() naturally), so your modified code will be called everytime rows are retrieved from the database. /** * Support method for fetching rows. * * @param Zend_Db_Table_Select $select query options. * @return array An array containing the row results in FETCH_ASSOC mode. */ protected function _fetch(Zend_Db_Table_Select $select) { $select->where('deleted = false')->order('name asc'); return parent:: _fetch($select); }
