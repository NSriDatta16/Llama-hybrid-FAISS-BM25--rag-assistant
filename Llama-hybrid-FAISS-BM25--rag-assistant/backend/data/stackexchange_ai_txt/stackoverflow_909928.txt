Qt: mouseMoveEvent and interfer with hoverEnterEvent of child object

I use QGraphicsView to create a sort of circut editor, which has elements in it, which have connectors. It should be possible to connect those connectors with wires. However, I have a problem, while I drag from one connector to another, Qt grabs mouse, and other connectors stop receiving hoverEnterEvent . Btw, on hover connectors resize, so it's easier to hit them. Once again, is it possible not to grab mouse while drag? I have used Qt 4.5 for Windows. As requested, here are some sources: http://pastebin.com/m422b9495
