how to find out the likelihood of a model given data

If i have a non-stochastic model that predicts the following dataset: [.2, .2] and the actual dataset found empirically (averaged over participants) is [.3, .3] How would I determine the likelihood of the model? p(Data|Model) What if the data was: [.2, .2] Would the likelihood be 1.0? What is the procedure for calculating model likelihood?
