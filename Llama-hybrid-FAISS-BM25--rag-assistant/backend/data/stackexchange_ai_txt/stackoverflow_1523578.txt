This is how I work, YMMV: Keep a spreadsheet for high level of everything - list of your projects, and some top-level items/todos/reminders Create a "project" folder for each product/project you have or work on, and create a strucuture to contain documentation and code for the project. Keep a top-level "catch-all" document for each project, in the root of this folder. Keep you ideas, research, notes etc in this doc. Then if you want to get organized, keep an MS project file (or similar) and plot out timelines for the various steps in each project. This is good for tracking progress on each project and make sure you arent forgetting anything. Basically keeps you honest with yourself. And if you need to track progress on project work you are doing for clients, I understand Basecamp is a good solution for this. I am currently evaluating it for my own company.
