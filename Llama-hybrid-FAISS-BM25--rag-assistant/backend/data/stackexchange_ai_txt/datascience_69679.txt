Determine statistically whether new product cannibalise old product by using data

Assume that $A$ is a cab company which offers online cab booking through their standard account. Recently, the company launched a pre-paid premium account with features such as discounted rides,special offers, guaranteed pick up and low waiting time. A survey is conducted to public and it shows that the response to the new premium account is encouraging. Question: Does the encouraging response stem from new customers or existing customers? We are given a data consisting of time (booking is placed), pick-up and drop-off location, journey fees, ride type (premium or standard), customer demographic and pricing information. I am totally lost here. What can we do to answer the question above? Any hint is appreciated. If I were asked to determine whether customers have any fixed budget to transport, how can I solve it using data above? My plan is to split the spending into monthly sales, then calculate their means. Let's say we have $12$ sample means and sample variances. Since the sample variances might not be equal, I employ Welch ANOVA test. Is this sufficient?
