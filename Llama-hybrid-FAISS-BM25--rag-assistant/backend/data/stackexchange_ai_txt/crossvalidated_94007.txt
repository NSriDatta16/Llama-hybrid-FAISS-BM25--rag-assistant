Yes, it becomes linearly separable, especially if you always use the RBF kernel which maps to infinite dimensional space. When people talk about soft margin, it is different from what you are thinking. The SVM by design expects that the functional margin [1] for the two classes be atleast 1. This requirement, however, need not be always satisfied, since this requirement is stricter than just being linearly separable. Thereby, you introduce slack variables to accommodate points that don't satisfy the functional margin requirement.
