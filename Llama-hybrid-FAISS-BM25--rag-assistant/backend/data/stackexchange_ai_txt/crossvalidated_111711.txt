It is a Lilliefors test, and your first and third items are pretty close to how to do it. The statement that Lilliefors test is only for the normal distribution is wrong. He did one for the exponential as well (you can even see that in the references at the bottom of the Wikipedia page you linked to), and the technique should work with quite a few other distributions. However, I don't think you quite have it right. There are a couple of ways of organizing it, but one approach that works for continuous distributions is as follows: Repeat many times: Simulate a sample of the desired sample size from the assumed distribution. Estimate the parameters of the distribution. Treating the estimated parameters as the population values, transform to uniformity via the probability integral transform . (You can compute a KS statistic without transforming at this step; however, it makes the computation a bit simpler.) Compute a KS test statistic. Collect the simulated statistics, and work out the proportion of times the simulated statistic is at least as extreme (more consistent with $H_1$) as the observed sample value. If you have it right you should be able to reproduce the results for Lilliefors paper (to the limited accuracy he had, anyway.
