How do you customize the drop highlight for a NSTableView?

The highlighting I want is for it to draw the drop indicator between rows and to never highlight an entire row. How can I do this with the 10.5 SDK? Since I am using the 10.5 SDK, I don't have access to -setDraggingDestinationFeedbackStyle: which is available in the 10.6 SDK.
