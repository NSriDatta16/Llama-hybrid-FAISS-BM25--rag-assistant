Does it make sense for a reduced parameter space to improve SVM?

I have seen the following claim in a paper: There are four real variables $a,b,c,d$ and a class label $y$. A support vector machine (SVM) was incapable of determining $y$ from $a,b,c,d$ without error, but it was able to do it based on the reduced parameter space $a/b, c, d$ (i.e. $a$ divided by $b$ as one of the features). I would think that if $a/b$ were such a valuable feature, SVM would be able to find it. Is this not the case?
