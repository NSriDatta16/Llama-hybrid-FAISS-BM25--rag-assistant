NLP lab, linux or windows and which programming languages?

I would like to do some data mining and NLP experiments to do some research I have decided to use NLTK or related tools and software Which environment or operating system do you suggest for my purpose? I mean doing research on NLP Windows or Linux? I am a user of Windows but I thought if Linux has better shell and related software for NLP tasks then I switch to Linux What is your experience and your preferred OS? As NLTK is in Python I thought Python is a good language for my purpose, do you suggest Python too?
