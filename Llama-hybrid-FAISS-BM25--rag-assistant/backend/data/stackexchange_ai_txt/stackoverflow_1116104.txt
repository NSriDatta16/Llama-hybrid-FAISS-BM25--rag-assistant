How do I refresh a DataGrid at timed intervals in F#?

I have a background thread updating an array. At timed intervals I call myDataGrid.Items.Refresh(). However nothing changes on the screen. But when I for instance click on the column heading of the data grid on the screen the information is actualized immediately.
