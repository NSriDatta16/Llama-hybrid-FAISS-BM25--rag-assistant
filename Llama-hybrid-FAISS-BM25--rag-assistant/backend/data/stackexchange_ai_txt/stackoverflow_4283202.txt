Trial version grace period

How should I implement a full-featured grace period or N-uses scheme to maximise sales of my small $5 social network Windows application, while encouraging continued use of a limited version by users who are never (not yet?) going to pay for it? Grace-period options: Use-limited. After 20 uses, cripple it. Calendar days time-limited. After 30 days after first-use, the software is crippled. Actual use-days time-limited, eg. 7 days. If used for seven days over the course of 7+N days, cripple it after the seventh day. Time-limited. After 20 hours of use or play, cripple it. Combination of the above with progressive crippling and optional nag screens. Nag screens, which I am averse to. Crippling software is not favoured by all (especially the open-source camp), but I have to base my decision on happy users and making a living, so I have compiled the findings I side with on limiting software below. My trialware conclusions so far: Focus on making your software good rather than spending time on thwarting crackers. If it is popular enough, it will eventually be reverse engineered. Let the client enjoy the full functionality of your software...for a while. Dependent users are more likely to buy. Crippled software can sell 5 times more than software with donation nag screens, assuming it is any good. Make paying as easy as humanly possible. Perceived value counts, but keeping the price low may lead to impulse buys. Pricing is really hard . Offering a 100% no-questions-asked money-back guarantee will lead to more sales. I intend to cripple my demo version, but I do want trial users to experience all the features. It's a smallish consumer application with a potentially large user base, so I'm looking at pricing it at ~$5 , but I don't know. It may be worth $50 to some users or $1. I'll leave pricing for later. This is about crippling software. An answer supported by real-world data grouped by software type would be more helpful, but any thoughts on this are appreciated.
