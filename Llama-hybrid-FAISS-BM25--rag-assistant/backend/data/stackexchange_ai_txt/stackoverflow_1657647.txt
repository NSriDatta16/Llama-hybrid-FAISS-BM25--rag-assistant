Defragmenting Windows Drives as part of an NSIS installer script?

I need to install a piece of software with a lot of files. Our experience showed, that on highly fragmented hard drives that leads to very poor performance. So I want to include automatic disk defragmentation into my installer (which I plan to write using NSIS). How can I include a defrag command and read the results as part of my installer?
