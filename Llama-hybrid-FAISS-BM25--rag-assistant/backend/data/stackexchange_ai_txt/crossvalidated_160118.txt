Unconnected Linearly Seperable Classification

Consider classifying something like the case shown below (exagerated syntetic example): If this were a task to classsify into 3 groups, (blue-left, red, blue-right), then a Linear Support Vector Machine would work great. But this is not a classification into 3 groups, just into two (blue, red). What classifiers can handle this? is a SVM, or a varient there of, still viable?
