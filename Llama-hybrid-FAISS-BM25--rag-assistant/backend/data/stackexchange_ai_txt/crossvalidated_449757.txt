OLR with rms: proportional odds assumption

I am fitting an ordinal logistic regression model with rms package. my data involves a three-level ordered outcome (see reproducible data below), as well as continuous and binary predictors: fit to test for the proportional odds assumption I've plotted partial residuals (see below): fit1 =1 ~ grp + sprt + chrs + age + gndr + prg + tm, x=TRUE, y=TRUE, data = df) fit2 But as I'm new to this I am unsure if the assumption is met for each of the predictors. Help? THANKS df
