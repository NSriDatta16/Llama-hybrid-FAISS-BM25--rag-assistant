This is the difference between physical model and conceptual model. In physical model you use junction able to define M:N relation because relation databases don't support it natively. In conceptual model you do not deal with physical storage. Junction table is not included in conceptual model because it is not needed. You don't need to access it, you need to access Tags related to Questions or Questions related to Tags. Those relations are directly accessible by navigation properties. Junction table will be automatically added to model only if it contains additional columns (not only FKs to build M:N relation). It is also possible to manually modify (EF4) model and force it to add entity for junction table.
