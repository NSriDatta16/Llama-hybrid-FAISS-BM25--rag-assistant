The UIScrollView has a property called delaysContentTouches . This is set to YES by default, which results in the behaviour that you want: dragging always works, even if you tap on for example a UIButton . So, if you do not see that behaviour then maybe you have set delaysContentTouches to NO ? Also, instead of using UIImageView s in your scrollview, and overriding their touchedBegan: and friends, it is probably much easier to simply use UIButton s instead. You can simply set the button's image to whatever you want, and you do not have to subclass them. Simply use addTarget: to make the buttons do a callback to your viewcontroller when they are clicked. (This is the same as making a connection to an IBAction using Interface Builder)
