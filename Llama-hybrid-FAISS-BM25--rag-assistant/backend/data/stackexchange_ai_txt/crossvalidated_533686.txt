Reading up on the background of generalized linear models (glm) may help. The Wikipedia article may help: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model Generalized linear models work with distributions that can be factored into a certain pattern (Exponential family), part of that factoring gives what is called the "canonical link" function between the mean of the distribution and the linear combination of the predictors. In the case of the Poisson distribution the canonical link is the natural log. You can use other link functions, but the canonical link has some theoretical benefits and is the default for most software. You do not have to use the log, but without good reason to use another link function, it makes the most sense. There are multiple ways to create confidence intervals, the intervals where you take the maximum likelihood estimate and add and subtract a constant times the standard error is called a Wald Style interval. The constant to multiply actually comes from a chi-squared distribution, but since the chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom is just a standard Gaussian squared, the constant is the same for a single estimated interval. These intervals work well when the estimate of the standard error is stable at the ML estimate and the likelihood function is close to symmetric around the ML estimate. This is exact in the case of a Gaussian likelihood, but is a pretty good approximation most of the time for the Poisson and can be reasonable for the Binomial and other distributions, and it is fairly quick and simple, so a good starting place. But there are also cases where the Wald style intervals do not work well (the main example I am aware of is with the binomial/logistic regression, google for Hauk-Donner effect) and the likelihood ratio or other intervals become much preferred.
