How to determine variable importance for feature selection with glmnet?

Sorry about this question because it has already been asked but I am really lost to find how to determine the variable importance in glmnet?? Variable importance here refer to, for instance, the Random Forest varImp() function, whit which you can see which feature drives the most the target attribute. With the regularization, looking only at the unstandardized coefficients doesn't help and I am not sure I can access the standardized coefficient from the glmnet object. I tried: lasso$beta Which returns: 35 x 1 sparse Matrix of class "dgCMatrix" s0 (Intercept) . samp_eff 1.414232e-01 B1_cv . B2_cv . B3_cv -7.529949e-04 B4_cv -2.339615e-03 B5_cv -4.571802e-04 B6_cv . B7_cv 3.745669e-04 B10_cv -5.131828e-02 ndvi_cv . ndvi_water_cv . ndwi_cv . evi_cv 1.293439e-03 B1_rao . B2_rao . B3_rao . B4_rao -3.316356e+00 B5_rao -3.015584e+00 B6_rao . B7_rao 1.437572e-03 ndwi_rao . ndvi_rao -7.407094e-04 min_alt 3.175029e-04 max_alt . av_alt -2.147137e-04 diff_alt . cluster_corine2 1.769418e-02 cluster_corine3 4.910332e-03 cluster_corine4 2.250217e-02 corine_1 -8.217931e-05 corine_2 2.547073e-02 corine_3 1.818796e-02 corine_4 . corine_5 4.997473e-02 If I order these coefficients, can I consider them as the importance order? I am not sure about the meaning of the lass$beta output. As a second step, I tried to use the varImp() function on my lasso regularization as follow: varImp(lasso, lambda = cv_lasso$lambda.min) Which returns: Overall 1 3.749767e+00 2 0.000000e+00 3 1.414232e-01 4 0.000000e+00 5 0.000000e+00 6 7.529949e-04 7 2.339615e-03 8 4.571802e-04 9 0.000000e+00 10 3.745669e-04 11 5.131828e-02 12 0.000000e+00 13 0.000000e+00 14 0.000000e+00 15 1.293439e-03 16 0.000000e+00 17 0.000000e+00 18 0.000000e+00 19 3.316356e+00 20 3.015584e+00 21 0.000000e+00 22 1.437572e-03 23 0.000000e+00 24 7.407094e-04 25 3.175029e-04 26 0.000000e+00 27 2.147137e-04 28 0.000000e+00 29 1.769418e-02 30 4.910332e-03 31 2.250217e-02 32 8.217931e-05 33 2.547073e-02 34 1.818796e-02 35 0.000000e+00 36 4.997473e-02 The thing is that I don't know 1) if they are the standardized coefficient and 2) to which feature correspond each coefficient (there's no row names) Cheers
