A possible way to estimate the significance of the cross-correlation function (CCF) could be to simulate two uncorrelated time series with similar variability properties (i.e. same power spectrum) and then cross-correlate them. This will give you the estimate of the CCF if the two time series were completely uncorrelated. The distribution of the values of the CCF for large N will be Gaussian centred in 0. At this point you can compare the sigma from the Gaussian and the value of your CCF and see if the CCF is significant or not.
