Read pixel data from an image file in .NET

I am trying to read in the pixel data from an image file as a byte[] , for in-memory storage. (The byte array will later be fed to a bitmap image object, but I want the data in memory so that there's no I/O holdup.) This is what I'm currently doing: private byte[] GetImageBytes(Uri imageUri) { //arraySize and stride previously defined var pixelArray = new byte[arraySize]; new BitmapImage(imageUri).CopyPixels(pixelArray , stride, 0); return pixelArray ; } I am wondering if someone knows of a way to get the byte[] data other than making a BitmapImage and then copying all of the bytes out. I.e. is there a .NET class that will just stream pixel data from the file? (I was originally using File.ReadAllBytes , but that brings in other stuff like the image metadata, and wasn't working out.)
