How can I transpose a high dimensional dataset?

I have a ( .csv ) file with more than 35,000 rows and 100 columns, where the rows represent the attributes and columns represent the instances. In Excel the maximum number of columns is 16,384 . Therefore, it is impossible to do this in one single Excel sheet. I need my dataset to be transposed in order to perform some machine learning algorithms in WEKA. Is there any tool allow such thing like this? Also, is there a way to transpose ( .arff ) file in WEKA?
