How does ACE_Remote_Mutex work?

I wrote two small programs which tried to acquire the same Remote Mutex named "The Token": ACE_Remote_Mutex token("The Token", 1, 1); token.acquire(); ACE_OS::sleep(5); token.release(); return 0; Both of them got the following debug output: (3078597488) acquired The Token (4243|3078597488) BIG PROBLEMS with get_connection: Connection refused error on remote acquire, releasing shadow mutex. (3078597488) released The Token, owner is no owner (4243|3078597488) BIG PROBLEMS with get_connection: Connection refused (3078597488) release failed: Permission denied. (3078597488) shadow: release failed Does ACE_Remote_Mutex work only with some sort of "agent" like Corba broker? Can I modify my code?
