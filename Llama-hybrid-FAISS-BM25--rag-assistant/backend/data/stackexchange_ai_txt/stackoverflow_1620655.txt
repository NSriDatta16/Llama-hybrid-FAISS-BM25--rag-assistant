Have you considered that it's easily possible to modify an FSM in response to stimulus? It is just a table of numbers after all, you can hold it in memory somewhere and change the numbers as you go. I wrote about it a bit in one of my blog fuelled deleriums, and it oddly got picked up by some Game AI news site. Then the guy who built a Ms. Pacman AI that could beat humans and got on the real news left a comment on my blog with a link to even more useful information here's my blog post with my incoherant ramblings about some idea I had about using markov chains to continually adapt to a game environment, and perhaps overlay and combine something that the computer has learned about how the player reacts to game situations. http://bustingseams.blogspot.com/2008/03/funny-obsessive-ideas.html and here's the link to the awesome resource about reinforcement learning that mr. smarty mcpacman posted for me. http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Esutton/book/ebook/the-book.html here's another cool link http://aigamedev.com/open/architecture/online-adaptation-game-opponent/ These are not neural net approaches, but they do adapt and continually learn, and are probably better suited to games than neural networks.
