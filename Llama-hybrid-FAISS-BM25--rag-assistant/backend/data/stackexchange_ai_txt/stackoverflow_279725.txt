Failure is to be expected here, because a macro is used when its argument should not be evaluated. In your first make-package-from-path, the def-dynamic-package will receive as argument a list that is EQUAL to the value of the following expression: (list 'pathname-name 'path) In your case, you only want a function: (defun def-dynamic-package (name) (defpackage (string-upcase name) (:use :common-lisp))) BTW, if you check the CLHS , you'll see that the first argument of defpackage needn't be a symbol, but any string designator .
