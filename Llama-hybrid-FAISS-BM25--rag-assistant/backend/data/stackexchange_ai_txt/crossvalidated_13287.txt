Help with cointegration problem

Please excuse me if my question is dumb but I am not a Statistics student. I have a project where I was exploring options for time series analysis where I found some papers on cointegration. I have 4 variables. One of them response variable. I wanted to to the forecasting using the cointegration technique. Please tell me if I am wrong whether the technique to use is a Johansen test. However I understand that the test needs a requirement that the variables are unit root (right?). So I took the software R and did the ADF test in R on each variable (and the first difference ) . But some variables dont pass the adf test. My question is: Is my thinking above right? Then, what do i do for the variables which dont pass the ADF test for unit root ? Can I still take those in the johansen test? If so, what is the purpose of the ADF test at all? @mpiktas Here I performed the ADF test and here are the results I got: yt.adf Null Hypothesis not rejected (Non Stationary) dyt.adf Null Hypothesis not rejected (Non Stationary) X1t.adf Null hypothesis rejected (Stationary) dX1t.adf Null hypothesis rejected (Stationary) X3t.adf Null hypothesis rejected (Stationary) dX3t.adf Null Hypothesis not rejected (Non Stationary) X4t.adf Null Hypothesis not rejected (Non Stationary) dX4t.adf Null Hypothesis not rejected (Non Stationary) yt.adf is the response variable while dyt.adf is the firs difference. Similarly other variables. As seen here, I suppose the inference is that none (yt, X1t,X2t,X2t,X4t) are unit root? So then I cant apply johansen test for cointegration,can I?
