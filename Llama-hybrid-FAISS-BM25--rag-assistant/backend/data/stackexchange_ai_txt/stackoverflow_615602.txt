Given there's no indication why you need the size, and that the size can change if the window style is set to include resizable attributes [and the user resizes the window using minimize/maximize/restore or drags a window edge], your safest choice is to include a message handler for WM_SIZE and use the wparam and lparam parameter values to determine window dimensions. This way, you'll always know the current size. WM_SIZE is called in the sequence of messages post window creation.
