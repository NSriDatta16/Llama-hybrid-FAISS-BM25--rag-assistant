Detect the specific iPhone/iPod touch model in Javascript

I am developing a website for Apple i* devices which uses HTML5 webkit features like transitions but I want to disable some of the fancy stuff for older/slower iPhone models like iPhone Is there a way to detect the exact model (not just the OS/User Agent) within Javascript?
