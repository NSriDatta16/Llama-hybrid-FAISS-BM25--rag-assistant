How to simulate the delete key on UITextField?

I'm creating an application on the iPad. I create a custom keyboard using UITextField 's inputView property. To insert text at the cursor position, I use the copy & paste method ( http://dev.ragfield.com/2009/09/insert-text-at-current-cursor-location.html ), which works fine. Now, I want to create the delete key. The code that I'm using is: if (textField.text.length > 0) { textField.text = [textField.text substringToIndex:textField.text.length-1]; } However, as you may know, it only deletes the last character no matter where the cursor is. Does anyone know a better solution? Thank you very much!
