Ive been looking into doing this project proposal - "8.1 " from the "Theory and praxis in programming language" research group from the University of Copenhagen - department of CS: 8.1 Automated Harvesting and Statistical Analysis of Music Corpora Traditional analysis of sheet music consists of one or more persons analysing rhythm, chord sequences and other characteristics of a single piece, set in the context of an often vague comparison of other pieces by the same composer or other composers from the same period. Traditional automated analysis of music has barely treated sheet music, but has focused on signal analysis and the use of machine learning techniques to extract and classify within, say, mood or genre. In contrast, incipient research at DIKU aims to automate parts of the analysis of sheet music. The added value is the potential for extracting information from large volumes of sheet music that cannot easily be done by hand and cannot be meaningfully analysed by machine learning techniques. This - as I see it - is the opposite direction of your question the data generated - I imagine - could be used in some instances of procedural generation of music.
