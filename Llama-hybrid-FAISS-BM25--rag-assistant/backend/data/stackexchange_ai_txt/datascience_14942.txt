Use of Correlation Map in Machine Learning

I would like to know the use of correaltion map in machine leraning. For example, if there are 2 features with high correaltion, should either of the features be removed before appying the algorithm or it depends on every data set. Any explanation would be highly helpful. Thanks in advance.
