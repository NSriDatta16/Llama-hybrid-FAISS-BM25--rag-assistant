If you are throwing the exception right after you catch it -- that is essentially the same as not having a try / catch block at all. Catch specific exceptions that might occur. For instance, you try to save a file but for some reason it cannot be written: try { SaveFile(); } catch(FileIsReadOnlyException) { //do whatever to recover } catch(Exception ex) { //If we hit the generic exception, we're saying that we basically have //no idea what went wrong, other than the save failed. // //Depending on the situation you might want to sink and log it, i.e. do nothing //but log it so you can debug and figure out what specific exception handler to //add to your code -- or you might want to try to save to a temporary file and //exit the program. // //If you were UpdatingAnAdvertisement() or doing something else non-critical //to the functioning of the program, you might just let it continue and //do nothing. // //In that case, you can just omit the generic catch. }
