Dismissing the keyboard for a UITextField in UIAlertView

I have a Customized UIAlertView.I have a UITextField in that AlertView, which becomes the firstResponder as soon as it is shown. Now I need to dismiss the keyboard for that UITextField when user touches somewhere else in the AlertView. I have touchesBegan event for that. Everything is in place and works fine, except when I call resignFirstResponder on the UITextField, it resigns from being the first responder but the keyboard is not dismissed. Is there any way to dismiss that keyboard. I was looking for the solutions and found a similar post here with no answers If anyone was able to find a way out please let me know. I even tried the following way, but its not working UIWindow* tempWindow; // Because we cant get access to the UIKeyboard throught the SDK we will just use UIView. // UIKeyboard is a subclass of UIView anyways UIView* keyboard; // Check each window in our application for(int c = 0; c
