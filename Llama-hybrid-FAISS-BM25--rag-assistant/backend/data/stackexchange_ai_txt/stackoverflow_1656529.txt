What you need to understand is the difference between block and inline elements and that both come from a rather text oriented philosophy. Block elements, like or , will push each other down, i.e. they won't appear on the same "line" next to each other but behave more like paragraphs. Inline elements, like and , on the other hand behave like text. They line up next to each other on the same line as long as there's space, then they wrap onto the next line by moving down, then left until they hit an obstacle and start the procedure again. Applying a height to an inline element will have a different result than applying it to a block level element. It probably won't visibly affect the inline element immediately, but might have an effect on other nearby block level elements by pushing them away. If you throw float into the mix though, it gets a bit tricky, since floated elements behave a bit like both block and inline elements. Block level elements will largely ignore floated elements, i.e. a floated element inside a block level element won't contribute to the total height of said block level element. OTOH, inline elements will "interact" with floated elements by floating around them (this behavior was designed for images embedded in text paragraphs). Floated elements will largely behave like inline elements amongst themselves. -- div (block) ----------------------------------- | inline inline inline -- img (floated right) -- | | inline inline inline | | | | inline inline inline | | | | inline inline inline ------------------------- | | inline inline inline inline inline inline | | inline inline inline inline inline | -------------------------------------------------- -- div (block) ----------------------------------- | inline inline inline -- img (floated right) -- | | inline inline inline | | | -----------------------| |-- ------------------------- (the float is not contributing to the div's height) The easiest way to have two inputs appear next to each other with a third one below is probably like this: -- div (block) --------------------------- | input (inline) input (inline) | ------------------------------------------ -- div (block) --------------------------- | input (inline) | ------------------------------------------ You can either code your HTML like this, or manipulate your existing HTML via CSS to behave like this ( display: block / display: inline ). Welcome to the world of CSS. It's not really all that hard in principle, you just need to get away from the table thinking. :)
