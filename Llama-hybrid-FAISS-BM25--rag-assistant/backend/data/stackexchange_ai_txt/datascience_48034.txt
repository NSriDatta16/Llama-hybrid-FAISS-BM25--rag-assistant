Ensemble technique for combining predictions from classification and regression algorithms

Given an anomaly detection problem - A , I have divided the problem into two independent subtasks - A1 and A2 and tackled the tasks using classification and regression algorithms respectively. In order to combine the predictions from the classification and regression algorithms, I have derived an average weighing formula. My question is if this approach can be regarded as ensemble learning ? Otherwise, are there better ways to combine such predictions into a common score ? I am new here :) UPDATE Subtasks A1 and A2 are tackled with One Class SVM (unsupervised) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)(supervised) respectively. The scores from both algorithms are added using weighed mean like so: Final_Score = alpha * OCSVM_Score + (1 - alpha) * GPR_Score where alpha = 0.5
