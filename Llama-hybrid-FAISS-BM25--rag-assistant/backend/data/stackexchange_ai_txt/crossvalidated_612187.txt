The OP is not asking about the model's outputs, they are asking about how to use non-binary labels as inputs (e.g. with label smoothing), which multi:softmax and multi:softprob do not support. For that you have a couple options. You could specify a custom loss function: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/custom_metric_obj.html Or, you can continue using the given multi class objective, create multiple rows for each non-zero class label, and weight them accordingly. As suggested here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66432364/training-xgboost-with-soft-labels
