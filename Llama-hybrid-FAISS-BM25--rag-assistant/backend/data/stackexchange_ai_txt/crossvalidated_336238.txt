Since the attribution to the Store is the probability P(Purchase|Store) , the corresponding attribution for the Notification Center is P(Purchase|Notification Center) and with the chain rule this can be decomposed as P(Purchase|Store)*P(Store|Notification Center) + P(Purchase|Social)*P(Social|Notification Center) . Plugging in the numbers thus yields 0.1*0.35+0.05*0.55 which is 0.0625 or 6.25%. The nice things about Markov chains is exactly that you don't have to worry about loops, since the probabilities are always depending only on the previous state.
