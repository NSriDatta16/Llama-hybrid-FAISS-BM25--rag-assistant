How do I get Visual Studio to display code coverage results for dlls with 0% code coverage?

I've written a program that tells me whether all the dlls in a code coverage result file are above a specified code coverage percentage. It works great except when a dll has 0% code coverage, because dlls with 0% code coverage aren't included in the visual studio code coverage result file at all. I have access to a list of the dlls that were instrumented for this code coverage run, but I'd much rather just look at the code coverage file if I can. Is there some way to get Visual Studio to add the code coverage results for dlls where the code coverage percentage = 0%?
