We can estimate based on prior probability by using a Bayesian approach . We have a reasonable expectation that the probability of vote for the candidate A is 0.8 and we and we could have a beta distribution. Similarly, we have the Beta distribution of Candidate B. $pA∼Beta(αA,βA)$ $pB∼Beta(αB,βB)$ $Pr(pB>pA)=\sum_{i=0}^{αB−1}\ \frac{ B(αA+i,βA+βB)} {(βB+i) B(1+i,βB)B(αA,βA)}$ We can measure the probability a draw from one beta distribution is greater than a draw from another using the above formula. Also, we can use a Monte-Carlo Simulation that allows us to sample from the Beta distribution and calculate the probability that A actually win the candidate B.
