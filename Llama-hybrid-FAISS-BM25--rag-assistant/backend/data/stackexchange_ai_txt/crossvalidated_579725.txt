Statistic method for comparing feature profile

I have three groups of people: Group 1, Group 2, Group3. Each group has about 20 people. And I collected data on the proportion of certain features for each person. Group Person ID feature 1 feature 2 .... feature 20 total of features A A1 20% 5% 25% 3% 100% A A2 30% 10% 2% 0% 100% B B1 34% 0% 45% 25% 100% ....... So each person is having a different profile of features - but I want to compare whether the feature profile differs on the group level, and if differs, where is the source of the difference. The statistical methods I could think of are: Chi-squared-test on group level (averaging the percentage over people in each group), but then I lose individual data. Generalised mixed effects model glm(Group ~ feature 2 + feature 3 .... + feature 19 + (1|Person ID)), but it does not seem to answer the research question. Any suggestion?
