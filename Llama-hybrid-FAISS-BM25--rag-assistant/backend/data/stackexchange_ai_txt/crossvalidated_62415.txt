How to "explain away" an effect size using an independent variable?

I have many measures of Y for two groups A and B. Following the more modern approach of research in education, I calculated the effect size of the difference of Y for both groups (Cohen's d), and the significant interval for the effect size. The fact that the effect size was positive and significant (both in statistical sense - the interval did not include the 0, and in the relevance sense - the value was large) was surprising. So I want to explain away the effect size by using a new independent variable X. The argument goes like this - the difference between A and B is due to the fact that A's have on average larger X's than B's, and it is known that larger X "causes" or is correlated to larger Y's. If I wanted to explain away Y by using X, I would do the regression: Y ~ C1 + C2*X + C3*AB + C4*AB*X where AB is the categorical variable that indicates whether the group is A or B, and then show that the coefficients C3 and C4 are not significant (in the statistical sense). Thus, the coefficients that include the variable AB are not really different than 0 and thus the Y can be fully explained by the X alone. In fact I did that, and the coefficients are significant, but I cannot interpret if they are large of not because they are in units of Y, and I want in effect size "units" (effect size do not have units and that is what makes them so useful!). The variable X is an integer with a small range of values, so I could calculate the effect size of AB for each of the values of X, and than perform a regression on those values and X, but I find this solution odd. In summary, given an effect size E, based on a categorical variable AB, how do I measure how much it is explained away by an independent variable X? EDIT - after @Peter Flom's answer I was not clear to specify that I do not know how to calculate the Cohen's d if there is a covariate variable X. Cohen d = ($\mu(Y_a) - \mu(Y_b))/\sigma_{ab}$ where $\sigma_{ab}$ is a pooled standard deviation. With the regression model above I now have Y ~= C1 + C2*X + C3*AB + C3*AB*X and I no longer have groups to calculate the mean of, or the standard variation! I would very much like remain in the Cohen d domain. The first analysis - by calculating the d for the groups A and B was standard in the literature, and I could compare that d with others to claim that the effect was large. I would like now to show that when X is taken into account the d reduces to a very small (or hopefully not significant) number.
