Before spending money to invest in faster hard drives, try building your project entirely on a RAM disk (assuming you have the RAM to spare). You can find various free RAM disk drivers on the net. You won't find any physical drive, including SSDs, that are faster than a RAM disk. In my case, a project that took 5 minutes to build on a 6-core i7 on a 7200 RPM SATA drive with Incredibuild was reduced by only about 15 seconds by using a RAM disk. Considering the need to recopy to permanent storage and the potential for lost work, 15 seconds is not enough incentive to use a RAM disk and probably not much incentive to spend several hundreds of dollars on a high-RPM or SSD drive. The small gain may indicate that the build was CPU bound or that Windows file caching was rather effective, but since both tests were done from a state where the files weren't cached, I lean heavily towards CPU-bound compiles. Depending on the actual code you're compiling your mileage may vary -- so don't hesitate to test.
