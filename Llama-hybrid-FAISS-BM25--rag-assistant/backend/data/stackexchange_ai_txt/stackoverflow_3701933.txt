SSIS package does nothing when invoked by agent

SSIS package loops through input files. For each file, flatfile parse adds records to a DB table, then file is renames/moved for archiving. After all files, package calls a sproc to delete all year-old records. Package runs from visual studio OK. Put in SSIS package store, run from there, no problem. Create an SQL Agent job to run package. Job does something for about five minutes, announces it was successful , but no new records in DB and no renaming of input files. Package uses dedicated login for SQL Server privileges. Job is run as HOSTNAME-SVC which has read/write privileges on the input directory and the archive directory.
