If there is no privacy concern, you may wish to post the url you are trying to access. If the URL is malformed, or references an invalid page (or an invalid page + parameters combination) you will sometimes see server errors like this. I worked with a legacy web app from the state of Michigan and it would throw 400 style errors every time I tried to access a page with the wrong page parameters.
