I would recommend you SPARK . We have same problem in my firm and finally decided to save time and do not reinventing the wheel and use existing (freeware) solution. SPARK does the job for us. "Spark is an Open Source, cross-platform IM client optimized for businesses and organizations. It features built-in support for group chat, telephony integration, and strong security. It also offers a great end-user experience with features like in-line spell checking, group chat room bookmarks, and tabbed conversations."
