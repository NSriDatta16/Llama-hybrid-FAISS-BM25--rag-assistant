The worst coding standard I've ever had to live with was insane indentation. The code had originally been written on a mainframe using 60x80 character green-screen terminals (this was quite a long time ago). The default tab size on these things was 8 characters, but the programmers at the time decided that was too big - the screen itself only showed 80 characters across, so an 8-character tab wasted a lot of space. So they decided to set the intent size for their code to 4 characters. All fair enough, you say. Except that they didn't do it by changing the tab size. They did it by making the first indentation to be 4 spaces, the second one to be a single tab character, and so on alternating between adding 4 spaces and a tab character. While they stuck to the green screen terminals, this was fine. Weird, but fine. The real chaos began when the development team got their shiny new Windows PCs. The PC editor they chose had its tab size set to 4 characters, and so when the code was loaded, the indentation was simply all over the place. We couldn't fix the indentation because some devs were still using the green screens, so for the year or so that it took to get the entire team transitioned to PCs, we had an absolute nightmare trying to work with code that was virtually unreadable in either one environment or the other (or more frequently, both).
