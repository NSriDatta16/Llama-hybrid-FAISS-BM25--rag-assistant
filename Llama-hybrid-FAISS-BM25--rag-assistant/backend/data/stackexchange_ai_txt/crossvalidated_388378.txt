How to interpret feature importance in a decision tree after applying Factor Analysis

I'm using SKlearn to apply Factor Analysis (FA) to my data before training a Decision Tree . I then want to do an importance analysis. If I had not applied FA to my data, I could just call clf.feature_importances_() on the decision tree. However, now, that would provide the importance of each factor-analyzed-feature. How would I go about casting those importances back to the original features? If the answer is easier with PCA, I can go with that.
