Assuming you are using a modern IDE, finding the method you want is rarely more than two mouse clicks away, so I am not sure what having a particular way of organizing your methods would get you. I do use stylecop ( http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis ) which has me ordering by public / private / method / properties - I have found that to be anal enough. The only time I ever truely thought this was important is when I wrote a very large jscript program and the editor at the time didn't offer any help in finding functions. Alphabetic organization was very helpful. When alphabatized, it isn't hard to figure out which way in the file you need to go to find a method. Semantic organization would have been completely unhelpful.
