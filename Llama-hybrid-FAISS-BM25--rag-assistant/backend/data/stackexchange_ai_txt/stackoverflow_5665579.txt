There are two different options there, depending on what you actually want. If you only intend to do some processing on the given vector in the short term, (and assuming single threaded execution and a couple other considerations) you can just keep the reference: std::vector const & v = agent.GetInfoState().GetPositionInfo().GetCloseTeammateToTeammate(2); for ( std::vector ::const_iterator it = v.begin(), end = v.end(); it != end; ++it ) { // do something } If what you want is to save a copy of the vector so that at a later time you can check for changes, or you want to use the vector as it is now without any later changes (note that this is not entailing thread safety!), just copy it: std::vector copy = agent.GetInfoState().GetPositionInfo().GetCloseTeammateToTeammate(2);
