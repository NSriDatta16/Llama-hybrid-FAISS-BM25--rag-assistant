Elaborating on my comments: The default may or may not be alright, depending on your data. You should plot the average cross validation error against the (log)lambda sequence. If the minimum occurs at a boundary then you may want to expand the bounds of the lambda sequence appropriately to see if a more appropriate lambda may be found outside of the range that was tested. However, if the default lambda sequence is such that the lowest lambda results in all variables being included and the highest lambda results in no variables being included, then you can't really improve on that sequence (other than making it a finer grid).
