Returning info from a Web Service

A support person from an organization indicated that their product wasn't able to consume my web service because it appeared I was returning ASCII encoded information, versus UTF-8 encoded information. [WebMethod] public string ReturnAll(){ XmlDocument xmlDoc = new XmlDocument(); xmlDoc.Load(@"some_dir\stockresults.xml"); XmlNodeList nodeList = xmlDoc.SelectNodes(@"/entries/Entry/Company|/entries/Entry/Symbol"); //public static string value; foreach (XmlNode org in nodeList) { value += org.OuterXml; } return value; } Any online references to what I'd need above to change it to the right encoding? Will I have to do something special in my method to re-encode the information before returning it?
