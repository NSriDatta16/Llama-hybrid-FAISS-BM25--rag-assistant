It's worth noticing what $A-B$ and $X-Y$ refer to. Each is essentially the random noise that differs between the two members of each pair. It's frankly quite surprising to me that the random noise of the first pair is so highly correlated with the random noise of the second pair. That suggests that any perturbations in the sync within pairs happens across pairs. For example, let's say $A$ and $B$ are the sales of chocolate and vanilla ice cream at store 1, and $X$ and $Y$ are the sales of chocolate and vanilla ice cream at store 2, and let's say that chocolate and vanilla sales are extremely highly correlated. Let's also say that chocolate sales are slightly influenced by the presence of a commercial playing one day for chocolate ice cream. On days the commercial airs, chocolate sells a tiny bit better at both stores. This would yield a scenario very similar to what you observe: $A$ (chocolate ice cream sales at store 1) and $B$ (vanilla ice cream sales at store 1) are highly correlated, and $X$ (chocolate ice cream sales at store 2) and $Y$ (vanilla ice cream sales at store 2) are highly correlated, but on the few days $A$ is higher than $B$ , $X$ is also higher than $Y$ , which leads to a high correlation between $A-B$ and $X-Y$ . In the absence of a commercial or other shock affecting both pairs of time series, you might expect $A-B$ and $X-Y$ to be completely uncorrelated. That is, sometimes $A$ is higher than $B$ and sometimes $X$ is higher than $Y$ , but there doesn't have to be anything linking those two events. Such a high correlation suggests there is a linking of those two events.
