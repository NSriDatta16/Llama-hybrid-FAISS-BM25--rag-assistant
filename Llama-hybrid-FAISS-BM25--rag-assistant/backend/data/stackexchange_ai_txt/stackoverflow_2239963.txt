First of all, it wouldn't work, because Spring can't inject EntityManager into internal object created with new . So, you have to write something like this: public class OrganizationRepository implements IOrganizationRepository { @PersistenceContext public void setEntityManager(EntityManager em) { internalRepository.em = em; } ... } Also your read method looks a bit too generic. It misses some important use cases, such as getSigleResult and setFirstResult / setMaxResults . Personally I prefer the second article apporach, because using composition you'll end up with having EntityManager in OrganizationRepository in order to implement features missed in IInternalGenericRepository .
