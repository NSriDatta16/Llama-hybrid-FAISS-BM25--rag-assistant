It sounds like what you need is something that will test a number to see if it fits within a 1 byte integer. A 1 byte integer can contain a number between 0 and 255 (if unsigned) or -128 and 127 if signed. So you just need something that tests to see if the number falls within this range. byte is unsigned by default in C# so you just need: return (x >= 0 && x Why these values? It's because a byte is eight bits of storage, which can store 2 to the 8 possible values. 2^8 = 256.
