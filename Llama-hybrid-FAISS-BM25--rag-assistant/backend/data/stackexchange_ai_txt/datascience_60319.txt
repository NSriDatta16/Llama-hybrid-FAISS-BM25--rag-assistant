In data science, people normally refer to “longitudinal data” as one or more time series. So you can try searching for that. A classic is to use ARIMA (available in many languages including R). Personally I also like Facebook’s Prophet library as a starting point, because it’s easier to use and works surprisingly well. Also available in R.
