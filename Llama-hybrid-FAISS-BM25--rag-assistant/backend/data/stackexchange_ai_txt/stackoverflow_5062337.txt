Clear all regions/views on Prism 4 (Silverlight) Logout

I have an 2 regions in my silverlight application leveraging prism 4 and unity main shell view, the Authenticated region and Non-authenticated region, and a menu item. Within the authenticated region, there are a lot more sub regions depending on the view injected into it. On load of the application, I will be presented with the login screen "Non-authenticated region", when login, I will be presented in the Authenticated region. When I click on the logout button on the menu, I will again be presented with the login view. But when I login for the second time, my existing view loaded within the authenticated region is still there. I tried the following code on logout, to remove all views from that region, but the views retrieved from the container is still the existing view.. var regions = this.RegionManager.Regions; foreach (var region in regions) { if (region.Name == this.AuthenticatedRegionName) { var views = region.Views; foreach(var view in views) { region.Remove(view); } } } I am actually getting some region key not found error when I call request navigate for some reason, but I think the main issue is with the container. How can I tell unity to dispose all views?
