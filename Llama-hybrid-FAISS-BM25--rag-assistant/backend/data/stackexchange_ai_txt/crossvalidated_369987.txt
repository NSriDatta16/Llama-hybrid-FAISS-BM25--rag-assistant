Is a single neuron in a Neural Network a GLM?

I was thinking about count data, and saw some research that said that some of the best functions to use for count data were GLMs rather than transforming the data. I'm training a neural network, and the question I had was if a single neuron in a neural network was a GLM. GLM's have the form $y = e^{\theta^T * x}$ . A neuron is just $z = \theta^T*x$ , and then via sigmoidal activation is $y = \frac{1}{(1+e^{-z})}$ . It's not quite the same form though. I'm trying to figure out how to handle count data being input into my neural network.
