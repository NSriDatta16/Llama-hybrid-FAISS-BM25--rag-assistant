There are alternative ways to check for optimality of the solution which are derived from the strong duality property. It is described in great detail in the paper Support Vector Machine Solvers . Concretely, libsvm uses the following step criterion, $$ \text{max}_{up} y_{i}g_{i} - \text{min}_{down} y_{i}g_{i} \le \epsilon $$ where $g_{i} = 1-y_{i}x_{i}K_{ij}$ and $up$ and $down$ are defined as $$ up = \left\{ i | y_{i}x_{i} 0 \text{ if } y_{i} = 1 \text{ or } > -C \text{ if } y_{i} = -1 \right\} $$ The paper provides a description of common techniques together with some implementation issues. I guess you will find it very helpful.
