TDD requires a certain organization for your code. This might be inefficient or difficult to read. Or even architecturally wrong; for example, since private methods cannot be called outside a class, you have to make methods non-private to make them testable, which is just wrong. When code changes, you have to change the tests as well. With refactoring this can be a lot of extra work.
