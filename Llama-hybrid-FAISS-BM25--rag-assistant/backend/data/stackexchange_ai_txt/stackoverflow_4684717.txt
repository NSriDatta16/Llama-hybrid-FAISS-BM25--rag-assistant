I've thought about this before but I've never had a need to actually try to implement it. Try this: Create a transparent GIF or PNG that has a diagonal line running from one corner to another. As you drag the divs around, stretch the image so that it's corners are always touching each div. You will probably need a diagonal-down image and a diagonal-up image and switch between the two based on the relative positioning of the two divs. This will probably take some finesse to get it working well, but it is the best thing that I can think of to get diagonal lines in HTML.
