Infragistics UltraWinGrid EmptyDataText Equivalent?

We're using Infragistics UltraWinGrid as a base class for customized controls. One of the projects that will use this control to display search results has a requirement to display a user friendly message when no matches are located. We'd like to encapsulate that functionality into the derived control - so no customization beyond setting the message to display is required by the programmer who uses the control. This would have to be done in generic fashion - one size fits all datasets. Is there allowance in the UltraWinGrid for this type of usage already? If so, where would I find it hidden. :-) If this functionality needs to be coded, I can think of an algorithm which would add a blank record to whatever recordset was set and place that into the grid. In your opinion, is this the best way to handle the solution?
