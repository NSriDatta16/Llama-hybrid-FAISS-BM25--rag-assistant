I've really been thinking about this. People hack games to get #1 on the scoreboard, correct? That's the only reason, they want to be on top. So, I've decided to completely get rid of the global scoreboard. Users, of course, will have their personal scores recorded so they can compete against themselves, but other than that, each game will simply give users an award for accomplishing some specific task. That way score is irrelevant. Whether you get 1,000,000 or 1,000, you still get the same award. This will deter hackers because their efforts are meaningless. Yes, I can still implement some form of lower-level security when transmitting data to the server via AJAX requests, but really it wouldn't seem very logical for someone to hack my game just to get an award that is exactly the same as any award anyone else has received. I know it seems like I'm kind of avoiding the issue, but really I'm not. I'm facing the real issue which is the hackers and pretty much demolishing their motivation to hack the game while still maintaining that sense of competition. Most hackers do it to gain attention, so they can look at the scoreboard and say, 'Yeah, I hacked the game to get that score.' But if they only have a little icon in their profile, who's going to care?
