Interaction test non significant

Let's suppose I perform two separate logistic regression models in two different subgroups of my dataset. glm(death ~ age + ..... , data = female, family="binomial") #female population glm(death ~ age + ..... , data = male, family="binomial") #male population From these, I obtan an OR for age in the female group and one for the male group (numbers are just examples) : OR age in the female group: 1.88 (0.41-2.89); p>0.05 OR age in the male group: 1.45 (1.20-1.78); p So the males OR is significant while the female's not. However, when I perform the interaction test, the p is >0.05. How do I interpret this? It means that there is no difference between the two ORs, so why one is significant and the other isn't? If there is no difference, then is the "true" OR 1?
