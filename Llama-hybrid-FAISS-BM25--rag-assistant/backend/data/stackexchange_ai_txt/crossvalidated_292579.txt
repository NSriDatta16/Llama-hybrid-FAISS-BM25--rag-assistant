Estimating the effect of different histories of exposure, on a scalar response measured at the end of a study

I have a cohort of $N\approx 20000$ subjects, for which a continuous variable (blood pressure) was measured at the end of a study spanning 5 years (so I have one value of blood pressure for each subject). Also, for each subject I have a time series of exposure to an environmental variable, measured across the five years at irregular intervals. Blood pressure before the study wasn't measured, however I have other covariates for each subject: age, physical activity, smoking/non smoking, social class. I would like to see if, controlling for the effect of the "scalar" (non-time series) covariates, different exposure time series have an effect on the final blood pressure level. In other words, if for two subjects of similar age, smoking habit etc. a different history of exposure results in a different BP. What approach could I use? Here is an example of the data: The plot on the left shows the exposure time series for a few randomly sampled subjects: different colors indicate different subjects. The plot on the right shows the same time series, but vertically offset. They are two visualizations of the same data. As you can see, the time series for different subjects start at different points in time, because for some subjects the measurement of the exposure to the environmental variable started earlier, and for others later. However, all time series end at the same time (baseline), which is the time when the blood pressure was measured.
