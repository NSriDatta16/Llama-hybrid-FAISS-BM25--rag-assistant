Note, I haven't worked with G.711 PCM audio myself, but I presume that you are performing the correct conversion from the encoded amplitude to an actual amplitude before processing the values. You'd expect the average value of most samples to be approximately zero as sound waveforms oscillate either side of zero. A crude volume calculation would be rms (root mean square), i.e. taking a rolling average of the square of the samples and take the square root of that average. This will give you a postive quantity when there is some sound; the quantity is related to the power represented in the waveform. For something better related to human perception of volume you may want to investigate the sort of techniques used in Replay Gain .
