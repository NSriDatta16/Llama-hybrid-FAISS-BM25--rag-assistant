Interpreting logistic regression output

Suppose I have a logistic regression output as follows. Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -5.8700887 0.0506436 -115.91 In this case, which variable play the most important role in the model? Is it f1 (the lowest coefficient) or f2 (the highest one)?
