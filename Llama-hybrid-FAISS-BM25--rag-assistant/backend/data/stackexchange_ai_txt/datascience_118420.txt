The issue is caused by the fact that you are trying to index the PCA object when calling x_pca[:,0:2] . I am not sure what type of values you are expecting to pass to your myplot function, but calling PCA.fit does not return an array of values but simply the PCA instance itself (see also the documentation ). If you are looking to use the values on the new principal components you can use the transform method after having fitted the PCA object, or use the fit_transform method to fit and transform the data in a single step.
