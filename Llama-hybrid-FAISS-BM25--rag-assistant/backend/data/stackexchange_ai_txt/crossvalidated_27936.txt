Statistical test for finding significant positions having deviated values

I have near about 50 files(each file corresponds to a patient) with 4 columns - chromosome start.position stop.pos value First 3 columns in all 50 files are same and fourth column is value which is different (or can be same for some) for all patients. Basically this value corresponds to copy number (structural variation in genome). I want to apply some test (or if you can suggest any other procedure) to find out values which are deviating as compared to others. Example- file1 chromosome start.position stop.pos value 1 10 110 4 2 100 200 5 2 500 600 0.5 file2 chromosome start.position stop.pos value 1 10 110 2.5 2 100 200 6 2 500 600 0.6 file3 chromosome start.position stop.pos value 1 10 110 3 2 100 200 5.5 2 500 600 3.5 file4 chromosome start.position stop.pos value 1 10 110 2 2 100 200 0.9 2 500 600 3 file5 chromosome start.position stop.pos value 1 10 110 8 2 100 200 4.5 2 500 600 2.5 So in the output, file5 has significant value (as compared to same position of other files) at row1, file4 has significant value at row2 and file1 and file2 has significant value at row3. I have 1 solution in my mind- pick a row from each file and take the average of values. Then compare this average with each file and return the position if it is significant as compare to average. But I feel there should be some better solution for this. Can you please suggest any test or any other procedure that you will use to complete this task. Thanks in advance. EDIT: After reading Joel's comment. Yes I have a specific question in my mind. As I mentioned these files corresponds to each patient, so I am trying to find if a patient has significantly increase(or decrease) in value at certain position (i:e row). Ok we can talk about only 1 row now. Just consider 1 position (1 row), take the values ( in this case, for first row we will have 5 values as we have five files) and from these values check which value is significantly deviating from others. So if you can suggest me solution for 1 row, I can do it for all the rows one by one. Please let me know if it is not clear.
