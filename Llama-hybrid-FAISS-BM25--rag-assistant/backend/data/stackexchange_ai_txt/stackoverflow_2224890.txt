Many developers tend to query large results from LINQ to SQL and then trim them down instead of relying on a pattern that leverages IQueryable which means you are building a more refined query instead of refined data subset. You may be seeing this happening: they need only a subset but they are coding to pull everything, then they filter the data out to what they actually need. The repository pattern with IQueryable will ensure the most optimized use of SQL Server server by allowing the developer to query a large resultset and trim it down at many levels until it's actually needed. By that time the query isn't: Get all Get data Filter subset Get data Filter another subset Get data Display It's: From all apply a filter and then another filter Get data Display Just my thoughts.
