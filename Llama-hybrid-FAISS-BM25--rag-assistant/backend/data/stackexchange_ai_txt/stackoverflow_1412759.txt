There seems to be a deeper problem here than your control constructs. Why do you have such complex error control? I.e. you seem to have multiple ways of handling different errors. Typically, when I get an error, I simply break off the operation, present an error message to the user, and return control to the event loop, if an interactive application. For batch, log the error, and either continue processing on the next data item or abort the processing. This kind of control flow is easily handled with exceptions. If you have to handle error numbers, then you can effectively simulate exceptions by continuing normal error processing in case of an error, or returning the first error. Your continued processing after an error occurs seems to be very fragile, or your error conditions are really control conditions not error conditions.
