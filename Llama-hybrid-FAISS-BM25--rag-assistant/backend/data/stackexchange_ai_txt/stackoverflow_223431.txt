Database comparison

Which industry-class database has the most unique features? (with "unique" meaning that no other RDBMS has them) I think my choice here is Oracle 11g: Flashback query (you can estract data as it was a moment in the past) ASM - automatic storage management Native code compilation of stored procedures Audit features (tracing everything, from logins to statements) and many others.
