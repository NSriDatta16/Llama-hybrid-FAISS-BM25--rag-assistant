It probably depends on what you want to use variable importances for. Is it to be used as a criterion for feature selection for a third classification model? In that case you could try to compute a weighted average the variable importances (maybe after normalizing each individual variable importance vector to unit length) for various values and the averaging weight and then pickup the value that yields the best cross-validated score for the final model. As for combining the outcome of the logistic regression model and the random forest model (without considering variable importances), the following blog post is very informative and demonstrates that a single averaging of the output is a simple yet very effective ensemble method for regression models.
