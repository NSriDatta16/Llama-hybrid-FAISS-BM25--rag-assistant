Python directory searching and organizing by dict

Hey all, this is my first time recently trying to get into the file and os part of Python. I am trying to search a directory then find all sub directories. If the directory has no folders, add all the files to a list. And organize them all by dict. So for instance a tree could look like this Starting Path Dir 1 Subdir 1 Subdir 2 Subdir 3 subsubdir file.jpg folder1 file1.jpg file2.jpg folder2 file3.jpg file4.jpg Even if subsubdir has a file in it, it should be skipped because it has folders in it. Now I can normally do this if I know how many directories I am going to be looking for, using os.listdir and os.path.isdir. However if I want this to be dynamic it will have to compensate for any amount of folders and subfolders. I have tried using os.walk and it will find all the files easily. The only trouble I am having is creating all the dicts with the path names that contain file. I need the foldernames organized by dict, up until the starting path. So in the end, using the example above, the dict should look like this with the files in it: dict['dir1']['subdir3']['subsubdir']['folder1'] = ['file1.jpg', 'file2.jpg'] dict['dir1']['subdir3']['subsubdir']['folder2'] = ['file3.jpg', 'file4.jpg'] Would appreciate any help on this or better ideas on organizing the information. Thanks.
