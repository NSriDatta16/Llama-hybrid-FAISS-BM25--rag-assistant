iPhone start Audio Recording by Voice

i already have a 'start voice recording" when the volume reach a special level. But it has one downside. When it starts recording it already missed a 1/2 second or so. When speaking a sentence it would miss the first word. Any ideas (best with example). Lets say I start first listening and get the peakpower, average, lowpass [recorder updateMeters]; ALPHA = 0.05; peakPowerForChannel = pow(10, (0.05 * [recorder peakPowerForChannel:0])); averagePowerForChannel = pow(10, (0.05 * [recorder averagePowerForChannel:0])); lowPassResults = ALPHA * peakPowerForChannel + (1.0 - ALPHA) * lowPassResults; averagePassResults = ALPHA * averagePowerForChannel + (1.0 - ALPHA) * averagePassResults; than i look if its loud enough to record if (peakPowerForChannel > 0.08f) ) -> start recording and if its less than a value it stops (peakPowerForChannel stop record, start listening again for now I found best is listening the peakpower, rather the average. but still its not fine. I also thought about to have a kind of tempory recording all time and when the peak is high enough I could start from now-2 seconds. Something like that, but here I dont know how to realize. So any practical suggestions are welcome. thanks chris
