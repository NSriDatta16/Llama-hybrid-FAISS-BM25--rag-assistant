VB.NET - how to remove Infragistics references

I moved a vb project to a new computer. This one does not have Infragistics libraries installed. Apparently on the original computer it was installed, and the vb project must have some reference to it (see error bellow) even though I'm not using it in the project. So I am getting this error on the new computer. Unable to resolve type 'Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraCombo, Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v9.1, Version=9.1.20091.1000, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7dd5c3163f2cd0cb' How do I get rid of it?
