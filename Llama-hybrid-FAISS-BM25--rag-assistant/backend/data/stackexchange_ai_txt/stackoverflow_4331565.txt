How can I get the compilation time in Flash Builder?

Is there a simple way to report the time necessary to compile an applcation in Flash Builder (in the Console or an external file) ? I want to compare the average compilation time between the usual Flex compiler and HFCD (HellFire Compiler Daemon) for a given project.
