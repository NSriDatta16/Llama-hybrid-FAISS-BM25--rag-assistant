Drag an imageview cross boundaries of views

I have a UIImageView in the top portion of my main view. Below this I have a horizontal UIScrollView with numerous UIImageViews contained in it. I am trying to drag any one of the UIImageViews from the UIScrollView up onto the main UIImageView in the upper portion of the screen. However even if I set the UIImageView being dragged to BringViewToFront it does two unexpected things? I can only drag the UIImageView vertically, as soon as I stray left or right the UIScrollView beings to scroll? As I drag the UIImageView up to place on the main UIImageView it slides underneath it, even though I have called BringViewToFront? Any ideas? Thanks
