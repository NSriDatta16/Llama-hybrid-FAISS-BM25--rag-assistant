How to use Java with NDK Android?

I am assuming that using the OpenCV code here: http://github.com/billmccord/OpenCV-Android#readme is the best way to use OpenCV on Android, with the NDK. I am still stuck as to how I get from the C definitions of functions to the ones I declare in OpenCV.java in my Android project cvFindContours( void* img, CvMemStorage* storage, CvSeq** firstContour, int cntHeaderSize, int mode, int method, CvPoint offset ) --> findContours(int[] data, int w, int h) ) Any help/pointers appreciated, even where to start to figure this out. I currently want to use cvHoughCircles, cvHoughCircles(CvArr* image, void* circle_storage, int method, double dp, double min_dist, double param1 = 100, double param2 = 300, int min_radius = 0, int max_radius = 0}; How do I write this in java with ndk for android?
