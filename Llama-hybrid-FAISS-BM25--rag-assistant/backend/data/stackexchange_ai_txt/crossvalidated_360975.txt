While obviously biased, I have trouble to see the difficulty with that sentence! If the proposal distribution has a bounded support, the Markov chain can only move to a point within that support and nowhere else. This means connecting two values $y_1$ and $y_2$ that have positive densities, $f(y_1)>0$ and $f(y_2)>0$ but are far away will require many iterations of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In the worst case, if the support of $f$ is made of two disjoint sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ with $y_1\in A_1$ and $y_2\in A_2$ and if the distance between both sets is larger than the diameter of the support of $q(\cdot|\cdot)$ the Markov chain cannot leave the $A_i$ it started from. Here is an illustration on a basic example: target target(prop)*propal(prop,x)) prop=x return(prop)} T=2e3 mark1=matrix(0,T,2) mark1[1,]=c(1,1) for (t in 2:T) mark1[t,]=hastin(mark1[t-1,]) mark2=matrix(0,T,2) mark2[1,]=-c(1,1) for (t in 2:T) mark2[t,]=hastin(mark2[t-1,]) plot(mark1,col="sienna",type="l",axes=FALSE,xlim=c(-2,2),ylim=c(-2,2),xlab="",ylab="") lines(mark2,col="steelblue") with outcome This poor behaviour of $q$'s with small support is unrelated with the point that when $f(y)/q(y|x)$ is large the chain should move there, which is correct.
