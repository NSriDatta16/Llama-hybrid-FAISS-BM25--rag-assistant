iPhone Build Configuration Enabling Features

Question about best practices. Is there a way to programmatically detect whether the app is being compiled for an AdHoc configuration, and, if so, enable a feature in the app? For example, I am thinking of enabling a switch between beta and prod environment given depending on whether the app is an an AdHoc vs. Release configuration. This way we can give testers the ability to switch between server environments in the same app. Could do this with a #define but thought I would ask if there is a more elegant way to do it by detecting the current configuration.
