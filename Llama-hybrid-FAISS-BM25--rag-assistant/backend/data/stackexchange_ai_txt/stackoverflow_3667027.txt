WCF Design Approach

In my solution I have a Web application project and a Class library project that contains all the business logic and this also acts as a data access layer as I am using Entity Framework. This means that I have my edmx in this layer itself. I have some 34 classes in this class library project and at an average 6 public methods in each class. These classes were getting called directly from the web application until now. No problems. Now I want to introduce the WCF Layer between the UI and the Business logic layer. This means I will have to write wrapper methods for all my methods and expose them in a WCF Service. Does this mean that 34 * 6 = 204 methods (approximately) will appear in my service layer as Operation Contracts? As per OO, I think this is too large a class and so it feels wrong. I know there is the Generic Service design pattern, but is there anything else that I am missing? Please advise.
