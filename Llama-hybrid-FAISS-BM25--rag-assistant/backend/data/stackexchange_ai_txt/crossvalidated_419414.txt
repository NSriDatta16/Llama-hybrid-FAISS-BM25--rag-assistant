If you build your method around semiparametric regression models you can estimate the entire distribution of Y for each X. A good example is the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. I have a case study doing this in my RMS book and course notes where at the end you'll see a nomogram displaying all sorts of predicted quantities (mean, quantiles, exceedance probabilities). See the chapter on ordinal models for continuous Y.
