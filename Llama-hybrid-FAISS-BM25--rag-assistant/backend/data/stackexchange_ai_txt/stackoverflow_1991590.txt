As others already have replied scalability isn't about what framework you use. Sure it is nice to squeeze out as much performance as possible from each node, but what you ideally want is that by adding another node you scale your app in a linear fashion. The application should be architected in distinct layers so it is possible to add more power to different layers of the application without a rewrite and also to add different layered caching. Caching is key to archive speed. One example of layers for a big webapp: Load balancers (TCP level) Caching reverse proxies CDN for static content Front end webservers Appservers (business logic of the app) Persistent storage (RDBMS, key/value, document)
