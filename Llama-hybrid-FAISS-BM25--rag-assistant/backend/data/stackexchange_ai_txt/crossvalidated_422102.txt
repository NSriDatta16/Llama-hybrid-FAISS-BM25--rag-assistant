A) One of the infinitely many requirements for a process to be called strictly stationary is that the joint distribution of $X(t_1)$ and $X(t_2)$ is the same as the joint distribution of $X(t_1+\tau)$ and $X(t_2+\tau)$ , that is, two random variables $X(t_1)$ and $X(t_2)$ that are separated by a given amount of time ( $t_2-t_1$ seconds here) have the same joint distribution as any other pair of random variables $X(t_1+\tau)$ and $X(t_2+\tau)$ separated by the same amount of time. Note that $X(t_1+\tau)$ and $X(t_2+\tau)$ are separated by $(t_2+\tau) - (t_1 + \tau) = t_2-t_1$ seconds, just as $X(t_1)$ and $X(t_2)$ are separated by $t_2-t_1$ seconds. B) is very confusingly written. The autocovariance function of a random process or time series is a function of two variables -- the time instants of the two random variables whose covariance is being calculated. That is, $l(t_1, t_2)$ is defined as $\operatorname{cov}\big(X(t_1), X(t_2)\big)$ . Now, the covariance of $X(t_1)$ and $X(t_2)$ depends on the joint distribution of $X(t_1)$ and $X(t_2)$ which A) tells us is the same as the joint distribution of $X(t_1+\tau)$ and $X(t_2+\tau)$ . Thus, for a strictly stationary process, the autocovariance function $l(t_1, t_2) \stackrel{\Delta}{=} \operatorname{cov}\big(X(t_1), X(t_2)\big)$ has the same value at the point $(t_1+\tau, t_2+\tau)$ and the same value at the point $(t_1+\tau^\prime, t_2+\tau^\prime)$ etc. So, $l(t_1, t_2)$ cannot possibly depend on the individual values of $t_1$ and $t_2$ , only on their difference $t_2-t_1$ which we will denote by $\lambda$ . It is a poor choice of notation to use the same letter $l$ to denote the autocovariance function when expressed as function of just the one variable $\lambda$ instead of $t_1$ and $t_2$ but the usage is far too entrenched in the literature to get rid of it here. What is generally written is $$l(\lambda) = E\left[(X(t)-\mu_X)(X(t+\lambda)-\mu_X)\right]\tag{1}$$ where we are relying on the fact that $X(t)$ and $X(t+\lambda)$ have the same mean $\mu_X$ (a consequence of stationarity) and the implicit assumption is that the RHS of $(1)$ does not depend on what value of $t$ is used; all that matters is that $X(t+\lambda)$ and $X(t)$ are separated by $\lambda$ seconds and thus the RHS depends on $\lambda$ alone.
