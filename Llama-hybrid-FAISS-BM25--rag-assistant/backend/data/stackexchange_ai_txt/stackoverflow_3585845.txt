I've suggested a different solution earlier, but I thought you were going to handle this on the client side. Following your comments I now understand that you need to take care of this on the server side. There may be a way for you to do it, which is not really elegant, but it should work: Add to all pages a script that collects all password field names into a new client-generated field, like so: function collectPasswordFields() { var inputs = document.getElementsByTagName('input'), list = []; for (var i = 0; i Then intercept the additional field in the server-side error handler, and remove the named fields from the email. Can something like this work for you?
