Android card based game, need help to start

I'm just setting out in android development. I want to make a kind of card based game. I'm just looking for suggestions really on how I might start it. I know I have to make the menu layout and view, then use an Intent from that to get to the main game view. My sticking points are: There's going to be a deck of cards. It's going to be a set number so I was thinking I could just have each card defined as a button in the layout. I don't know if that is the right way to do it though. Storage of card details. I'm thinking of using an xml file to store these.
