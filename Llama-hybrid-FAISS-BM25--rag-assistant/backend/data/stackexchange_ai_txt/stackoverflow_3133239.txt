It would help if you said exactly what you don't understand, but here are a few tips: if you have something like a(r,c), that means matrix a, row r, column c (always in this order). In other words, you should have two elements inside the brackets separated by a comma where the first represents the row, the second the column. If you have : by itself in one of the sides of the comma, that means "all". Thus, if you had a(r,:), then you would have matrix a, row r, all columns. If : is not alone in one of the sides of the comma, then it will mean "to". So if you have a(r, z:y), that means matrix a, row r, columns z to y. Mean = average. The format of the function in Matlab is M = mean(A,dim). A will be the matrix you take the average (or mean) of, M will be the place where the results are going to go. If dim = 1, you will get a row vector with each element being the average of a column. If dim = 2 (as it is in your case), then you should get a column vector, with each element being the average of a row. Be careful , though, because at the end of your code you have ', which means transpose. That means that your column vector will be transformed into a row vector. OK, so your code: x(:,i) = mean( (y(:,((i-1)*j+1):i*j)), 2 )'; Start with the bit inside, that is y(:,((i-1)*j+1):i*j) So that is saying matrix y(r,c) where r (row) is :, that is, all rows c (column) is ((i-1) j+1):i j, that is, columns going from (i-1) j+1 until i j Your code will then get the matrix resulting from that, which I called y(r,c), and will do the following: mean( (y(r,c), 2 ) so get the result from above and take the mean (average) of each row. As your code has the ' afterwards, that is, you have: mean( (y(r,c), 2 )' then it will get the column vector and transform into a row vector. Each element of this row will be the average of a row of y(r,c). Finally: x(:,i) = mean( (y(r,c), 2 )'; means that the result of the above will be put in column i of matrix x. Shouldn't this be x(i,:) instead?
