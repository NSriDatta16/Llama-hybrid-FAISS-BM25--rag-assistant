So you have a list of strings representing ints as input and you want a sorted list of ints as output? You seem to be doing a lot of work here to get the results you want - you could leverage some Linq to get your results like this: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; namespace ConsoleApplication6 { internal class Program { private static void Main(string[] args) { var unsortedListOfStringsAsInts = new List {"1234", "2345", "7", "9"}; var sortedListOfInts = unsortedListOfStringsAsInts.Select(x => int.Parse(x)).OrderBy(x => x).ToList(); foreach (var i in sortedListOfInts) Console.WriteLine(i); } } } And I wouldn't be concerned about optimising your sort algorithm manually with 2 thousand items - that's not really so many items to sort unless that's 'all' your application is doing.
