Well, I'll give it a try. There could be mistakes though I'm my logic. So total rides for a month are 10,000. On average there's a fault after 100 rides. So there'll be 10000/100 = 100 faults. Each fault costs 10€ to repair, so (10€)×(100 faults) = 1000€ Assuming all 300 bikes are in working condition, so 300 - 100 = 200 working bikes for the month. This is a simple assumption that all bikes are working at the start of the month, in reality there could be less than 200 active bikes or more than 200 active bikes. Total revenue = 8000 - 2000 (costs no repair) - 1000 (repair costs) = 5000€
