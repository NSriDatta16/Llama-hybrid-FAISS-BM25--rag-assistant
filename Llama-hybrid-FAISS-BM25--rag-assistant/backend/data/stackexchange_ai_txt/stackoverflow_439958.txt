Highest Performance Database in Java

I need ideas to implement a (really) high performance in-memory Database/Storage Mechanism in Java. In the range of storing 20,000+ java objects, updated every 5 or so seconds. Some options I am open to: Pure JDBC/database combination JDO JPA/ORM/database combination An Object Database Other Storage Mechanisms What is my best option? What are your experiences? EDIT: I also need like to be able to Query these objects
