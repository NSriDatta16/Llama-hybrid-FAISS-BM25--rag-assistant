Move a window on keypress + mouse (like linux ALT + mouse down)

Simple, i want to move a windows pressing ALT+MOUSE, like linux os (ALT+drag). It's possible to pass a win32 api (move api) to the windows interested clicking on it? I have a windows services that hook key pressed (ALT button in specific). When ALT key is pressed and a mouse down event is verified, i want to move window clicking anywhere, not only on the title bar! Currently i move my form windows in this way: using System.Runtime.InteropServices; [DllImport( "user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = false )] static extern IntPtr SendMessage( IntPtr hWnd, uint Msg, int wParam, int lParam ); [DllImportAttribute( "user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = false )] public static extern bool ReleaseCapture(); private void Form1_MouseDown( object sender, MouseEventArgs e ) { ReleaseCapture(); SendMessage( this.Handle, 0xa1, 0x2, 0 ); } How can I get windows handle of the specific windows by clicking and after call SendMessage() on it? It's possible?
