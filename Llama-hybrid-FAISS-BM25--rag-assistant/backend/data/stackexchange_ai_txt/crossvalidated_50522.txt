In order for us to answer, we need more information: 1. How many samples and how many features do you have? 2. How many drugs (classes)? 3. Are the features all numeric? Are there missing values? 4. Is the data balanced? (i.e. Do you expect to have the same probability for each drug?) 5. Do you have labeled data? (samples with symptoms for which you know the drug) A sample dataset (even with synthetic data) could also help. Edit: After your added description, I can think of a few alternatives: Use a classifier that can handle categorical values. Start with Naive Bayes and then proceed maybe to Bayesian Networks . Use Association Rules to learn more about the relations between symptoms.
