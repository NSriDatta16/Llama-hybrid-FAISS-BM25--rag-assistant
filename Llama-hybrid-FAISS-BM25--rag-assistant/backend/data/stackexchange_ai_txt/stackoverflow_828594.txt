Should I create a primary key on all three columns (userid, set, and key) Make this one. Using surrogate primary key will result in an extra column which is not used for other purposes. Creating a UNIQUE INDEX along with surrogate primary key is same as creating a non-clustered PRIMARY KEY , and will result in an extra KEY lookup which is worse for performance. Creating a UNIQUE INDEX without a PRIMARY KEY will result in a HEAP-organized table which will need an extra RID lookup to access the values: also not very good.
