You can use the AVG() function. This will get the average for a column. So, you could nest a SELECT statement with the AVG() methods and then SELECT these values. Pseudo: SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM ( SELECT AVG(col1) AS col1, AVG(col2) AS col2, AVG(col3) AS col3 FROM table ) as tbl WHERE col1 IN (0, 3, 5) etc.
