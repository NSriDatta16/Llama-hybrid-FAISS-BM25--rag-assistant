Animate a spinning cube after touch event - iPhone objective c

I have a UIViewController implementation which builds a core image cube and rotates it while there are touches events occuring. It has the following methods: initController touchesBegan touchesMoved touchesEnded continueSpinning I am trying to continue rotating the cube after the touchesEnded fires for an amount of time (say 2 seconds). I have created the continueSpinning method but I am unsure how to get the method to invoke without the touches methods e.g. on a timer. I have tried calling continueSpinning from touchesEnded and sleeping the thread and recursively calling continueSpinning but this just animates when the thread returns (after the 2 seconds). I need some way of invoking 'continueSpinning' similar to the touchesBegin methods. Any ideas?
