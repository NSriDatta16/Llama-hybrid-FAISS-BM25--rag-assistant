The 95% is not numerically attached to how confident you are that you've covered the true effect in your experiment. Perhaps recognizing that 95% is attached to the procedure that produced the interval, and not the interval itself, would help. Part of the procedure is that you decide that the interval contains the true value. You'll be right if you do that consistently 95% of the time. But you really don't know how likely it is for your particular experiment without more information. Q1: Your first query conflates two things and misuses a term. A narrower confidence interval may be more precise but it's accuracy is fixed by the procedure backing it, be it 89%, 95%, etc. As long as that procedure was correctly designed, the true value will be contained in the interval at the prescribed rate. (see @Michael R Chernick's answer for a discussion on coverage and a different sense of accuracy) Whether an observation falls in a CI isn't something to consider. A confidence interval is about estimating the mean. If you had an extraordinary large sample size and could estimate the mean very well then the chances of an observation being in the CI would be miniscule. Nevertheless, your question does raise some points and it's important to think about why a CI is narrow. Just because it's narrow doesn't mean you're less likely to encounter an observation that falls within that CI. Keep in mind, a narrow CI can be achieved in one of three ways. The most common way researchers make the CI narrow is by increasing the sample size. Another way they can be narrow is because the experimental method or nature of the data yields very low variance. For example, the confidence interval around the boiling point of water at sea level is small, regardless of the sample size. Finally, it could be narrow because your sample is unrepresentative. In that case, you are actually more likely to have one of the 5% of intervals that do not contain the true value. It's a bit of a paradox regarding CI width that the ones in that 5% of misses tend to be narrow. It's something you should check by knowing the literature and how variable this data typically is. Q2 : A 99% confidence interval is wider than a 95%, all else being equal. Therefore, it's more likely that it will contain the true value. See the distinction above between precise and accurate. If I make a confidence interval narrower with lower variability and higher sample size it becomes more precise because the values cover a smaller range. If I increase the coverage by using a 99% calculation it becomes more accurate because the true value is more likely to be within the range.
