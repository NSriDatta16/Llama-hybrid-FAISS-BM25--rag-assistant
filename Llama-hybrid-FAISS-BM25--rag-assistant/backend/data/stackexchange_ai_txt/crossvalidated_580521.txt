Relation between typical set and stationary condition in MCMC

In Betancourt's paper "A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo" , I don't quite see the relation between imposing the stationary condition on the Markov Chain and finding and staying in the typical set. The paper says: "So long as this condition holds, at every initial point the Markov transition will concen-trate towards the typical set. Consequently, no matter where we begin in parameter space the corresponding Markov chain will eventually drift into, and then across, the typical set" . The stationary condition is $$\pi(q)=\int_{\mathcal{Q}}\mathrm{d}q'\pi(q')\mathbb{T}(q|q')$$ And $dq'\pi(q')$ represents the "mass" of the probability (volume times density). But I don't see why this is happening, why the stationary condition takes you to the typical set and you remain there. Similar question that went unanswered: Hamiltonian trajectory stays in the typical set?
