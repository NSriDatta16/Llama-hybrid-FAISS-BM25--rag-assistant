What is the final goal of RobustPCA methods?

I have an ongoing research that is about clustering and for assigning each data point to a specific cluster, I'm using the Mahalanobis criterion that is gravely based on the covariance matrix of the cluster. As everyone knows, if the cardinality of the cluster is less than or equal to its dimensionality, then the covariance matrix will be singular and so, the Mahalanobis distance wont be reliable anymore! But the thing is that I've heard that it would be possible to conquer such problems by using RobustPCA methods. As it's mentioned in this ROBPCA method , in the third paragraph of its Introduction section: The goal of robust PCA methods is to obtain principal components that are not influenced much by outliers I think it's trying to say that RobustPCA methods are only useful when we want to draw out the mere principle components that are obtained through real data points but not grossly corrupted observations . So, it's not OK to say that we can use it for overcoming the Mahalanobis criterion issue that is caused by singularity problem of the covariance matrix of the cluster ! However, is this correct?! Regards ...
