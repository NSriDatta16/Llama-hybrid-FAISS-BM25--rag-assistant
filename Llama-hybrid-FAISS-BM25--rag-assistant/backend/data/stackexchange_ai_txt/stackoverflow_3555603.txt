Newbie question on Hibernate... in context of Martin Fowler article

In Domain Logic and SQL , Martin Fowler talks about 3 styles of interfacing with a database: Transaction Script Domain Model, and Logic in SQL What I'd like to know is: When employing Hibernate for persistence, which of the above 3 styles is typically used and/or encouraged? Is there any 4th style when using Hibernate? (In context of Hibernate, substitute HQL in place of SQL above.) Many thanks...
