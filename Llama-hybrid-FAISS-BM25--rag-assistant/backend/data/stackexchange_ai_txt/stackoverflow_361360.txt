From Naming a File or Directory on MSDN : In the Windows API (with some exceptions discussed in the following paragraphs), the maximum length for a path is MAX_PATH , which is defined as 260 characters. Even if you could coerce longer strings out of the dialog, you may run into trouble down the line when using APIs that have been coded against MAX_PATH . The docs go on to say: The Windows API has many functions that also have Unicode versions to permit an extended-length path for a maximum total path length of 32,767 characters. This type of path is composed of components separated by backslashes, each up to the value returned in the lpMaximumComponentLength parameter of the GetVolumeInformation function. To specify an extended-length path, use the "\\?\" prefix. For example, "\\?\D:\ " . (The characters > are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of a valid path string.)
