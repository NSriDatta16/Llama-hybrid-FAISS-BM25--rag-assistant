You can't, really. Logistic regression is typically intended to model discrete outcomes, like being dead or alive, sick or well, or account in good standing/default. You, however, want to predict a continuous value (in [280, 850] or [501, 990] or whatever). You could get the probability of default out of a logistic regression model, but that alone is typically just one component of a credit score. You could potentially plug that value, along with other predictors, into a regression model to predict a credit score. Strictly speaking, I'm not even sure if credit scoring systems are actually regression models. There may just be some proprietary algorithm that combines the information to produce a single value using ad-hoc weights.
