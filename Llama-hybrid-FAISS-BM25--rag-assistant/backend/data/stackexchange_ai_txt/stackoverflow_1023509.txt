You're not actually using a salt. Salt is a randomly generated string that is included in the input for your hash function. As such, it will be different every time. The idea is that you generate a salt when a user stores a password, and that this salt is included in your data storage. When authenticating, you retrieve the salt and the stored hash, you prefix the given password with the stored salt, and hash the two together. Then compare the result with the stored hash.
