Excel rocks for importing data. You can quickly edit, troubleshoot, and it has lots of options to organize data. Several developers at my company tried to phase out the Excel data import sheets, but they all failed (one after 6 man-months.) It not always worth the effort to build a specialized data entry web site or windows app. :)
