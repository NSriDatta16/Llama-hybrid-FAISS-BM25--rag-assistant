I asked myself a very similar question recently: Cross-classified multilevel model with lagged dependent variable Using R I found this recent publication by Hamaker & Muthén (2019) in which the authors point out that the "endogenous problem" could simply be overcome by group-mean centering of the predictor variables (i.e., including the lagged dependent variable). In essence if you group-mean center the predictor variable this variable can "by definition" not correlate with the random intercepts of a person (i.e., the endogenous problem). So in short: Regardless of Bayesian or frequentist statistics, as long as you group-mean center you should not have a problem of endogeneity. Reference: Hamaker, E. L., & Muthén, B.
