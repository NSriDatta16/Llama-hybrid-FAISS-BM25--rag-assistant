Should I include non significant coefficient for forecasting with ARIMA model?

My goal is to make forecasts from a time series by using an ARIMA model, but I am not sure if I should include a non-significant coefficient in my equation for predicting future values. I have tried some models and ended up picking an ARIMA (2, 1, 0) as the best one, comparing the AICs and RMSEs. However, when observing the standard errors and p-values for the hypothesis tests, I found that the coefficient of the first autoregressive component was not significant. Also, the ACF and PACF showed no effect from the first lag. So, my question is: should I include this term to make predictions or should it be removed from the equation?
