Your question seems rather confused to me. You mention a SQL Server, but you don't say your application uses SQL Server for its data storage. Thus, I can only assume that you have a single MDB or ACCDB file with your data tables and forms and reports all in the one file. The only proper way to distribute this app is: split it into front end (forms/reports/etc.) with linked tables that point to the back end (data tables only). place the back end on your file server and relink your tables to point to the new location of the back end. give a copy of the front end to each of the 3 users, who will run it from their desktop computers. If you're concerned about distributing changes to the front end, something like Tony Toews's front-end updater is very useful. Others have jumped in to say that you should put the data in SQL Server, but most 3-user Access apps don't need the power of SQL Server. If you're not given administrative permissions on your SQL Server, it could be quite difficult to continue to alter your application's database. On the other hand, if your database is going to grow to 1GB or more, or if you have strict security requirements, or if the data in your database is so important as to need completely failproof backups, then SQL Server would be a reasonable data store. For most homegrown apps, not so much.
