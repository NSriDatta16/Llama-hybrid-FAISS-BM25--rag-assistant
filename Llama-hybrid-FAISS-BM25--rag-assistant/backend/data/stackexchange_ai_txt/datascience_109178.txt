Given the relative complexity of the data to the amount of data, machine learning might not be useful. Here are several different machine learning options: If you ignore the sequence information (aka, the bag-of-words style assumption), you can fit any traditional multi-class classification algorithm. If you make the Markov assumption, you'll only need to look at the last element in the sequence. Then it can be modeled as a simple Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM). Then start relaxing the Markov assumption by looking back at progressively more time steps. It is possible to frame it as reinforcement learning (RL) but that would require far more data.
