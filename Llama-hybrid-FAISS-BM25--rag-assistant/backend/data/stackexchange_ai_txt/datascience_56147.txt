Let me try to explain you with an example, Consider we have a dataset with features X1, X2 and Y is the target value. Now in Machine Learning our traget is to get an equation which should calculate the value as close as target value. Consider a simple equation, f(X) = w1X1 + w2X2 + b and here our target is to identify best value of weights i.e. w1 and w2 such that f(X) ~Y. Generally, initially f(X) gives you a very different value(as weights are not tuned), but gradually with each iteration(epoch), f(x) becomes better(weights getting tuned), that is called "parameter Learning".
