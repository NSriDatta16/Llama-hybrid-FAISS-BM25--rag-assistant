how prediction of xgboost correspond to leaves values

I trained xgboost regressor. Now I want to see its fitted trees and to trace the prediction of an object. For simplicity I trained model with n_estimators = 1. But when I make a prediction for some object, I don't understand, how to get the same value with fitted trees. So the prediction for object [0.92689...] is 0.334... (which is ok, according to the plot), but 0.334 doesn't seem to be one of the leaves values. So my question is, given the fitted xgboost (fitted trees of xgboost), how prediction of xgboost correspond to leaves values?
