By the properties of logarithms, $$ y = \sqrt{x} $$$$ \log(y)=0.5\log(x) $$ So the net effect in something like a regression setting is to add a constant multiplier out front of the variable, i.e. to double the coefficient value of the log-square-root compared to simply taking the log. But in other contexts, the effect won't matter at all! If you're using decision tree methods (e.g. random forest), and x > 0, then it won't even matter because these models are insensitive to monotonic transformations of the data.
