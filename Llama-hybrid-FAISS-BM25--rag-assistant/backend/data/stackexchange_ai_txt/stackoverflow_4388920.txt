Maven and AppServer dependency management best practice

I am developing a web-app and use maven for dependency management (duh). Some of the needed jars are already available in the server lib folder, but do not match the "maven naming scheme", ie missing the version suffix. I would like to use them for development and deployment, but.. 1. i cant point maven to them because maven seem to need a version suffix. I cant omit it in the pom. 2. If i define the dependency outside maven then maven is obviously unable to build. 3. Renaming the files inside the server distribution sounds like a kludge. What would Brian Boitano do? I mean, there sure is an elegant solution that im not aware of, or at least a good argument for one of the three solutions above. Thank you PS. i am using jboss 5.1 and maven 2.2.1 atm, but its subject to change
