No access to developer tools in Opera without a connection to Internet

I have noticed that when being in offline mode (the computer is not connected to the Internet), Developer Tools (AKA Dragonfly) in Opera are not accessible. When choosing them from the menu, Opera thinks for a while then displays a connection error. Is there any way to use Developer Tools without being connected to Internet?
