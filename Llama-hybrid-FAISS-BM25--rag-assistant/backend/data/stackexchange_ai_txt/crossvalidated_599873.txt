As already noted above, $c$ -index is related to Somers' $D$ : $$ c = \frac{D_{XY} + 1}{2} $$ but that requires us to be able to compute $D_{XY}$ . This is not quite trivial. In a comment below the linked answer , Frank Harrell explains how it's done in R's rms library: Internal, all possible combinations of observations having different $Y$ values are examined, and the fraction of such pairs for which predictions are in the same order is the estimate of the concordance probability. In the Python's scipy.stats module there is a function somersd to compute $D_{XY}$ . One should pay attention, however, that $D$ is not symmetric: in general, $D_{XY} \neq D_{YX}$ , so the order of the parameters is important. From the documentation: somersd(x, y) calculates Somers' $D(Y|X)$
