We're mostly an MS shop at this stage or at least that's the direction we're looking to take (compelling business reasons for a start-up) but are wanting to avoid any lock-in. One approach I'm looking at is having a middleware framework that abstracts away the cloud specifics. The middleware would comprise of two primary layers, the lower layer would a Cloud Adapter to abstract away the nuances and API of the specific cloud. The upper layer would provide general framework services. The middleware would be responsible for: User, Credentials etc: Should provide any user information, profiles, and authorisation etc. Security: Should provide any security implementations and enforce any restrictions. Cloud Provider specifics: Instance and storage management. Measuring usage and cost of cloud usage. Instance services: Lower-level services within an instance e.g. CPU, memory, local storage. Provide Parallel processing implementation. Creating endpoints/ports etc. Abstract away access to cloud storage (e.g. tables, queues, blobs in azure). Configuration of application services. Deployment: Any specifics required for deployment to a cloud - would attempt to automate cloud-specific deployment. Logging: Should be a comprehensive logging framework that allows performance measurement across the cloud. Comments welcome.
