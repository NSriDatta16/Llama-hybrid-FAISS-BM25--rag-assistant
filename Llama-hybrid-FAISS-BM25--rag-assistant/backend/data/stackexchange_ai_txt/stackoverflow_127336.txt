Decipher Client-Side Rules binary definition for Microsoft Outlook

Outlook saves its client-side rule definitions in a binary blob in a hidden message in the Inbox folder of the default store for a profile. The hidden message is named "Outlook Rules Organizer" with a message class IPM.RuleOrganizer . The binary blob is saved in property 0x6802. The same binary blob is written to the exported RWZ file when you manually export the rules through the Rules and Alerts Wizard. Has anyone deciphered the layout of this binary blob?
