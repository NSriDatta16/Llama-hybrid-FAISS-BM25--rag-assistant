Authentication Error when accessing Sharepoint list via web service

I wrote a windows service a few months ago that would ping a Sharepoint list using _vti_bin/lists.asmx function GetListItemChanges. It was working fine until a few weeks ago when my company upgraded our Sharepoint instance to SP1. Now whenever my service attempts to access Sharepoint I receive an 401.1 authentication error: Error: You are not authorized to view this page You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials that you supplied. Please try the following: Contact the Web site administrator if you believe you should be able to view this directory or page. HTTP Error 401.1 - Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials. Internet Information Services (IIS) I have checked and my privileges on the site have not changed. here is the code In which I call the list: Lists listsService = new Lists(); listsService.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("UserName", "Password", "domain"); Result = listsService.GetListItemChanges("List name", null, dTime.ToString(), null); It has also been brought to my attention that basic authentication may have been disabled on our farm. I don't believe I'm using that but I may be mistaken.
