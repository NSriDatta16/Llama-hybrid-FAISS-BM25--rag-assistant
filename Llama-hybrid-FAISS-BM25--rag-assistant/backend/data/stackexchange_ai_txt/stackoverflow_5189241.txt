How to find the average of a set of bearings

Possible Duplicate: How do you calculate the average of a set of angles? If I have a set of bearings, ranging from 1-360, how can I find the average? Usually to find the average one would add them all up and divide by the number of items. The problem here is that doing that in the case of [1, 359], 2 bearings, would result in in 180, which in fact should be 360. Any ideas?
