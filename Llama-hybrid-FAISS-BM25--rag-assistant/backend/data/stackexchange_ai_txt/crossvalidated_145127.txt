Trained Logistic Regression returns 'NAN' for some out of sample data

I'm using MATLAB R2015a , glmfit function for training and glmval for out of sample evaluation. My input sample and out-of-sample are normalized (MAX-MIN mapping / Using MAX-MIN of training sample set for normalizing out-of-sample data set). When I'm suing SVM or MLP model there isn't any problem and I have output values for all out-of-samples but when I check Logistic Regression outputs, in some samples I have NAN as output. In cases that we have NAN as output, all inputs are negative (or many of them) as we can see in above picture. The above data set is out-of-sample that we used to predict output probabibites after model training phase. Why Logistic Regression returns Nan output for these samples? PS. In training phase I have this error : Warning: Iteration limit reached.
