This is a terribly context-sensitive situation. I'd like to build on the suggestions of postos and tvanfosson. I don't think names of cities and countries are needed except to help people set their local time and maybe in a dialog for setting times that might be for other locations when they only know the desired local time (big challenge to not overwhelm/distract users with what is clutter to them). If a location is associated with the time, then the date and time at that location is often appropriate (e.g., when speaking of market closings, events, trip arrivals and departures, and so on). I favor the idea that a tool-tip is available for translating it into (1) gmt and (2) the apparent local time of the user who is seeing the interface. Offsets are useful too, and also the date when midnight crossings are involved. I also concur that the time zone should be explicit as a cue that it might not be the local time. Furthermore, even when a local time is shown without timezone, I think that tool-tip is still important. (Especially when someone traveling with a lap-top may keep their homebase timezone setting.) Bonus attention to detail: Dealing with time shifts for summer time, daylight savings, etc., and their difference between locations (not every place has summer time, not every place makes the change at the same time) and between points of time (into the future especially).
