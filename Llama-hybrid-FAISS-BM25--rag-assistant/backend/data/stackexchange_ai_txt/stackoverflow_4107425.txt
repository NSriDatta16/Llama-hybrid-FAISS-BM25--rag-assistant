How do I save the character occupying a certain space in curses?

I'm beginning to try making some simple console games in C++ with curses, and my first project is just a large room to walk around in. I figure I'm gonna implement walking by having the program save the state of the square that the character is walking on, so when he walks onto the next square, it can restore whatever was there. Problem is, I don't know how to save the character at a certain position to a variable, and to my surprise I can't seem to find any comprehensive curses documentation. I'm looking for a function like this: int storage = mvsavechar(1,1); Does any such function exist?
