For knowing that Javascript was originally called LiveScript and the 'Java' prefix was attached for marketing purposes not because Java and Javascript are related (which they are not). Oh and for owning any version of David Flanagan's 'Javascript: The Definitive Guide' (this information is on page 2). ... and for appreciating those that have gone before in trying to obfuscate Internet Explorer 4's document.all[] and Netscape Navigator 4's document.layers[] before the likes of Jquery took away the pain. EDIT: As @Kinopiko points out JavaScript was called project Mocha originally ( some sources also reckon it was called project LiveWire) but it is generally accepted that the language (written by Brendan Eich) was slated to be released as LiveScript before the Java prefix was adopted on release in early 1996.
