How to copy picture from Word to Powerpoint programmatically?

I am creating a macro that converts a Word 2007 document into a structured PowerPoint 2007 presentation. I am looping over all the paragraphs of the document and copying them over to the new presentation. I am able to copy and paste the paragraphs to the presentation just fine. But I also need to be able to copy and paste the pictures from the Word document into the PowerPoint (and in the right location between paragraphs). So far, I am able to detect if a paragraph is a picture by looking at the paragraph's style attribute - it will say "Figure". But, I don't know what to do from there. After looking online, it looks like I should be able to do this: paragraphFromDocument.Range.Copy currentSlide.Shapes.Paste But, this doesn't seem to work. How do I copy a picture from Word to PowerPoint? Thanks EDIT I've also tried: paragraphFromDocument.Range.CopyAsPicture currentSlide.Shapes.PasteSpecial(ppPasteMetafilePicture) and get this error message: Shapes.PasteSpecial : Invalid Request. Clipboard is empty or contains data which may not be posted here. But, when I use that CopyAsPicture command, I am able to open up PowerPoint (with the picture still on the clipboard from the macro) and use the Paste Special command to paste the picture to the slide.
