You have to create what is known as a modeling pipeline this includes creating so-called transformers. These transformers basically apply all necessary data transformations on your raw data to make the input "fit" for the trained model. This might include things like One-Hot-Encoding, etc. It is important to "fit" these transformers on your training set only e.g. OHE only encodes values it knows from the training data set and treats everything else as NA. Some of your transformers are a bit more involved though. If you have performed clustering / PCA for example and used the resulting dimensions in your model you cannot simply do the same steps on a new data. You have to create a suitable transformer which varies depending on your steps. For example with a factor analysis you are usually able to extract a regression model which predicts the factors based on the raw input. You then apply this regression model fitted on the training data to the new unseen data.
