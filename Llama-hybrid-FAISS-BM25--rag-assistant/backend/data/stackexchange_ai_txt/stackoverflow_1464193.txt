Make a space between paragraph (X)HTML and CSS

I want space between my content tags. Not before and not after tags. For example, my code is: A headline Some text Some text Something I don't want space between h1 and p which is done with zero margin on h1. But I don't want space after the last tag. Is this possible without :last-child or some JavaScript/jQuery? I can't set class="last" on the last tag because it is a CMS system.
