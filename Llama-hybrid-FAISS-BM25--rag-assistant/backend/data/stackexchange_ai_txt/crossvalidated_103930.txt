Discrete uniform random variable(?) taking all rational values in a closed interval

I just had an (intellectual) panic attack. A continuous random variable that follows a uniform in a closed interval $U(a,b)$: a comfortably familiar statistical concept. A continuous uniform r.v. having support over the extended reals (half or whole): not an r.v. proper, but a basic Bayesian concept for an improper prior, useful and applicable. A discrete uniform taking a finite number of values: let's throw a geodesic dome, no big deal. But what about a function that has as its domain all the rationals that are included in a closed interval with integer bounds (start with the $[0,1]$ if you wish)? And we want to use it in a probabilistic framework, requiring that each possible value has equal probability with all the others? The number of possible values are countably infinite (which characterizes a lot of discrete distributions), but how to express the probability of a single value given that we want probabilities equal? Can we say-show-prove that such an entity is (is not) a random variable? If not, is this another incarnation (perhaps already well-known) of an "improper prior"? Is it possible that this entity is in some well-defined sense, however special, "equivalent" to a continuous uniform r.v.? Or I just committed a cardinal(ity) sin? It appears that the fact that the domain is a closed interval does not let me let go. Bounded things are usually manageable. The questions are many in order to be indicative of the internal maelstrom- I am not asking to get answers to each one of them. At any time that I may come up with any insights, I will update. UPDATE: the present question just acquired a constructivist sequel here.
