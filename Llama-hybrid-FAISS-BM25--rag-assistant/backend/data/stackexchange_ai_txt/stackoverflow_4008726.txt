What kind of storage is the file on? A normal HDD or a SSD? In case of a normal hdd you should minimize seek times, so you might need to order your accesses by the offset. I think having large memory mapped segments doesn't cost much RAM. They only cost address space since they can be backed by the file itself. So the most of the used RAM is the OS cache. From what I heard async IO using I/O Completion Ports is fastest, but I haven't used them myself yet.
