What your asking is essentially what Box Jenkins ARIMA modeling does (your yearly cycles would be referred to as seasonal components). Besides looking up materials on your own, I would suggest Applied Time Series Analysis for the Social Sciences 1980 by R McCleary ; R A Hay ; E E Meidinger ; D McDowall Although I can think of reasonable reasons for why you want to forecast further into the future (and hence assess the error when doing so) it is often very difficult in practice. If you have very strong seasonal components it will be more feasible. Otherwise your estimates will likely reach an equilibrium in relatively few future time periods. If you plan on using R to fit your models you should probably check out Rob Hyndman's website (Hopefully he will give you better advice than me!)
