Approximating a function using one hidden neural networks

I have implemented a neural network that has one hidden layer to approximate the following function: by trying different numbers of nodes (ranging from 1 to 20). Using 6 nodes in the hidden layer had the best results (lowest mse). I want to know if there is any relationship between the number of hidden layers and the inflection points in the function.
