Looping through "steps", then "sub-steps", then "sub-sub-steps" in PHP/CodeIgniter

I guess my first question is, since I'm the lone developer, I miss having others to throw ideas off of, or to get ideas when I'm stuck on a problem. Is there a site that's specific to solving that problem? Like a virtual co-programmer site? Or can StackOverflow work like that? My main question: I'm working on something like a "to do" list, but each item can possibly have sub-steps... or even sub-sub-steps... and maybe even further. I've got a table with the fields "id, item, parent_id", with all the top-level items having a parent_id = 0. Using Datamapper ORM in CodeIgniter, I'm using this: $i = new Item(); $i->where('parent_id',0)->get(); foreach($i as $item) { echo $item->item; $si = new Item(); $si->where('parent_id',$item->id)->get(); foreach($si as $subItem) { echo $subItem->item; // and so on } } It works, but is there a smarter way to accomplish this? Some kind of recursive function maybe? I'm also working on a way to have everything administered by someone else, so they can just drag-and-drop the Items where they need to go... but that's a whole other issue for another day.
