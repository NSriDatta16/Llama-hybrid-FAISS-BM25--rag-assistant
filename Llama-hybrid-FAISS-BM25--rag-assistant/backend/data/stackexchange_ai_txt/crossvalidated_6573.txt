(Disclaimer: I am by no means very experienced in Bayesian stats or using BUGS!) What parameters would you like to estimate? What does "mu = 10, tau=1/10" mean? Are these numbers considered to be priors? Let us assume your interested in estimating $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. (Keep in mind that Win/OpenBUGS use the precision, i.e prec = 1/$\sigma^2$). So, your BUGS model could look like this: model { for (i in 1:3) { x[i] ~ dnorm(mu, prec) } ## priors (will have strong impact on the parameter estimation) prec ~ dgamma(0.1, 0.001) mu ~ dnorm(2.0, 0.0001) var I am using OpenBUGS (10,000 iterations, burn-in: 5000; starting values were generated by OpenBUGS) and here are my results: mean sd MC_error val2.5pc median val97.5pc start sample mu 1.544 0.6666 0.01039 0.3894 1.535 2.728 5000 5002 prec 4.155 3.942 0.06772 0.1263 3.024 14.38 5000 5002 var 1.31 5.893 0.1191 0.06952 0.331 7.917 5000 5002 You might realize that the variance estimator has been heavily affected by the choice of the prior. As @whuber already mentioned, I strongly recommend that you check out the many examples that come with any of the BUGS packages. You also might be interested in "Bayesian Methods for Ecology" or "Bayesian Modeling Using WinBUGS: An introduction" .
