It is a completely different paradigm. Boosting involves using a group of outcomes to achieve a final result instead of just one. The outcomes are separately weighted so that more accurate ones have a bigger influence on the final result. It is hard to understand simulated annealing starting from simulated annealing. I recommend looking at articles on MCMC first, or understand the idea of hill-climbing (iteratively moving to the next best solution). GAs are once again different, but the most intuitive, since they are pretty true to their name.
