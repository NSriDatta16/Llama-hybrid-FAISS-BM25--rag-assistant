The card with both sides red is basically (forgive the pun) a red herring -- any way it's dealt, it'll come up red and we don't need to care about it any more. That leaves only the red/black and the black/black card. Again, we need pay no further attention if the red/black is dealt red side up. The remaining possibilities are: red/black, black up black/black, first side up black/black, second side up Since two of those three have the other side black, the probability is two out of three.
