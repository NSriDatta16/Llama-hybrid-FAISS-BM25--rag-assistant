How can I visualise and understand the relationship between n dimensions

I am new at the field of machine learning. I have non-linear 6 dimensions, and I want to understand the relationship between 5 dimensions first. And, then understand how these 5 dimensions behave related to the sixth. dimension. Can I ask if there is any techniques in machine learning can help?
