You are training a machine learner to identify patterns in your (training) data. If you later incorporate data it has never encountered before it has no idea what to do with it (it literally is seeing this information for the first time). Think of it as reading Chinese, while you've only learned English. Sure there's a lot of info in the Chinese text but there's no way for you to understand it without learning (at least a little bit). Even if it is as simple as a linear correlation, without prior knowledge it will just see a single value for a single case and have no information of how that individual value relates to the thing you want to predict. I think it's important to know that the machine learner typically looks at individual cases and not at the data as a whole. Example: We trained a machine learner to understand that a high value in column A + a low value in column B equals a high value in our predicted column Z. If we present data with an additional column C to the machine learner, it will not have learned how this value relates to the value in column Z (or how it relates to the other columns), so it will not be able to make use of it. Time series & RNN: As discussed in the comments. If the additional columns only represent more of the same data (for example, a varying number of values representing the same thing, such as bitcoin values). Then it is possible to use certain algorithms to analyse these. Using RNN's for example it is possible to "slide" over time series data and analyse different data of different lengths this way. However, this all assumes the data represents the same thing.
