(Edited after clarification) std::map is optimized for fast searching. It has its own find method that uses its internal structure to provide good performance. In general, it will only inspect log(N) keys, where N is the number of items in the map. std::list is a simple linked list, and so only supports element-by-element traversal. You could use the separate std::find algorithm, or std::find_if with a custom predicate that only examines the first member to better match the semantics of std::map::find , but that would be very slow. In fact, it will have to look at every pair in the list for any failed search, and will look at half on average for any successful one.
