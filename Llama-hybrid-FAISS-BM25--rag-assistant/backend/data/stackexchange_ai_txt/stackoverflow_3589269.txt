Sometimes resorting to the "disassembly view" of the C++ code and stepping through the optimized release x86 give you an idea of what's going on. Pay special attention to function calls (many times those cannot be optimized out), and code around those calls - before and after, and register usage (many times variables are optimized into hardware registers). Regardless of whether this works or not, you learn a little bit about x86 assembly, compiler optimization, and how C++ is actually implemented!
