How to deal with inept management

A project I was working on has finished, so I've been moved on to some new tasking at my employer. The previous work was very agile, small team, progress over procedure, etc etc. So anyway, the new project I'm on - I find myself confused on how to deal with management. They have no real understanding of object oriented programing , current technologies or methodologies. They seem to fear change and just recently we moved to the latest JRE We do these code reviews and I have to listen to "gray beards" saying how much better it is in ADA or how they used to do things in C. But then when they try to code review - they lack even the most basic understanding of OOP design and dev. They focus more on the style of the code; spacing; method names; etc. One of the senior level people say we should be writing our own logger instead of using log4j because of one negative review of log4j in an academic PDF written ages ago. How do I deal with this? How can I explain to them that their design is faulty or that they are really behind the times, without coming across as a jerk. I've only been with this organization for about a year - so I don't know how much credibility I will have.
