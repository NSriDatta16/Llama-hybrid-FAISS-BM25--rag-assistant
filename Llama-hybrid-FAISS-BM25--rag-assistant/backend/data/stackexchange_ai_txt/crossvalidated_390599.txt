That's more a hint than a formal proof. Let's start with N. N is a Poisson variable. Therefore, there is a Poisson process whose count is N. That Poisson process has an average of $\lambda$ events per time unit. If we don't count all successes but each one has an (independent) probability $p$ of being counted, we still have a Poisson process, but now its average will be $\lambda·p$ . Please notice that the result of this process will yield the same result as the definition of $Z$ : after each observation of $N$ (e.g. after each unit time) we decide randomly to keep each event with probability $p$ . Therefore, $Z$ is a Poisson variable with average $\lambda·p$ .
