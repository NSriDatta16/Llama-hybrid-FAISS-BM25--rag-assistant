There could be several reasons. The original developer may have intended to black box the dll for external usage. It's possible the other developer had a custom-built, "in the can" test harness for testing libraries of this nature. Precompiled dlls are a little more secure during the SDLC because intermediate agents can't impact the code behind. Code in a web service that is not compiled can be edited accidentally (or with malicious intent even). In the end, it could just have been the guy's preference. The decision really is fairly arbitrary unless you have some outside factor as an influence.
