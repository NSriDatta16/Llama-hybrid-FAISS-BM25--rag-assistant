Unit root tests and stationarity

Two common methods of testing whether a time series is stationary are the KPSS and ADF tests. If my understanding is correct, these tests essentially work by measuring the residuals of fitting the time-series to an autoregressive model which is linear. So my question is this, if the time series is possibly of a non-linear nature are the results of the above tests still valid?
