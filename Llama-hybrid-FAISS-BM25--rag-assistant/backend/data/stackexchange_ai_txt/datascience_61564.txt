How to choose solution - Neural Neworks or Scikit-Learn/Numpy/Pandas?

I am trying to solve a problem - categorising and routing service desk emails to concerned teams for resolution. Created and tested a model using Scikit-Learn, Numpy and Pandas. - Tokenized the email subject and body, used Bag-of-Words/TfIdf, and applied ML algos like - SVMs, Random Forest, Linear Classification, etc. Now, as I read more came across NLP and Neural Networks, Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc. May I ask how to choose the correct tool or solution for my particular problem? Please advise.
