Most machine learning algorithms are designed with complete trust in the labels. There is no standard way to model uncertainty in data labels. Thus, create a project-specific threshold for uncertainty to omit data or labelers. For example, a trusted classification data label would require n of m ensemble voting. One major issue is re-labeling. Systems tend to evolve over time and the definition of labels is refined. Mature data labeling system have a notion of data lineage - "Who labeled what data when with what criteria". The book "Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning" by Robert Munro goes into greater detail.
