Data Mining - Intent matching and classification of text

PROBLEM Suppose you have a list of 100,000+ google queries related to travel bookings. For example: hotels in london barcelona flight city breaks to berlin khao san road hostel luxury holiday to paris new york business class flight price disneyland trip... How can I extract the location i.e., London Classify the Line of Business i.e., flight, hotel, package, etc Classify the affinity i.e., luxury, family, city break, beach etc Use this info to record the frequency of various pattern that exists in the keywords i.e. **keyword pattern** **frequency** (destination) hotel xxx flight to (destination) yyy (theme) (destination) hotel zzz POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS Manual - get an exhaustive as possible list of locations (most of the queries will be for tourist destinations) and look for a match against the keywords. Again, compare the keywords against possible Line of Business Identifiers and Affinity Identifiers Google Cloud Natural Language API - This can be used to analyse Entities and Sentiment of text. e.g. hotels in london -> entity(hotels), entity(london) barcelona flight -> entity(flight), entity(barcelona) This isn't very powerful and only supports english. Machine learning - seems difficult as I haven't got any descriptors for the keywords. Would Naive Bayes be applicable or SVM? I'd preferably like to run any solution in R too. Could someone please suggest a direction/potential solution?
