You're probably running into memory fragmentation issues somewhere. Playing around with really large blocks of memory, especially in any situation where they might need to be reallocated tends to cause out of memory errors when in theory you have enough memory to do the job. If it needs a 600mb block and it can't find a hole that's 600mb wide that's it, out of memory. While I have never tried it my inclination for a workaround would be to create a very minimal program that does ONLY the one operation. Keep it absolutely as simple as possible to keep the memory allocation minimal. When faced with a risky operation like this call the external program to do the job. The program runs, does the one operation and exits. The point is the new program is in it's own address space. The only true fix is 64 bit and we don't have that option yet.
