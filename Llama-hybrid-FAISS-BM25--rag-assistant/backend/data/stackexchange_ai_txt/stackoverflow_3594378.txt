One more detail - if you reserve space for your vector in advance: int main() { vector *vx = new vector ; vx->reserve(5); .... Then you'll get the following output: ---constructor +++ copy constructor ***desctructor ---constructor +++ copy constructor ***desctructor ... So as you can see vector also copies all its elements when it is needed to reallocate its storage - that's why you get 5 copy constructors and destructors for the last push_back()
