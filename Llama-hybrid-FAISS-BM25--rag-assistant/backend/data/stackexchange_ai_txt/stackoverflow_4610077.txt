I found the following documentation: http://www.ejb3.org/jar_file_reverse/jar_file_reverse.html This tool is not free but it works pretty well. You can also use Topcased but the quality of the reversed information is mediocre and it is not really possible to recreate advanced diagrams from the reversed model.
