I don't know what the 'MVC Build Agent' is, but it's not a component of Team Foundation Server. Sounds like you have a custom assembly that's failing to load. Check the build controller properties to see where it's looking for its custom assemblies. You'll need to either (a) check-in the dependencies required by this custom assembly, or (b) change/remove the custom assembly path for the build controller so it no longer tries to load it.
