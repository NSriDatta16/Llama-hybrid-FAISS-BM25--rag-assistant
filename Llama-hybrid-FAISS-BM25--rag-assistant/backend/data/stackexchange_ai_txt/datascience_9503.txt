I think you are making things more confusing then they are. Binary In this case you have two possible outputs: Obama = 1. Not-Obama (who in this case can only be Romney) = 0. Multi-Class In this case you have k possible outputs, for example when k = 4 : k = 0 : Obama k = 1 : Romney k = 2 : Clinton k = 3 : Bush There are approaches to tackle multi-class classification as binary classification which are called One-vs-rest classification and One-vs-one classification , other classifiers, such as Random Forests, are able to deal with a multiclass setting in a natural way. For a brief report, see here .
