"Supervised" usually means you have labeled response/target. I would say the matrix $W$ is "given" or "provided" or "fixed", rather than "supervised". As a tool to recognize patterns or predict observations, machine learning models are "supervised" if they are given correct labels to try to predict. Compared to "unsupervised" models which try to recognize the patterns on their own. Supervised/unsupervised is the adjective that describes the model, not the (hyper)parameter. Hyperparameters are either searched for optimal values, or given based on empirical knowledge.
