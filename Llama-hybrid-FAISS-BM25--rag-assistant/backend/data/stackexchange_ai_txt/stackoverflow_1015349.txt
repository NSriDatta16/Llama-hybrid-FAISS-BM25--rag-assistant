Audio in Java Applet not playing

I am trying to play audio in a Java applet but it is not working. What could be the problem? EDIT: Besides the limited number of files that Java can play, the problem was that I didn't realize that the bin folder (in Eclipse workspace) contains the .class file that is run. So my code referring to the getDocumentBase() couldn't find the audio file. -_-" import java.applet.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; public class Viewer extends Applet implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener { AudioClip sound1; AudioClip tap; AudioClip clap; public void init() { sound1 = this.getAudioClip(getDocumentBase(),"boom.au"); tap = getAudioClip(getDocumentBase(), "tap.au"); clap = getAudioClip(getDocumentBase(), "clap.au"); this.resize(600,600); addMouseListener(this); setBackground(Color.BLACK); } public void paint (Graphics g) { } public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) { sound1.play(); System.out.println("BOOM!"); } public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) { } public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) { } public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { tap.play(); System.out.println("tap!"); } public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) { } public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { } public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e) { } }
