Relative Importance of categorical variables

My question concerns management issues more than statistical theory. I am searching for a way to measure the relative importance/influence of categorical variables in a logistic regression model with continuous and categorical variables. Since the standard deviation of dummy variables is hard to interpret, I am searching for a robust method which doesnâ€™t include the standard deviation. Usually I use the standardized coefficients to evaluate the influence of a variable.
