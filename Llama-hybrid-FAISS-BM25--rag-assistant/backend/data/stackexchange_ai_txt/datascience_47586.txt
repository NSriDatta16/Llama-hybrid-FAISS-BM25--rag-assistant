Data prepration for logistic regression : Value either "not available" or a "year"

I have some data of houses that have been renovated. In my data there is one column (among others) that captures this information. It is either "-1" if there has not been yet any renovation, or the information is the year of renovation like "1995" or "2008". I would like to apply logistic regression. However, I do not know how to treat this value. IMHO it looks like a missing value although it is not a missing information. So, does anybody have an idea how to put these (unordered) values into relation to the ordered years? On alternative I could think of is binning the information. Like 1990-1995, 1996-2000,...2016-2019. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.
