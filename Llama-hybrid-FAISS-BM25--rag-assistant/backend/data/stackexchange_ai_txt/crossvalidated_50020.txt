A negative Cronbach alpha when there is a good factor is usually due to some items being reverse coded. In a factor analysis, this doesn't matter, the loadings just become negative. But for Cronbach alpha, the correlation between that item and the others will be negative, thus messing things up. e.g. Suppose you had the following questions From 1 to 100, please rate the following people George W. Bush Barack Obama Hillary Clinton Ronald Reagan Richard Nixon Well, I would guess there would be one strong factor, but alpha would be lousy. if this is the problem the solution is simple: Just reverse code the items that need it
