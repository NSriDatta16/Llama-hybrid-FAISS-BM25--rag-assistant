Variables and constants are pointers to memory locations. Ruby does this by defaut, so you don't have to "emulate" the PVP behaviour by hand. Evidence: a = "hi" b = a a.upcase! puts a # => "HI" puts b # => "HI" As for your @app_session question, I'd do something like this: class ApplicationController This lets you call the method 'app_session', so that you can easily change the implementation later on. (Say, if you find out that you need to use a constant instead of an instance variable, or whatever.)
