If you have a webserver configured to serve up digital certificates with the correct mime-type then Safari on the iPhone will add them to the trust store. mime-type for a CA certificate is "application/x-x509-ca-cert" (example here ) When safari downloads this certificate it will as the user if they want to trust it. Once trusted it appears in the Settings | General | Profiles section as a Configuration Profile. alt text http://o-regan.org/cacert.png The certificate is also inserted into the TrustStore.sqlite3 db. Verified that by doing a backup and extracting the DB with iphone backup extractor . I'm not sure if that now means that it is trusted for other purposes, say as an SSL root. Hope this helps, I might investigate more if time permits.
