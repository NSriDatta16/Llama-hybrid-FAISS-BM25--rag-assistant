Java XML: using DOM with StAX to construct a document

I am using StAX to construct an XML document using an XMLStreamWriter . However, there are portions of my document where it is difficult to make calls to XMLStreamWriter's methods one-by-one, and it would be easier to construct a small document fragment using DOM, then write that out. I know how to use DOM, but here's my question: is there an easy way to take an Element object and write it out to an XMLStreamWriter ? I can probably figure out how to "connect" the two methods, but it seems like it would be tedious & something should be out there already. (going the other way appears to be trivial: http://blogs.oracle.com/venu/entry/constructing_dom_using_stax_writers )
