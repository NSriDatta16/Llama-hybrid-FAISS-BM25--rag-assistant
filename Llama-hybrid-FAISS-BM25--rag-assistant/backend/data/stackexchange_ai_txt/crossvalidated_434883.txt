Forecasting method to use with large seasonal swing but otherwise stable data

I am attempting to forecast percentage of churn. However, I am running into issues. The churn is fairly stable except at each year anniversary point. For example, data looks like this for the first year Month 9: 1.013770726 Month 10: 1.013770726 Month 11: 1.015761766 Month 12: 0.72113357 #big drop in first year The next year looks fairly stable except the 2nd anniversary point: Month 21: 0.7765050878 Month 22: 0.7844692491 Month 23: 0.7884513297 Month 24: 0.4732490503 I thought about simple exponential smoothing model or a simple weighted average. That will help me with normal months but not the expected large drop each year point. I also tried an arima. That helped with the seasonal drop but well under-forecasted all the other months. Is there an another option that is obvious that I am not considering? Here is the completed data set month churn 2016-09-01 0.9854712144 2016-10-01 1.000828964 2016-11-01 1.000828964 2016-12-01 1.000828964 2017-01-01 1.004811044 2017-02-01 1.006802085 2017-03-01 1.006802085 2017-04-01 1.009788645 2017-05-01 1.009788645 2017-06-01 1.013770726 2017-07-01 1.013770726 2017-08-01 1.015761766 2017-09-01 0.72113357 2017-10-01 0.7300932514 2017-11-01 0.7346932411 2017-12-01 0.7406663621 2018-01-01 0.7565946846 2018-02-01 0.7585857249 2018-03-01 0.7625678056 2018-04-01 0.7685409265 2018-05-01 0.7725230072 2018-06-01 0.7765050878 2018-07-01 0.7844692491 2018-08-01 0.7884513297 2018-09-01 0.4732490503 2018-10-01 0.4890469254
