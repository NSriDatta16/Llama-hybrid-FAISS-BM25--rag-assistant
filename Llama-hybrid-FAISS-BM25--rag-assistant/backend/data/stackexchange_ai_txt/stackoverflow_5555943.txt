"The Social Network" programming puzzle

There's a neat sequence in the movie The Social Network in which the character writes a perl script to grab images from sorority web servers on campus. His goal is to get a picture for every member of each sorority with a minimum of missed members. Typically, this just involves him grabbing it from a public directory or other little hoops like an empty search which returns all members, but he describes one really interesting set up and never gives a solution for it. One sorority's site allows for searching and returns the pictures for matching members. However, if a search returns more than 20 matches, nothing is displayed. Assuming no other way to access the pictures and without a list of the names of sorority members, is there an elegant way to get at least a majority of member pictures in this case? Or any way at all? Edit: Here's a link to the scene from the movie, slightly cut up to show only the coding parts.
