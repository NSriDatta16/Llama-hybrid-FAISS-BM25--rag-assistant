Detecting change points in a time series requires the construction of a robust global ARIMA model (certainly flawed by model changes and parameter changes over time in your case ) and then identifying the most significant change point in the parameters of that model. Using your 509 values the most significant change point was around period 353. I used some proprietary algorithms available in AUTOBOX (which I have helped develop) that could possibly be licensed for your customized application. The basic idea is to separate the data into two parts and upon finding the most important change point re-analyze each of the two time ranges separately (1-352 ; 353-509 ) to determine further change points within each of the two sets. This is repeated until you have k subsets. I have attached the first step using this approach. Visually it appears to me that the most important point change point has been identified.
