The TPR is defined as $\frac{TP}{P}$ (see, e.g. Wikipedia ) or Encyclopedia of Systems Biology which says it is "In machine learning, the true positive rate, also referred to sensitivity or recall, is used to measure the percentage of actual positives which are correctly identified." or other sources. So, when there are no positive cases, I would say that the TPR is undefined. But your question is a little ambiguous, see the other answer, which reads your question differently.
