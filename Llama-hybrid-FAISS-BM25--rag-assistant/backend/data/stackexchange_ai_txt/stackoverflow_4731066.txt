Me too. I have been a member for the last 1 3 / 4 years, so i've got a good feel for the SO flow. For me moderation is NOT about spending endless hours on SO editing posts, removing tags from post titles and reminding tardy users about 0% accept rates (i already do that). It's about jumping on dirty spammers, bringing delinquent users into line, and responding to user requests submitted via the flag for moderator attention action. (I've thrown some random formatting into this nomination just to show that i know how to use it. Kind of.) I'm pretty fair and good at adjudicating - i've got kids so that is a well polished skill. I'm also logged into SO too damn much, both at work and home. I'm also in the timezone that is first to see the sunrise everyday, so like a ninja i'm around to action things when everyone else is asleep. Edit: my usage of the word 'damn' has drawn some comment, but it brings up a very interesting point: culture . It is important to remember that Stack Overflow has participants from many different cultures - not so that we can be politically correct, but so that we can recognise something when said inadvertantly or taken out of its intended context . I used the word damn in a light hearted, informal, self-deprecating manner, which is culturally 100% legitimate where i come from. That doesn't mean i would use it in a conversation with my highly religious mother-in-law - that would be inappropriate. A good moderator needs to be able to make distinctions like this.
