I've always found that the rhino book is my friend when working with javascript. Although it does not cover the flashy frameworks it feels like it's always there as a backbone tutorial/reference with really solid coverage of everything. The latest editions also cover ajax stuff. I have no less than 3 editions of this book, and they all look worn & well used.
