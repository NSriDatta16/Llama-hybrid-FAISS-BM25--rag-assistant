While consumers bypassing the marketplace and copying a free app will obviously not directly affect profits, keeping track of the number of people using your app can be very important in terms of building the reputation both of the app itself and of your company / you as an indie developer. If your app communicates with a server or central database as part of its natural functionality, then usage tracking can be implemented through that channel. But if not, then download information on the marketplace is the next best way to get a rough estimate of its popularity. As for security, I'm not aware of any way forward locking directly makes your app more secure, preventing illicit copying could certainly serve to discourage untoward manipulation of the package files.
