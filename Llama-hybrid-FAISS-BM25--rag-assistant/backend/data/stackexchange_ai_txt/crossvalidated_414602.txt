statistical tests for average data

I'm working on visualising for some data set. I was going to run some statistical tests on the data set, but I'm not sure if I can run some tests or not. I'm sorry that I cannot put the data set here. Basically, the data set is a csv file. And all the data in the file is an average value. I wonder if I can run a statistical test, such as ANOVA (or making a correlation matrix), for this data where all the inputs are average values. Thank you!
