If you convert a continous variable to binary you throw out a lot of detailed information. So in my opinion it is advisable not to do it. For tree classifiers binary splits are used but the information in the continuous variable if used to get the first split and the variable can be split again if it is very important to the classification. I don't think it works that way with neural networks.
