Can Boosting and Bagging be applied to heterogeneous algorithms?

Stacking can be achieved with heterogeneous algorithms such as RF, SVM and KNN. However, can such heterogeneously be achieved in Bagging or Boosting? For example, in Boosting, instead of using RF in all the iterations, could we use different algorithms?
