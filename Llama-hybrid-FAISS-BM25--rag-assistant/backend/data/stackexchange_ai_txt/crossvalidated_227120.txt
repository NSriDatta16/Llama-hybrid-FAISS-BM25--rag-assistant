With only 28 events you are just barely able to evaluate 2 predictor variables in Cox regression. The usual rule of thumb is 10-20 events per predictor that you are evaluating. A categorical variable with multiple levels counts in this as one fewer than its number of levels. Note that the small number of cases limits your ability to find a true relationship between your main variable of interest and any other predictor. So the finding of "no association" between your main variable and a second variable might simply represent a small sample size hiding a true relationship. On that basis it might make sense to adjust for a second variable by including it in your model. If that second variable is categorical with only 2 levels, or is continuous, then your 28 events should be enough for this. If you want to adjust for more variables (you seem to have several) you could consider using a propensity score that combines several variables into a single predictor to use in the survival model. That's a 2-step process. First, calculate the propensity score for each case; that's a measure of how all the other variables are related to the values of your main variable of interest. For a 2-category main variable of interest, a logistic regression model is often used to calculate this propensity score. Then you can use the propensity score as a single predictor, rather than all the individual predictor variables, in your survival model to help adjust for them as you evaluate the relation to survival of your main variable of interest.
