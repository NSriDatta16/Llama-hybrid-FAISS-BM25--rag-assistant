People have different opinions on how to organize their hard disks, why should you enforce a particular layout? One should be able to check out multiple working copies of the same project in the repository - impossible if you insist using the same hierarchy. In one large project I worked on, literally thousands of files assumed that the working copy was in a fixed absolute hard-coded path ( \projectname ). To work with several branches of the project, we had to resort to using different drive letters (on Windows), meaning that we had to divide our hard disks into many partitons (6 or more were common). This was very inconvenient. Eventually we had to integrate the project as a sub-project of a larger project. This meant changing all those absolute paths, a tedious and time-consuming task. Using relative paths gives you much more flexibility; however, if everybody has the project root at the exact same location, you won't notice if someone adds an absolute path somewhere by accident.
