You're going to need to get an instance of a Transformer from an appropriate TransformerFactory . You can use the built-in xerces transformer factory or a 3rd party XSLT processor, like saxonica . Using Spring's IoC you can configure a Xerces XML transformer like this: or a saxon XML transformer like this: Once you have a TransformerFactory you can use dependency injection to get a new instance of a transformer either inside your bean or using the IoC. Switching to be inside your class you might have some property, say transFact that you need to set: Then in your class: public class myClass { // ... private javax.xml.transformer.TransformerFactory transFact; public void myMethod(){ StreamSource transformerStream = new StreamSource(getResourceAsStream(pathToXslt)); javax.xml.transformer.Transformer myTrans = transFact.newTransformer(transformerStream); // now you've got a myTrans } // ... public setTransFact(javax.xml.transformer.TransformerFactory transFact){ this.transFact = transFact; } } Alternatively you can get a new transformer within IoC using the factory-method with a little more effort.
