How to derive the mean and variance of a two phase sample?

Suppose there are $N$ authors, and each author has writen $A_i$($i=1\dots N$) articles. I want to estimate the average level of the authors by scoring the articles. the level of author $i$ is defined as the mean of the quality score of all his articles, that is $X_i = \frac{1}{A_i}\sum_{j=1}^{A_i} Q_{ij}$, where $X_i$ is the level of author $i$, and $Q_{ij}$ is the quality score of article $j$ of author $i$. Since Both $N$ and $A_i$ are very large, it is impossible to score all the authors and all their articles, so I use the following method to estimate the average level of the authors: randomly choose $K$ authors. from each of the $K$ authors, randomly choose $n_i$ articles. the total number of the articles $M=\sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i$ is fixed. use $Y=\frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}Q_{ij}$ as the estimator of the average level of all authors. My question is: Is $Y$ an unbiased estimation? How to derive the variance of $Y$? When $M$ is fixed, how to choose $K$ and $n_i$ to minimize the variance of $Y$? EDIT: As mentioned in StatsStudent's comment, this problem is a Two-Stage Cluster Sampling problem, but the purpose is a little different. Here I want to estimate the mean of the primary units, i.e. the average level of all the authors, not the average score of all the articles. In a typical Two-Stage Cluster Sampling, $Y=\frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}Q_{ij}$ is a biased estimation of the mean score of all the articles, but it seems like an unbiased estimation of the mean level of all the authors.
