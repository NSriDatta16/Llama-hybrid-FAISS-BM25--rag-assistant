Comparing User Input To Data Generated Randomly

I've written a python cgi script to generate random numbers and add them together than ask the user to give the answer. But even user answer was correct, it gives him wrong. The answer will not be correct. The problem is in the flow : #!/usr/bin/python2.7 import cgi,sys,random sys.stderr = sys.stdout input_field = cgi.FieldStorage() x = random.randrange(1,20) y = random.randrange(1,20) answer = x + y print("Content-type: text/html\n") print (" ") if "input" in input_field: if input_field["input"].value == answer: print("Content-Type content=text/htm") print " Good :D Wrong :( " print "Your Answer :",input_field['input'].value print " ","Correct Answer",answer else: print " ",x,"+",y," " print(""" Answer: """) print (" ") e.g : 3 + 9 Answer: [12 ] Wrong :( Your Answer : 12 Correct Answer 17 Has anyone know what should I do to fix the flow? It generate new numbers each time Note : This is not a type error, it's Logical error
