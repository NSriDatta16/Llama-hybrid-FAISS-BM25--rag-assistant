Try to use the System.IO.Path.Combine method to make sure you a) have the necessary backslash between the directory and the file name, and to b) make sure you don't have multiple of those: string xmlPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, "cities.xml"); Also: maybe your user account doesn't have the permissions to write to that directory. Try using something like Isolated Storage or some other directory you're 100% sure that the user is allowed to write to.
