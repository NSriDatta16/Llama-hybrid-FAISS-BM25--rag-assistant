Short answer: Switch statement is quicker The if statement you need two comparisons (when running your example code) on average to get to the correct clause. The switch statement the average number of comparisons will be one regardless of how many different cases you have. The compiler/VM will have made a "lookup table" of possible options at compile time. Can virtual machines optimize the if statement in a similar way if you run this code often?
