It's not really a matter of power, but a matter of what you're trying to do and how you try to do it. You could say that Python is "more powerful" because it comes with a large set of built-in libraries, or that C++ is "more powerful" because it's much faster, or that Haskell is "more powerful" because it uses lazy evaluation - in short, it's really a matter of opinion. But I haven't seen many desktop apps written in PHP, and I don't see web apps written in C++ (though there are probably exceptions, of course). Some languages simply offer what is considered an "elegant" way to perform certain tasks. For instance, look at a factorial function in Haskell: factorial 0 = 1 factorial n = n * factorial (n-1) Some might consider this elegant mainly because it reflects the mathematical definition clearly. But is this better than another implementation? No. (Especially since this would overflow the stack.) In conclusion, use what you feel is best for your task - if you're best with PHP, and you don't want to learn Python, than don't. If you're interested in what it's like, then check it out. Don't learn it because it's "more powerful."
