Python float copy question

I'm puzzled by some behaviour I'm seeing when copying a float array member into another variable - please help! For example data_entry[1] = 9.6850069951 new_value = data_entry[1] #print both 9.6850069951 9.6850663300 I'm aware of the problem of binary storage of floats but I thought with a direct copy of memory we would end up with the same value. Any ideas? I need better precision than this! thanks in advance Stuart
