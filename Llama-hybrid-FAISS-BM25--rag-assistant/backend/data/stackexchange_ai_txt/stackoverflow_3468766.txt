For this specific issue, please refer to Strings Passed to loadXML must be UTF-16 Encoded BSTRs . Overall, xml parser is not designed for in memory string parsing, e.g. loadXML does not recognize BOM, and it has restriction on the encoding. Rather, an xml parser is designed for byte array form with encoding detection, which is critical for a standard parser. To better leverage MSXML, please consider loading from IStream or a Win32 file.
