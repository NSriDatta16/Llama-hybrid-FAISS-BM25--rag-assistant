If you run .Load(Objects.MergeOption.OverwriteChanges) on the collection you'll get any newly added items. If you want the deleted items to be "refreshed" you'll need to detach the entities from the collection before running .Load Putting it all together (sorry about the vb) For Each child in Parent.ChildCollection.ToArray() context.Detatch(child) Next Parent.ChildCollection.Load(Objects.MergeOption.OverwriteChanges) This works for me, but if there's a more elegant way I'd love to see it!
