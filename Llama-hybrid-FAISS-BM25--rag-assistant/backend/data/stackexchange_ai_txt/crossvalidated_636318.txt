Are you running regression diagnostics to identify/drop overly influential observations, and then re-running with dropped outliers? This entails looking at the Studentized residuals, jackknife residuals, Cook's distance, leverage residuals, DFFITS, DFBETAS, and comparing them with threshold values to identify and drop overly influential observations from your model. VIFs can be used to look at multicollinearity between input predictors. To sidestep regression diagnostics, you could try median regression (quantile regression), which will likely tone down the overly influential observations. In addition, hopefully, you looked at univariate prediction models to get a handle on which predictors are meaningful by themselves. Another way to "smooth out" these issues when looking for a relationship is to run univariate Somers' D between the x-y pairs, to get a handle on univariate directionality and association.
