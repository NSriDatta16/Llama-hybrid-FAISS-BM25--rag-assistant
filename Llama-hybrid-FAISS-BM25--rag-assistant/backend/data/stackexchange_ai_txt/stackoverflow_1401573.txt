Personally, I would use the second option to approach this problem. The first option limits functionality, so I eliminate that right away. The third option is inefficient in terms of performance - it is likely that you will be fetching that number a lot , and, if your program is anything like stackoverflow, perhaps showing (calculating) that number many times per pageview/action. To me, the second option is a decent hybrid solution. Normally, I hate having duplicated data in my system (actions and points, rather than one or the other), but in this case, an integer field is a rather small amount of space per user that saves you a lot of time in recalculating the values unnecessarily. We must, at times, trade data storage space for performance or vice versa, and I would say that #2 is a trade-off that greatly benefits the application.
