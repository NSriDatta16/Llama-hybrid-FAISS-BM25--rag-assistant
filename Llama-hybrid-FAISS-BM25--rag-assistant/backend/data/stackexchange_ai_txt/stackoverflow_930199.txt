How many simultaneous connections can an .mdb access file support?

I have a website (www.soltrago.com) wghere I use a .mdb microsoft access database to retrieve data when the pages loads. I use a dns less connection to connect to the database. My question is how many simultaneous connections can I have to my webpage? Like how many people per second can view my webpage? Thanks!
