Rank of sample covariance matrix when $p = n$

Suppose we have a $p$ -dimensional Gaussian distribution, and we take $n$ observations from that distribution. This answer states that when $p > n$ , then the sample variance covariance matrix is singular and has rank $\leq n-1$ . Does this hold when $p = n$ ? This question on PCA seems to imply that even when $p = n$ , the variance covariance matrix cannot have rank higher than $n-1$ .
