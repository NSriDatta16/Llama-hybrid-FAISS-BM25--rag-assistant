When you drag an LI from one list to a connected list, the "empty space" in the old list disappears. This causes the lists below it to "move up" on the page, just as your cursor reaches the next list. This causes your dragged item to be hovering over the 2nd space instead of the 1st, forcing you to nudge your cursor up again to get the 1st space. If your lists are next to each horizontally, you won't see this issue (but, of course, that doesn't help you). I haven't come up with an actual solution yet, but hopefully this will help frame the problem.
