The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0150002)

I have an image processing C program which uses OpenCV library. I was developing this with Visual Studio 2008 until this happened. So I moved the whole project to netbeans(6.9) and MinGW. I have configured netbeans to use OpenCV libraries as guided in this blog . But when I run the program it gives this error " The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0150002) " I don't think this happens when trying to read any image files from the hard disk. It gives the error without even executing 1st line in the main method. The only change I made to the code is this. static __inline void release_mem( CvPoint2D64f*, CvPoint2D64f*, static struct feature** ); this gave me error : storage class specified for parameter 'type name' so I changed the code to (Trial and error rather than any logic) static __inline void release_mem( CvPoint2D64f*, CvPoint2D64f*, struct feature** );
