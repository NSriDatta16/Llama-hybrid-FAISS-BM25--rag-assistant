I have a different interpretation of the meaning of the wrong statement than @Karl does. I think that it is a statement about the data, rather than about the null. I understand it as asking for the probability of getting your estimate due to chance. I don't know what that means---it's not a well-specified claim. But I do understand what is likely meant by the probability of getting my estimate by chance given that the true estimate is equal to a particular value. For example, I can understand what it means to get a very large difference in average heights between men and women given that their average heights are actually the same. That's well specified. And that is what the p-value gives. What's missing in the wrong statement is the condition that the null is true. Now, we might object that this isn't statement perfect (the chance of getting an exact value for an estimator is 0, for example). But it's far better than the way that most would interpret a p-value. The key point that I say over and over again when I teach hypothesis testing is "Step one is to assume that the null hypothesis is true. Everything is calculated given this assumption." If people remember that, that's pretty good.
