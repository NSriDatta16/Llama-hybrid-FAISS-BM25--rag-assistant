Since there are no cycles in the career path, you can simply use the geometric distribution to work out how long people stay in their respective positions: Programmers stop with probability $p=0.3$ after each year, so stay programmers for $1/p = 10/3$ years on average Project managers are fired with probability $p=0.05$, so say in their job for $1/0.05 = 20$ years on average. Thus, the average length of a programmer's career seems to be $10/3 + 2/3 * 20 = 16.67$. So I'm siding with you on this one.
