In logistic regression, as with linear regression, the residuals can be defined as observed minus expected values. The data are discrete and so are the residuals. As a result, plots of raw residuals from logistic regression are generally not useful. The binned residuals plot instead, after dividing the data into categories (bins) based on their fitted values, plots the average residual versus the average fitted value for each bin. binnedplot(fitted(model_name), residuals(model_name, type = "response"), nclass = NULL, xlab = "Expected Values", ylab = "Average residual", main = "Binned residual plot", cex.pts = 0.8, col.pts = 1, col.int = "gray") you can find more information, on this paper: http://vulstats.ucsd.edu/pdf/Gelman.ch-05.logistic-regression.pdf
