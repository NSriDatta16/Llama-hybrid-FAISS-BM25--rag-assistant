An RDF file should parse down to a list of triples. A triple consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. But what do these actually mean? The subject is, well, the subject. It identifies what object the triple is describing. The predicate defines the piece of data in the object we are giving a value to. The object is the actual value.
