Due to the special nature of the Trash, you should be able to experiment fairly safely. Try moving the whole Developer directory to Trash then moving just /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications back into place. If it doesn't run, try leaving more alone... This ignores the various hooks installation has into your system, the ones that executing "/Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools" script removes. Maybe you should copy the entire /Developer folder somewhere first, then do the official uninstall, then try just restoring that Applications directory. In fact clone your whole drive first. I'm hoping you are trying to save space because you have moved to a small SSD so you probably have some other storage capable of holding it all?
