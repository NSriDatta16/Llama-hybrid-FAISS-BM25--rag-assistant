Imputation in a univariate time series

I am doing a univariate time series analysis on regional sea-surface temperatures which has missing data, and I am thinking about using the R package, 'imputeTS.' My model is simple, it has MA errors and a term linear in time. I would like to impute the missing data, but I am not sure which package method to use. Also, I am not sure how the error from the imputation would affect the SE of the slope. Could someone advise me on which method to use, and how to incorporate the imputation error on the slope? I would greatly appreciate any help.
