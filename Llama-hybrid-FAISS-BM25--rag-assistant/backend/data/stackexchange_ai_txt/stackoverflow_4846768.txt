Counting Sentences/Words in Perl Using Regex

This regex thing is getting old. :( Yet another question: I need to count the number of words and number of sentences in a paragraph. The code I tried using was this: my $sentencecount = $file =~ s/((^|\s)\S).*?(\.|\?|\!)/$1/g; my $count = $file =~ s/((^|\s)\S)/$2/g; print "Input file $ARGV[1] contains $sentencecount sentences and $count words."; My results return 63 for both counts. I know this is incorrect, as least as far as word count goes. Is this a result of using a substitution for the counting process? If so, how do I correct this?
