What is the interaction between Objective-C and RDBMSes like SQLite?

I would like to learn how to persist data to a RDBMS from Objective-C, and I don't really know where to start to learn this. Do I learn a RDBMS? Do I learn data modeling? I'm wondering are there techniques or special considerations when modeling the data as to not run into any pitfalls? I.e. are there rules of thumb like "don't subclass" or "always encapsulate your attributes." In my limited experience it has been quite difficult to translate an Objective-C class into a relational database. It would seem that CoreData might get me started off on the right path, but it also seems like CoreData kinda just gives me a lot of things to take for granted (I'm curious to know what's going on under the hood with the SQL calls...). Or am I understanding this framework wrong? I'm looking for any resources that would get me started down the path of better understanding RDBMSes and how Objective-C model classes typically interact with them for data storage. EDIT: In an effort to answer my own curiosity, I've picked up Joe Celko's SQL for Smarties as well as Beginning Database Design by Clare Churcher. Neither of them really give much by way of the interaction between controller classes written in non-SQL languages (in my case Objective-C), SQL, and the database. There's a missing link that I'm just not understanding...
