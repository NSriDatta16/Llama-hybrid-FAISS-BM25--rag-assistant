How can one download the contents of an HTML5 web database to the client?

I am looking for a way to save the contents of an HTML5 web database to a local file for persistence and for loading back into the web application. I'm using Firefox 3.6.8 with the HTML5 features to use a local web database. I can upload a file and read it's contents but am unable to find an elegant way to save the contents of the database to the file system. Any ideas? I believe there is something written in flash that can do this. I would consider this but I would prefer a straight HTML 5 version instead.
