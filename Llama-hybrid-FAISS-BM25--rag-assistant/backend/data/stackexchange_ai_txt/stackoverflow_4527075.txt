Define Dragonfly specific path for S3 Datastore

I need to define an specific structure path for storing my files in S3. Example: Instead of 'bucket_name/2010/12/23/127/43/2345/File.jpg' I need 'bucket_name/artists/elvis_presley/faceshot/100x100.jpg' 'bucket_name/books/the_black_cat/cover/180x280.jpg' etc. I read a similar question but don't catched much of it. Thanks.
