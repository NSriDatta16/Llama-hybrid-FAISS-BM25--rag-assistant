Reverse engineering a ROM DOS device

I understand that my question is probably too abstract and tricky to be replied with an OneTrueAnswerÂ©, but I hope I can express myself well enough to receive some kind of useful feedback. It has come to my possession an interesting device which bears the following specs. (from http://www.motia.co.kr/product/product_03.asp ): 80386 Compatible Processor (Intel) 33MHz SRAM 512KB Flash Memory 4MB ROM 512KB Video 32KB 320 x 200 pixels STN LCD with backlight, with touch panel 3 RS-232 ports ROM Dos 6.2 O.S. Sure, it's not an iNexus-Pre, but it was free ;). Anyway, it's supposed to be embedded in track & tracing operations, mounted in a truck's console. Not to me, though. My goal is to bend this device to my own will, pairing it with an Arduino (or similar) to satisfy my lust towards DIY projects. Come on, the three serial ports and touch screen make my eyes glow. And even though I come from a somewhat technical background, I must confess I don't know where to start with this thing. I can do as much as turning it on and accessing its shell from a serial terminal, meanwhile the display only shows: "System initializing. Please wait a moment...", and that's it. Naturally, I tried to contact Motia to ask for a SDK of some sort, but I was promptly and elegantly dismissed. So without further ado, I expose my questions: First and most important: Is it worth it? I'm willing to spend several weekends on the matter, but given my infinite stupidity I'm not aware of the difficulty of my quest. If so... ... where to start? I've never developed anything (significant at least) on DOS, specially with GUI. I hope I'm able to change that. What else can I provide you to help me accomplish my goal? Every kind of feedback is endorsed. Thanks in advance!
