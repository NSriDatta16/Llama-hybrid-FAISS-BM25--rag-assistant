Categorical Predictors and categorical responses

I have a dataset consisting of 5 categorical predictors and a categorical response (class). I want to find out which predictor has an effect on the response. Additionally, I can't guarantee whether the predictors are not correlated to each other. I know that in the case of: continuous predictors and continuous response -> I'd use Multiple Linear Regression continuous predictors and categorical response -> LDA or Logistic Regression categorical predictors and continuous response -> ANOVA But what do I do in the case of: categorical predictors and categorical response -> ??? What approach should I use and what are the assumptions of this approach?
