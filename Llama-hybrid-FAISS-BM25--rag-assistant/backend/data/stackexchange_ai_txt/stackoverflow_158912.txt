I haven't, traditionally, had any "stability" issues with Infragistics NetAdvantage releases. However, I have found breaking changes (particularly with the ASP.NET CSOM side), and smaller, more insidious gotchas. As a result, our company's policy is to not upgrade an Infragistics-enabled project until it is absolutely, critically necessary. (Yes, that means my current dev machine actually has four versions of IG installed. My last one had 8, because it also supported VS2003/.NET 1.1!) IG does tend to fix quite a few bugs when it drops a new release; often I'll find that a hack or workaround I needed on an old project is no longer necessary on a new one. (This is, obviously, control-specific.) If you are going to upgrade the control set for a given project, my official advice would be to go as new as you can. You're going to (potentially) have breaking changes and such no matter what, but at least this way, you get the advantages of the most recent bug fixes as well. This may not be justification for new licensing, mind you -- if you're canceling your IG subscription, this isn't a reason to undo that. But go as new as you can -- which for you, sounds like 8.1.
