If you're wanting options quite different from a logistic regression, you could use a neural net. For example, R's nnet package has a multinom function. Or you could use a Random Forest (R's randomForest package, and others). And there are several other Machine Learning alternatives, though options like an SVM tend to not be well-calibrated which makes their outputs inferior -- in my opinion -- to a logistic regression. [Actually, a logit is probably being used under the hood by the neurons in the neural net. So it's quite different, but not quite different at the same time.]
