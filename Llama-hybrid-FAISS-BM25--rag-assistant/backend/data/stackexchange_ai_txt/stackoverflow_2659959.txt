Have a look into articles about REST, the architectural style which the whole web is based upon. By following these guidelines about client-side state storage, you can have your web app show the user the correct information when something unexpected happens. http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html . You essentially want the store the entire context on the client (in a cookie, or held in the current page and transferred back to the server using POST), and not take advantage of any context on the server. In doing this, the client can bootstrap the process at their current 'position' in the process using their local context, even if the server has no stored context.
