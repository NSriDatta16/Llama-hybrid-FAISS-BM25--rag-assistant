How might I improve my changepoint modeling with pymc3?

I am having trouble getting any estimates to render with pymc3 for a changepoint model. I am wondering if someone more experienced with Bayesian data analysis could offer some opinions as to what I might do to try to improve my modeling attempts at my data that looks like this: My code is as follows: with pm.Model(coords=coords) as switchpoint_gauss: ''' switchpoint guassian ''' freeze_idx = pm.Data("freeze_idx", df.freeze_p, dims='obs_id') # Priors for pre- and post-switch intercepts and slopes intercept_1 = pm.Uniform('intercept_1', lower=0, upper=1) intercept_2 = pm.Uniform('intercept_2', lower=0, upper=1) beta_1 = pm.Normal("beta_1", mu=0, sigma=5) beta_2 = pm.Normal("beta_2", mu=-1, sigma=1) # switchpoint switchpoint = pm.DiscreteUniform('switchpoint', lower=0.05, upper=0.95, testval=0.8) intercept = pm.math.switch(switchpoint My results in turn look like: And:
