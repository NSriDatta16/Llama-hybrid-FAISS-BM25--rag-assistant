Edit: Google has released Asynchronous Tracking . I haven't tried it yet, but I guess that it addresses the issues listed below. I think Google Analytics can make a website slower because it does happe that ga.js takes noticably long to load, and this can cause some problems: If you have a JavaScript that triggers on window.onload (that includes the old school syntax), then it wont fire until the web page has downloade complety. Using something like jQuery's ready event might remedy this, though. Most browsers do not fill in saved user names and passwords until the web page has loaded completely. It is not easy for the average user to spot that a web page is simply waiting for the Analytics script to load, so they might be waiting for the little download animation to finish even though the page has essentially finished downloading. You could follow niallbrowne's suggestion of downloading ga.js and serving from your own web server. But this should be a last resort, since ga.js is cached across web sites and only expires once a week.
