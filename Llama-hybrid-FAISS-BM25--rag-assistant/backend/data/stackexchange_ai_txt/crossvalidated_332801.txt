1) Can residuals be determined from moving averages or are they strictly from the regression line? 2) Can the regression line be determined from the moving averages or only from the original data points? The moving averages tell you nothing about the covariate or the dependence between the outcome and covariate. You will need this to estimate the slope and the residuals. See Wiki on simple linear regression . Also the regression line was taken from the N-point moving averages. I do not know you would do this. Did they do moving averages of both the outcomes and the covariates?
