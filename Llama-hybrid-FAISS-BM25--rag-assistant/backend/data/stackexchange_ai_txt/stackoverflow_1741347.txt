Natural language rendering

Do you know any frameworks that implement natural language rendering concept ? I've found several NLP oriented frameworks like Anthelope or Open NLP but they have only parsers but not renderers or builders. For example I want to render a question about smth. I'm constructing sentence object, setting it's properties, specify it's language and then render as a plain text. Please advice. Thanks !
