Rarely does a question appear that I believe I can answer. This isn't in R (at least I don't believe there is a addin for it). It doesn't answer your exact questions either, although I believe may be of help. I am seeking other methods of variable selection in lieu of using stepwise methods for building more parsimonious binary logistic regression models (containing 8 to 12 variables to predict outcomes such as loan payment/default or current/late payment history) from a wide array of potential predictor variables (500+ variables, 200k+ records). Perhaps Correlated Component Analysis would answer your problems. See here: http://www.xlstat.com/en/products-solutions/ccr.html Predictor Selection Using the CCR/Step-Down Algorithm In step 1 of the step-down option, a model containing all predictors is estimated with K* components (where K* is specified by the user or determined by the program if the Automatic option is activated), and the relevant CV statistics are computed. In step 2, the model is then re-estimated after excluding the predictor whose standardized coefficient is smallest in absolute value, and CV statistics are computed again. Note that both steps 1 and 2 are performed within each subsample formed by eliminating one of the folds. This process continues until the user-specified minimum number of predictors remains in the model (by default, Pmin = 1). The number of predictors included in the reported model, P*, is the one with the best CV statistic. Here is the summarization for when it was presented at the Paris workshop on PLS developments 2 years ago. Jay Magidson. "Correlated Component Regression A Sparse Alternative to PLS Regression." http://statisticalinnovations.com/technicalsupport/ParisWorkshop.pdf It sounds like what you are partially trying to accomplish is done with this algorithm in this tutorial: " Using Correlated Component Regression with a Dichotomous Y and Many Correlated Predictors. " http://statisticalinnovations.com/products/xlstattutorials/XLCCRtutorial2.pdf I also hate it when people answer questions by just referencing other works instead of actually answering the question, but, I just feel this is the best answer if I'm understanding everything correctly. Hope it helps.
