Absolutely. In fact, the vast majority of the time, you absolutely should include a fixed effect. The reason for this is that random effects are restrained to $\sum \gamma = 0$, or always centered around 0. Thus, the random effect is the individual's estimated deviation from the group average for that individual. By leaving out the fixed effect, you would imply that the average effect of time must be 0.
