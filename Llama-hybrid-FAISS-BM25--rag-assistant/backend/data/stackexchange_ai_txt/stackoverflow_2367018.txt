To Spark or not to Spark?

Been on a huge learning binge with ASP.MVC 2 lately, and recently uncovered there are different rendering engines out there... Spark especially caught my attention, couple of things though. I have vast knowledge with ASP.NET so is it worth the ramp up, in addition to ASP.NET MVC Is it worth it in general? Does it really matter? It seems to be a preference of taste really and not so much performance or even a substantial reduction in developer time. It still seems immature, not very good intellisense support, syntax highlighting support, not many tooling options. It has preliminary support for MVC 2 only... What are your thoughts? I am leaning towards it's probably not worth it...
