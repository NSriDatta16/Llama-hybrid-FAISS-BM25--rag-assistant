Is it possible to display Google Analytics reporting interface in an IFRAME?

Has anyone had much luck in embedding the Google Analytics reporting interface in an IFRAME? We'd like to add an "Analytics" tab to our CMS which displays the Google Analytics for each specific page. So, the user could view a page in the CMS, and see the analytics for that page right in the interface. We have everything worked out, and we're bringing up the correct URL in the IFRAME. We get the Google login page, but when we log in, Google "busts" the IFRAME and loads the analytics page in the full window. Is there anyway to keep Google Analytics reporting interface in an IFRAME?
