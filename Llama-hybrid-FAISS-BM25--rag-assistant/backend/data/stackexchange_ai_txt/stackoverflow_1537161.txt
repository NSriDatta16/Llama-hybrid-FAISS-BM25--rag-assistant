Reading from sockets and download speed

Just for fun, I develop a download manager and I'd like to know if reading a large stack of data (i.e. 80 or 100KB) from a socket over the net makes the download speed higher, instead of reading 4KB for each loop iteration? (My average download speed is 200KBPS when I download a file with firefox for example) Thanks, Nir Tayeb.
