importance of each predictor in logistic regression

I recently read a paper made a logistic regression and used a table like this to summarise the model: data.frame(predictors = c("drat", "mpg"), "chi squared statistic" = c("x", "x"), "p-value" = c("x", "x")) predictors chi.squared.statistic p.value 1 drat x x 2 mpg x x The data.frame presented the chi-squared and p value (the x's) for each predictor in the logistic regression model, and thus allowed to see at a glance which predictors were most important. I have made this logistic regression model: mtcars_log_reg How can I fill in the x's for the above table using R code?
