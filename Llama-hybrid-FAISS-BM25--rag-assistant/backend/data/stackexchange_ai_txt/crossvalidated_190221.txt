What are the published methods to smooth a time series of weights?

I am looking for methods to smooth a time series of human weights, in particular I would like to know methods that are quoted or described in articles published in peer-reviewed journals. I am also interested in the value of the parameters, for example the bandwith in a kernel smoothing method or the number of days in a moving average filter. For example I think that this article (which I have no access to) describes some smoothing method used by the authors: HELANDER, Elina, et al. Time-series modeling of long-term weight self-monitoring data. In: Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), 2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE. IEEE, 2015. p. 1616-1620.
