The choice between linear and logistic regression depends on how the dependent variable is measured. Is it a Likert type scale? Then ordinal logistic is a good starting point. If it is continuous (or nearly so - say a 0 to 100 rating) then linear regression is the starting place. The correlated independent variables may indicate coliearity. Without data there is no way to tell. The number of observations needed depends on what you are trying to find out, how big your effect size is, what statistical method you wind up using, how many independent variables you have and so on. There are packages to try to figure this out for you - look up power analysis.
