Suggestions on using model in production 1 test at a time

I have created an Artificial Neural Network with 4 categorical features and a binary outcome either 1 for suspicious or 0 for non-suspicious: ParentPath ParentExe 0 C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireless AutoSwitch wrlssw.exe 1 C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireless AutoSwitch WrlsAutoSW.exs 2 C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireless AutoSwitch WrlsAutoSW.exs 3 C:\Windows\System32 svchost.exe 4 C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireless AutoSwitch WrlsAutoSW.exs ChildPath ChildExe Suspicious C:\Windows\System32 conhost.exe 0 C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireless AutoSwitch wrlssw.exe 0 C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireless AutoSwitch wrlssw.exe 0 C:\Program Files\Common Files OfficeC2RClient.exe 0 C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireless AutoSwitch wrlssw.exe 1 C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireless AutoSwitch wrlssw.exe 0 I have used sklearn for label encoding and one hot encoding on the data: #Import the dataset X = DBF2.iloc[:, 0:4].values #X = DBF2[['ParentProcess', 'ChildProcess']] y = DBF2.iloc[:, 4].values#.ravel() #Encoding categorical data from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder #Label Encode Parent Path labelencoder_X_1 = LabelEncoder() X[:, 0] = labelencoder_X_1.fit_transform(X[:, 0]) #Label Encode Parent Exe labelencoder_X_2 = LabelEncoder() X[:, 1] = labelencoder_X_2.fit_transform(X[:, 1]) #Label Encode Child Path labelencoder_X_3 = LabelEncoder() X[:, 2] = labelencoder_X_3.fit_transform(X[:, 2]) #Label Encode Child Exe labelencoder_X_4 = LabelEncoder() X[:, 3] = labelencoder_X_4.fit_transform(X[:, 3]) #Create dummy variables onehotencoder = OneHotEncoder(categorical_features = [0,1,2,3]) X = onehotencoder.fit_transform(X) I have split the data into a training and test set and run it on my gpu box with a nvidia 1080. I have tuned the hyperparameters and am now ready to use the model that is trained in a production environment with one test sample being tested at a time. Lets say I just want to test one sample: ParentPath ParentExe ChildPath ChildExe 0 C:\Windows\Malicious badscipt.exe C:\Windows\System cmd.exe The issue that I am running into is the training set has seen the ChildPath "C:\Windows\System" and the ChildExe "cmd.exe" which are normal, but the training set has not seen the ParentPath "C:\Windows\Malicous" or ParentExe "badscipt.exe" so these have not been label or one hot encoded. My big question is how do I handle one test feature where part of it has not been trained? I have seen examples using feature hashing but im not sure how to apply that or if that would even solve this problem. Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.
