I cannot see anything good in doing this. The obvious alternative is to fit a model that assumes this type of smooth curve and that's the appropriate way of doing this. Adding artificial extra points at best leads to wrong SEs, CIs without nominal coverage and invalid p-values - and that's when the true curve is from the class of piecewise functions used for interpolation with nothing "interesting" happening in the unobserved segments of the curve. The interpolation will overfit each data point and gives a too high mean squared error. If the true curve is different, then all bets are off and things can get more or less arbitrarily bad. In short, it's a very inappropriate thing to do.
