There are two aspects to a Java Web Application. First is developing the Java Web application and the other is actually running a web application. The simplest things to get started with developing a Java webapp, is to understand and use 1. Java Servlets 2. Java Server Pages (JSP) 3. JavaEE jdk To actually have the web application run, you have to host it inside a Java Servlet Container (A web server). From the list that you have mentioned, Tomcat and Jetty are both Servlet containers, you can choose either one. Once you have understood the basics, you can then move forward to things like JavaEE and the various other frameworks and start looking into what Actual Java Application servers like Glassfish, JBoss etc. You do not need the Apache httpd server. This is not directly useful for serving a java web application (although it has indirect uses, which you would probably understand once you have covered your basics). As you mentioned, you are using eclipse. I would suggest you start with the 'Dynamic Web Application' project rather then a JavaEE project. This will set up a basic Java servlets based project for you to get started on. Also the tutorial provided by matt b is an excellent resource on how to develop a simple servlets based java web application using eclipse and run it on tomcat.
