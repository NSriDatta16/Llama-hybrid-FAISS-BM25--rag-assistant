Is there a way to replace the Reading Pane with a VSTO CustomTaskBar in Outlook 2007?

I have a custom task pane I've made in VSTO for Outlook 2007, but it needs a fair amount of screen real estate to be functional. I'd like to just take over the place of the Reading Pane, as it won't really be needed when this addon is active. It's also a really great spot since this addon relies on drag-and-drop from mail folders to this task pane, and the closer I can get it to the folder pane, the better. Any way to replace the Reading Pane, or at least toggle it's visibility?
