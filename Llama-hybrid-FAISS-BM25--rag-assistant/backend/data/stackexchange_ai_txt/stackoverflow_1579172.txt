ASP.NET Menu control and Safari 4.0.3

So I'm using a Menu control on my page, and it has dynamic items that should drop down when you hover over a menu item. This works in all browsers except for Safari 4.0.3. I've looked around and there seem to be several solutions to this problem: Add this code to the Page_Load event: if (Request.UserAgent.IndexOf("AppleWebKit") > 0) { Request.Browser.Adapters.Clear(); } Add this code to the Page_PreInit event: if (Request.UserAgent.IndexOf("AppleWebKit") > 0) { this.ClientTarget = "uplevel"; } Add a browser file like in this thread: Link to thread Well I've tried all of those, and none of them seem to work. I should mention that this did use to work in older versions of Safari using option #2. But it's not working for me with the newest version of Safari. Does anyone know how to fix this?
