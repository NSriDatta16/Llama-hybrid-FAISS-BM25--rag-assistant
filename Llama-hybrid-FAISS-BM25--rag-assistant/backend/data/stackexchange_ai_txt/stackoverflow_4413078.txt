As far as I know (and I hope others will correct me if I'm wrong / the user will verify this), you lose a significant amount of security by keeping a static key and IV. The most significant effect you should notice is that when you encrypt a specific plaintext (say usernameA+passwordB), you get the same ciphertext every time. This is great for pattern analysis by attackers, and seems like a password-equivalent that would give attackers the keys to the kingdom: Pattern analysis: The attacker can see that the encrypted user+password combination "gobbbledygook" is used every night just before the CEO leaves work. The attacker can then leverage that information into the future to remotely detect when the CEO leaves. Password equivalent: You are passing this username+password in the URL. Why can't someone else pass exactly the same value and get the same results you do? If they can, the encrypted data is a plaintext equivalent for the purposes of gaining access, defeating the purpose of encrypting the data.
