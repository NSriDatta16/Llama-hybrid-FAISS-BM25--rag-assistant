Your "simplistic first thought" of qualitatively representing just the directional movement is similar in spirit to Keogh's SAX algorithm for comparing time series. I'd recommend you take a look at it: Eamonn Keogh & Jessica Lin: SAX . From your edit, it sounds like you're now thinking about tackling the problem differently, but you might find that SAX provides a piece of the puzzle.
