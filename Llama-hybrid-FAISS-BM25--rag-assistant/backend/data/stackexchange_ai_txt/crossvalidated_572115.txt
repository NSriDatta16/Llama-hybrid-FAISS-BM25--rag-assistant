If you have the compute/patience is there a reason not to train DNN slowly?

When fitting a deep neural network it is not uncommon for the learning rate to be too high, and then the fit goes horribly wrong. On the other hand as far as I can tell, the only problem with setting the learning rate low is that it takes a long time. Is there any other downside to a low learning rate? Or if you are patient enough is it acceptable to just train for say a million epochs? In other words, is it better to err on the side of learning slowly and using as much time as you can afford?
