Drupal node creation - back to origin after creation

I have organic groups setup and within those group users are allowed to post certain content. What I woulkd like to do is, when you create a node inside an organic group, it automatically defaults back to frontpage of the group, or the same page that I used to create the node. At present it defaults to the node view page.I assume there must be a way to add some kind of code so that after the node creation it defauls back to its origin. I.E. the page from where the node was created from. thanks :) UPDATE: Got the below, but not entirly sure how to ensure that it redirects back to the GROUP node, from where it was created, '; } ?>
