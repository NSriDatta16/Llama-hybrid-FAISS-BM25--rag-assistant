First, mind that deep learning is a buzz term. There is not even a consensus of a formal definition in the research community. A discussion of the term does not lead anywhere, really. It's just a word. That being said, convolutional nets are deep because they rely on multiple layers of feature extraction, as you said. They extract features from the input to predict an outcome. What you refer to is a "generative" approach, i.e. the features are used to create the observation (a picture, not a class label). That is what made deep learning popular, but it is in no way limited to that.
