Nesting XIBs in Interface Builder / embedding by reference

Say I have created an XIB for an icon view. I then want to embed a number of instances of this icon view in a different XIB container view by reference , so if I alter properties / layout in the original icon view XIB, the instances in the container view XIB reflect these changes. Essentially, embedding by reference. Maybe I'm being dense, but it seems the default behaviour of Interface Builder when dragging a view into a container view is to copy everything over, rather than referencing the original XIB? And dragging an instance of the class associated with the icon view into the container view just results in a blank view. I'm sure there's a way to do this, but I'm damned if I can figure it out. I normally avoid IB like the plague ;)
