Just my two cents. Generally, as you most likely know, Bayesian networks represent a foundation of a large subset of machine learning approaches, methods and algorithms. For example, see this paper . I think that the fact that your particular implementation of Bayesian inference/learning fails to produce correct probablities from your specific and particular data set does not really question Bayesian inference as a machine learning tool. P.S. A note from the "terminology police" :-): in R , bayes() is not a command - it's a function .
