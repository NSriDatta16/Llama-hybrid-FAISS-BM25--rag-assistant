How to choose the number of latent dimensions in VAE?

I have trained a VAE that can generate photos of human faces. I have isolated the dimension that correlates most to smiling and now I only want the VAE to generate smiling faces. May I know is it a usual practice to adjust the latent_dim value in order to optimize the attributes (e.g. naturalness etc.) of the generated samples? I suppose an extremely low latent_dim will cause excessive information compression. How about a high latent_dim ? Is it always better to use a higher number of latent_dim ? Or is such a choice of latent_dim a hyperparameter optimization problem that depends on the problem? p.s. I'm trying to master VAE so GANs is out of context for now.
