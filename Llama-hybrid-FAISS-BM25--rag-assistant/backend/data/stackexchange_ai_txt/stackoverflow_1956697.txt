A recent usability study suggests taking the opposite approach and indicating which fields are optional rather than required. Furthermore, try to ask for only what you really need in order to reduce the number of optional fields. The reason is that users tend to assume all fields are required anyway. They may not understand or pay attention to the asterisk, whereas they readily understand clearly labeled optional fields.
