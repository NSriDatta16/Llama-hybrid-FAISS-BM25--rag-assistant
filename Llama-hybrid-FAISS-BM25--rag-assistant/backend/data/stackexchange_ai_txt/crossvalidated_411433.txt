Are there any examples of multinomial or logistic regression as an outcome model using propensity score weighting?

I apologize if this is an inappropriate question, but does anyone have more recent texts on implementing some type of covariate balance weighting scheme (entropy balancing, IPTW, etc) where the outcome is binary (logistic) or multiple categorical quantities (multinomial). I've seen some articles regarding SMMs and its use with IVs, but am trying to use weighting techniques in my analysis.
