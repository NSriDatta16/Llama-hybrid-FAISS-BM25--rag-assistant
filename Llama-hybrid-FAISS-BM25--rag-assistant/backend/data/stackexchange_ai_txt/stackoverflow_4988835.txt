My guess is that one of the playernn variables is null . You are almost certainly trying to create too many MediaPlayer objects. These are a limited resource and you should only allocate one when you need it and release() it as soon as you do not need it. Since you are probably not using a player until you click on an image, create the MediaPlayer in your click response method, and release it after the sound has played.
