I would like it to be easy to connect to any database, perform queries that return a recordset, and be able to parse and iterate easily said recordset to display its data in graphic controls, for example pie-charts, bar-charts, timeline charts (stock options like), node graphs with animation effects, all this at run time. Easy mouse events catching, to implement any action on rollovers, mouseins, mouseouts, clicks, drag and drops, clipboard management, etc. A good infinite zooming capability would be great too. I don't want to set a "datasource" that establishes a fixed connection between some column in my SQL query and some displayable element at design time, I want to perform any query that I want and show elements tied to any query field, anytime, in run time. I don't want to be only able to bind a datasource and displayable elements at design time. css style capability for everything. Or something as simple and easy. resize and layout taken care of automatically. Easy access to local files, to parse, play, display. Easy classes for image management, supporting transparency, resizing, etc. Basic and advanced classes for drawing in the screen: lineTo, rectangle, circle, animations. Even 3D. Embedded fonts functionality. I don't want to worry about "will the user have this font installed?" Also I don't want to worry about DPI or screen resolutions. Basic widgets: treeviews, etc. A good designer. I don't want to add widgets writing the code. I want to place them visually in the screen. Also, it would be good if it could connect to dlls made in C++ or COM objects in general.
