The validation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm relies on repeating the current value in the Markov chain if the proposed value is rejected. You should not consider the list of accepted points as your sample but instead the Markov chain with transition \begin{align*} X_{t+1} &= Y_{t+1} \quad&\text{if } U_{t+1}\le \pi(Y_{t+1})/\pi(X_t)\\ &= X_t \quad&\text{otherwise} \end{align*} (assuming a symmetric proposal distribution). The repetition of the current value in the event of a rejection is what makes the algorithm valid, i.e., why $\pi$ is the stationary distribution. It is always possible to study the distribution of the accepted and of the rejected values, with some recycling possible by Rao-Blackwellisation , but this study is more advanced and far from necessary to understand the algorithm.
