Using random forest to estimate a numeric using ranges?

I have a problem where I'm trying to estimate a numeric number given a set of features. The number ranges from 160 to 240. Could I label the data using ranges i.e. ( 160-165, 166-170, 171-175, etc, etc ) and then use a random forest to classify? What would be the pros and cons of that vs using a linear regression? It seems kind of nice because I would have probabilities/confidences with the random forest approach.
