Method 'documentation'

What is the objective-c syntax for documenting a method's usage? Is this done in the .h or .m file? In C# one uses something like: /// /// Executes an HTTP GET command and retrieves the information. /// /// The URL to perform the GET operation /// The username to use with the request /// The password to use with the request /// The response of the request, or null if we got 404 or nothing. protected string ExecuteGetCommand(string url, string userName, string password) { ... } Is this done with the #pragma directive? Thanks, Craig Buchanan
