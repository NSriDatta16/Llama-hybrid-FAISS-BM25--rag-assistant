MIPS, the Android Market, 3.0 SDK and JNI

Not a bits, bytes, algorithm and syntax question... but a technology development and business one. Hope that's ok. At CES 2011, mips.com unveiled new MIPS-processor based smart phones running Android. By what I've read, it sounds like these either might be Chinese-market only (which, lets face it... is huge) or part of a big push by MIPS to elbow into ARM's territory. Here are problems I see: - Google only provide first-class support for ARM. Their SDKs are ARM-only. Does anyone know if they have plans to adopt MIPS? - The Android Market is ARM-only, as far as I can tell. It looks like companies like Velocity Micro (and their little MIPS-based Cruz tablet) have their own "Cruz Market". I think that's awful. Is the Android Market going to be the one-stop shop for Android, or are things fragmenting even more? - The JNI breaks the processor-independence of the VM. Can multiple processor-specific JNI libraries be packaged into a single app? MIPS binaries aren't exactly small. Does anyone out there have a crystal ball on these things? Let the assumption be: MIPS won't just go away. TL;DR: Anyone know WTF is going on with MIPS?
