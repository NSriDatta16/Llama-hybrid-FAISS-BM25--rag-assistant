Can you use hashed data in a random forest classifier?

I'm using hashed data to build a random forest classifier in Python (sklearn) to classify hacker intrusion events. Some of the variables are hashed, for example, IP addresses, and they have a lot of levels (over 19K, for a database of 23K events). I am intending to use these variables as categorical variables, so that IPs associated with a hacker intrusion once, can later be used to classify other events as hacker intrusions or not. I don't think I would be able to reduce the dimensionality of the data or use some sort of clustering analysis since it is hashed. For example, if I had 150 levels for a country variable, I could reduce it to continents. But, since it is hashed, I am unsure PCA or other dimensionality reduction method would be helpful. However, given the enormous amount of levels in this variables, I am unsure if I should input this variable as a categorical variable or transform it into an ordinal variable. I have read that when a categorical variable has a lot of levels, it could be better to transform it into an ordinal and (especially with a large sample like mine).
