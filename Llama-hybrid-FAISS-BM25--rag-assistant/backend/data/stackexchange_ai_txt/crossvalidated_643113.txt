Appropriate null hypothesis for rating a set of data points?

My setup is this: I am generating some text (say 10 sentences) from a model in a particular scenario, and there’s some text generated by humans (10 sentences, same scenario). Each sentence (20 of them) is assessed by a group of experts who provide a score between 1-5. There are 30 such “scenarios”. I want to test the hypothesis that the machine generated text quality is significantly better than the human generated text. My original null hypothesis was that “the average quality of human generated text is significantly lower than the machine generated text”. Someone said that’s not a valid null hypothesis and a valid one would be “there’s no significant difference in the average quality of human generated text and machine generated text”. I am wondering if mine is wrong or do I need to test the “no difference” hypothesis before the “greater” hypothesis.
