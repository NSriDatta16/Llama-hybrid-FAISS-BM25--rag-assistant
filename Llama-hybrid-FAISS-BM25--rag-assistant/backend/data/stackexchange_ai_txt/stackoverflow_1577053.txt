So my simple question is: In case of an exception is the finally block reached even if there is a throw some lines before? Yes. The Finally block is always 1) executed and exists precisely for clean-up. In your code, remove the Catch block, it does nothing. Worse, it actually destroys the stack trace because you don’t re-throw the original exception, you throw a new one. If you really need a Catch block that then re-throws the exception, use the following: Catch e As XyzException ' … do some stuff. ' Throw End Try 1) : Caveat emptor: there are some exceptions such as StackOverflowException (how fitting …) which require special attention and may not trigger the Finally block. Handling them correctly is usually quite difficult.
