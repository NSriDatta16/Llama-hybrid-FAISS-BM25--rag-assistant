Why Would 2 Tree Based Methods Have Different Variables Of Importance

I am using the data set Boston to predict the dependent variable medv. I used two tree based methods, xgboost and random forest. Both models give me a very similar R^2 on the test data set. RandomForest R^2 = .81 and xgboost R^2 = .79. When I plot the variables of importance, xgboost relies much more on the variable lstat while the random forest sees the variable rm as the most important. Is it a common occurrence for two tree based methods like random forest and xgboost to find different relationships in the data? For another data set I have worked with, the variable importance were vastly different! Why might this be the case? Lastly, is there a way to combine these two models to create an even better output? Here is variable importance for xgboost Here is variable importance for the random Forest
