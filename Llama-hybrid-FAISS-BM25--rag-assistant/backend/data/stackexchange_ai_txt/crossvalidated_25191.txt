How to report accuracy of predicted classifications with CI when using k-fold CV?

I modelled a binary response against several explanatory variables using logistic regression. There were various combinations of the explanatory variables that produced reasonable fits. I would like to validate and compare the models by using 10-fold CV by comparing the mean positive prediction rates. When doing such a comparison, is it enough to report the mean prediction rate and provide the standard deviation of the accuracy across the ten folds? Or is it possible to report confidence intervals?
