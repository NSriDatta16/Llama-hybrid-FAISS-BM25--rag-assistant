One place where log scoring may be inappropriate: the comparison of human forecasters (who may tend to overstate their confidence). Log scoring strongly penalizes very overconfident wrong predictions. A wrong prediction that was made with 100% confidence gets an infinite penalty. For example, suppose a commentator says "I am 100% sure that Smith will win the election," and then Smith loses the election. Under log scoring, the average score of all the commentator's predictions is now permanently stuck at $-\infty$ , the worst possible. It should be possible to distinguish that somebody who has made a single wrong 100% confidence prediction is a better forecaster than somebody who makes them all the time.
