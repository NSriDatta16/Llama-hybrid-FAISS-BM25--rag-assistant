is it possible (and/or logical) to set feature importance for xgboost?

If I understand tree based methods correctly, it would be better for more important features to be toward the top of the tree. Is there a way I can dictate this in xgboost? Similar to how I can assign weights to each sample/row, can I somehow enforce certain features to be more likely to be put on top compared to other features? (or some other way that enforces certain columns to play a more important role in the model?) I am aware that you would want the data to guide the model rather than enforcing it but 1 logical case for this is when you have limited data and would like to try helping the process through your subject matter expertise.
