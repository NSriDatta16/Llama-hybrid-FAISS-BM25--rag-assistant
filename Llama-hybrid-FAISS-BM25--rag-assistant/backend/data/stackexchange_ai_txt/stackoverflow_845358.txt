The servers that run shared hosting are typically much faster than the average home computer, so it probably will not take as long as is does running on your local computer. I think the alarm bells would start to go off if you were sending 500,000 emails a day but if you have a reasonable host using that much CPU for a short time shouldn't be too much of an issue. You could always talk to them about it first, im sure they will sort something out.
