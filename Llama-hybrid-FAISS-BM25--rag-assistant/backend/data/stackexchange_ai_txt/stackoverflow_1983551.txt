From a purist point of view, every import creates a dependency and a potential for conflict. Imports are treated as a necessary evil so they are minimized. Importing another package with a * is like writing a blank check. Importing two packages like that is like giving somebody access to moving money between your accounts. From a practical point of view, this often makes sense because different projects and libraries use surprisingly similar names for differing concepts. Or, imagine you import everything from package A and then everything from package B, and use some class C from package B. If someone later on adds a class with the name C to package A, your code might break! That being said, I admit I'm lazy. I'll often pre-import everything in the package, and then let Eclipse organize it for me based on what I actually use.
