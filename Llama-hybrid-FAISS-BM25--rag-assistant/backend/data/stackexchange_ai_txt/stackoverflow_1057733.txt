Depends what you consider a large amount. Hundreds or Thousands should be OK, but millions may be worth looking for something specialised. A tree will get slower as you grow, depending upon your storage technique and rebalancing. A dictionary should be fairly consistent, but make sure you construct it with a size appropriate to the amount of data you're likely to store (maybe x2 to be safe).
