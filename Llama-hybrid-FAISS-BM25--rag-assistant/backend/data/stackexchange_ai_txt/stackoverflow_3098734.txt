You should use either pthread_detach or pthread_join (but not both) on every pthread you create. pthread_join waits for the thread to finish; pthread_detach indicates that you don't intend to wait for it (hence the implementation is free to reclaim the storage associated with the thread when it terminates). ditto what Artelius said about ps not being the right tool for diagnosing memory leaks.
