What is the One Max Problem in detail?

I am looking a python lib named deap , but stuck at beginning. The first paragraph says: The problem is very simple, we search for a 1 filled list individual. What does 1 filled list means? Search a 1 filled list, from where? individual list or individual 1? Google One Max Problem only gives some information which seems to be useful: There is a Max One Problem I can understand this, but is it same as One Max Problem ? If so, I have a question that why need evolutionary algorithm to "evolve" our population until eventually the target emerges. ? If I am a Medical Researcher, I should already have the entire DNA(gene list) , what I need to do is just search in that list, not evolve a random list. There is a Maximum_satisfiability_problem This is understandable too, seems relate to One Max Problem , another saying?
