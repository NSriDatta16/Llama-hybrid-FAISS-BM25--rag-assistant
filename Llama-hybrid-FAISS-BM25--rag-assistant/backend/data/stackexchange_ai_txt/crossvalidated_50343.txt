Variations in time series

I'm trying to do some really simple Time Series work. I started off looking at monthly counts but the more I thought about it (and the more I read posts by IrishStat) the more I realised my view of this was fundamentally flawed. My main reason for thinking this is the plethora of timing issues there are with using monthly aggregate figures: Varying month length Varying numbers of weekdays Weekends Holidays But what gets me is that this must be a really common issue, I mean practically every big company out there must have an executive report that includes monthly figures. How does one balance for the discrepancies between the months you are comparing? I'm using R to slowly crawl through this stuff and currently I'm just looking at cross correlations with lag. I've looked at decomposition and how to adjust for seasonality but how does one adjust for dates that you know will have an effect on business activity? Is there a way to integrate a list of dates that should be treated differently or somehow compensate for the number of weekend/holiday days in a month (or in a week, or in a year)? A general explanation of the concept would be much appreciated. Edited to make the question more succinct: I am looking at a time series of monthly counts. 2 examples from this time series would be: February 2012 is 29 days long, has 8 weekend days and zero public holidays May 2013 is 31 days long, also has 8 weekend days but also has 2 public holidays How would I compare them without having my conclusions adversely affected by their differences? I could divide by days in month but this doesn't take into account holidays I could divide by working days in month, but this doesn't differentiate between a holiday and a weekend.
