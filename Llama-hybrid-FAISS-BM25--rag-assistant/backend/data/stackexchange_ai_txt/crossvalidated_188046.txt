Recursive neural network implementation in Theano

Is there any available recursive neural network implementation in Theano? Theano's deeplearning.net tutorial does not present any recursive neural networks. Most Theano code I've found is CNN, LSTM, GRU, vanilla recurrent neural networks or MLP. I am most interested in implementations for natural language processing. Example of a recursive neural network:
