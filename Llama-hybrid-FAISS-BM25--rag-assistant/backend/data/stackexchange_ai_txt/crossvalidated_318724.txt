Frequentist Predictive Distribution for a Cauchy variable

I have not been able to find this in the literature, but that probably means I am looking in the wrong spot. I am looking to find the Frequentist predictive distribution, assuming it exists, for a one dimensional and an n-dimensional Cauchy variate. The issue with the n-dimensional version is that there is nothing like a covariate matrix, instead, there is but one scale parameter making the errors hyper-circular. I could see this interfering with the existence of a pivotal value. EDIT I am either looking to predict $x_{i+1}$ from a set of observations $x_1\dots{x_i}$ drawn from a Cauchy distribution with center $\mu$ and scale $\sigma,$ or to predict $y_{i+1}$ from some equation $y=mx+b,$ where $x$ is drawn from a Cauchy distribution as above. It could be a vector or multidimensional, but I am trying to determine the relative properties of the Bayesian versus the Frequentist prediction. My data is drawn from either a truncated Cauchy or a Cauchy depending on which set. A prediction interval will work as I will just set the interval to 100%.
