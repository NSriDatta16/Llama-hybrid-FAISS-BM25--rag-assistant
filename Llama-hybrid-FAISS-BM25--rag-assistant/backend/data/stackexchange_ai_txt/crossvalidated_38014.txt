Using $\chi^2$ to compare two Markov transition matrices

I have a set of observed Markov sequences for which I have calculated first and second order transition matrices: $$M={P}(X_i=x_i|X_{i-1}=x_j)$$ and $$M^2=P(X_i=x_i|X_{i-1}=x_j,\,X_{i-2}=x_i )$$. I then produced a series of Markov chains based on the transition matrix $M$ and hence recalculated the empirical transition matrix $M^2$ based on this new data calling it $\tilde M^2$ and would like to compare it against the expected $M^2$. Is the $\chi^2$ test appropriate here? ie. $\displaystyle \sum \dfrac{M^2_{ij}-\tilde M^2_{ij}}{\tilde M^2_{ij}}$?
