Interpreting regression results for aggregate data: does it make sense to refer to the "average of average"?

I don't have access to individual data, so I have to rely on aggregate data for a large number of cities in a country. If my outcome variable is the log of city average earnings and the predictors are dummy variables for n-1 national regions, does it make sense to interpret coefficients in this way: "Average earnings are on average 10.3% higher for Region_B compared to Region_A" ? In other words, does it makes sense to speak of "average advantage in average earnings" , or is that like saying "average of an average" ?
