I don't know of any DBMSs that would let you do a single query that hits multiple database schemas. Your two best options are: Run a service that knows about each instance (most likely by looking them up in a central database as you say) that can query each database and aggregate the results and return them to your main program. Once you do this you will most likely find other uses for this central service, like initializing all instances. Run all organizations from a single database schema. This is called Multitennant . Add a field to most of your tables for the organization ID and add it to all of your queries and most of your indexes. Which will work better for you is affected by several factors. How many organizations you're dealing with vs how much data for each If you fairly regularly add or remove organizations, multitennant will mean a lot less administration to do so. If the amount of data varies greatly between organizations, or you have some organizations that are much more active than others, then keeping them in separate database instances will allow you to more finely tune your load balancing and backups.
