Find clusters of industrial probe

I'm new to data science, but in these last months i have started to gather many samples of values coming from different industrial probes (temperature of water, pression, Kw consumed, etc). I have developed a procedure to collect every 5 seconds many different values from many differents PLCs, and I have now about 40M records of data. After doing some basic analysis and visualization, I would like to start by finding for every probe the clusters of data and of course the outliers, so I can understand when I have a "strange" situation. Can you help me giving some advise to what kind of analysis I can try to do? Sorry, I understand the question could seem quite vague, but I'm really at the beginning and trying to undestand something more about my data.
