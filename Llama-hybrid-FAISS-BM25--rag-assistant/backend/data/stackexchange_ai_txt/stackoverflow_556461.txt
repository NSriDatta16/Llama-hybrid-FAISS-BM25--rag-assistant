Found a much more elegant solution here Code added below for completeness but all credit goes to Pinal Dave SELECT f.name AS ForeignKey, OBJECT_NAME(f.parent_object_id) AS TableName, COL_NAME(fc.parent_object_id, fc.parent_column_id) AS ColumnName, OBJECT_NAME (f.referenced_object_id) AS ReferenceTableName, COL_NAME(fc.referenced_object_id, fc.referenced_column_id) AS ReferenceColumnName FROM sys.foreign_keys AS f LEFT JOIN sys.foreign_key_columns AS fc ON f.OBJECT_ID = fc.constraint_object_id And if you just want the primary keys... SELECT i.name AS IndexName, OBJECT_NAME(ic.OBJECT_ID) AS TableName, COL_NAME(ic.OBJECT_ID,ic.column_id) AS ColumnName FROM sys.indexes AS i INNER JOIN sys.index_columns AS ic ON i.OBJECT_ID = ic.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = ic.index_id WHERE i.is_primary_key = 1 Added this as an additional answer because it's so far removed from my previous one :)
