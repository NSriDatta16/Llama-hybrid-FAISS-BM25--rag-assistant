What do I gain if I consider the outcome as ordinal instead of categorical?

There are different methods for prediction of ordinal and categorical variables. What I do not understand, is how this distinction matters. Is there a simple example which can make clear what goes wrong if I drop the order? Under what circumstances does it not matter? For instance, if the independent variables are all categorical/ordinal, too, would there be a difference? This related question focuses on the type of the independent variables. Here I am asking about outcome variables. Edit: I see the point that using the order structure reduces the number of model parameters, but I am still not really convinced. Here is an example (taken from an introduction to ordered logistic regression where as far as I can see ordinal logistic regression does not perform better than multinomial logistic regression: library(nnet) library(MASS) gradapply which shows the distribution of the number of right guesses (out of 40) of both algorithms. Edit2: When I use as scoring method the following return(sum(abs(as.numeric(pred)-as.numeric(test_data$apply))) and penalize "very wrong" predictions, polr still looks bad, i.e. the plot above does not change very much.
