Confusion related to MCMC technique

I have this confusion related to Monte Carlo Markov Chain method. I know that Monte Carlo method is used to get the sample mean instead of calculating the high dimensional integration which is not tractable. However, I didn't get what's the role of Markov chain in this. I mean if we take samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters, then we can average the function of the parameters to get the expectation or mean. I didn't get what the role of Markov chain is here?
