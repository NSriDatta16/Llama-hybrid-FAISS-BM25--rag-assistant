How to handle non consistent time series( using LSTM )

The time series dataset I am working on has missing samples. I am trying to use keras and LSTM for prediction. How should I handle the missing timestamp samples ( sometimes there are missing weeks even months)? Does this affect the overall performance of the LSTM predictor?
