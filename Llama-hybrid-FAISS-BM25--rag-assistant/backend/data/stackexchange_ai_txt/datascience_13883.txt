Data engineering is infrastructure work; maintaining "big data" pipelines from ingestion to output. Today you might be expected to know things like SQL, Hadoop, Spark, Docker, and AWS. Data science is an umbrella term, so it can mean a lot of things, including data engineering. But it can also mean pure data analysis without any production work. It really depends on who's using the term; read the job description and ask the company for details.
