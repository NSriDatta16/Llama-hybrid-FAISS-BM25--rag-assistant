Realised the method to do this. Ultimately, I think partial least squares regression would be a better tool, but how to do it in PCA is the following: We know that the first 2 principle components will be vectors that point along the direction of the sheet. The first principle component should move up the sheet from the origin, assuming that the variation in the described direction is greater than the variation seen when looking down the z (response) direction to see the variation of the 2 predictors (the variation of the 2 predictors should be less, as the response is a multiple, by 2 and 5, of the 2 predictors, and I didn't standardise my data in this case). So the first PC moves from the origin up the sheet. The second PC moves perpendicularly to the first PC along the sheet to describe the rest of the variation seen (as a result, the second PC will move in a direction where the response measured will remain constant. This is why PCA is a poor tool: we wouldn't know which PC was which, unless we understood the relationship between predictors & responses to begin with, & ultimately, I want to measure how the combination of 2 predictors affect the response). If we plot the first PC with the 3rd PC - which is a vector that points perpendicularly to the sheet - we can look along the edge of the sheet and plot what I was looking for.
