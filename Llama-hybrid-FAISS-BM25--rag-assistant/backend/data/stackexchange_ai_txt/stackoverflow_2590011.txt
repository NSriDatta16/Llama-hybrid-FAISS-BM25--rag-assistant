how do you build your appliances?

virtual machines hold great promise as a way to distribute hard to configure applications. i have been using jeos vmbuilder (and some bash scripts) to generate my appliances, but i'm looking for something more elegant. in my case, i'm looking for a solution that will build a linux-based vm with configured versions of tomcat and mysql as a base. each future release would be a new war file and a sql update script. it'd be really nice if already deployed vms could self-update and test builds could be pushed to ec2. in my brief search, i've found rpath rbuilder , turnkey linux , vagrant up , suse studio , jeos vmbuilder , and vmware studio . rather than try all of these, i figure i'd ask what this community uses to build and distribute appliances...
