You want to cache the painting in a QImage or QPixmap (probably a QPixmap ). If you do this a lot, you might also want to look at QPixmapCache . Additionally, a lot of drawing can be calculated beforehand, then fairly quickly done using QPainterPath s. I will often use them and recalculate when necessary, rather than caching the whole paint event in a pixmap. Edit: I also ran into a brief mention of QPicture , which might also be something you want to look at: The QPicture class is a paint device that records and replays QPainter commands.
