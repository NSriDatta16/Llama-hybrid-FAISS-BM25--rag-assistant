You might consider using the 'otherwise' keyword as part of your guard expression: initFirstFour :: [a] -> [a] initFirstFour xs | length xs > 3 = take 4 xs | otherwise = error "Need at least four characters." I think this is a bit more readable (and elegant) than your chosen method of pattern matching.
