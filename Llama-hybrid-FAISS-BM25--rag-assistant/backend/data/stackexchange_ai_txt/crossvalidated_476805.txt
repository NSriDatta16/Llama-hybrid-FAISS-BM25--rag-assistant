Nested ANOVA: Correct use for colinearity problem?

We have neuronal data, that we want to analyse for effects of two factors that are hierarchically structured. The data: We have recorded neuronal data from a neuron, where the organism received visual stimulation from 10 different spatial positions (arranged in a circle, five positions on the left and five on the right side). We have 100 stimulations for each position. The two questions that we want to answer are: Is the neuron increasing its firing rate for stimulations from left or right (e.g. higher firing rate for left side stimulation vs. right side stimulation) Is the neuron increasing its firing rate for stimulations for individual positions (e.g. higher firing rate for one single position or multiple adjacent positions vs. the rest). For this question we want to test each position independently. The problem: The factors side (left and right side) and position (10 positions) are hierarchically structured. A individual position is only found on one side. What we did: We performed a nested ANOVA (Matlab anovan with 'nested'), where we defined the position (10 positions) as a factor of the factor side (left and right side). From what I understand both factors are "fixed effects". The question: We are not sure, if the nested ANOVA is accounting for the colinearity of the two factors. Is this a valid use of the nested ANOVA or do we have a problem of colinearity? I hope this question has not been answered before, I was not able to find a similar question. I am very grateful for any answer or comment!
