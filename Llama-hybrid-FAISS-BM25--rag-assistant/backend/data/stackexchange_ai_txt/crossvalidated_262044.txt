What does a bottleneck layer mean in neural networks?

I was reading the FaceNet paper and in the 3rd paragraph of the introduction it says: Previous face recognition approaches based on deep networks use a classification layer trained over a set of known face identities and then take an intermediate bottleneck layer as a representation used to generalize recognition beyond the set of identities used in training. I was wondering what they mean by an intermediate bottleneck layer?
