Some standard error metrics to consider are L2 error, L1 error, RMS, and Pearson/Spearman correlation. Bootstrapping is a good idea, but if possible check if the variance isn't too high as compared to the population. If it's a high variance and/or your data is high dimensional, then reliability is hard to trust, even with bootstrapping. With a small data set, consider using leave-one-out cross validation. Another suggestion is to use a Gaussian process for your regression, assuming you have continuous features. Not only does it work well for relatively small data sets, it's also a Bayesian model that can output a distribution for each prediction, so you can obtain uncertainty estimates as well.
