IP address spoofing using SharpPcap on C#

I will use SharpPcap framework to make my spoofing program, so I need to edit my machine's IP address of the packet with another IP address on the source address field. I found some example on SharpPcap project, but how can I edit or change the source address field of sending packet? Here is the sample code for sending random packets: byte[] bytes = GetRandomPacket(); private static byte[] GetRandomPacket() { byte[] packet = new byte[200]; Random rand = new Random(); rand.NextBytes( packet ); return packet; } - device.SendPacket( bytes );
