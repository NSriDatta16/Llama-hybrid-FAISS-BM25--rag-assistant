Nested PCA : is it the same to reduce dimension one time by m and to reduce m times by 1?

My data is initially represented in a vector space $E$ of dimension $n$. I want to reduce the dimension by $m$, so I apply a PCA process to obtain a vector space $E'$ of dimension $n-m$. If I had applied PCA $m$ times but reducing the dimension only by $1$, I would have obtained another vector space $E''$ of dimension $n-m$. Question : is $E'$ the same vector space as $E''$ ? I would say no, because in the second case, when reducing the dimension at the $i^{th}$ step, the covariance matrix is estimated using data that has already been distorded by the previous steps... Is that correct ?
