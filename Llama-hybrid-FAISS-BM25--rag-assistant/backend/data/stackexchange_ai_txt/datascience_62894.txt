As mentioned in the answers, you can try an unsupervised approach to compare the two texts. To provide some more detail on that, you can use some existing word embeddings to generate word embeddings for the two texts. From a quick google search of the words in review_text it looks like it is Indonesian language. But nonetheless you can use FastText to generate word embeddings for it, it supports more than 150 languages. The word embeddings would be a high dimensional vector, you can use some dimensionality reduction method like PCA or t-SNE and try visualizing these sentences to find how they're structured, if there is an overlap or maybe some other useful insight. You can also try tagging Part of Speech tags for both the languages and see how the structure of the sentence differs based on these tags. You will be able to find a lot of interesting patterns once you try visualizing the word embeddings.
