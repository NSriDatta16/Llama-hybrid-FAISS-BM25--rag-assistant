How can I find the number of support vectors in an SVM, depending on kernel?

Here on slide 3 I see the claim that for linearly separable cases the number of support vectors will be d+1, where d is the dimension we are working on. What if my data is not linearly separable and I use polynomial or RBF kernel? Is there a way to know what will be the number of support vectors?
