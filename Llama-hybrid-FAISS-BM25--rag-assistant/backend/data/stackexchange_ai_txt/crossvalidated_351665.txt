Mixed effects logistic regression with repeated measures and binary outcome

I have an experimental array with a binary dependent variable. Each subject belongs to 1 of 3 groups. Each subject answers 10 questions, 5 of which belong to category A and 5 of which belong to category B. My goal is to examine the interaction between the group level and the category as well to examine the group and categories main effects. I'm using the glmer function from the lme4 package: glmer(binary_outcome ~ category * group + (1|subject_ID), family=binomial(link=logit)) Does this formula capture the relevant aspects of the experimental array?
