Can't get Java Web Start to work in Eclipse

I'm attempting to get Java Web Start to work on an application by using the Web Start Plugin for Eclipse ( http://webstart.sourceforge.net/ ). I tried following the tutorial, but when I completed it and went to launch the JNLP file, it failed with an Application Error, saying "Unexpected exception: java.util.NoSuchElementException. The launch file displayed is: ACSLLand AP Comp Sci 2009-2010 A game. and the exception stack trace is: java.util.NoSuchElementException at java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Unknown Source) at java.util.Scanner.next(Unknown Source) at ascllandgame.ASCLLand.main(ASCLLand.java:16) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.executeApplication(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.executeMainClass(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.doLaunchApp(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.run(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
