I am not familiar with the queue model you mentioned, but this question can be answered using two theorems from general stats. Your assumption for $\mu$ is correct, due to the law of total expectation . The idea is that when you sample a customer uniformly, the expected waiting time for that customer can be $\mu_1,\mu_2,\cdots,\mu_n$ , each with probability $\frac{1}{n}$ . Therefore, the overall expected value is indeed $\mu=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i}{n}$ . For the variance, you should look for the law of total variance , which states that the overall variance is the sum of the average individual variance (given by $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2}{n}$ ) and the variance between individuals (given by $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (\mu_i-\mu)^2}{n}$ ). Hope it helps!
