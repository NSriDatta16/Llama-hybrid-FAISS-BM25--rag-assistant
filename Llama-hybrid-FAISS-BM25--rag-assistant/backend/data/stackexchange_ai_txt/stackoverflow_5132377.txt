What's the average line number per method/class?

I'm interested what's the average line number per method or class . Programming language is JAVA and it's an Android project. I know there is no specific number, but I'm interested what's the good programming practice ? EDIT: For example in android I have 10 buttons (3 for action bar, 7 for every day of the week so I can quickly choose some day of the week and get relevant information and so on, doesn't really matter what the application is about) and only this "type of code" needs ~100 lines of code (per button I need at least 10 lines of code to initialize it and set up a onClick listener ), is there a way to shrink this down a bit? someButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button); someButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { // do something } });
