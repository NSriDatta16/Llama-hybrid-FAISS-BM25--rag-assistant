Yes, if you can write down the integral, then this is possible. You'll almost certainly end up using some MCMC sampler and the details depend on the sampler. You basically need to somehow calculate the parameters of the likelihood function for what you observe from the underlying parameters your interested in and that can involve integrals (or differential equations etc.). With "traditional" (e.g. Metropolis-Hastings type) samplers, you just need a function that evaluates the integral to plug that in (some MCMC samplers such as PROC MCMC in SAS have numeric integration by quadrature available and that's not too crazy to manually implement, either), while with modern Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers you'll also need derivatives of the integral (or express it so that auto-differentiation can obtain this for you). E.g. Stan (which you can use in R via the rstan package or in some situations via the simpler brms, in python via pystan etc.) has ready made capabilities for 1d-integrals , while for more complex integrals some more thinking/re-expressing as differential equations (for which there are then various differential equation solvers available). You might also be able to sample from the integral without having to numerically solve it. Of course, these tend to be time consuming steps, so 1) make sure you cannot analytically solve the integral and 2) if you have computers or servers with lots of CPUs, then use the parallelization capabilities of tools like Stan.
