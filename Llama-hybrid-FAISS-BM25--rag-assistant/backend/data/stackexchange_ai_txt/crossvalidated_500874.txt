I think this is the right kind of visualization that should be done before you embark on your logistic regression endeavors. It suggests to me that a logistic regression with a spline term could be appropriate for these data. Generally statisticians will consider splines to be more reliable than polynomial models. Take a look at the mgcv package in R, and think about trying out fit as a model. The gam function from mgcv will fit a logistic regression model with penalized thin plate splines.
