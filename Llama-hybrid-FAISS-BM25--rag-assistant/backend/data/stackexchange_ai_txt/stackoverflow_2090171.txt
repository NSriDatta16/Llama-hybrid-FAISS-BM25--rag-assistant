Why do you want to limit passwords to 20 characters? A minimum encourages users to select harder to guess phrases, but why limit it? Same goes for limiting the characters which can be used. Why restrict it at all? Despite your website being casual , it is bad practice to store passwords in plaintext form. At the very least, concatenate some salt (such as the username plus some constant string for your site), and store the SHA-1 hash of it. Since users tend to use the same passwords at multiple sites, this provides a nice measure of protection against cross site hacking should your site's passwords be hijacked.
