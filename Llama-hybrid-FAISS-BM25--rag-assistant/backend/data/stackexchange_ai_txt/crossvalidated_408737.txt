You can search for random slope (or random coeficient) models, but this is normaly done with panel data, with a $X$ variable that varies through time for each individual. Otherwise, in your simple model, if you don't put any constraint on your coefficients, you will just end up saying that each $Y$ is 100% determined by $X$ . This applies to your second model as well. It assumes that there is no error term beside the error on the coefficient. Therefore, it just assumes that $X(\beta+\epsilon_i)$ completely determines $Y$ , so nobody would ever use this to try to estimate individual-specific coefficients. But if this is still the model you want to assume, then yes OLS gives a consistent estimate of the average effect $\beta$ . It just means you have heterosckedasticity, so you should take this into account for inference.
