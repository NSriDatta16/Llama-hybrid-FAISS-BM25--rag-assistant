Your UserControl must be added to the Controls collection of a parent Form/Control before it can be properly initialized. Normally you would not write the code yourself that creates and adds the UserControl. Instead, first build your project, then go to the Deisgner view of your main form and look at the Toolbox. Your UserControl name (and an icon) should appear towards the top of the toolbox, and you can simply drag it to the main form. The Windows Forms designer will automatically generate the needed initialization code for you. You should not create a new instance of your control in your button click event handler. Using the Designer approach to create your control you can simply access the existing instance of your control as follows: public void button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { // myUserControl1 has already been created and initialized by the Deisgner generated code // Note the name 'myUserControl1' is just an example, yours may be different. string controlText=myUserControl1.rtnTxtMake; // Or to change the UserControl textbox value myUserControl1.rtnTxtMake="Testing"; }
