Microsoft Word is required to load the .doc and generate the preview image of document. Embedding Word in your own window used to be possible but support for this is rapidly disappearing. The old DsoFramer control used to be the standard solution but you can no longer download it. It got removed when the Office 2010 beta became available, an ominous sign. Embedding it in a WebBrowser might still be possible, not sure. The long term solution is to use Word itself to generate the preview. Use the Document.PrintPreview() method .
