Predicting individual performance on game A given team performance on game A doesn't seem like a predictive problem as much as solving a system of equations. I don't see a problem using linear (or non-linear!) regression to predict individual performance on game A given team performance on game B, since your team's past performance is a function of your performance. Whether the function you are trying to model is "aggregating things" or "individualizing things," there is nothing circular going on, you are simply modeling a function. The more directly linked your input variables are to your output variables, the better! With all this said, in the paper you are referring to, I think team performance refers to "the quality of the team" not including the individual player. When you have good teammates, you play better (because there are better team dynamics, because you don't want to let them down, etc...). The team you play in can affect your performance, but it is not a function of your performance. Reference from the article: The first pool of variables represents the team quality. The first indicator (the average team rating except for the observed player) serves as a proxy for the team environment and can be a source to improve individual HC.
