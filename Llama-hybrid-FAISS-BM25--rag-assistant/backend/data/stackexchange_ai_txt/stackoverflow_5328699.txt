I've looked at embedding Ruby into C/C++ before, and it seemed extremely difficult. There are a lot of challenges you'll face: Calling into Ruby from C/C++ requires 2 layers of functions to be written (one layer to call, and one to catch exceptions) Calling back into C/C++ from Ruby requires the normal SWIG-type work Moving data back and forth requires keeping careful track of allocations, since Ruby will want to garbage collect anything it can I'm sure that this can be done, but it seemed extremely difficult to me, only doable if you can jump into Ruby in a minimum of entry points.
