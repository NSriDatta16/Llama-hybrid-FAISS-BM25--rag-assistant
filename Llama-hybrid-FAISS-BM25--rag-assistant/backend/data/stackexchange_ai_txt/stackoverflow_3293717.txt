Okay, turns out MATLAB can do this but it's not very pretty. It basically boils down to doing PCA, and then using the quiver function to do the plotting: My matrix X here contains starting points of my high dimensional nodes in odd rows, and ending points in even rows. Then: [COEFF, SCORE]= princomp(zscore(X)); x=SCORE(1:2:end,1); y=SCORE(1:2:end,2); z=SCORE(1:2:end,3); u=SCORE(2:2:end,1); v=SCORE(2:2:end,2); w=SCORE(2:2:end,3); quiver3(x,y,z,u-x,v-y,w-z,0); The downside is that I can't find a good way to color the edges, so I get a huge mess if I just do it trivially. Ah well, good enough for now!
