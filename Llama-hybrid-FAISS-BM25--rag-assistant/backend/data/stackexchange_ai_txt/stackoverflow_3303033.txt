Unfortunately there is not yet a selector to differentiate text only links to image links. However you could get away with this: p a:active { position: relative; top: 1px; } If your links are all contained within paragraph tags this will work, and will not affect your image tags. You could create one for H1, H2, etc for any tags you need to include.
