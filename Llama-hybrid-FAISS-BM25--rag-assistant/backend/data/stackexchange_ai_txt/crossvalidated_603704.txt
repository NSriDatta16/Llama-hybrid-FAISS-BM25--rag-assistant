(Why) is a logistic regression maximum likelihood estimator consistent?

A nice property of maximum likelihood estimators is that, while they can be biased, they are consistent for $iid$ observations. In a logistic regression, unless the conditional distributions all have the same probability parameter, we lose the "identically" distributed of $iid$ . Nonetheless, logistic regressions tend to have their parameters estimated by maximizing the likelihood. (Why) does this not lead to an inconsistent maximum likelihood estimator?
