Teams I have worked on do not pass this kind of workflow information around in session, primarily because of the difficulty it poses to web farms/gardens. We think of session as a container for information that is relevant most (if not all) of the time from the moment the user first hits the site to the moment they leave. Even then, I'd only use session if that information was very expensive to retrieve/build, and only if I knew that the load balancer would stick the user to a particular server in a farm or that we had a suitable out-of-process session provider in place. Instead I would pass this type of information via the query string, hidden input field, or ViewState (if enabled), and provide friendly error-handling when invalid values are sent. If history management is important, I would leverage ASP.NET AJAX history management .
