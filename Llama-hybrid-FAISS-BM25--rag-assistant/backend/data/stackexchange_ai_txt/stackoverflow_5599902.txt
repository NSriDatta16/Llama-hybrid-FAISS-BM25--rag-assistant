Another consequence of using iframes is that the rendering may be out of order, since it is an independent HTTP request, and, because it is an additional request, this can add overall time to the retrieval of the data, especially in IE versions before 8 where they were limited to 2 simultaneous HTTP requests at a time--so if you have images or other scripts loading at the same time, some of these may be queued until one or both of the two slots are free. IE8 (and Firefox) boosted this to 6. While it seems the real solution is looking into them fixing the Commentics script, or you finding another library, despite all advice you will probably find here to the contrary (albeit for good reasons of course), for beginners, I recommend focused on practicality and experimentation rather than dogma; in other words, it could work out all right for you, as long as there are no links inside the iframes which, if clicked, would lead to only the iframe being replaced with the content. Not a best practice though for reasons I and others have mentioned. Another issue to watch for is that even the slightest whitespace before your beginning is interpreted as text sent to the user, so if a script you include tries to then add headers, you could have problems. The headers being already sent message means that the script has started to send headers since it needed to send them before starting to send the content (in this case the whitespace) which you already started printing out (without buffering). For PHP, I really recommend a templating engine like Smarty (and Smarty is nicely documented) where you get comfortable with the pattern of letting your business logic run first, and then supplying variables to the design logic for use there (currently what is your HTML + includes). When you're including others libraries which output text, you will need to still use buffering though for such reasons as you discovered.
