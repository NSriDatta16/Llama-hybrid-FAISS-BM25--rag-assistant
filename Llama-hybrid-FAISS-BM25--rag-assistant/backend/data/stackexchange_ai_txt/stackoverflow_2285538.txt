Seeing as you are using ASP.NET, you could take a look at LINQ-to-SQL which solves this in a very elegant way: var query = db.T_Persons; if (txtGender.Text != string.Empty) query = query.Where(x => x.Gender == txtGender.Text); if (txtWeigth.Text != string.Empty) query = query.Where(x => x.Weight == int.Parse(txtWeight.Text)); ... Of course, you'll need to be using .NET 3.5 or newer.
