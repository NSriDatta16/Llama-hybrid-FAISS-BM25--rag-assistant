Should I scale my data before a Cartesian-to-spherical conversion?

If I have three features, should I scale them before converting them to a spherical coordinate system? I have been working on a ternary classification problem. My data is high-dimensional, so I've been using one-class techniques such as SVM with different kernels, local outlier factor, and linear discriminant analysis to extract new features within the training splits; this approach appears to be working well. I noticed some radial patterns in visualizing these features so I decided to treat the trios of per-class features as Cartesian coordinates and converted them to spherical coordinates as new features. Before conversion, the features were on vastly different scales, so I tried a couple of different scaling techniques such as Yeo-Johnson power transform, standard scaling, or quantile transform before obtaining the spherical coordinates. Downstream, there is some more feature engineering and one more scaling step before the classifier is trained. Adding the spherical features appears to boost performance, but I haven't noticed a big difference between the choice of pre-spherical scaling and saw some evidence in tree-based feature importance to suggest that omitting scaling before the spherical transformation might even yield the best performance. Is there any theoretical motivation to scale or not to scale before performing such a Cartesian-to-spherical transformation? If so, may I safely assume it applies to 2D conversions (polar coordinates) as well?
