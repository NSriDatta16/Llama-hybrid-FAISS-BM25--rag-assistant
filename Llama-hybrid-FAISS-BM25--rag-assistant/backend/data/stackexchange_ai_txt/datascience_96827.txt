Creating neural network to solve for equations

I have a dataset like: The v1 variable is a mathematical expression. Currently, I am using hyperopt to solve for these parameters and am using v1,v2,v3 in regression to predict y and then minimize the RMSE as the objective function. The values of x, y, and z are from 0-1 and that's how I defined the space. Will it be possible if we can use a neural network setup to solve for such cases? I would really appreciate it if someone could provide a starting point to solve such a problem. The reason I would like to switch from Bayesian optimization is because in reality I have 50+ parameters and it is not recommended to solve for so many parameters using a Bayesian approach.
