Generating Strong Unique User ID's w/PHP & MySQL

Ahoy Stack Overflow! This be mai first post... I'm attempting to identify users with a salted unique public key. Algorithm - Should I use uniqid(), sha256, sha512, something else? All hashes will be salted. NIST recommended SHA256, but I prefer to hear what others might suggest. Generation - Does hash(SALT + AUTO_INCREMENT_PK + CREATED_TIMESTAMP ) suffice? More entropy? I'd use email, as it is unique for each user, however the user can modify their email address. I was also considering storing signup_email so that hashes would not have to be re-calculated. MySQL Storage - Currently, our ID's are INT(255) auto_increment primary key's. As stated earlier, potentially hundreds of millions of keys. Depending on the crypto algo, I should have a fixed-size ID. Can I keep INT(255) or should I use CHAR(n)? ---------------------- Thanks for reading :) -------------------------------
