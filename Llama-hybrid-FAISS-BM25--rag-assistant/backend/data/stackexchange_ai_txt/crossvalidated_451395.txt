Many science fields have shifted the focus from a more theoretical study of statistics to a more data-based focus. How about econometrics?

In the last decade, science fields, which depend on an empirical approach, have shifted the focus from a more theoretical study of statistics to a more data-based focus provided by machine learning or statistical learning theory (automatic procedures to choose the variables, cross-validation procedures...). Simple examples can come from physics, engineering and also statistics. Econometrics does not seem to have followed this phenomenon. That's true? Why? PS: This question was motivated by @MatthewDrury. It was based in an interesting discussion (in the comments) with @RichardHardy about an answer to this question .
