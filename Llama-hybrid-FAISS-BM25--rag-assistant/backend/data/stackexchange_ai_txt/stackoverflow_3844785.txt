So I'm not sure what you mean. Michael wrote : I am just wondering how to do the replacement. If it makes it easier, say I want to replace all UNICODE_ESC fragments with the character '?' while parsing. Okay, that can be done like this: Token : 'x' {setText("?");} ; where Token matches the literal x and is then rewritten with ? .
