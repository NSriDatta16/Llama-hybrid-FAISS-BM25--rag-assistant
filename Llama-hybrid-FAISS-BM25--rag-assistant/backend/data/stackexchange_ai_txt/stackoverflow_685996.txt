The style problem is more easily solvable of the two. If you render using Javascript, you can inject your own CSS rules that would apply only to your widget. For example you could put an ID on the widget's outer DIV, and scope all the rules through that ID: #widget * { font-family: Verdana; text-size: 12px; } #widget a:link { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer; } And so on. To resolve the frame resizing issue, you would need some code to be hosted on the server of the page you are embedding into, and some pretty crafty scripting to facilitate a frame communications layer.
