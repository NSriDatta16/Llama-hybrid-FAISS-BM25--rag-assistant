Adding a separator to a list of items for display

I have a list of items that I wish to display with a separator between them in C#. Using a normal iterator I would end up with an extra separator at the beginning or the end: string[] sa = {"one", "two", "three", "four"}; string ns = ""; foreach(string s in sa) { ns += s + " * "; } // ns has a trailing *: // one * two * three * four * Now I can solve this using a for loop like so: ns = ""; for(int i=0; i Although the second solution works it doesn't look very elegant. Is there a better way to do this?
