How do you compute the confidence interval for the product of two separate A/B tests?

I am trying to find the confidence interval of the end result of two A/B tests. As an example, lets assume that for test 1 I am looking at the click-through rate of a page and have a control and treatment cell. I have found that the click-through rate increases from 0.387 in control to 0.393 in treatment by using the test of differences between proportions to find that the difference between control and treatment is significantly different from zero (p=0.01). The sample size for both control and treatment is about 100K. A week later, I do a second A/B test, again with a control cell and a treatment cell. I record the average number of items bought after the user clicks on the page I tested in Test 1. I find that for this test, the number of items increases from 0.367 in control to 0.385 in treatment. This time I use a T-test for differences between means with sample sizes of 60K per cell. I find that the sd of control is 0.805 and the sd of treatment is 0.815. Again, the result is statistically significant with p=0.00. Now, since I increased the click-through rate by 0.393/0.387 = 1.015504 and the number of items bought after clicking by 0.385/0.367= 1.049046, my point estimate for increase in sales (assuming everything else remains equal) is 1.015504*1.049046=1.06531. I can also compute 95% confidence intervals for both Test 1 and Test 2 separately. However, I would like to compute the confidence interval for this estimate of 1.06531. For simplicity's sake, let's assume test 1 and test 2 are completely independent. What method can I use to estimate an accurate confidence interval here? I know multiplying the two separate confidence interval doesn't work, and I have tried the Delta method described here ( Confidence interval for the product of two parameters ), but this gives a much narrower confidence interval than the product of the two separate confidence intervals, which seems counterintuitive. (I can't rule out I made a mistake though). The calculations in R are: varp2 #Means of differences p2 #Formula (p1)*(p2) #Delta method, assuming zero covariance varX Where the variances may be a bit different than the ones you'd calculate manually, since the data I gave above was a rough estimate.
