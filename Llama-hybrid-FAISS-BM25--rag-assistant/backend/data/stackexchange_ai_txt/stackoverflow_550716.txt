Events and Delegates in F#

I donâ€™t have any experience in F# but have a few lines of test code in C# for a framework I've made that I need to rewrite in F#. Any help would be appreciated. bar.Ready += new Agent.ReadyHandler(bar_Ready); static void bar_Ready(string msg) { Console.WriteLine(msg.body); }
