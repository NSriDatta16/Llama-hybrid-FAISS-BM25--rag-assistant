Use Laplacian Eigenmaps, Locally Linear Embedding or Local Tangent Space Alignment. These methods map the distances in a low-dimensional space non-linearly, thereby preserving the local neighborhood/ local geometry. A very preliminary technique would be classical metric multidimensional scaling- but this would be a linear projection, and hence it is fairly possible that the local neighborhood is not preserved accurately, unless the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is low (one way of interpreting this is- the data can be represented as a kernel gram matrix, which has a low-error low rank approximation).
