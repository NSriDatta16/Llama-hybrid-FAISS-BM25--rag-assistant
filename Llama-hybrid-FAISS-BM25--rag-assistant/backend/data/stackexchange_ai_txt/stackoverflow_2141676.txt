I've done this using a somewhat ghetto/duct-tape PHP shell script across database servers (dev/production setup) in the past. Given you have 2 servers, and one of them is "right": grab a list of columns per each table to check. SHOW CREATE TABLE works, or just SELECT * FROM x LIMIT 1 if you aren't interested in possibly altered data types / defaults. array_sort() the field names alphabetically, and loop through each comparing whatever potential changes you're interested in. Not recommending this though! I used this because the sysadmins didn't think anything of granting full db permissions to some outsourcing folks, so it was just a quick safety net, nothing as planned or permanent as unit tests. A more elegant & cleaner way to do this (limited to MySQL5+ though?) would be to use the information_schema system database, particularly the COLUMNS table. If you don't have 2 servers, a separate database to hold/copy column info (e.g. a clone of information_schema with the latest "correct" schema) would work too. This would let you diff for new/dropped tables, indices, triggers, procedures, users/permissions, etc. as well.
