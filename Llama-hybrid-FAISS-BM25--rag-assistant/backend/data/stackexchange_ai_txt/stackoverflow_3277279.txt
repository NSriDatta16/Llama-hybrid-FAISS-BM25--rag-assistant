Rich, I've done similar, primarily with iMagick. GD is functionally similar, so I expect no problems. My site handled a hundred images a week without issue, and reliably served to ~1k/week. I did all processing on the backend as it appears you're doing in this example, so few worries about heavy inbound traffic (such as a pickup on DIGG) crushing your server. The biggest challenge that you're opening yourself up to vulnerabilities by allowing uploads of any sort. You've probably heard IT security guys say that the only way to protect from hackers is to get off the web....it's kinda like that. I wouldn't live in complete fear, because it looks like you've taken fair steps to audit file types and sizes. An additional consideration is to look at the permissions on your server--open the directory write only to the user agent of the server and block browsing to the directory for extra security. If you want to be doubly safe, write to a different account (if you have such available) to limit the exposure to your code. It's not necessary, but it's a good extra step if you have concerns. Finally, place your uploader behind a simple password system with captcha to block the auto-exploit checkers....give users free access with a simple registration step. It's a small UI hassle, but could make all the difference security-wise. I might consider stopping the process if the user file is over 2mb limit. That's just me. You wouldn't want the system to crash and burn if some user trys to force a bad file with a .jpg file extension on your server. Bandwidth is likely only a concern if you're hosting yourself or if you're paying by the meg--sure, this'll raise your bandwidth, but even with a hundred uploads a day you're likely not going to be pushing a standard server beyond its means unless the corresponding traffic visiting the site is in the thousands. Most hosts will allow you to monitor server load. I've had good luck on the cheap personally with HostGator Files stay on the server indefinitely, assuming nothing bad happens to your account and you pay your bills. For that reason, make sure to separate your upload folder from that of any other content--it gets to be a nightmare once a couple hundred files have been uploaded. Backup often, just to be safe.
