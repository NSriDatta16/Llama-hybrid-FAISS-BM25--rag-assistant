What's a good, free, drop-in set of mimetype icons?

I want a set of mimetype icons to go with my file uploads, to show in users' files lists and the like. It should be: 16x16 PNG or JPG (other sizes through 64x64 would be a bonus but not required) already organized such that I can do e.g. mimetype.sub('/','-') + '.png' and get the icon file name (I'd like to avoid spending a bunch of time figuring out the associations) not platform specific, preferably using properitary apps' native icons where available (e.g. a .zip icon should not look like a KDE box) pretty but readable and suitable to a general audience ;-) What's a good package for this?
