The example by gabriel gave me the right lead but I could not get it to work exactly like that. When looking at the source code example of the jQuery documentation you see that the HTML code is supposed to look like this: One Two Three First tab is active by default: $('#example').tabs(); ... As I have 3 tabs which have content that is rather static, for me it was enough to set the height of all tabs to the height of the highest one, which is #fragment-1 in my case. This is the code that does this: $("#tabs div.ui-tabs-panel").css('height', $("#fragment-1").height());
