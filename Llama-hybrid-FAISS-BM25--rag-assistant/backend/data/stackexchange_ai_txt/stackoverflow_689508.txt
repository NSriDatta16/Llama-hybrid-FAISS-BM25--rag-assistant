Is this a reasonable way to implement 'remember me' functionality

If a user logs into the site, and says 'remember me', we get the unique identifier for the user, encrypt this with RijndaelManaged with a keysize of 256 and place this in a httponly cookie with a set expiration of say.. 120 days, the expiration is refreshed each successful request to the server. Optionally we generate the initialization vector based upon the user agent and part of the ipv4 address (the last two octets). Obviously theres no real expiration system built into this, the user could technically use this encrypted key forever (given we don't change the server side key).. I considered the fact that to allow this feature I need to allow the user to be able to bypass the login and give me their unique id (which is a guid), I figured the guid alone was really hard to guess a real users guid, but would leave the site open to attack by botnots generating guids (I've no idea how realistic it is for them to find a legit guid).. so this is why theres encryption where the server knows the encryption key, and optionally the iv is specific to the browser and ip part. Should I be considering a different approach where the server issues tickets associated to a user, and these tickets would have a known expiration date so the server stays in control of expiration? should I really care about expiration? remember me is remember me after all? Looking forward to being humbled ;), Cheers.
