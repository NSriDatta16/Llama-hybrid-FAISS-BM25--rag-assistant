if else condition in class constructor ... is it good practice?

I have written a constructor and passing one boolean flag to decide which value to set to class variable. Code is as follows public PDFParagraph(PDFPhrase phrase,boolean isRtl) { super(phrase); if(isRtl) this.setAlignment(Element.ALIGN_RIGHT); else this.setAlignment(Element.ALIGN_LEFT); } Now I am confused and not sure if I shall add if...else conditions in constructor. Is it good style to set the class varible value? Thanks, Hanumant.
