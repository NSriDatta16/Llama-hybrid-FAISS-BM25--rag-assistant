What computational savings? The PCA computation is based on the covariance (or correlation) matrix, whose size depends on the number of variables, not the number of data points. The calculation of a covariance matrix is fast. Even if you were doing PCA repeatedly (as part of a simulation, for instance), reducing from 1000 data points to 500 wouldn't even reduce the time by 50%.
