Interpretation of partial autocorrelogram function

The partial autocorrelogram function for the time series I am working with shows a significant spike at lag 1 and a minor one at lag 3. For another time series, it shows the significant one also at lag 1 and another one at lag 6. How do I interpret this in terms of the time persistence of the series?
