The best way to go about learning PHP? Pick it up and play with it. Follows some tutorials; maybe pick up a simple project you've done in the past and re-implement it in PHP; start a new project in PHP and see how it goes. Don't worry about the fact that you're used to ASP. Just forget all the language-specific stuff and remember that you already know how to write good code. Those skills are (largely) language-independent. There will be some things that are easier to do in PHP and some things that are harder. Don't be discouraged by the harder bits. It is certainly worth the time to learn. It will broaden your knowledge and make you a better developer. And it never hurts to know a tool or two that work cross-platform.
