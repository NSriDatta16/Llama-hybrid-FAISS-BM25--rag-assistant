Creating a Desktop Shortcut Using a Web Page

I am trying to create something on a webpage that allows my users to create a desktop shortcut. Because my users are NOT technically savvy, I would like to avoid having them try to drag and drop. Is there a way that I could create a button on a webpage (either using JavaScript or .Net) that automatically creates a desktop shortcut for the user?ยก
