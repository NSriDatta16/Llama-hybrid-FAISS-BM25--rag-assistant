I used qtip and was pretty impressed until it started interfering an infragistics grid control. I'm now also looking for a very simple tooltip plugin that doesn't cause the problems that Qtip caused. For anyone curious in the infragistics details, it was causing the dropdownlist items as defined in a valuelist to not show.
