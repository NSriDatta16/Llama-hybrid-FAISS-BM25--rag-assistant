Windows 7 Ribbon: How to specify "Four buttons, two big, two small"?

When laying out a group, the Windows Ribbon Framework supports some predefined layouts . One of the layouts, which requires four buttons is called FourButtons . This layout supports 3 different sizes, Large , Medium , and Small . In each case it gives the layouts: Large : Medium : Small : Right now i am using the FourButtons predefined template in my xml file as: ... ... And you can see the line which specifies the FourButtons layout template. And my layout is FourButtons : Except i don't want FourButtons layout, i want " Four Buttons, Two Big Two Small ". In the same way that there is ThreeButtons-OneBigAndTwoSmall : And there is a FiveButtons : i want a FourButtons-TwoBigTwoSmall , which i can manually mockup: Unfortunately declarative programming that Microsoft invented for creating custom layouts confounds me as a programmer. Can anyone decipher the declarative language example at the bottom of the page and come up with a FourButton-TwoBigTwoSmall template? Note: All the pretty graphics, formatting, links, and stuff are used to attract squirrels - who love shiny graphics. And if you actually read this far i could actually use your help.
