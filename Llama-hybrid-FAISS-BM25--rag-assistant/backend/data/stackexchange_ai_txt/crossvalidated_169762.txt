Detect multiple classes in an image?

I have a deep neural network trained with data of different kinds of fruits (apples, oranges, guava, pear, etc.). In my testing data, I have multiple fruits in the same image. For example, an image may be both apple and oranges. Will my neural network be able to recognize that multiple fruits are in the image? Can it tell me which fruits are in the image? Also, can my neural network tell me that the image has apples and oranges? The number of fruits in each image also varies. Some images have two kinds of fruits, some have three.
