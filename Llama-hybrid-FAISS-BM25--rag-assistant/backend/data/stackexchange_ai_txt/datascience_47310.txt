How Does Sci-Kit Learn Train Regression Neural Networks (MLPRegressor) So Fast?

Why does using the scikit-learn library's MLPRegressor result in such a boost in training time when compared to constructing the network from scratch? I tried both methods and I found that writing the code from scratch yielded an average training time of ~10 seconds while Sci-Kit Learn trained almost instantly?
