getting strange exception trying to implement asynchronous http in google app engine for java

I'm trying to implement async http in java. Here is the important part of the code: for (String urlString : urls) { // TODO: try and get rid of these two heap allocations url = new URL(urlString); request = new HTTPRequest(url); request.addHeader(userAgentHeader); request.addHeader(authorizationHeader); request.addHeader(acceptEncodingHeader); request.addHeader(acceptCharsetHeader); responses.add(URLFetchServiceFactory.getURLFetchService().fetchAsync(reques t)); apiCallsMade++; } for (Future futureResponse : responses) { parseResponse(new String(futureResponse.get().getContent())); } I keep getting this error: com.google.apphosting.api.ApiProxy$CallNotFoundException: The API package 'urlfetch' or call 'Fetch()' was not found. I looked around for any jars that were missing from the classpath but didn't see anything missing. Do you know which jar that code is in? I googled the error and also searched through this group but found nothing. Thanks, David
