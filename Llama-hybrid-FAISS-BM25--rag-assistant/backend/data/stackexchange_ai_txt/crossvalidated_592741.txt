Can I set my priors to the get_priors outcome (brms package) in a linear mixed effect model?

I am brand new to Bayesian statistics. I want to perform a linear mixed effect model via the brms package in R. To do that, I have to set priors in my model fit. I use the get_priors function and apply those in the model fit. library(readr) library(brms) library(bayesplot) pre = read_csv("C:/mixed_model1.csv") pre $regions = as.numeric(as.factor(pre$ regions)) pre.sc = data.frame(scale(pre)) #scale all predictors to center pre.sc = na.omit(pre.sc) (prior When I compare this model with one model fit from brms too, but without any priors via the loo function, I get that the model fit including priors from get_priors perform better. Is it that 'simple' to use the given ```get_priors ``` function for setting my priors in the model fit?
