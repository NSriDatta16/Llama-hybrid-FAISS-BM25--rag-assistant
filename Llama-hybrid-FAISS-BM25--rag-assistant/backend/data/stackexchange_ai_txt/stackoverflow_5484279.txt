Recommended pattern to confirm action in Spring MVC?

Sorry for this question, but today I feel short of ideas. What I need is a good way to implement confirmation of requests in spring mvc. suppose I have @RequestMapping(params = "action=deleteitem") public ModelAndView deleteItem(@RequestParam(value = "id") int id){ ... } I'd like something that I could re-use, like a confirmation page with a parametric message, that then recalls this. I can think of 100 of ways, but none seems clean and elegant. So I'd like a word from who has more experience than me.
