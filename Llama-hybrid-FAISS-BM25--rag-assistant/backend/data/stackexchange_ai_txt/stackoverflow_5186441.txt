Javascript Drag and drop for touch devices

I am looking for a drag & DROP plugin that works on touch devices. I would like similar functionality to the jQuery UI plugin which allows "droppable" elements. The jqtouch plugin supports dragging, but no dropping. Here is drag & drop that only supports iPhone/iPad. Can anyone point me in the direction of a drag & drop plugin that works on android/ios? ...Or it might be possible to update the jqtouch plugin for droppability, it already runs on Andriod and IOS. Thanks!
