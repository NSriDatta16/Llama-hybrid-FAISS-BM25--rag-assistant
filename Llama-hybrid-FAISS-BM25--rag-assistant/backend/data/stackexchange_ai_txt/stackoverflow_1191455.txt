get organized with the command line: a command library

we all create/discover new and useful commands every day (I do...) but I forget them the day after, above all those complicated command pipes.. I use history | grep but that's not enough. I'd like a program to save and categorize my favorite commands, that lets you search them and execute them easily. If you know any, that'd be cool if not, I'm writing one.. don't you thing this is a good idea?
