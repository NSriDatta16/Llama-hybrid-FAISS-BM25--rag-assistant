The MySQL manual indicates that the MySqlBulkLoader is a wrapper of 'LOAD DATA INFILE'. While looking at the 'LOAD DATA INFILE' documentation I noticed this paragraph: If you specify IGNORE, input rows that duplicate an existing row on a unique key value are skipped. If you do not specify either option, the behavior depends on whether the LOCAL keyword is specified. Without LOCAL, an error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text file is ignored. With LOCAL, the default behavior is the same as if IGNORE is specified; this is because the server has no way to stop transmission of the file in the middle of the operation. I found no discussion on transactions but the above paragraph would indicate that transactions are not possible. A workaround would be to import the data into a import table and then use a separate stored procedure to process the data using transactions into the desired table. So in answ
