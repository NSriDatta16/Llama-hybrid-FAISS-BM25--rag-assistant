Model Underperforming

I am a quite new to machine learning but I have tried to implement some prediction on a data to predict if a customer would churn of not.And for this I have used many features but I am unable to figure out what is the issue with this model as it is just unable to predict churners which non churners are easily predicted as they are the majority in the dataset.Ex: 10% of the entire dataset is a churner and rest are non churners. Now I have a great accuracy but 0 sensitivity which beats the goal of my model.Also I am unable to figure out how can I make this work better.Whenever I try some new algorithms I get this: Sample dataset: https://www.dropbox.com/s/65slinuaabyr7bq/trial.csv?dl=0 Warning in preProcess.default(thresh = 0.95, k = 5, method = "pca", x = c(239573, : These variables have zero variances: RAHVUSLIT, NAMEGurmee_Solaris, Jalatsid, Laste.jalatsid, Laste.jalatsid..realisatsioon. Something is wrong; all the Accuracy metric values are missing: Accuracy Kappa Min. : NA Min. : NA 1st Qu.: NA 1st Qu.: NA Median : NA Median : NA Mean :NaN Mean :NaN 3rd Qu.: NA 3rd Qu.: NA Max. : NA Max. : NA NA's :3 NA's :3 Error in train.default(x, y, weights = w, ...) : Stopping As well when I do a confusion matrix: Confusion Matrix and Statistics Reference Prediction churner nonchurner churner 0 0 nonchurner 42 258 Accuracy : 0.86 95% CI : (0.8155, 0.8972) No Information Rate : 0.86 P-Value [Acc > NIR] : 0.541 Kappa : 0 Mcnemar's Test P-Value : 2.509e-10 Sensitivity : 0.00 Specificity : 1.00 Pos Pred Value : NaN Neg Pred Value : 0.86 Prevalence : 0.14 Detection Rate : 0.00 Detection Prevalence : 0.00 Balanced Accuracy : 0.50 'Positive' Class : churner Any ideas on what could be the issue is highly appreciated. Thanks for the help!
