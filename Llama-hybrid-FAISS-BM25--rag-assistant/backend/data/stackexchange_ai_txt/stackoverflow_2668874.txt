A point of view to add to this discussion is that a function call generally in the most optimistic case has overhead of a a few 8-bit instructions (4-10 on average)in x86. A system call has the following properties. It Executes far more instructions, it has to freeze a process instead of simply the stack state. The timing involved is mostly non-deterministic. It is often a scheduling spot, and the scheduler may choose to reschedule. For these three primitive reasons (there are probably more), one should reduce the amount of system calls where possible -- e.g., networked system software keeps socket handles (and other application specific internal data structures used by a connection) around to assign to new connection, why bother the kernel ? Remember that software is built like a upside down pyramid. System calls are at the base.
