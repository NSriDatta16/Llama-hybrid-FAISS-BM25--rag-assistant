The quick and dirty way to do it is just transfer a file to the client and have it send it back. What you will need to do is have a file of known size, download it to the client, take the filesize/time to transfer and that is your download speed. Do the reverse process to get the upload speed. It is a good idea to have a file at least a few MB in size so it can average out the peeks and valleys in the transfer.
