You probably want a code fragment more like this: double number; do { printf("Enter a double: "); scanf("%*c"); // burn stdin so as not to buffer up responses } while (1 != scanf("%lf", &number)); However as Jonathan has pointed out, some better line-by-line parsing may be better. Scanning directly from stdin this way isn't intuitive to the user.
