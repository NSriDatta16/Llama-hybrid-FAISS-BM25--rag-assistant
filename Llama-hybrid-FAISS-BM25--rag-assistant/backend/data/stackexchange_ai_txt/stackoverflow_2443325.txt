Java: How to get Unicode name of a character (or its type category)?

The Character class in Java defines methods which check a given char argument for equality with certain Unicode chars or for belonging to some type category. These chars and type categories are named. As stated in given javadoc, examples for named chars are HORIZONTAL TABULATION , FORM FEED , ...; example for named type categories are SPACE_SEPARATOR , PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR , ... However, being byte or int values instead of enums, the name of these types are "hidden" at runtime. So, is there a possibility to get characters' and/or type categories' names at runtime?
