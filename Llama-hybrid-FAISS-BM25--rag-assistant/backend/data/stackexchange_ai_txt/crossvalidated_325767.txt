The backshift operator is just that, an operator. It is not the solution to any equation. It is an operation defined on a time series, in the same way that we define the mean of a time series or the variance of a time series, and its definition is: $BX_t = X_{t-1}$ Applying it to your series: $$X_t = at^2+bt+c+Y_{t-1}$$ We get: $$BX_t = a(t-1)^2+b(t-1)+c+BY_{t-1}$$ $$= at^2 + (b- 2a)t+ a-b+c+Y_{t-2}$$ The best way to understand differencing is as a discrete equivalent to differentiating for continuous variables. In the case of the example you give, the series has a quadratic trend, so you would have to difference it twice to make it stationary.
