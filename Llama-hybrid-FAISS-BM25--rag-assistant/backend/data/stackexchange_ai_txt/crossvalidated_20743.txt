The difference is not the mathematical expression, but rather what you are measuring. Mean squared error measures the expected squared distance between an estimator and the true underlying parameter: $$\text{MSE}(\hat{\theta}) = E\left[(\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2\right].$$ It is thus a measurement of the quality of an estimator. The mean squared prediction error measures the expected squared distance between what your predictor predicts for a specific value and what the true value is: $$\text{MSPE}(L) = E\left[\sum_{i=1}^n\left(g(x_i) - \widehat{g}(x_i)\right)^2\right].$$ It is thus a measurement of the quality of a predictor. The most important thing to understand is the difference between a predictor and an estimator. An example of an estimator would be taking the average height a sample of people to estimate the average height of a population. An example of a predictor is to average the height of an individual's two parents to guess his specific height. They are thus solving two very different problems.
