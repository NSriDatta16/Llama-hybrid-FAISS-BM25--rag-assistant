It looks like your survey 2 is a convenience sample. I don't know what it can be useful for. Without a clear sampling strategy, you cannot generalize to the population in any meaningful way. At best, you might be able to utilize Survey 2 to build a model of how variables are interrelated, and then try to improve your estimates from Survey 1 using some sort of generalized regression estimation but to get there, you need to make sure your sample is not biased. For instance, suppose you want to predict how much income taxes can be collected in the economy. Suppose you use something like the US Current Population Survey as your survey 1. This is a very well designed survey, with weights, poststratification, bells and whistles, whatever have you. Then you also have a survey that you hand out in the local unemployment offices, and only hope that most people will write something in. This is your survey 2. You don't know how well it reaches to your population -- in all likelihood, you are more likely to reach those who are seeking jobs more actively, and show up in the local offices more often. You won't reach the frustrated workers who quit looking for a job, or those who are not eligible for the unemployment benefits but would be looking for a job otherwise, some seasonal workers, and a number of other people. You don't know any of that though: somebody just handed you Survey 2 and said, "This is our rich data base, make sense out of it". Well, this is a biased sample to begin with. If you fit a regression model of individual's earnings using this data set, you will likely get wrong estimates: the sample censors out those with higher earnings in full time, permanent jobs, and probably has way more people with low education than there are in general population. So what's the use of Survey 2 for you? As I said, I doubt it has much value in this purpose. It is not helping at all that you give zero background information about what the survey is about, what sampling units are, etc. I understand that you are probably bound by your employer, or your client, or whatever form of supervisor you have. But without more detail, all we can give you is some sort of handwaving advice. I can point you to technical literature about combining information from several surveys (using Bayesian or empirical likelihood methods), but I am not sure it will help much at this point.
