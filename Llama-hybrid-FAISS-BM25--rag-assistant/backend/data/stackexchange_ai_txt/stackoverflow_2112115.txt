Prova 3.0 http://www.prova.ws is nearing completion. It is, however, not just another Prolog but a mix of programming styles, particularly, useful for easy bi-directional Java integration, reactive agent programming, integration with ESB's, workflow logic, and event processing. This version is a complete rewrite from zero so some older features, like OWL integration, are missing, but are bound to return in the next revision.
