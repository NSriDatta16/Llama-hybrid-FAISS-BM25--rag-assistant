There is a contribution to the Lucene project called "wordnet". According to its documentation : This package uses synonyms defined by WordNet to build a Lucene index storing them, which in turn can be used for query expansion. You normally run Syns2Index once to build the query index/"database", and then call SynExpand.expand(...) to expand a query. It includes a sample of what it does: If you pass in the query "big dog" then it prints out: Query: big adult^0.9 bad^0.9 bighearted^0.9 boastful^0.9 boastfully^0.9 bounteous^0.9 bountiful^0.9 braggy^0.9 crowing^0.9 freehanded^0.9 giving^0.9 grown^0.9 grownup^0.9 handsome^0.9 large^0.9 liberal^0.9 magnanimous^0.9 momentous^0.9 openhanded^0.9 prominent^0.9 swelled^0.9 vainglorious^0.9 vauntingly^0.9 dog andiron^0.9 blackguard^0.9 bounder^0.9 cad^0.9 chase^0.9 click^0.9 detent^0.9 dogtooth^0.9 firedog^0.9 frank^0.9 frankfurter^0.9 frump^0.9 heel^0.9 hotdog^0.9 hound^0.9 pawl^0.9 tag^0.9 tail^0.9 track^0.9 trail^0.9 weenie^0.9 wiener^0.9 wienerwurst^0.9 You see that the original words ("big" and "dog") have no weighting attached to them. The synonyms, however, have a weighting (0.9) that you can configure yourself. It comes bundled with the standard distribution of Lucene, in the "contrib" directory.
