I'd use two iterations over the tree, although it's probably possible in one. First iteration: get rid of your NOT Nodes by walking through the tree and using De Morgan's law ( wikipedia link ) and remove double negation wherever applicable. Second iteration (the NOT are now only directly before a leaf node) Go through your tree: Case "AND NODE": fine, inspect the children Case "OR NODE": if there is a child which is neither a Leaf nor a NOT node apply the distributive law. start from parent of current node again else fine, inspect children After that you should be done.
