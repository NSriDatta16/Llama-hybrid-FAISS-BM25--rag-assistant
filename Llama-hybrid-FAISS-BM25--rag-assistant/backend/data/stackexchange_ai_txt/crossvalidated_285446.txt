How can I formulate a "choose 1 from N" problem into a machine learning model?

Lets say I have a set of N items, and I want to choose the best one. Each item is represented using 6 feature. I could fix N but it would be nice if it can vary. The "best choice" might depends on what other item is present in the set Is there a way to formulate it?
