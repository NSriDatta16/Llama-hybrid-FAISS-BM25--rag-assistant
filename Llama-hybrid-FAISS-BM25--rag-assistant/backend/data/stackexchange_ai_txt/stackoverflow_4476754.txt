Magento - Multistore implementation

Im looking at switching to Magento for a project im going to start. I was wondering if i could get a bit of advice regarding the Multi-Store implementation. Does this allow seperate admin users for each store? Would you recommend this implementation for a small hosted ecommerce application? Cheers,
