To track your progress, I would recommend using a $p$-chart. The chart tracks your percentages of non-conforming (in your case you can use the percentage of the ranking) along with upper and lower control limits which vary based upon sample size. (This is because 25% out of 200 entries is very different than 25% of 4 entries.) The basic chart is based upon a time series of your position and the total number or entries. The plotted point is the fraction nonconforming: $$p=\frac{np}{n}$$ where $n$ is the total number and $np$ is the number nonconforming or in your example $$.765=\frac{153}{200}$$ As your position improves, your fraction nonconforming is reduced. The centerline is then calculated as the average of all of the $p$ values: $$\overline{p}=\frac{\Sigma n p }{\Sigma n}$$ Control limits are calculated and plotted for each unit of time. The formula is: $$CL=\overline{p}\pm \frac{3\sqrt{\overline{p}\left(1-\overline{p}\right)}}{\sqrt{n}}$$ Control limits are at a default of $\pm 3 s$; if you would like to plot limits at each standard deviation away from the centerline, simply multiply the previously calculated control limits by $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$ or by simply changing the leading $3$ in the fraction to nothing or a 2, depending on if you want to plot one or two standard deviations away. In your case, you would like to improve from where you are now and not maintain some constant score. As a result, having data points "out of control" or in a definite trend in a desired direction would be a good thing. Once you are playing at a level you want to maintain, you should recalculate your $\overline{p}$and move forward from that point. If you would prefer to use a fraction conforming chart, simply subtract the above values from $1$. If you are interested in other charting options, I would suggest refering to Quality Control by Dale H. Besterfield.
