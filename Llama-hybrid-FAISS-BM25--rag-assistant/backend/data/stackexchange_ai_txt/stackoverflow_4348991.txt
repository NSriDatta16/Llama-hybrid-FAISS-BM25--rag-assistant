Since you can't change the behaviour of either the GZip compression in IIS or get your client to upgrade to a new OS, why not conditionally turn off GZip compression for specific user agent strings. On Apache you could use mod rewrite to do this ( see here ) with some lines like: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP:User-Agent} MSIE\ [56] RewriteCond %{HTTP:User-Agent} !SV1 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(css|js)$ RewriteHeader Accept-Encoding: .* $1 This server fault thread indicates that you can use ISAPI Rewrite to use the same directives and get the same result. It looks like these directives would be supported by the free "Lite" version too, so you won't have to buy any licenses.
