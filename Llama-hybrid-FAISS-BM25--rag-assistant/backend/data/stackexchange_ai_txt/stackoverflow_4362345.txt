I was finally able to achieve tremendous performance gains simply by querying the database in a much more efficient way. For example, in building up an array of information, I was previously querying the database for each row that I required with a "WHERE _id = n" type selector. But in doing it this way, I was issuing a dozen or more queries, one at a time. Instead, I now build up a list of IDs that are required, then get them all with a single query of the form "WHERE _id IN (n1, n2, n3, ...)" and iterate through the returned cursor. Doing this and some other structure optimizations, the largest database is now almost as quick to view as the more average case.
