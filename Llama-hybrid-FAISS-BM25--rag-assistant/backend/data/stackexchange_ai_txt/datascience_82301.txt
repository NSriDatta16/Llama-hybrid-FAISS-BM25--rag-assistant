Can a novelty detection model overfit?

Can a novelty detection model overfit? In novelty detection, the model is trained on normal data instances (not polluted by outliers) where no labels are used in the training process, while validated and tested on a data instances that contain outliers in them. An example of algorithms that can be used for novelty detection are one-class SVM (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF).
