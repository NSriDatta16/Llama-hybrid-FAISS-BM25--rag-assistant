What do you want to do : - Make forecasting of each of the time serie independently? - Make forecasting of one time series and then determine the values of the other one? In any case this reference will help you a lot : http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207006000021 What is the length of your time series (meaning how much data do you have)? What is the horizon of forecasting (meaning do you want to make 1 day, 1 month or 1 year ahead prediction)? By looking at your data, I would say that there is no obvious trend of seasonality, to look at a longer time series would help to be sure, to see if there's any seasonality or trend, plot the autocorrelation function (you can find lot of stuff about it). For both of your time series, they look like a random walk except maybe for the peak, it depend of what you want to model. If you're interested of modeling the right amount of peak in your data without being precise on the other value beetween the peak, use a count process (poisson process) or maybe a threshold model. If you want to model the other value, then autoregressive model could be a solution. You can use time series analysis even if there is no trend in your data. Support Vector Machine are maybe a little too complex for the kind of time series you have, but it could be an interesting to dig into it, if you have time to spend on it.
