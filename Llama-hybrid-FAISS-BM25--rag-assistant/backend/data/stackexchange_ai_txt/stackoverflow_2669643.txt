Yes, you should probably paste the hex dump here. It could be the fact that the checksum is wrong. Unlike UDP, I believe ICMP (ping) checksum is not optional and should be correct. This is also what I got from RFC 792 . If you want to use WinPcap with .NET, you can use Pcap.Net , which will allow you to create and send any ICMP packet by writing very few lines of code.
