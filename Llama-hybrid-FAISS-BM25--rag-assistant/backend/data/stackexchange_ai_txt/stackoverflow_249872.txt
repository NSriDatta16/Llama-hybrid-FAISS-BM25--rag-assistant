You don't test private functions. There are ways to use reflection to get into private methods and properties. But that isn't really easy and I strongly discourage this practice. You simply shouldn't test anything that's not public. If you have some internal methods and properties, you should consider either changing that to public, or to ship your tests with the app (something I don't really see as a problem). If your customer is able to run a Test-Suite and see that the code you delivered is actually "working", I don't see this as a problem (as long as you don't give away your IP through this). Things I include in every release are test-reports and code coverage reports.
