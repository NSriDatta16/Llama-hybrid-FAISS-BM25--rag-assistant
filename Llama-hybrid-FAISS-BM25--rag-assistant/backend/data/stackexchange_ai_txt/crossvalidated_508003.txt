A useful reference is "Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences" by Jacob Cohen. Chapter 8, about ANOVA, is available via google https://books.google.ch/books?id=rEe0BQAAQBAJ&&pg=PA273 or other online sources. The value for Cohen's f resembles Cohen's d Cohen's d is the ratio of the difference between two population means and the population variance: $$d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma}$$ Cohen's f generalizes to more than two populations and is the ratio of the difference between the population means (in terms of their variance) and the variance/deviation of the populations. $$ f = \frac{\sigma_ \mu}{\sigma}$$ You can relate these variances roughly with the sum of squares. $$\sigma_\mu^2 \approx SS_{between}/n$$ and $$\sigma^2 \approx SS_{within}/n$$ Such that $$f^2 \approx \frac{SS_{between}}{SS_{within}}$$ You do get some discrepancies because the computation of an average square (using the denominator $n$ ) is not an unbiased estimator for the variances $\sigma_\mu$ and $\sigma$ , and instead you could use some correction terms (which becomes complex for unequal groups ) but they will not have a large effect. F-statistic and F-test You do have a related term the F-statistic and this is computed as $$F = \frac{SS_{between}/(I-1)}{SS_{within}/(n-I)}$$ where $n$ is the number of observations and $I$ the number of groups. This is not the same as Cohen's f. The numerator $SS_{between}/(I-1)$ relates to the random observed sample variance for the group means given a null hypothesis where the effect is null (absent), $\sigma_\mu = 0$ . In that case the error in the group means is solely due to a random effect and is distributed with a variance that decreases as $n$ is larger. Overall you will have that, given the null hypothesis $\sigma_\mu = 0$ is true, this between error is distributed as a chi-squared variable $SS_{between} \sim \chi^2_{I-1}$ independent of the sample size $n$ (as $n$ grows, the increase in the number of term/squares that are summed will cancel with the decreasing size of those terms/squares). However, in case there is an effect $\sigma_\mu \neq 0$ , then the $SS_{between}$ will grow roughly linear with $n$ and so you have to divide by $n$ and use the average $SS_{between}$ . (it will follow approximately a noncentral chi-squared distribution and exactly when the populations are normal distributed)
