A cross between std::multimap and std::vector?

I'm looking for a STL container that works like std::multimap, but has constant access time to random n-th element. I need this because I have such structure in memory that is std::multimap for many reasons, but items stored in it have to be presented to the user in a listbox. Since amount of data is huge, I'm using list box with virtual items (i.e. list control polls for value at line X). As a workaround I'm currently using additional std::vector to store "indexes" into std::map, and I fill it like this: std::vector vec; for (MMap::iterator it = mmap.begin(); it != mmap.end(); ++it) vec.push_back((*it).second); But this is not very elegant solution. Is there some such containter?
