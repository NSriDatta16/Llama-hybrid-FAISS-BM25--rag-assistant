Study this first: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process From "finding one planet does not help at all with finding planets of other stars in the same part of the sky," you can model $N(t)$, the number of planets found up to time $t$, as a Poisson process. So, $N(t)$ has distribution $\text{Poisson}(\lambda t)$. I suggest you to measure time in months. From "Audrey is good at it, and finds one planet at a time, on average once every three months," you can figure out the value of $\lambda$, and from the properties of the $\textrm{Poisson}(\lambda \cdot 24)$ distribution you can "find the expected value and standard deviation of the number of planets she will find in the next two years." As you've studied in the Wikipedia page, for the Poisson process the intervals between events (finding a new planet) have independent exponential distributions with parameter $\lambda$. The sum of $k$ of these independent exponentials has distribution $\textrm{Gamma}(k,\lambda)$, which gives you "the expected value and standard deviation of the amount of time until she is eligible for that prize."
