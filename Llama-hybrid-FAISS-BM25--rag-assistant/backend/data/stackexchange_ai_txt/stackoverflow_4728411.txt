java EE installation and setup

I need to develop a simple email client in Java. I will be using JavaMail APIs of Java EE. I installed NetBeans that supports Java EE from this site: http://netbeans.org/downloads/ If I select the option of creating a Java EE application while creating project, I dont get the drag-n-drop feature of creating GUI with swings. And if I select Java Desktop Application I get the GUI building features but then Java EE libraries are not available. How can I use these two simultaneously? Also, the NetBeans installer seems to install Java EE SDK. In which folder is this SDK installed? I have experience of using Java SE but I am totally new to Java EE. Please help me.
