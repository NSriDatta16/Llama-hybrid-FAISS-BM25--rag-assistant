Running Azure application on a local development environment got extreamly slow

Problem: I have a Azure project. The problem is that when I run the application it takes like 10-15 minutes to actually open the page in browser. The page & debugging works normaly. Project: using VS 2008 Version 9.030729.1 SP Solution (7 projects) â€¢ Hitrarisma (Azure configuration project) HitraPisma.DataAccess (c# class) HitraPisma.WebRole (asp.net mvc 1.0) HitraPisma.WorkerRole PrintPreview (c# dll) StorageClient (c# dll) TestPrintPreview (c# windows test app for testing PrintPreview dll) CPU is low, memory is plenty - what could be wrong? I guess the azure Service configuration is fine if everything works. Any pointers are more than welcome. Tnx, Tom
