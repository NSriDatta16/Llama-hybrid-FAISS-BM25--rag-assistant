Glue time series back together

I have a long time series whose distribution I don't know. I take snapshot of a fix window at random places of the time series to get a set of equal length shorter time series. Now without the help of the longer time series, what are some of the methods that can help me glue the time series back together ? assume the set of short time series covers all points of the long one, and there are overlaps between the short time series.
