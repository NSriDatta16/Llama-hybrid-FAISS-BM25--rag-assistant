I've been having the same problem for a few days. It seems as though this error can be caused by so many different issues, so it's a shame Apple don't elaborate the error with an email. For me, the solution was to not use "Application Loader" at all! Instead do the following within Xcode: Select your application go to Build > Build & Archive Once this is complete, go to Window > Organizer Select your application under "Archived Applications" Click'Validate' If the validation is a success (as mine was): click 'Submit'. This will then submit the application to apple. For me, after a few seconds the status was changed to 'Waiting for review' rather than 'Invalid Binary'.
