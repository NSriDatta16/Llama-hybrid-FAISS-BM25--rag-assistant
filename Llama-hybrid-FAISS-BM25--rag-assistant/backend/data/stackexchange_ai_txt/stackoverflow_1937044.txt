If it gives you a 404 it's likely because the feed generator checks your user-agent or similar, and then responds 404 when it doesn't meet the requirements. I agree with Marc: Use a WebRequest and check the response, it should be a 301 or 302 (Permanent or temporary redirect) and it will contain the target url then. If your response code isn't 301 or 302, then it's not redirecting you - again this could be caused by a user-agent check serverside.
