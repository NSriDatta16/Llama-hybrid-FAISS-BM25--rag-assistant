Yes - Production data should be used. The highest quality, newest data should be used to train a machine learning model. Typically, new data is used to fine-tune existing models. No - Training should be done in its own separate environment. A full-trained model then is moved into development, staging, and production environments for prediction-only (aka, inference). Training requirements are very different than prediction requirements. The goal of training is to find the best algorithm/architecture, hyperparameters, and parameters. The goal of prediction is to apply that solution to solve a user's problem. A prediction-only system will include many other features, including safeguards and fallback options. Not applicable, see see above.
