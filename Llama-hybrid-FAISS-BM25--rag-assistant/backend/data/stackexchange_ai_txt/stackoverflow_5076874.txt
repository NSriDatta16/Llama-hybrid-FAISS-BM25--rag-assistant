Good day people, the SSL/TLS technology is a security technology. Its goal is to protect the user from having his/her information (credit card, address, tel number...) being stolen by a hacker. The SSL certificate will protect the website and each person who connects on the website will be sure to have a secured environment. The quality of the security depends on the type of certificate installed on the website in question, whether it is DV (Domain Validation), OV (Organization Validation), EV (Extended Validation), if the SGC technology is present or not. If you have any other questions, you can have more details here .
