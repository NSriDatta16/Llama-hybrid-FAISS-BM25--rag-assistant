How to check assumptions for time series linear regression?

So, I am checking the assumptions for my time series data. I also did this test and it seems to reject the null hypotheses. Then, to check the equal variances, I made a box plot. So, I found that for age variable, all the groups have non-similar variances. So, how am I supposed to conclude the equal variances of the entire data? For outliers, I made a box plot too. I found that only variable age has an outlier. So, how to fix this? And, what plot should I use to check the linearity for this time series data?
