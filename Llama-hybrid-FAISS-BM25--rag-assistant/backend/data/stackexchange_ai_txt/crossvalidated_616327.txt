Decomposing the weight based on stages of sampling/nonresponse The overall weight for a person is meant to represent the overall probability that a person in your target population had of taking the survey, accounting for random sampling as well as the probability that they responded to the survey, given that you asked them to. To determine this overall probability for person $i$ , denoted $p_i$ , we have to break the survey process into four distinct stages, each of which impacts the probability someone had of taking the survey. Stages: Random selection to invite a person to join the panel. $p_{1,i}$ Joining or declining to join the panel, given that they were selected $p_{2|1,i}$ Random selection of panel members who are requested to complete the particular survey, given that they joined the panel $p_{3|2,i}$ Response or nonresponse to the particular survey $p_{4|3,i}$ , given that you requested that they complete the survey As the survey designer, you control the random selection probabilities (stages 1 and 3) but you don't control the response/nonresponse probabilities (stages 2 and 4). The overall probability for individual $i$ is thus: $$ p_i = p_{1,i} \times p_{2|1,i} \times p_{3|2,i} \times p_{4|3,i} $$ The weight for this person is then $w_i = 1/p_i$ . This weight is used to make sure that your estimates aren't biased as a result of oversampling some groups or because of some groups being more or less likely to take the survey. It's common practice though to further adjust this weight using raking adjustments, which can help further reduce nonresponse bias as well as potentially reduce other kinds of bias such as coverage error. Determining Stage-specific Probabilities Because you designed the survey, you should know the value of $p_{1,i}$ and $p_{3|2,i}$ for everyone in your sample. For the stages of nonresponse, you have to estimate response propensities: that is, you have to estimate $p_{2|1,i}$ and $p_{4|3,i}$ . Common approaches include logistic regression or using observed response rates for key demographic groups (e.g., if a person is from a racial/ethnic group with a 15% response rate, then you estimate that person's response propensity to be 15%). This R package vignette gives an example of how to estimate response propensities and do weighting adjustments in R. https://bschneidr.github.io/svrep/articles/nonresponse-adjustments.html References Chapter 2 of “Applied Survey Data Analysis” provides an excellent overview of survey weighting to account for sampling probabilities and nonresponse.
