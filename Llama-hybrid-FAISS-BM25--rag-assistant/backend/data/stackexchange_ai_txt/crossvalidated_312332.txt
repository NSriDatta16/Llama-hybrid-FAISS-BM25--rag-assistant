about "fracture" issue of non-regularized autoencoders

In Page 12 of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05644.pdf , they mentioned that a drawback of non-regularized autoencoders is: "but it is widely known that non-regularized autoencoders “fracture” the manifold into many different domains which result in very different codes for similar images [Hinton]" They did not provide reference in the paper and I searched it in Google but did not find related information. Could anyone provide any links or papers on this issue? Thanks!
