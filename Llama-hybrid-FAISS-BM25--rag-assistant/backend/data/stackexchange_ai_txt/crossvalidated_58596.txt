Types of regression that might work on small samples

I know that this kind of discussion might be both a silly...very silly and a hot issue simultaneously...but I thought it would be nice to raise it : Which types of linear AND non-linear regression could be recommended when you have a small sample size (e.g. 50-70 records) and you want to predict a continuous outcome from 5-7 predictors (both categorical and continuous). Can k-fold cross-validated stepwise linear regression OR Partial Least Regression be a remedy to this problem? Are boosted trees OR Neural networks just insane even to think about them? Your responses are GREATLY WELCOMED and VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU!
