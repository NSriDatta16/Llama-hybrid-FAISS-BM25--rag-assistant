If you are using some simple rules to determine if a project is active or inactive ("no activity in one year, 0 contributors etc"), you don't really need to use machine learning to predict the outcome of those rules. You can just apply the rules directly to the new data points. What machine learning could be used for is to predict beforehand which projects will be labeled as inactive with your rule system. In business churn models are used to predict which customers might become inactive in the future. A simple churn model could output the probability that a project will have any activity within the next one month. This approach is not able to use the data on the projects that have been labeled as inactive by the users. It could still be used as one of the features, but I would avoid using it as the only training data as it does not sound very reliable source of information.
