This would give you the ability to do simplify your GameMap by removing the paintComponent(...) public class GameMap extends JPanel{ private JEditorPane status; private GameBoard board; public GameMap() { status= createStatusTextPane(); board = new GameBoard(); this.setLayout(new BoxLayout(this,BoxLayout.PAGE_AXIS)); this.add(board); this.add(status); } //...all of the other stuff in the class // note that you don't have to do anything special for painting in this class } And then your GameBoard might look like public class GameBoard extends JPanel { //...all of the other stuff in the class public void paintComponent(Graphics g) { for (int row = 0; row
