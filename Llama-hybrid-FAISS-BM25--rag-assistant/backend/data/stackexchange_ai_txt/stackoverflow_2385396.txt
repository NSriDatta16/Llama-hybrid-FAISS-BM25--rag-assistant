I don't know what is causing this, but you could drop Gears for the Chrome browser. What Gears used to provide (location & local storage) is now part of HTML 5. Google have "end of life'd" Gears. Chrome supports HTML5 (up to date versions anyway) http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html
