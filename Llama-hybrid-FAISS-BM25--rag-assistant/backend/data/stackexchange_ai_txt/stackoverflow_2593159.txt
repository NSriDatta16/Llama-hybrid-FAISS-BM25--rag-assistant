Assigning figure size to a figure with a given handle (MATLAB)

is there a way to assign the outerposition property of a figure to a figure with a given handle? For example, if I wanted to define a figure as say figure 1, I would use: figure(1) imagesc(Arrayname) % I.e. any array I can also change the properties of a figure using the code: figure('Name', 'Name of figure','NumberTitle','off','OuterPosition',[scrsz(1) scrsz(2) 700 700]); Is there a propertyname I can use to assign the outerposition property to the figure assigned as figure 1? The reason I am asking this is because I am using a command called save2word (from the MATLAB file exchange) to save some plots from a function I have made to a word file, and I want to limit the number of figures I have open as it does this. The rest of the code I have is: plottedloops = [1, 5:5:100]; % Specifies which loops I want to save GetGeometry = getappdata(0, 'GeometryAtEachLoop') % Obtains a 4D array containing geometry information at each loop NumSections = size(GetGeometry,4); %Defined by the fourth dimension of the 4D array for j = 1:NumSections for i = 1:plottedloops P = GetGeometry(:,:,i,j); TitleSize = 14; Fsize = 8; % Save Geometry scrsz = get(0,'ScreenSize'); %left, bottom, width height figure('Name', 'Geometry at each loop','NumberTitle','off','OuterPosition',[scrsz(1) scrsz(2) 700 700]); This specifies the figure name, dims etc., but also means multiple figures are opened as the command runs. % I have tried this, but it doesn't work: % figure(0, 'OuterPosition',[scrsz(1) scrsz(2) 700 700]); imagesc(P), title('Geometry','FontSize', TitleSize), axis([0 100 0 100]); text(20,110,['Loop:',num2str(i)], 'FontSize', TitleSize); % Show loop in figure text(70,110,['Section:',num2str(j)], 'FontSize', TitleSize);% Show Section number in figure save2word('Geometry at each loop'); % Saves figure to a word file end end Thanks
