Yes, your intuition is correct. See this source, Property 4. It follows from the Markov chain property, i.e. If we have a markov chain of the following form: $$X\rightarrow Y\rightarrow Z$$ then, $$I(X; Z)\leq I(X;Y)$$ This can be specialized to $Z=f(Y)$ . The same property can be applied for the other random variable, $X$ , as well, and you get $$I(X;Y)\geq I(f(X);g(Y))$$ in general, and letting $f=g$ yields what you ask.
