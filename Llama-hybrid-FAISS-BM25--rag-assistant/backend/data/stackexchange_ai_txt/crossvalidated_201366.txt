help for interpreting svm graph

I have been following a tutorial about SVM with a dataset for OCR located in: https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/letterdata.csv So far I have done the following: letters and I have obtained a graph like the following: So far I know that the X are the support vectors, but what does this graph shows? The values xbox and onpix refers to the size of box x and the onpix to the number of pixels each box has. Is there other way to plot the results of the svm in a more meaningful way?
