You need to implement the onKeyDown and onKeyUp method in your activity and return true for each of your required buttons: @Override public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) { switch(keyCode) { case KEYCODE_BACK: case KEYCODE_CALL: return true; } return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event); } @Override public boolean onKeyUp(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) { switch(keyCode) { case KEYCODE_BACK: case KEYCODE_CALL: return true; } return super.onKeyUp(keyCode, event); } The above however will only intercept the back button and block it . Please note that for security reasons you are not able to block certain hardware buttons. This includes ENDCALL and HOME. The way the application TheftAware does this is likely to be by leveraging some unintended functionality in the NDK.
