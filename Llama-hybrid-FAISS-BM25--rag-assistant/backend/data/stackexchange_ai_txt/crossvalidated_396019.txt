Matching the size of the flattened convolution layer with the 1st FC layer size

Suppose that the size of the last convolution layer or max pooling layer in a neural network was NxNxM. What would be the size of the corresponding flattened layer? I thought it would be, well, 1x1x(N*N*M). Looking at the VGG16 network , and I'm a bit confused now. The last max pooling layer of VGG16 is 7x7x512, but the drawing seems to indicate that the flattened layer is 1x1x4096. Maybe I misread the drawing, maybe the flattened layer is 1x1x(7*7*512)=1x1x25088, and 1x1x4096 is the 1st FC layer? I doubt that: full connectivity from 25088 to 4096 neurons would require 102760448 weights (not including bias). Could you clarify for me what I'm seeing wrong there?
