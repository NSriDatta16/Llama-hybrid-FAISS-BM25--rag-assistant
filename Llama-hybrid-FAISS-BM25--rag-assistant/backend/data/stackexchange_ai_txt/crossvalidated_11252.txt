Weight variables for predictive model

I received a question today that I wasn't exactly sure how to answer. I have built a predictive model using a fairly basic logistic regression that works pretty well and fits our business needs. Recently, we purchased a CRM tool that allows us to build "probability" scores, but only allows the end users to give integer weights to various factors. Said differently, one can arbitrarily assign a weight of 10 points to one factor and -5 points to another with the sum of all weights representing the "probability" for a given entity in our database. What I am looking to do is translate my model to this new format such that the resulting score equals the calculated probability from my logistic model. This is not out of desire, but business needs. Admittedly I am not sure how to use the calculated coefficients and "adjust" them to these requirements. What is the best approach, if any? General thoughts on how to assign statistically valid integer weights to business criteria given these constraints? Any thoughts or insight will be very much appreciated.
