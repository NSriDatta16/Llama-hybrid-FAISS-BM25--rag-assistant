I assume that you have raised this question in context of frequency argument while modeling the time series using some tool, say R. The interpretation of frequency for time series packages is generally 'the number of observations in a series if you consider the natural time interval of measurement'. For example, if you measure value of some variable once in a month, and you have data for multiple years, you can use value of 12 for frequency. But things get tricky where there could be multiple levels of seasonality. For example, if you measure number of visitors to a web page every hour, there will be seasonality by hour as well as by day. Bottom line is, very hard to tell you one single number purely based on information that you have given. You can study Rob J. Hyndman's blog post "Seasonal periods" for more details.
