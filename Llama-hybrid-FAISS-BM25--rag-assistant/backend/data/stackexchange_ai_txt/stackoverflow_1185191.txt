Sounds like your needs are so specific (since you want hyphenation) that you will most likely not be satisfied with a generic solution. I would suggest splitting your text in words and add those individually to a line, splitting on hyphens if necessary, and then move to the next line when full. If you work with fragments larger than a single word, your code will most likely end up very messy. I believe the method to do this will fit on a single page. I can strongly recommend using test driven development to write such a library method.
