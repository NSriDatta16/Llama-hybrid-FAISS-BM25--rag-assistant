[Option 2 is] NOT the most normalized option [as @Ray claims]. The most normalized would have no nullable fields and obviously option 2 would require a null on every row. At this point in your design you have to think about the usage, the queries you'll do, the reports you'll write. Will you want to do math on all of the numeric responses at the same time? i.e. WHERE numeric_response IS NOT NULL? Probably unlikely. More likely would be, What's the average response WHERE Question = 11. In those cases you can either choose the INT table or the INT column and neither would be easier to do than the other. If you did do two tables, you'd more than likely be constantly unioning them together for questions like, what % of questions have a response etc. Can you see how the questions you ask your database to answer start to drive the design?
