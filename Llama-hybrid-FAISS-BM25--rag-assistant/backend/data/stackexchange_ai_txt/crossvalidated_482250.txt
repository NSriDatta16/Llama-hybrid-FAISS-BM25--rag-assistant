If it works, why not? Define your objective and run the model on historical data to predict future. If predictive performance metrics show satisfying results, your method is good! You're not using future unobserved data to predict future. Also you're not performing stats like pvalues to need any assumptions to hold. so your method is legit. Note to use probability models not just classification models such as SVM since your outcome of interest is not common! You can determine probbility of fraud, can't detect it. The signal to noise ratio in your problem is very low, in which case classification methods usually fail badly!
