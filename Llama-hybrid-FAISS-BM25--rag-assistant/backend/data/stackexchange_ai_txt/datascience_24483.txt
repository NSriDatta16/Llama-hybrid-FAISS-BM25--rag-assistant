Best way to store financial data together with news

My question is if there is a DBMS that allows storing financial data (i.e. timestamp+value) together with small text fragments. These small fragments will not be very long, but it might help an algorithm to predict changes in the future. In summary, I wonder if you can suggest me what it is the best way to massively store timestamps+numeric value+(optional)text fragment. Thank you in advance.
