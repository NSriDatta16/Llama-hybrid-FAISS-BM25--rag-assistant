reading value of node that has a specific attribute with Xdocument

Im trying to write a List of 'Documents' from an XML string, but i was wondering what is the best way to get the value of a node of certain attribute. More specifically in the sample I would like to set the value of aDocument.Source to the text "The Source" of the "field" node that has the "Source" value for the "name" attribute. Sample XML: 3 129793 Some Title 2009-07-03 2009-07-03 14:45:00 The Source Area The Source Some Organisation Some Summary Sample Code protected override List GetDocuments(string xmlString) { //Parse the string XDocument xDocument = XDocument.Parse(xmlString); //Create a List of Document objects, from the doc xml element. List documents = (from doc in xDocument.Descendants("doc") select new Document { DocId = Convert.ToInt32(doc.Element("docid").Value), DocTitle = doc.Element("doctitle").Value, DocDateTime = DateTime.Parse(doc.Element("docdate").Value), DocSummary = doc.Element("summary").Value, DocBody = "", DocUrl = doc.Element("docid").Value, Source = "" //CODE NEEDED } ).ToList (); return documents; }
