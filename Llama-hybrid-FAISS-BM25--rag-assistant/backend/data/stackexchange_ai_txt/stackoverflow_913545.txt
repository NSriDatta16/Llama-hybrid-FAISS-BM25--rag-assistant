Changing newid() to newsequentialid() on an existing table

At the moment we have a number of tables that are using newid() on the primary key. This is causing large amounts of fragmentation. So I would like to change the column to use newsequentialid() instead. I imagine that the existing data will remain quite fragmented but the new data will be less fragmented. This would imply that I should perhaps wait some time before changing the PK index from non-clustered to clustered. My question is, does anyone have experience doing this? Is there anything I have overlooked that I should be careful of?
