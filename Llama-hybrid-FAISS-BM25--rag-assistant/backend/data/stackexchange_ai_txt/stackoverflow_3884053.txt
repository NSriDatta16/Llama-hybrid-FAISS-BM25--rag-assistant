I would do it like this: public static class AgentDescriptions { public static int P1 { get; private set; } public static int P2 { get; private set; } public static void Initialize(int AgencyId) { P1 = GetIDFromDB(AgencyId); P2 = GetIDFromDB(AgencyId); } } If you want to lock it so Initialize can only be called once, then you can easily just use a flag that throws an exception (or whatever) after Initialize has been called.
