This is a literal string initializer for a character array: char arr[] = "literal string initializer"; Could also be: char* str = "literal string initializer"; Definition from K&R2: A string literal, also called a string constant, is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes as in "...". A string has type ``array of characters'' and storage class static (see Par.A.3 below) and is initialized with the given characters. Whether identical string literals are distinct is implementation-defined, and the behavior of a program that attempts to alter a string literal is undefined.
