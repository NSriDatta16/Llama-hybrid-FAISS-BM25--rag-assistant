Overriding OnMouseClick, OnMouseDown, or OnMouseUp would be the way to go. The MouseEventArgs class can contains members which will help you figure out which button(s) were pressed. Dragging is a different animal altogether. You need to override the OnDragEnter and OnDragDrop methods, and you will also need to initiate the drag-drop operation by calling DoDragDrop at the appropriate time.
