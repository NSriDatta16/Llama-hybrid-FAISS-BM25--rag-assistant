Is there an elegant way to test if one instance method is an alias for another?

In a unit test I need to test whether alias methods defined by alias_method have been properly defined. I could simply use the same tests on the aliases used for their originals, but I'm wondering whether there's a more definitive or efficient solution. For instance, is there a way to 1) dereference a method alias and return its original's name, 2) get and compare some kind of underlying method identifier or address, or 3) get and compare method definitions? For example: class MyClass def foo # do something end alias_method :bar, :foo end describe MyClass do it "method bar should be an alias for method foo" do m = MyClass.new # ??? identity(m.bar).should == identity(m.foo) ??? end end Suggestions?
