User of Nested class is depending upon the scenario like below. 1) Organizing code into real world situations where there is a special relationship between two objects. 2) Hiding a class within another class so that you do not want the inner class to be used from outside of the class it is created within. Suppose you have 2 classes called A and B and class B is depending upon class A without class A you cannot use class B @ that scenario you can use nested classes As per my knowledge DataRow class is nested class for DataTable i.e you cannot create a DataRow Class untill u declare a object of DataTable class
