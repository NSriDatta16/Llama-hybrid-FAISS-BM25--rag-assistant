I don't have Excel 2007 to test, but I'll give it a shot: = AVERAGEIF($A$2:$A$100, ">=" & (TODAY()-6), $C$2:$C$100) I assume the "last 7 days" means compared to TODAY(), not compared to some other row of data? Use NOW() instead of TODAY() and "-7" instead of "-6" if you want time sensitivity, not just looking at today and anything back up to 6 days ago (i.e., a total of 7 days). If each row of data should have an average of the past 7 days compared to itself rather than compared to today (i.e., you want a different rolling average in each row), use something like: = AVERAGEIF($A$2:$A$100, ">=" & ($A2-7), $C$2:$C$100) in row 2 and paste down, the $A2 will adjust to use the reference point of the current row's date/time. If the dates are sorted already, you can optimize the formula by using $A2 and $C2 instead of $A$100 and $C$100 (pasting down will increase the range for each additional row).
