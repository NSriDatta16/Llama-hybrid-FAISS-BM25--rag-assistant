Get count from join table - EFCodeFirst

So I've recently began checking on ASP.NET MVC3 and EFCodeFirst and have gotten stuck. I have 2 Models: Person: [Bind(Exclude = "PersonID")] public class Person { public int PersonID { get; set; } [Required(ErrorMessage="Given name is a required field")] [DisplayName("Given name")] public string GivenName { get; set; } [Required(ErrorMessage="Family name is a required field")] [DisplayName("family name")] public string FamilyName { get; set; } [Required(ErrorMessage = "Birthdate is a required field")] [DisplayFormat(DataFormatString = "{0:d}")] public DateTime Birthdate { get; set; } [DisplayName("Ingredient")] public virtual Ingredient Ingredient { get; set; } } and Ingredient: public class Ingredient { public int IngredientID { get; set; } [Required(ErrorMessage = "Ingredient is a required field")] public string Name { get; set; } public virtual ICollection Persons { get; set; } } Now the point is that Ingredient is a semi-fixed table (only business users can add ingredients, but that's a different story) and a person can input his/her data and his/her favorite ingredient. This all works fine but I wanted to create a top 10 of ingredients by joining the 2 tables, and then performing a group by, order by, count and limit (to 10 for example). The issue here is that I've tried several things and just can't get it to work. I'm quite new to LINQ and can't get my head on how to do this. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Edit: To specify once more, I just need the equivalent of the following query in LINQ: SELECT i.name, COUNT(p.Ingredient_IngredientID) AS Total FROM People p, Ingredients i WHERE p.Ingredient_IngredientID = i.IngredientID GROUP BY i.name ORDER BY total DESC;
