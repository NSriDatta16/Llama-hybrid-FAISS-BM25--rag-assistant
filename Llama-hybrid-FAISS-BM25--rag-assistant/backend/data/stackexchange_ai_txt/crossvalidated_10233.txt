As already stated (by @mpiktas), in order to do PCA, you need to transpose your data so that chemical batches are rows and "measurements" are columns. You can then run a PCA on the data and plot the 80 chemical batches on axes derived from the first two components. Here's an example on Quick-R of doing this in R. Also a small supplementary suggestion, you might want to have a look at Chernoff faces . They present a face where each of your eight variables would represent a feature on the face. The size or shape of the feature indicates something about the variable. Flowing data has a tutorial in R with images .
