WPF: Embedding TextBoxes in TextBox

Is is possible to embedd a TextBox in another TextBox. It does not have to be a TextBox, any editable text-component will suffice. I tried it with TextBox and got compiler errors. Reasoning: I want to create some kind of source code editor. I want that string literals in my source code are allowed to contain all kinds of special characters like ",'\ and so on. To achieve this, all string literals should be encapsulated in separate textboxes within the source code to separate them from the other text. Saving and loading of the source is done using xml with all special chars converted to entities, so my only problem is the proper editing. I do not want to put the user off with escaping sequences and so on.
