Getting significance with chi squared but not with logistic regression?

I'm performing a study on a large group of single participants, testing my categorical independent vars against future relationship status. My main IV has three categories: (type 1) no attraction, (type 2) romantic or sexual attraction to an acquaintance or stranger, or (type 3) attract to a current or former partner (girlfriend, husband, ex-spouse). My other two categorical variables include Gender and whether they have a crush/"waking attraction" (WA) to someone in their life. I tested all 8 subgroups using C.S., and also tested their aggregate groups. E.g., all participants at 3 months, all Women at 12 months (both with and w/o WA). My dichotomous DV is future relation status (single | in a relationship) and my binary IVs are gender and WA. Below are my SPSS results for Block 0 and Block 1. I'm not getting L.R. significance with IV variable ("Attracted_1Yes2No"), but it appears that there's interaction between my variables? EDIT: It occurred to me that I was treating my data at 3- and 12- months as separate outcomes and really should OR them together to create a DV that relates whether participants were in a relationship at either of these two time points. Getting much more interesting results now with both my C.S. and L.R. tests.
