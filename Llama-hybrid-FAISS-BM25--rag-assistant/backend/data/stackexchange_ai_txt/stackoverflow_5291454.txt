See Generating URLs in Action Mailer views in the Action Mailer guide. Emphasis in the last paragraph mine (that's the part that should fix your problem): URLs can be generated in mailer views using url_for or named routes. Unlike controllers, the mailer instance doesn’t have any context about the incoming request so you’ll need to provide the :host , :controller , and :action : "example.com", :controller => "welcome", :action => "greeting") %> When using named routes you only need to supply the :host : "example.com") %> Email clients have no web context and so paths have no base URL to form complete web addresses. Thus, when using named routes only the “_url” variant makes sense.
