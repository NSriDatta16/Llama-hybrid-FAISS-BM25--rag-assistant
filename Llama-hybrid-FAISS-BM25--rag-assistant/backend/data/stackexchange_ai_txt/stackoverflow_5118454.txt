In Erlang processes are guaranteed to be switched approximately each 1000 reductions. In such a naive framework as Scala/Akka agent owns a scheduler until it finishes work in receive. Checkmate. Game over. Hasta la vista:) People, do not waste your time on pseudo techs. I shocked that guys here compare Scala with Erlang. Also there are many other so called "killer features", but here is my advice, do not think in terms of features, think about idioms that enables particular language. Scala steals "best features", Erlang enables/implements you with right idioms to build systems reliably, with high level language that driven from those right idioms. When you learn Erlang you are rebuilding your mind, your way of thinking about distributed reliable system, Erlang teaches you and upgrades you. Scala is just another one imperative (oh, sorry, multiparadigmal, funny word) language that tries to steal good features from other languages.
