Exporting *.png sequence from *.fla with C++

I need an animation in my program. My designer draws animation in Flash and provides me with *.fla file. All I need is to grab 30-40 PNGs from this file and store them within my internal storage. Is it possible grab resources from *.fla with C++ ? Probably, some Adobe OLE objects can help? Please, advice. Thanks in advance.
