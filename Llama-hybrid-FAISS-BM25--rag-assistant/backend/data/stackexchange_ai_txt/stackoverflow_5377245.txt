Having defined this backquote function you can just call it again and again, from your programs as well as the interactive shell (IPython, etc). There's no direct way to use such "backquotes" in Python, and IMHO for a good reason. Python is known for its readability, and having such a construct in the language encourages unreadable "scriptish" code. Having said that, backquote is probably not the most descriptive name for a function that returns the output of a subprocess.
