Is the variance of the process in first differences larger than the variance of the undifferenced series?

I have a question regarding a a sinlge-choice problem in my time series course. My question is the following: Is the variance of a process in first differences larger than the variance of the undifferenced series? I cannot find anything on this either in the course material or on the internet. So my intuition is that differencing is a special case of linear filtering, where the weights do not add up to one (therefore changing the mean and variance). But I am not sure how to check whether the variance does indeed grow larger or not. I greatly appreciate your responses.
