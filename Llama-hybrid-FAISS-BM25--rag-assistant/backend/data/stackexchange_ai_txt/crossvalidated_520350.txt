What does the bolded phrase mean? I agree with you that it means the evidence isn't causal. In other words, no causal inference was tested so they only note the correlation in the survey data. Does it mean that even if the evidence isn't causal, the next phrase still makes sense? Yes. Even if the relationship isn't causal, only an experimental correlation, we are still going to attribute causation to the correlation. And what is the "evidence" they are referring to? I think it is the evidence from the previous paragraph: Yamagishi and his colleagues demonstrated the learning advantages of being trusting. Their experiments were similar to trust games, but the participants could interact with each other before making the decision to transfer money (or not) to the other. The most trusting participants were better at figuring out who would be trustworthy, or to whom they should transfer money.
