WordPress Theme Hack - How Do I Call Specific Child Pages Only

I'm going to try my best to explain this correctly :) This question is regarding a Wordpress Theme Hack and php. Currently we are using Coda Blue as a theme see here . Right now the jQuery slider is being controlled by li's that are the tabs of the slider (web design, social media, etc). The tabs are created by making a page, and the content of the page will be in its respective slide. The tabs are being called by this code: post_name?>"> Is it possible to have the "Our Work" link make a reloaded page with different tabs for the slider? For example, if "Our Work" was clicked then hothtactical.com/our-work would load and a new set of tabs would appear above the slider, perhaps child pages of a the "Our Work" parent page. If this is possible we would want the "Our Team" to load up different tabs as well. I thought that all it would require is an if - then statement saying that if a certain page is loaded then call for its child pages to be loaded in as tabs, but am I under-complicating things? Is there javascript changes needed in the coding of the Coda Slider to allow it to make a parent page loadable instead of it going to the slider? I am fervently paying attention to this thread so let me know if you need any further documentation or code. I am willing to donate to the cause of the individual that can help a brother out here. Thanks all!
