Read the Javadocs. Become familiar with the structure as all Javadoc API specs will follow this pattern. I use Google in general to find solutions to problems. I don't rely on any one given site. Generally, a Google search with the right keywords will yield the best results when searching for the solution to a problem. It also depends on the context of what you're searching for. If you have a Spring problem, go to http://forum.springsource.org/ . If you have a Google App Engine problem, search Google Groups. This rule isn't always true for every tool in your toolbox because sometimes the information is just plain better and more organized in other sources. Some problems are also very specific and may not be covered specifically in the documentation. It really just depends on the problem. But in summary, I suggest getting really good at learning to use Google to find information quickly while also weeding out anything that's not relevant to you.
