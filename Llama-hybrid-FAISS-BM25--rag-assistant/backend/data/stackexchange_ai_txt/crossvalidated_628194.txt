Does the order of iteration affect the answer returned by FIND-S?

This paragraph is from the book Machine Learning by Tom M.Mitchell (Page 26): Initialize $h$ to the most specific hypothesis in $H$ For each positive training instance $x$ $\;\;\;\;\;\;$ .For each attribute constraint $a_i$ , in $h$ $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ If the constraint $a_i$ , is satisfied by $x$ $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ Then do nothing $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ Else replace $a_i$ , in $h$ by the next more general constraint that $\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ is satisfied by $x$ Output hypothesis h Now, If there is more than one maximally specific hypothesis consistent with the set $D$ of training examples, Does the order of iteration on the training examples affect the answer returned by this so-called FIND-S algorithm? I think the answer would be yes but I haven't been able to find an example yet.
