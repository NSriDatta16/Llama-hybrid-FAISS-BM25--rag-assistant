R vs Python for Data Analysis

Possible Duplicate: Python as a statistics workbench I am just starting out with data analysis and machine learning. From the books that I am reading/have read Python and R seem to be the best options for me. I want to know (in a general way) the pro's and con's of each, or if I should perhaps use both. Up until now I have been learning C# but have taught myself Python to a competent level. What interests me is programming and finding solutions. I want to work on new thing where possible. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
