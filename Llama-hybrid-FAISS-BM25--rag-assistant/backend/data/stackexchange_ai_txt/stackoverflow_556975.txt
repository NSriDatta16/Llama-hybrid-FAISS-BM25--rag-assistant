You can avoid the heavy markup by leveraging the fact that both links are oneliners. With this markup: View this page Back to List of Pages And this simple css: #view { float: right; } No clearing necessary, and no need to specify widths. This solution would only work for this scenario: two links. If you need more, then you should look at a set of floating list items.
