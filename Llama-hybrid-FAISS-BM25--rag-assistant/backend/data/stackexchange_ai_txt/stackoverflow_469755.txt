This can no doubt be done more elegantly, but here's the basic principles (apologies for any syntax issues, I'm not much of a VB guy): In the KeyUp event: Make sure the key in't a navigation key: if e.KeyCode <> Keys.Back [...] Search the items list for the text typed: idx = myCombo.FindString(myCombo.Text) Take the combo's found item: s = myCombo.GetItemText(idx) insert it into the .Text property: myCombo.Text = s Note that this would overtype everything the user entered (destroying case). You could improve this by appending the 'missing' part instead: stringToAppend = s.SubString(myCombo.Text.Length) myCombo.Text = myCombo.Text + stringToAppend Finally, select the new text so they can keep typing: myCombo.SelectionStart = myCombo.Text.Length - stringToAppend.Length myCombo.SelectionLength = stringToAppend.Length
