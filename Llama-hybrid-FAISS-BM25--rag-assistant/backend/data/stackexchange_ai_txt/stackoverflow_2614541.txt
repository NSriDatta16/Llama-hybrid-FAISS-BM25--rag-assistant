Is Core Animation causing my subviews to call -drawRect for every single frame?

I made a nice UIView subclass which paints all its stuff in -drawRect:, because people said that's good. That view is a subview of another. This another view is beeing animated with Core Animation: It's scaled down, rotated and moved. However, I encountered this: -drawRect seems to get called trillion of times during animation, and performance sucks. Is that normal or did I do something wrong, probably? And I have found this in the documentation of UITableViewCell, which is strange: However, drawing in editing mode is not encouraged because, as you might recall, custom drawing while cells animate into and out of editing mode severely affects performance. So -drawRect: is very very bad when doing any core animation thing? I also remember from some other apple resource, that they "don't redraw during animation". Paradoxon. Again.
