How to print an integral template argument at compile time in C++

Say I have implemented a template class like this: template class C { void f() { // print out N here? } }; I wish that while the compiler compiles a clause like C c; it would print out a message "class C is templated with N = 20" I've tried with #pragma and static_assert in vain. The problem is that with #pragma and static_assert, I could not embed an integral(20 here) into a message; with preprocessors, it's too early that N is not substituted with 20 yet. Is there any way or no way? Thanks.
