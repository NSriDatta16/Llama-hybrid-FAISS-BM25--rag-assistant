Take a look at the Amelia II package, by Honaker, King and Blackwell. Amelia II "multiply imputes" missing data in a single cross-section (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data set (such as collected by years for each of several countries). q1. Yes, it is possible with the above package. q3. I guess it would be possible to impute workplace using a more general imputation method. ( MICE could help). q4. As a general rule, do not throw information out. The imputation model, at a minimun, should include all covariates in all your models. But if extra information help predicting the missing data, include it!
