What happens if we use Z-Score(Mean Normalisation) in Neural Networks to standardize values

I'm currently doing the DeepLearning.ai Specialization where they divide pixel intensity with the maximum value it has (255) to standardize the data when working on a classification NN for cats. What effect does Z_Score have on this? Will my code fail becuase pixels cannot have negative values which will be assigned by Z-Score?
