Fisher's exact test or logistic regression to determine if distributions differ

I have the following data: Somkers Yes No All Groups ]10,20] 35 6 41 ]20,30] 20 13 33 ]30,40] 10 15 25 ]40,50] 15 9 24 All 80 43 123 I understand that this type of data is a 4 by 2 table and a logistic regression can be applied here. My objective here is to test whether the smokers and non smokers have the same distribution in the 4 groups. What test is more suitable here: a homogeneity test, or Fisher's exact test? Do I have to fully specify the logistic model in order to be able to perform these tests?
