When running several Markov chains in parallel, the starting values of those chains start to matter. In short, if they are generated from $\mu$, the distribution of the chain after $n$ steps is $K^n\mu$. Rather than the target $\pi$. It is thus necessary to cull the burnin or warmup stage of the chain, which is much harder than with a single chain when one can invoke the Birkhof Theorem. To decide where to cull can be done by coupling the chains, i.e., by checking approximately when a value from one chain can be accepted as following value by another chain, which should happen with probability were both chains in their stationary regime. One way to check for convergence is to take the final part of each Markov chain, subsample drastically, and check for all components or some components of interest of the simulated parameter whether or not the distributions are the same, using for instance a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
