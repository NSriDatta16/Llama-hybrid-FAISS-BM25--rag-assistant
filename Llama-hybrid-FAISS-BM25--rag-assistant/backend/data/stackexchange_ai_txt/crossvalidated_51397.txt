I see "average" and "mean" used mostly as synonyms. One author who draws a clear distinction is Donald Wheeler, in "Advanced Topics in Statistical Quality Control." He declares that the "average" is a statistic determined by some arithmetic procedure, whereas "mean" is a parameter, specifying location of a distribution. By way of example, he writes that one could calculate an "average" telephone number, which would be meaningless (pun?). The average (a statistic) is an unbiased estimate of the mean (a parameter).
