Green & Tashman (2008, Foresight ) report on a small survey on the analogous question for forecast errors. I'll summarize arguments for either convention as reported by them: Arguments for "actual-predicted" The statistical convention is $y=\hat{y}+\epsilon$. At least one respondent from seismology wrote that this is also the convention for modeling seismic wave traveling time. "When actual seismic wave arrives before the time predicted by model we have negative travel time residual (error)." ( sic ) This convention makes sense if we interpret $\hat{y}$ as a budget, plan or target. Here, a positive error means that the budget/plan/target has been exceeded. This convention makes the formulas for exponential smoothing somewhat more intuitive. We can use a $+$ sign. With the other convention, we would need to use a $-$ sign. Arguments for "predicted-actual" If $y=\hat{y}-\epsilon$, then a positive error indicates that the forecast was too high. This is more intuitive than the converse. Relatedly, if a positive bias is defined as positive expected errors, it would mean that forecasts are on average too high with this convention. And this is pretty much the only argument given for this convention. Then again, given the misunderstandings the other convention can lead to (positive errors = forecast too low), it's a strong one. In the end, I would argue that it comes down to who you need to communicate your residuals to. And given that there are certainly two sides to this discussion, it makes sense to explicitly note which convention you follow.
