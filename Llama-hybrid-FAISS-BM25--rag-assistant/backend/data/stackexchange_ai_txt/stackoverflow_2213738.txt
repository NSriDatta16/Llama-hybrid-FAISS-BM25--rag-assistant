The short way is not always available. The short tags is available with short_tags function () (PHP 3 only), setting the parameter of the configuration file of PHP short_open_tag, or by compiling PHP with the - enable-short -tags option to configure. Although it's enabled by default in php.ini-dist, it discourages the use of short tags format. Although this might not be enough, the manual reiterate and also expanding other situations where it is not appropriate: "Note: Do not use short tags when developing applications or libraries that are meant for redistribution, or when it is developed for servers not under your control, because it may be that short tags is not supported in the server. To build portable, redistributable code, be sure not to use short tags. " In fact, in PHP 6 or 7, these tags will be removed. BTW, In the Zend Framework manual clearly says "Short tags are never allowed" :)
