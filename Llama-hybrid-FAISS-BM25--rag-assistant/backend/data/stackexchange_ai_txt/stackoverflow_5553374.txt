You won't (AFAIK) be able to do that with pure JS in an HTML 4.0 environment. You'll either need Silverlight, Flash or (heaven forbid) an ActiveX controller. HTML 5.0 has DnD capabilities (I believe) but not all browsers suport it. http://html5doctor.com/native-drag-and-drop/ that should give you some idea about how it works :)
