In any size company, you can take the chain of command and move up, to see who has the last say, and the reverse holds true for who will do it. In an ideal world the Presentation layer is the responsibility of the analysis and design team. There are a lot of theoretical and practical uses to a UI, which a simple designer may have never been taught. That does not go to say that a designer with a brain - or experience - will not generate more than adequate results. Bottom line: there is no right answer for a design. Even if you have a checklist of things that a good UI should include, there is always the aesthetic aspect of it, which is not really quantitative. No better approach than trial and error. Even Google Adsense/Analytics encourages you to make multiple designs, and alternate between them while collecting statistics which are quantitative. Given your question, I am guessing you do not work in a large company, otherwise your job description would have been well defined. So: Stop whining and just do it!
