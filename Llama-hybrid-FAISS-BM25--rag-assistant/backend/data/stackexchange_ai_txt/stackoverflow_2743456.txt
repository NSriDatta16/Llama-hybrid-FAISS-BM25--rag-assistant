For C# you can simply place a #pragma warning disable 1591 at the beginning of the reference.cs file. Then the warning concerning missing XML documentation will not be issued. But you have to do this every time, the file is regenerated (i.e. when your service definition changes). I'm not aware of any way to influence the code generation (I'm not sure if they use T4 templates or where these might be located ...)
