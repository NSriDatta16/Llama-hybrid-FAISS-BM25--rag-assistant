How to Add a "Like" Button to my FaceBook Landing Tab?

My FaceBook Page is setup so that users who have not "Liked" the page yet (and attempt to view the page) are presented with the content of a particular tab instead of the default "wall" view. The tab that these users arrive at contains an application I made. It is a simple application that lists information about the business. The application is using the "I Frame" render method (in the application's "Canvas" settings). My goal is to add a FaceBook "Like Button" or "Like Box" inside my application. The purpose of this is to write a message that encourages visitors to "Like" the FaceBook Page (not the application). I've tried the FaceBook code generators for Like Buttons and Like Boxes, but it does not work. When I view my application in FaceBook, there is "nothing" in the location where I added the code. Having a "Like" button inside of an application seems like something that many FaceBook page owners would want. Is there any way to accomplish this?
