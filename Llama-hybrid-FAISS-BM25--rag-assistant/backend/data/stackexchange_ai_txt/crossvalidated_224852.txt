Method to predict action based on previous sequence of actions

Given $n-1$ sequences of actions [$k_{i1}$...$k_{in}$] as training/example I want to be able to predict $k_{nn}$ in the sequence [$k_{n1}$...$k_{n(n-1)}$] where $k_{nn}$ would be the most likely action in set $n$ given the previous $n-1$ sets seen. I first thought of HMM but in my case I would actually be interested in using all my history not just the last k steps. I've also looked into time series prediction but there is no real connection between the sets of actions only between the elements of the set, so I'm not sure it applies. What are my best options here?
