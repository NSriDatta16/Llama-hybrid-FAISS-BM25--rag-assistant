A RecursiveParentChildIterator -- like the RecursiveDirectoryIterator

There are tons of examples of using the RecursiveIterator to flatten a tree structure.. but what about using it to explode a tree structure? Is there an elegant way to use this, or some other SPL library to recursively build a tree (read: turn a flat array into array of arbitrary depth) given a table like this: SELECT id, parent_id, name FROM my_tree EDIT: You know how you can do this with Directories? $it = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator("/var/www/images"); foreach(new RecursiveIteratorIterator($it) as $file) { echo $file . PHP_EOL; } .. What if you could do something like this: $it = new RecursiveParentChildIterator($result_array); foreach(new RecursiveIteratorIterator($it) as $group) { echo $group->name . PHP_EOL; // this would contain all of the children of this group, recursively $children = $group->getChildren(); } :END EDIT
