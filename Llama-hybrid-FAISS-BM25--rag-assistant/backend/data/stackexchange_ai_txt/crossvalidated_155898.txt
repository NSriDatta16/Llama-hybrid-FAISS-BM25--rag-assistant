The model you define is somewhat inaccurate unless $y$ is of dimensions $p \times 1$. Is it? Having said that assuming the eigenvectors $[f_1 f_2]$ define a $p \times 2$ matrix you simply do the multiplication: $[f_1 f_2]^T r^*$ to get the new scores. This is equivalent of projecting $r^*$ to the axial system defined by $f_1$ and $f_2$. Both $U$ and $V^*$ are unitary matrices. If the matrix $X$ was symmetric $U$ would equal $V^*$. If you want the eigenvectors that are the same as the ones returned by PCA you are looking to use $V^*$. Please see the post by the user @amoeba found here regarding the relation between SVD and PCA. I believe it will aid your understanding a lot.
