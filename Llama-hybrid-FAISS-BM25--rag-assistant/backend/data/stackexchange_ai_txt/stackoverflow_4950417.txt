Avoid CakePHP's Auth component to display authentication error messages

I would like to get rid of Auth component error messages, specially the authError message that comes whenever I try to access a non-allowed action. Just to be sure, I double check that there is no $this->Session->flash() call anywhere in the layout. Besides, setting an empty value does not work, as the component has a default message value. I am using the Auth component with the following configuration in AppController class: class AppController extends Controller { var $components = array( 'Auth' => array( 'userModel' => 'WebUser', 'loginAction' => '/login', 'loginRedirect' => '/', 'logoutRedirect' => '/login', 'autoRedirect' => false, ), 'Session', ... ... } For login and logout redirections I have setup two routes: Router::connect('/', array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'index')); Router::connect('/login', array('controller' => 'web_users', 'action' => 'login')); The login action within WebUser controller is almost empty; I only change the default layout: function login() { $this->layout = 'login'; $this->set('title_for_layout', 'Sign in'); } Finally, I have a very simple login.ctp layout file: ... ... ... When I access http://example.com/login there is no problem, no messages, just the login form. However I get the default authError message when requesting any other action, just after the Auth component redirects to the login action. Two questions arise: Why is the Auth component displaying flash messages when there is no $this->Session->flash() call anywhere? (see update 2 below) How can I setup an empty/null value in authError attribute? Thanks! UPDATE I came up with a really ugly solution: I created an element login_error.ctp and assigned to the flashElement attribute in Auth component initialization: class AppController extends Controller { var $components = array( 'Auth' => array( 'flashElement' => 'login_error', ... ... } In login_error.ctp I just compare with the authError default message: It works, but I hate it! UPDATE 2 Thanks to dogmatic69 answer I forced myself to check everything again. I finally found where the call to $this->Session->flash() was being made. It was on a little view element that I had wrote before. It had nothing to do with login/logout stuff so I did not pay attention to that file. UPDATE 3 Thanks to SpawnCxy answer as well. Copying the Auth component and making custom modifications is a better approach than string comparison.
