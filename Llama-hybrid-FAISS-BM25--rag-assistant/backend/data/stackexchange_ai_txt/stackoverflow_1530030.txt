iPhone Sounds and delay

I am developing an application where the user can tap multiple hit areas which produces sounds. But the result is a little laggy, when multiple sounds start at the same time, the sounds are played with an ugly delay. I am using AVAudioPlayer instances for each sound. Is there a better way to play sounds and prevent this lag? Here's the code: #import "MBImageView.h" #import @implementation MBImageView -(void)awakeFromNib { NSURL* audioFile = [NSURL fileURLWithPath[[NSBundlemainBundle] pathForResource:@"shaker" ofType:@"caf"]]; AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID((CFURLRef)audioFile, &shortSound); } - (id)initWithImage:(UIImage *)image{ return self; } - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(shortSound); } @end Regards.
