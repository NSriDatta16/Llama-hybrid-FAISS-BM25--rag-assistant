Dynamic ProtectionDomain s (introduced in 1.4 IIRC), delegate to the modifiable Policy . Determining permissions by thread is, erm, tricky. The applet security managaer does it by ThreadGroup , which is generally considered a bad thing. You can allow connections to specific ports. Similarly you can have a privileged JDBC driver that perhaps proxies onto another driver asserting particular privileges through AccessController.doPrivileged . Permissions for system properties can be specified for each individual key. AccessController in the Sun/Oracle implementation does have tracing features. Applets/WebStart will show a dialog on, for instance, printing. But the JNLP services approach is much better. "Glossitope" attempted to have a system that sprung up a dialog box every time a permission was requested. Of course, the request makes no sense to the user that just wants to see the dancing pigs. (Glossitope was an attempt at a Java version of the Vista side panel thing. The features added to 6u10 (drag-and-drop install, non-rectangular windows, warning icon instead of banner, JNLP services) make it mostly redundant.)
