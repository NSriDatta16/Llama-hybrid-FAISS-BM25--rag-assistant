I've solved this by requesting the necessary data from the server (step 2) right away at the application start. Not that elegant, since there is no guarantee that the user will click on the download button, and i store the just-in-case data anyway, but it works. So when the user decides to click on the download button, I check air status, and if it's installed on the machine, i just use the already stored values, and download-->install or launch the application.
