The best book for Gaussian Processes is Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning, of which there's a free pdf online: http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/ . For most other aspects of Bayesian Nonparametrics, like the Dirichlet Processes and the like, there are a few books that are essentially collections of papers from the literature, but they're not really text books to learn from unless you have some background already.
