I use the both logo image and text for improving SEO on my site Site name then I used css for formatting display so visitor can see only my logo but SE can see the both that make double search result for 2 type of search text and image . The image which use searched is the brand of your site, when visitor see your logo, they thought about your site, your products, services like as HP, IBM, DELL etc.... In other case you can make paragraph tag for more description about your site to focus some keywords in your site. My language skill is not good but I still want to share to you some knowledge, dont laugh me when I got mistake about grammar please :)
