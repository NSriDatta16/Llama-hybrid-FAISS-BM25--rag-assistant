Machine Learning books for CS (non-statistician) grad student

What books on machine learning are recommended for a CS graduate student without a huge background in statistics? I do have some background in ML (and of course linear algebra, probability, etc.) but not really a great/firm background in statistics. I saw a lot of recommendations for: PRML: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop. ESL: Elements of statistical Learning by Hastie et al. MLaPP: Machine Learning - a Probabilistic Perspective by Murphy. Which ML book is recommended for a grad student with my background? I see MLaPP is pretty new but seems to include a lot of topics including deep learning etc. - I'd love to know what did someone who read it though of it.
