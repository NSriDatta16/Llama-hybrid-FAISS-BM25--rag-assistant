If your application is checking the IP Address, then it is extremely vulnerable. At that point you don't have any protection at the router which is where IP filtering really needs to be. Your application is probably checking HTTP header information for the sending IP address and this is extremely easy to spoof. If you lock the IP address down at the router, that is a different story and will buy you some real security about who can access the site from where. If are you are doing is accessing the application internally, then SSL won't buy you much unless you are trying to secure the information from parties internal to the organization, or you require client certificates. This is assuming you won't ever access the site from an external connection (VPNs don't count, because you are tunneling into the internal network and are technically part of it at that point). It won't hurt either and isn't that hard to setup, just don't think that it is going to be the solution to all your problems.
