XML forces your data to be well-structured, so that a program which does not understand the semantics of your data will still be able to understand its syntax . This allows things like XSLT, which will transform one well-formed XML document into another. It means that you can manipulate data without having to interpret it. You can see the document is well-formed and valid according to its DTD without needing to understand the contents. This was a huge step forward for data storage, interoperability, and machine-readability in general.
