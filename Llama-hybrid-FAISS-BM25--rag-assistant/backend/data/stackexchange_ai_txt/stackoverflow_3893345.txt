Here are a few things to try: First, try adding BOOL success = [[GANTracker sharedTracker] dispatch]; to the end of your code and testing the value of success. Second, I don't see kGANDispatchPeriodSec defined in GANTracker.h . Is this a const that you're creating? Pass in a 0 as the dispatchPeriod instead so dispatches are sent immediately instead of batched. (You'll want to change this before you submit your app.) Finally, implement GANTrackerDelegate on your class and see what's happening in the trackerDispatchDidComplete:eventsDispatched:eventsFailedDispatch call. This will tell you if your dispatch calls are failing, but unfortunately won't tell you why. See this link about adopting a protocol on your class. In your .m file, add the following: #pragma mark GANTrackerDelegate - (void)trackerDispatchDidComplete:(GANTracker *)tracker eventsDispatched:(NSUInteger)eventsDispatched eventsFailedDispatch:(NSUInteger)eventsFailedDispatch { NSLog(@"events dispatched: %d, events failed: %d", eventsDispatched, eventsFailedDispatch); }
