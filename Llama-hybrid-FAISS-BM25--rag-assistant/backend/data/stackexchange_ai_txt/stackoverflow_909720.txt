log4net is in widespread production use in a huge variety of products, and not dead or beta by any means (and was a reimplementation of the popular log4j framework which has similar ubiquity in the Java world). Most of the time, use of 'incubating' and 0.xx naming schemes is an oversight more than a 'here be dragons' / 'here be stuff not interesting enough to fight' indicator that one might infer. In general, the incubating tag means that it's not being formally released as part of a beta/test/release cycle. UPDATE: The project is and was NOT at the time of asking the question in incubating state, it graduated in 2007
