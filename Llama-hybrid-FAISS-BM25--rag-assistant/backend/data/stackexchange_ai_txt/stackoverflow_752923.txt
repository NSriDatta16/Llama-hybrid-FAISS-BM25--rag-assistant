You resolved the problem, but you probably don't know why. It's probably important to know what was wrong and why doing what you did fixed it, so you can make it not happen again. The problem was most likely that your SettingsWindowViewController.m file was not a member of the iPhone_PNP target you were building. Projects are just containers; targets actually build things, and if a file is in the project but not assigned to a target, it won't get built. Removing the files and re-adding it defaulted to adding it to the current target. You might have seen a list with a check box in it and paid no attention to it, but that check box is what fixed the problem. The easier way to do this in the future is to just drag the source file into the target, or choose Get Info on it and click the target's check box in the General tab.
