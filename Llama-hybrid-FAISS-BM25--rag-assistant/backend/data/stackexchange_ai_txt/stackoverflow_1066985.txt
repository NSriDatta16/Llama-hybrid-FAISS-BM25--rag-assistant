Hey Chris, I also use the same way for keeping a database project, the only problem, is that you often make changes to stored procedures, and sometimes you forget which ones you changed, so you might drag one and forget the other. Do you know of a way to synchronize the database project with the database, or a way to import latest script for stored procs in your project, after they have been added by dragging the first time.
