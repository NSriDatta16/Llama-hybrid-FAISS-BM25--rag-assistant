PNG in IE: toggle opacity for partially transparent img?

I have an PNG image file that is partially transparent. I need toggle its opacity . Currently I am using the following CSS code to permit opacity: filter:alpha(opacity=50); However, IE has trouble handling the transparent portion of the PNG. When I try to fix it by adding the following CSS: filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader (src='../images/translucent_effect.png', sizing Method='scale'); Well, it doesn't work. My question is: what is the best solution that people have found to this problem? Should I just convert PNG into GIF? Or is there a more elegant solution? Thanks.
