Time series Modelling - Forecasting for weekly incidents

I am new to R. I am trying to apply forecasting model Time Series (TS) Model as follows: Plotting original data, Simple Moving Average, Auto correction(AC), Partial AC, Differencing of TS etc to get stationary time series, Fitting optimal model which gives minimum AIC, residuals from ARIMA/ARMA Normality test for residuals forecasting for future values The forecast figures are not coming out with the accuracy that I expected. Please find following weekly incidents. Can anyone please help me with the right approach and sample code? There are some outliers in the data (# of incidents per week) due to new release of application, seasonality effect and holiday period.
