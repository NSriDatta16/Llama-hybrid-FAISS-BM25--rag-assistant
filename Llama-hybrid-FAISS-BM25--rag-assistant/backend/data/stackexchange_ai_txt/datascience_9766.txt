This is a pretty classic ARIMA dataset. ARIMA is implemented in the StatsModels package for Python, the documentation for which is available here . An ARIMA model with seasonal adjustment may be the simplest reasonably successful forecast for a complex time series such as sales forecasting. It may (probably will) be that you need to combine the method with an additional model layer to detect additional fluctuation beyond the auto-regressive function of your sales trend. Unfortunately, simple linear regression models tend to fare quite poorly on time series data.
