How can I scrape multiple website html tables to a single excel file?

I have a list of urls I would like to scrape into *.txt format. Can anyone suggest to me how I can write a php code integrating regex and scraping all the html tables form the listed url to one excel file. I have tried doing this manually but since the urls are large in number its costing me a lot of time. For the manual scraping I have copied the html code to notepad and saved as a html file and dragged and dropped the file to excel giving me a excel file I want. Please send in your replies and provide the correct code to do so.
