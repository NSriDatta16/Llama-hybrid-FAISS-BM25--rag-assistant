Testing of hypothesis for the linearity of a data? PCA suggested, but how do we design a statistical test using it?

Suppose we're given the data set $\{x_1 \dots x_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^D$ the $D$ -dimensional Euclidean space, and assume this data has intrinsic dimension $d N.B. this just means that data is lying on a $d$ -dimensional connected manifold which can be very flat or very curved but certainly it doesn't assume the manifold is a hyperplane, i.e. linear; and assume we've no idea about the curvature of this manifold: we just know that the manifold is $d$ -dimensional. Suppose we're interested in determining whether the above manifold, or equivalently the data has an linear structure or not, i.e. if the manifold above is a $d$ -dimensional hyperplane or not. This means, we want to test, does this manifold have zero curvature and is it homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space? To ease things, assume the manifold is homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space, then test if the sectional curvature of this manifold is identically zero. Is it possible to test, and if yes, what test(s) do we need? More specifically: what I want is a test of hypothesis following the steps: (1) Construct a suitable statistic $\Theta(X_1, \dots X_n)$ that's representative of the linearity of the data. (2) Determine the sampling distribution of the statistic, and if needed , the limiting distribution of $\Theta(X_1, \dots X_n)$ as $n \to \infty.$ (3) Accept the null hypothesis $H_0:$ the data is linear if for a chosen threshold $\theta, \Theta(X_1, \dots X_n) \le \theta, $ and reject it otherwise. Let's consider two specific examples of data , where I'd like to find whether the data is linear or not, with certain confidence from the test described above. I'd rather prefer the answer for the second example . Example I: You may consider the the data coming from the $2$ -sphere and then embedded by zero padding in $\mathbb{R}^{50}$ , so consider the data $x_i$ sampled from $M:=\{(x, y, z, 0, \dots 0): x^2 + y ^2 + z^2 =1\}, 0$ occurring $47$ times in this expression so that $M \subset \mathbb{R}^{50}.$ Now clearly in this case, $M$ is two dimensional, and not a linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{50},$ so the test I'm asking for would answer in the negative - it'd tell us that the samples came from a nonlinear manifold, and not a linear hyperplane. Example II: Perhaps Example I above was a bit easy, so consider instead $100$ data points $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{50}, x_i= (y_i, 0), 0$ occurs $47$ times, and $y_i$ 's come from the manifold $\{(x,y,z): x^2 y^3 z + sin(xy) cos(yz) + tan(y-z +1) - xy^2 e^z - xyz + cos(yz) - xy + z - 5=0\}$ . The reason to cite this example is that unlike the Example I, it's not a linear function of functions of one variables, as the example I was a linear/affine function of $x^2, y^2, z^2.$ So I see that many of you've suggested PCA, and perhaps because of my own background, I'm having trouble to understand how exactly it helps us infer if the manifold $M$ is linear or not. Say, given $d,$ I do the PCA, and find the best approximating $d$ -dimensional hyperplane approximating the data (or equivalently, maximizing the variance). I'm okay with this so far - but what do we do next? What's the statistic in question that'd help me accept or reject the null hypothesis that the data was linear?
