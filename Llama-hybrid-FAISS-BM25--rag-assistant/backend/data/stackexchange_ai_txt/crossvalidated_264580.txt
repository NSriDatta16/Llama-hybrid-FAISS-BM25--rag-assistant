Extracting Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimates from MC samples

I notice in some academic papers the use of MAP estimators in Bayesian settings. The samples are generated through some MC method, but the MAP calculation from these samples is never elaborated on. Are there any standard ways of extracting MAP estimates from continuous samples? I feel like I am missing something - since googling doesn't help either.
