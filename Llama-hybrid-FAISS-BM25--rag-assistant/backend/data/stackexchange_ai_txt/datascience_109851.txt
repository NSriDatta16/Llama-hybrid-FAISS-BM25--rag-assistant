Effect of log odds on skewed data

Does taking the log of odds bring linearity between the odds of the dependent variable & the independent variables by removing skewness in the data? Is this one reason why we use log of odds in logistic regression? If yes, then is log transformation of data values unnecessary in logistic regression?
