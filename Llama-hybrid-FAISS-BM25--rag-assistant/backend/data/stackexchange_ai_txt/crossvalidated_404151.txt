Note: MSE depends on the scale of your predicted variable, so stateing its value (0.41) does not bring much info. (If you are working on classification problem, cross entropy would be a better criterial function than MSE). R2 measure the improvement of your model over always predicting the average value of your predicted variable. If you think that your MSE is good, low R2 may be caused by inbalanced dataset: if most of the observation have the same / similar value of predicted variable, then guessing always the average would be a good strategy (and your model will not be able to improve much over it, hence the low R2).
