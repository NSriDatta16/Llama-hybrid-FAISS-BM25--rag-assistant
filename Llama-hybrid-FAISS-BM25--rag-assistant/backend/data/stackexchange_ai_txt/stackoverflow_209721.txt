XML structure for a personal organizer

I'm doing a personal organizer for learning purposes, and i've never worked with XML so i'm not sure if my solution is the best. Here's the basic structure for the XML file i came with: activity description. The urgency attribute should be on a scale of 1 to 10. I did a quick search on google and couldn't find a good example. Maybe that's not the best solution, and i'd like to know if its adequate. I'm doing the application in PHP if that has any relevance.
