My first Neural Network not working

I have just started deep learning and neural networks and when I try the following code, it does not work: #Import Keras for deep learning import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras #Store the data into a variable data = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist #Split the data and create classes (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = data.load_data() class_names = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot'] #Standardize the data train_images = train_images/255 test_images = test_images/255 #Create the model model = keras.Sequential([ keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28,28)) keras.layers.Dense(128, activation = 'relu') keras.layers.Dense(10, activation = 'softmax') ]) #Compile and fit the model model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy']) model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5) #Test the model test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels) print(test_acc) For some reason this is not working.This is the error: File " ", line 15 keras.layers.Dense(128, activation = 'relu') ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax Thanks!!
