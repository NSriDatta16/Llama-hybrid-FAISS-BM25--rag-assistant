Is storing Image File in database good in desktop application running in network?

I recently came across a problem for image file storage in network. I have developed a desktop application. It runs in network . It has central database system. Users log in from their own computer in the network and do their job. Till now the database actions are going fine no problem. Users shares data from same database server. Now i am being asked to save the user[operator]'s photo too. I am getting confused whether to save it in database as other data or to store in separate file server. I would like to know which one is better storing images in database or in file server? EDIT: The main purpose is to store the account holder's photo and signature and later show it during transaction so that teller can verify the person and signature is correct or not?
