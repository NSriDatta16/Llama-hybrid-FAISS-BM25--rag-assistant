This terminology refers to whether we want some coefficient in a regression model to be similar but vary across some categories. E.g. if you want to model the relationship between outside temperature and how many minutes flights will be delayed by, you can do a number of things: assume there is a single slope for all flights $i=1,\ldots,I$ , so something like $\text{delay}_i = \text{intercept} + \text{slope} * \text{temperature}_i + \epsilon_i$ (we would call that a fixed effect), assume that this relationship is different and unrelated for every airport $j=1,\ldots,J$ , i.e. $\text{delay}_i = \text{intercept} + \sum_{j=1}^J 1\{\text{airport}_i=j\} *\text{slope}_j * \text{temperature}_i + \epsilon_i$ (we would say that we have separate fixed effects for every airport, or assume that this relationship is different across airports, but varies across airport according to some distribution (e.g. a normal distribution) so that $\text{delay}_i = \text{intercept} + \sum_{j=1}^J 1\{\text{airport}_i=j\} *\text{slope}_j * \text{temperature}_i + \epsilon_i$ with $\text{slope}_j \sim N(0, \tau^2)$ (we would say that we have a random airport effect on the slope term). Next, you could of course also have a random airport effect on the intercept (or a fixed airport main effect), too (after all some airport just always have longer delays). Option 3 has the effect that we borrow information from other airports so that airports with few participants have their slope estimates pulled towards the (weighted) average of the slopes for all the airports.
