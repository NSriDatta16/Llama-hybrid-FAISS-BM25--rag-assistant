A marginal model estimates population averages, in contrast to a subject-specific model that estimates an expected value conditional on a subject's attributes. In a linear model context, these are the same, but they differ for nonlinear models. The GEE is the most salient marginal model. Observations coming from the same unit are not (statistically) independent. This poses particular challenges to the statistical procedures used for the analysis of such data. A marginal model (e.g., the Generalized Estimating Equations approach) is a method to account for such nonindependent, autocorrelated data. Contrary to a (subject specific) GLMM, a marginal model yields parameters with a population-averaged interpretation. Reference: Verbeke et al. (2010). Random Effects Models for Longitudinal Data .
