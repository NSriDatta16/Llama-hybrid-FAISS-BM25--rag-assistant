How to pass noisy images as input and original images as labels in Keras - Autoencoders

I want to make denoising autoencoder, I've added some noise to images, and i want to use them for training, original images will be used as label. Reading the keras documentation I've found that I need to make generator, since my dataset is large. The function flow_from_directory method from keras documentation is good fit. But I have found one problem. class_mode: 'input' option from flow_from_directory(directory): method is saying: images identical to input images (mainly used to work with autoencoders) My question is: 'How can I pass as input noisy images and then pass as labels original clean images' ?
