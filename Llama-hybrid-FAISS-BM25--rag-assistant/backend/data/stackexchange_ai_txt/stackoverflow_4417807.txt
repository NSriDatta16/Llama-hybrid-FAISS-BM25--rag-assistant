Loading Youtube in a modal (possibly with swfobject?)

I'm having a lot of problems getting a YouTube video to load in a modal properly on all browsers. I just found swfobject but can't find any code on implementing it. Can anyone tell me how to load a YouTube video dynamically using swfobject? I've also got jQuery running on the site if that makes it more elegant code.
