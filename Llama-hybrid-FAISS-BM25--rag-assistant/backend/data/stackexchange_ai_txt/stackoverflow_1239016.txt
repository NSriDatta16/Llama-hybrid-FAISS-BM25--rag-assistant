The arp cache is provided as standard in the set of SNMP data available. You can use SNMP4J to write a trivial agent to query this data. e.g. from a command line SNMP toolset snmpwalk ${hostname} 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2 (that huge period-delimited string is the OID, or identifier, of the ARP cache in SNMP terms. That will work for all SNMP implementations)
