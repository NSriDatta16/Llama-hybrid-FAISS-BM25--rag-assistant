How to force cdecl calling convention for functions declared in specific header file

Hi My VC2008 project uses the stdcall calling conventions. I have an external library that I am using which has been built with cdecl naming convention, however they didn't mention the calling convention in the function declaration of the functions. I would like to know if VC has some kind of #pragma or other keyword that would force specific calling convention for the entire header file kinda like the extern "C" trick but for calling conventions: extern "C" { #include #include } Anyone knows of such?
