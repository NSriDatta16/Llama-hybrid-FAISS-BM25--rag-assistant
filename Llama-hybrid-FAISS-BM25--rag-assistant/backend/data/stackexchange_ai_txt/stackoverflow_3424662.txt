Using bitmasks this way, you will not be able to leverage the power of SQLs referential integrity checks. What happens if somehow I enter a value of 128? There is no such entry in your lookup table. With foreign key constraints properly imlemented, if I attempted to load a value that did not exist in the lookup table, I'd get an error and the value would (properly) not be loaded in the database. It may be quicker and easier (and more interesting) to implement bitwise operators, but properly normalized databases can be a lot easier to support and maintain over time.
