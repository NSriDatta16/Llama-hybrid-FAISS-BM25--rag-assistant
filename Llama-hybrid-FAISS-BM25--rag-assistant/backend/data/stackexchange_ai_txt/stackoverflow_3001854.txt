I am not sure that the Object Inspector will know the syntax for the arithmtic expression. However, in your code you should be referring to the fully qualified class. Then the syntax you are using should be perfectly fine. Query query = new Query( session, "select * from com.yourCompany.yourClass where _qtyOrdered - _qtySent > 0 "); QueryResult result = query.execute(); I just tried this out on one of my classes and it worked fine.
