Purchased domain, purchased hosting, how do I link the two?

Pretty much what the title says. I purchased a .com domain for my first personal site ever from gandi.net and I purchased shared hosting space from lithium hosting. I haven't found any specific instructions for how to make the domain name use the hosting space I purchased, so if you guys could advise me on that, it'd be fantastic! Thanks!
