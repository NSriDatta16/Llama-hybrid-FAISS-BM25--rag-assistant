Dependence of Error: Does it matter for data-driven models?

Linear regression assumes that the errors of the response variable are independent of each other. Lets assume that a data-driven model like a random forest or multi-layer perceptron is trained/formed with some data and the resulting error of the response variable is not independent with each other. Does this matter in any way? What can be concluded from such behavior?
