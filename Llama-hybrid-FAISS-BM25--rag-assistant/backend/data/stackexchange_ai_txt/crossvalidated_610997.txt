Given a finite time series $\{y_1, \ldots, y_n\}$ , the usual definition for the sample autocovariance at lag $k$ is $$ \hat{\gamma}_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=k+1}^n (y_t - \bar{y})(y_{t-k} - \bar{y})\,. $$ Notice that we're dividing by $n$ even though there are only $n-k$ terms in the sum. The sample autocorrelation at lag $k$ is then $\hat{\rho}_k =\hat{\gamma}_k /\hat{\gamma}_0$ , so the $1/n$ cancels out and you obtain the formula in your post. The stats::acf function in R uses the same convention. If in your definition of $\hat{\gamma}_k$ you divide by $n-k$ instead of $n$ (which is what pandas.Series.autocorr does), you get $\hat{\rho}_1=1$ instead. The difference is negligible for long time series (large $n$ ), but not for small $n$ .
