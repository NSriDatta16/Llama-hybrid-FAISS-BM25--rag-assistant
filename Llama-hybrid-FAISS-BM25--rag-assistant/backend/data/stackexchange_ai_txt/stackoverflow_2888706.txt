If there is a one-to-one relationship between a given record and a LOB then the best idea is to declare the LOB column in the record. Oracle allows us to declare a separate tablespace for LOBs, so there is not much impact on storage. create table t23 ( id number not null , col1 number not null , col2 date not null , col3 varchar2(255) , a_doc clob , x_doc xmltype , constraint t23_pk primary key (id) ) tablespace app_date lob (a_doc) store as basicfile a_lob (tablespace lob_data) lob (x_doc) store as securefile x_lob (tablesapce xml_data) / (SECUREFILE is an Enterprise Edition feature introduced in 11g. Find out more ). The main thing about this approach is that you will have to explicitly specify the columns you want to select if you don't want to include the LOB columns. This shouldn't be a hardship as it is best practice: select * from .... is a bug waiting to happen. "The table three will have to store images" If you have a one-to-many relationship then you will need to have a separate table for Images. There are a lot of subtleties when it comes to storing LOBs and tuning the affected queries. I recommend you read this Oracle white paper, from the OTN website .
