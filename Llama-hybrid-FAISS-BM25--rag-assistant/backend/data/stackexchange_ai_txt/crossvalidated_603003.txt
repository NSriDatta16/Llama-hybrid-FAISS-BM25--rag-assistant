Comparing Different Types of Survival Models

Suppose there is a system in which individuals are measured only at discrete time points (e.g. blood pressure is measured once every year) and these individuals have the ability to transition between multiple states (e.g. disease free, disease stage 1, disease stage 2, death by disease of interest , death by comorbidity, lost to follow up etc.) until one of the absorbing states is reached or the period of study is over. The goal of the analysis is to understand what how different cohorts of patients and patient characteristics contribute to the transitions between these states. I am trying to understand what types of Survival Models are generally used for this type of problem. At first I thought that perhaps the competing risk model might be suitable seeing as there are "competing absorption states" (e.g. death by disease of interest vs death by comorbidity) - but I am not sure if a multistate/multistate-survival model is better suited for these types of problems. Another approach that I have been considering is using several multinomial logistic regression. For example, if there are "n" states and "k" absorbing states (i.e. "n - k" non-absorbing states): Isolate all rows of data in "state 1" and create a multinomial logistic regression model where the outcomes are "state 1, state 2, state 3... state n" Repeat this process and create "n - k" multinomial logistic regression models Thus, as a recap: Approach 1: Discrete Competing Risks Model Approach 2: Discrete Multistate Survival Model Approach 3: Multinomial Logistic Regression Can someone please comment which of these approaches (or perhaps some other approach) is generally used for these types of Discrete Time problems? Thanks!
