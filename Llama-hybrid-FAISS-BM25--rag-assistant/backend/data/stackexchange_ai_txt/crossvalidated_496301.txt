What's the speed bottleneck in sklearn.svm.SVC.predict?

I'm working with some high resolution images of specimens in test tubes and I found that using an SVC to classify each pixel by HSV value helps me to a great job at segmenting out just the specimen from the rest of the image. The problem is that it's non-trivially slow to make a prediction (other questions on the forum ask about training - this is not that). A 768x768 image takes on the order of a second. I know enough about SVMs to understand that for each pixel the algorithm has to apply the kernel function, in my case rbf, then compute a dot product (or something like that). My best guess is that the rbf kernel is the bottleneck, but I'm still not sure why is should take so long. Any thoughts on that? And any ideas how I can speed things up?
