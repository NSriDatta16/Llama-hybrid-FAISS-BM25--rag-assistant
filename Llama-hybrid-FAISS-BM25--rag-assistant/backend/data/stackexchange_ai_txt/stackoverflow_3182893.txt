Here is one thing that can keep all developers busy for a month: Run your apps' unit tests in a profiler with code coverage (nUnit or VS Code Coverage). Figure out which areas need more tests. Write unit tests for those sub-systems. Now, if the system was not written using TDD, chances are it'd be very monolithic and will require significant refactoring to introduce test surfaces. Hopefully, at the end of it you end up with a more modular, less tightly coupled. more testable system.
