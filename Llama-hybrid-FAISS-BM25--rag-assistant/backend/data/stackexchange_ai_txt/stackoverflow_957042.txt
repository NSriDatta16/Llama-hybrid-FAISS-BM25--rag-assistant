Manage ASP.NET Web Service Source Code

I'm working on building a set of ASP.NET (2.0) web-services to be deployed into a single web application under IIS7. The services will be added incrementally (over a period of a year or more) by multiple programmers. How should I organize my source in VS2005. Should I use one project or several? Should I use a Web-Application or Web-Site project. How do I manage the web.config that they will all share. Thanks for your advice.
