Data science Ph.D. program, what do you think?

As Yann LeCun mentioned , a number of PhD programs in data science will be popping up in the next few years. NYU already have one, where Prof.LeCun is at right now. A statistics or cs PhD in machine learning is probably more rigorous than a data science one. Is data science PhD for the less mathy people like myself? Are these cash cow programs? There is a huge industry demand for big data, but what is the academic value of these programs, as you probably can't be a professor or publish any paper.
