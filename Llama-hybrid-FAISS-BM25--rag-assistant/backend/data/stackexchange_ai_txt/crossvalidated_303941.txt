Let's call your parameters $\theta$, your time series of observations $y_{1:T}$, and your hidden states $x_{1:T}$. Blocked-Gibbs sampling targets the full posterior $p(\theta,x_{1:T}|y_{1:T})$. It alternates between sampling $X_{1:T}^i \sim p(x_{1:T}|y_{1:t},\theta)$ and $\theta^i \sim p(\theta|x_{1:T},y_{1:T})$. It is called Blocked Gibbs because all of the states are blocked together and sampled all at once. You need the Forward-Backward algorithm to do the first one: to sample from $p(x_{1:T}|y_{1:t},\theta)$. And here 's a paper.
