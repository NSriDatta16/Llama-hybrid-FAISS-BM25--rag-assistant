Device name/id doesnt show in organizer window

I have added a device via the provsiong portal by enetering the UDID But when viewing the device in the organizer window in xcode, it just shows "1 other device," and not the same info as for other devices I have added. I get the feeling that it is not really added?! Note the other devices that come up normally where added via usb cable and using the organizer window. Thanks for the help.
