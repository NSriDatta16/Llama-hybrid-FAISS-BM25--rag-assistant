Paired t-test vs two-sample t-test - animal populations

From my understanding, a paired t-test is used when samples are dependent of each other. I'm having trouble deciding whether a paired t-test should be used when comparing the average population of a group of animals. Is this data actually independent? I'm trying to decide if it is better for me to use a two-sample t-test to determine if there is actually a difference in the number of animals in one year compared to another. As the number of animals in one year doesn't necessarily have an effect of animals on another year, I assume that this is independent data and that a two-sample t-test should be used?
