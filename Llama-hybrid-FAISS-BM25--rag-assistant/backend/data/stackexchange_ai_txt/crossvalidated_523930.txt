Fixed effects model nonsense result in R

im trying to create a simple fixed effects model of the impact minimum wages has on youth unemployment rate in europe but keep getting nonsense results. I have a panel data of 19 european countries from 2006-2020 and using the variables: The data i'm interested in is: yemp20 - Which is the employment rate (%) of european youth between 20-24 minwage - Which is the lagged minimum wage to average wage ratio (kaitz index, and lagged meaning 2019 minwages are put into 2020). My code (and for the robust standard errors) and results are: model which is just nonsense. What am i doing wrong? This should be very simple.
