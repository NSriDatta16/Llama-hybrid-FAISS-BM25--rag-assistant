How to configure Eclipse with CDT?

I've been trying to use CDT with Eclipse 3.4 under Windows XP with cygwin. What do I need to do, in order to get startet? I used "eclipse-cpp-ganymede-SR1-win32.zip" found on the Eclipse homepage. Edit: The main problem is, that I cannot compile and run the code. In the run configuration, I tried gcc.exe for the C/C++ Application: After adding the path of make.exe to my $Path, and starting from scratch, it works perfectly.
