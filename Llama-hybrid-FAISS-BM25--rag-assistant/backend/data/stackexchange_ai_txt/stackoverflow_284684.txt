note that agile methods are not an excuse to avoid designing, they just encourage testing of the design more frequently, and in smaller increments i like to sketch the design and break its elements down until reasonably sure that there are no obvious unknowns or risks; unknowns and risks are highlighted for 'spike' projects, with a time-box for determining feasibility and notes on possible alternatives if the preferred methods prove unworkable once comfortable with the overall architecture, jump into the features bottom-up (or in priority order) to complete the design, write the initial tests, then implement EDIT: note that the question "design or prototype first" is making a bad assumption, i.e. that it is possible to prototype without doing any design, which of course is not the case (unless you are using the million-monkeys methodology)
