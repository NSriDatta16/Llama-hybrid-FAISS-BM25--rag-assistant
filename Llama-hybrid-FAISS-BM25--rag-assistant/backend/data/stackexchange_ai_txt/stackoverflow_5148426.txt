To define a column in an SQL query, you can use pretty much any SQL operation that returns a single value (including select statements). Here are some examples: select 'Y' from dual; select (5 * 3) cal_col from dual; select (select min(col1) from table 2) calc_col from dual; select nvl(col1, 'N') has_value from mytable; From my experience, if you want to use a derived column in a select query, then you must define the column as part of an inner select. Here is an example: select * from ( select (col1 * col2) calc_col from mytable ) data where data.calc_col > 30 Another alternative is use the calculation within the where clause itself: select (col1 * col2) calc_col from mytable t where (col1 * col2) > 30 If you are performing a count(*) operation, then you can also leverage the HAVING clause: select field1, count(*) from mytable having count(*) > 3
