Implementing Granger causality for 2 binary event timeseries

I am trying to understand how to implement granger causality to binary valued timeseries data (0/1). I only found one other question on here at Granger Causality Analog for Binary Time Series , but the answer is difficult to comprehend for implementation. I couldn't understand if I need to transform my 0/1 timeseries to start with. I do not have a strong math background which makes the answer harder to understand.
