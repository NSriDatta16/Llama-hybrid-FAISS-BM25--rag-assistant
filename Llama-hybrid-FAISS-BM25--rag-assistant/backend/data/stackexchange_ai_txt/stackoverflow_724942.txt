MD5 Code Coverage

I'm currently implementing an MD5 hash algorithm based RSA data security code, in the UpdateData method there is a section which reads: mCount[0] += (length I'm trying at the moment to understand how the if statement could ever evaluate to true (the mCount[0] value is initialised to 0). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
