How to do data augmentation for Machine Learning on statistical data?

I am training machine learning classification model. I have data in csv format with lets say 5 features(or columns) and 100 such observations(or rows). I want to add more similar data to improve my model accuracy. I do not have more data from original source. I did data augmentation on images in deep learning where I performed brightness(-/+), rotate, flip. But I do not know how to do such exercise in ML. Please help.
