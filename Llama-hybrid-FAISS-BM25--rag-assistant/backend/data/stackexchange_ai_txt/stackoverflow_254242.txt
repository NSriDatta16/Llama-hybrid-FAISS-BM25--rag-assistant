The first thing I noticed in your source code is that you've got most of your game logic is in the main.cpp file, with the nesting going as deep as 11 tabs! For code organizational purposes, this is a nightmare. Of course, I did this too on my first game. :) The first thing you can do is simplify your main game loop to look something like this: int main () { game_object gob; gob.init_allegro(); gob.load_assets(); while(true) { gob.handle_inputs() if (!gob.update()) break; gob.render(); } gob.cleanup(); } Everything else should be refactored into your game_object class. It will be much easier to manage this way, also your code might actually fit on the page since you can avoid deep nesting. If you find your code getting more than 3 tabs deep, then whatever you are doing needs to be refactored into another method or even a separate class. My second suggestion would be to replace your goto's with something a little more sane like this: bool playerwins = check_win_condition(); if(playerwins) { // win condition code } else { // lose condition code }
