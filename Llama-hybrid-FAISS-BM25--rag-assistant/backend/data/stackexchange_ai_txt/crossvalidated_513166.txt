Determining the Weight of Categorical Variable's Coefficient

Lately, I have been studying about Logistic Regression, and I came across a question on how to handle categorical variable (as opposed to numerical ones). Let's suppose I have a data table with two independent variables, and one dependent variable (the classification). Also, let's say one of the independent variables holds a numerical value, and the other one holds a categorical value. So the first one can be something like age, and the second one would be something like education level (high school, undergraduate, masters, phd). To my knowledge, in order to perform logistic regression on this data set, I have to make the categorical variable into binary variable. So instead of 2 independent variables, I would have 5 independent variables (using the example I gave above, it would turn from [age, education] to [age, highschool, undergraduate, masters, phd] which the latter 4 would hold binary value. Once logistic regression is done, it would give each variable a coefficient, a weight. Now in this case, I would have coefficient for each [highschool, undergraduate, masters, phd]. And here, I have a question: In this case, would the 'weight' of the categorical variable (education) be the sum of 4 coefficients from [highschool, undergraduate, masters, phd] ? In other words, how would I measure the 'weight' (importance) of the categorical variable?
