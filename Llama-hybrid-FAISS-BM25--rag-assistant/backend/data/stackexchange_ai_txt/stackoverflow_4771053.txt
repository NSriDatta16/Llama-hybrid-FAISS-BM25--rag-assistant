I have been playing around with this a bit at work and I think it could give you a head start on a jquery form builder that knows how to serialize and deserialize itself. I think it serializes the form to a string rather than JSON, but it's a start. http://www.botsko.net/blog/2009/04/07/jquery-form-builder-plugin/ A google search found me sites.google.com/site/daveschindler/jquery-html5-storage-plugin which says that it stores things in HTML 5 storage with a fallback to cookies if the browser does not support it. Another thought: If the goal in using local storage is for users not to lose work that they don't yet want to publish, another option could be to implement seperate "save" and "publish" buttons so you still save the user's work on the server side but let them retain "drafts" till they're ready to publish, and this way it wouldn't matter which browser or PC they use. Hope this helps.
