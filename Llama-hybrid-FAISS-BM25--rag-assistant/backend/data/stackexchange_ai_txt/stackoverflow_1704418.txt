+1 from me. I think this is a great question. I don't have a specific answer for you, but why not direct your attention toward looking for something that could be of use for charities or developing countries? Charities are becoming increasing dependant on technology for raising funds, managing logistics, etc. Also, in Africa mobile phones are used a lot to provide simple financial products that enable people without access to more traditional financial services to buy and sell things. If you've got the time and the desire, doing something that really benefits the world as well as getting you a great degree would be very satisfying.. Daniel.
