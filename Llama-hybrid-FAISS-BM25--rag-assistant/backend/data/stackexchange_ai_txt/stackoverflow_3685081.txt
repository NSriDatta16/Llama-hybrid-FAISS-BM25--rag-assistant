What makes this complex, I think, is that #{myBean.dynamicHTMLContent} isn't quite HTML content but JSF content. I think the most flexible solution would be to write your own JSF component. Perhaps someone will correct me, but I don't think there's a way to replace text like {niceImage} JSF code. There's some articles about this: http://www.theserverside.com/news/1364786/Building-Custom-JSF-UI-Components http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jsf1/ http://www.theserverside.com/news/1364786/Building-Custom-JSF-UI-Components http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnavh.html http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jsf4/ https://matthiaswessendorf.wordpress.com/2008/02/29/custom-jsf-components-with-facelets/ I'm no JSF expert, but you could probably: extend org.ajax4jsf.MediaOutput parse out all the text in curly braces replace things like niceImage with references to #{myBean.generateNiceImage} or whatever forward the actual work to the superclass, org.ajax4jsf.MediaOutput Hope that helps!
