You don't need any new APIs to get the performance gains of EXI. All the EXI testing and performance measurements the W3C has conducted use the standard SAX APIs built into the JDK. For the latest tests, see http://www.w3.org/TR/exi-evaluation/#processing-results . EXI parsing was on average 14.5 times faster than XML in these tests without any special APIs. One day, if people think its worthwhile, we may see some typed XML APIs emerge. If and when that happens, you will get even better performance from EXI. However, this is not required to get excellent performance like that reported by the W3C.
