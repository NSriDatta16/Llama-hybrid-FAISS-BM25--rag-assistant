ASN.1 fits the definition of "good general purpose binary network protocol definition framework". It's also standardized by ITU-T, so there's a lot of existing tools and libraries for various languages. The DER encoding is suitable for efficient network communications, the XER encoding for human-readable (and writable) permanent storage.
