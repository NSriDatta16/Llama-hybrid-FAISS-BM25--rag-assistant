How can we set the visibility of a button placed inside a Infragistrics Windows Grid control

I have a form where i have used Infragistics windows grid control to display the data. In this, i have placed a button on one of the cell. I want to set its visibility either True or False based on the row condition. I have handled the InitializeRow event of UltraWinGrid control and able to disable the button. But i am unable to set the button's visible to False.
