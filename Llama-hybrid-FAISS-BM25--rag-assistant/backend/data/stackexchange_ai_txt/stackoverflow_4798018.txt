I decided to turn my comment into an answer. I would suggest that you don't store your text data in Solr/Lucene. Only index the data for searching and store a unique ID or URL to identify the document. The contents of the document should be fetched from a separate storage system. Solr/Lucene are optimized for searches. They aren't your data warehouse or database, and they shouldn't be used that way. When you store more data in Solr than necessary, you negatively impact your entire search system. You bloat the size of indices, increase replication time between masters and slaves, replicate data that you only need a single copy of, and waste cache memory on document caches that should be leveraged to make search faster. So, I would suggest 2 things. First, optimally, remove the text storage entire from your search index. Fetch the preview text and whole text from a secondary system that is optimized for holding documents, like a file server. Second, sub-optimal, only store the preview text in your search index. Store the entire document elsewhere, like a file server.
