How to include handle days with no delivery?

I am currently trying to forecast the delivery of cash to branches. The problem I face is that there are a few days, as well as most Sundays, in which there are no deliveries. Hence, in the time series for those dates I have zeroes. I am using a years worth of data for the training set and wish to apply the forecast to the following year. Additionally, it is daily data. The forecast technique I am using is the ARIMA model. I have used the auto.arima function. However, the accuracy I have has been horrible - I am under the impression I am doing something incorrectly. Will the these dates of no deliveries cause an error in the forecast? Updated: Using seasonality of one week. The following is the plot of the time series (actual vs. fitted) My assumptions from ACF and PACF is that it is stationary. I am new to ARIMA forecasting. Updated with the log of the volumes and na.action=na.pass The following is the code used: library(tseries) library(ggplot2) library(forecast) library(readxl) ##Data to time-series and incorporating seasonality data = ts(Volume,frequency = 7) ##correlograms acftest = acf(data, na.action = na.pass) pacftest = pacf(data, na.action = na.pass) ##Arima Forecast arimaf = auto.arima(data) #results resultsfUL= data.frame(cbind(time(Trial_Dataset4log$Date),(Trial_Dataset4log$Volume),(acx))) names(resultsf)
