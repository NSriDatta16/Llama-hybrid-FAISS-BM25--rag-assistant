To quote from a paper by Robert West : The Bayes Factor (BF) is a ratio showing the degree to which a set of data (even just one data point), changes the probability that a given hypothesis (H1) is true versus an alternative hypothesis (H0). If the BF is 1, then the data support (or fail to support) both hypotheses equally and are thus completely uninformative on the matter. If the BF is 3 then, given these data, H1 is three times more likely to be correct than H0. If the BF is 1/3 then H0 is three times more likely to be correct than H1. It so happens that a BF of 3 is found typically when in classical frequentist statistics the P-value would be 0.05 on the same data, and so 3 and 1/3 are used commonly as thresholds for statements that there is substantial evidence for one or other hypothesis being correct [3]. For different decisions one may wish to use different thresholds. Suppose one has undertaken a study of 300 people (150 in each group) comparing gradual and abrupt methods for smoking cessation and finds an odds ratio favouring abrupt cessation of 1.56 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.77–3.11, P = 0.22]. Thus, using the classical hypothesis testing approach, we would say there was no statistically significant difference and researchers often conclude that there is ‘no effect’. With a Bayesian approach we can go further. We could specify in advance two hypotheses: H0 as the hypothesis that the odds ratio in the population is 1 (i.e. there is no difference), and H1 as the hypothesis that there is a clinically useful and plausible advantage to abrupt cessation of something between 1.1 and 3.0. We can calculate a BF to tell us which of these is most likely from the data and by how much. In fact, it turns out to be 1.5, which means that H1 is 50% more likely than H0. The appropriate conclusion, then, is that the data favour the hypothesis of a clinically important difference relative to none at all, but not strongly. This is more informative than simply concluding that there is no statistically significant difference and more accurate than asserting that there is ‘no effect’.
