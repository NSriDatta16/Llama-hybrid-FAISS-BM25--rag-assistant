Have you tried using a more explicit binding? Caliburn can only do automatic binding on certain elementtypes, and I guess Infragistics TabGroupPane is not one of them! I guess you have to use something like this: }/> Note: This is just used as an example, not sure if ItemSource is the correct property!
