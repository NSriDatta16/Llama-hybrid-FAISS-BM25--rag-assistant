How to use jQuery to hide some content within a DIV tag

I need to display list of news items from a database on a web form. I would like to display a fixed amount of data (say a certain height or number of characters) for each item on page load and then have a MORE button that would then display the full paragraph. I have seen how to use hide or slideUP/Down to hide the whole DIV tag, but how do you just hide part of it? Thank you.
