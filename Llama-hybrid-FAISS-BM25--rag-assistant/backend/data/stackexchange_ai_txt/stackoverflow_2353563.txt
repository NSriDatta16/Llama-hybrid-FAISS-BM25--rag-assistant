To my knowledge, it is not possible for Flex to talk directly to MySQL or any database, for that matter. You must use web services in conjunction with HTTPService or use something like Spring BlazeDS . In general, your concerns about scale should focus on whatever web service/server side configuration you pursue. In these cases the same rules apply as in your average web applications: use proper database indices, use caching if you're running the same queries repeatedly (and your data is not changing that quickly), denormalize if your joined queries are bogged down, shard or partition your if your tables have locking issues or have grown too large to easily back up and manage.
