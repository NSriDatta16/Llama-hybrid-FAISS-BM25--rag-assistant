How do I add buttons to the Eclipse toolbar?

I'm on about my sixth version of Eclipse now, but I've never been able to work out how to add a button to the toolbar. For example, by default I have a little "open type" button in the Java perspective, and I would like to add an "open type hierarchy" button right next to it. Both functions are available right next to each other on the Navigate menu, and I would simply like to drag one of them onto a toolbar as well. Doesn't seem so far fetched to me? I've tried the "customize perspective" by right-clicking the toolbars, but to no avail. I seem to be able to add stuff that I don't want. Any ideas? I happen to be using Eclipse 3.4.2 M20081224-0800 , but I've never gotten anywhere with this in multiple versions. Thank you.
