Drag N Drop controls in a GridPanel

I have been fooling around with dragging and dropping controls in a grid panel in delphi 2010. Move a panel/button/whateever the contents are from one cell to another cell. Replacing existing or swapping places. I have not figured out how I know which cell was dropped on because they work with column indexes and also row indexes. so if I have a gridpanel which has 3 columns and 3 rows, and I have a button in cell 1/1... and I drag that button from 1/1 into 3/3 how can I get that cell location from the dragdrop event? I get the x,y coords on the drop but how can I determine the cell from that?
