This might not be the best way but I solved the problem. Here is my new code for the method. public void Install(final String name,View view) { //prompts user to accept any installation of the apk with provided name printstatus("Installing apk please accept permissions"); Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW); intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(new File (Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/ContentManager/" + name)), "application/vnd.android.package-archive"); startActivity(intent); try { Thread.sleep(1500); } catch (InterruptedException e1) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e1.printStackTrace(); } for(int i=0;i I created a loop that will wait until the window is in the front to let the method continue executing. The garbage collector and thread sleeping prevents it from slowing down the system or the Linux kernel killing the process. The sleep before the loop is needed so the package manager has time to start before the loop begins.
