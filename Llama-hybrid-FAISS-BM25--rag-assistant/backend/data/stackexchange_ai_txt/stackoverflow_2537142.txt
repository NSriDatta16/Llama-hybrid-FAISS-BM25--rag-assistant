i use a text file with one sql statement per line. the TestFixtureSetUp method reads this file (line by line) and executes each sql statement with ADO.NET's IDbCommand: something like: using (IDbConnection cnn = OpenConnection(connectionString)) foreach (string line in ReadFile(sqlFile)) using (IDbCommand cmd = cnn.CreateCommand()) { cmd.CommandText = line; cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); } you might also want to have a look at something like SQL Installer.NET
