If a fullworthy SQL database server is not an option for some reason, then you can always use an embedded SQL database server, like JavaDB , H2 or SQLite . It that is also even not an option, then you can always head to a textbased file in a predefinied format like CSV, XML or even JSON. There are lot of tools available which can convert between Java objects and CSV, XML and JSON. Even more, it's relatively easy to homegrow it. If that is even not an option for some odd reason, then you can as last resort use Java serialization . At least, HTML is definitely not a suitable format for "data storage".
