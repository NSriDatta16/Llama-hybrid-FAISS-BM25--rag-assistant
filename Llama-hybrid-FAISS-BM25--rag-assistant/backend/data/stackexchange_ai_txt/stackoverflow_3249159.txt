It won't work, also because of proxies. If two people with the same user agent visit, then it's disaster. Some projects can do "cookieless sessions" by passing the session id in a GET variable in all URLs that they use. PHP can actually do this by itself. And you can even force PHP to not use cookies at all , just pass it in GET variables. But there are some drawbacks. If you invoke URLs of your application in your javascript code, you have to insert the session id there. Also, if there are external links, the session id can be made available via the referer (sic) HTTP parameter to third parties, which could result in potential session stealing. You have to be extra careful with XSS holes. You probably have to be careful with session fixation happening during the login procedure of your application. And so on.
