How to find similar phrases

I have the following problem: I have created a customized Dictionary for getting used in some NLP tasks. I want to enhance my dictionary by finding phrases similar to the phrases I have in my dictionary. For example: Lets say I have a phrase: - take responsibility then, I should be able to find phrases like: - hold accountable for -responsible for I have just started learning NLP and I tried Word2Vec model over my dictionary but it only gives similar words that are already present in the dictionary. Is there any other algorithm that helps me find similar phrases using multiple sources.
