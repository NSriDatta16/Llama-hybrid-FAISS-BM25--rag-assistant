The only thing I run as part of my regular build is Nunit, and some simple tweaks to deal with version maintenance. My view is that the rest of the tools are useful when trying to solve a specific problem , but that you shouldn't spend all your time worrying about arbitrary numbers, "zone of pain", etc. Don't get me wrong - I very much use the other tools (or variants of them, such as dotTrace) - but more "on demand" (with code coverage being the most regular that I use).
