The phrasing any of the features of interest was more likely to occur than no feature of interest: 48 paragraphs with features, 12 features without, p suggests to me a test of the null hypothesis that the probability of a paragraph's having some feature of interest is one-half, using the binomial distribution. Why that null hypothesis should be of particular interest is another question.
