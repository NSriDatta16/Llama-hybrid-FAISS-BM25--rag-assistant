Why do my GaussianProcessRegressor prediction results converge to 0?

I am using sklearn GaussianProcessRegressor to predict a time series. The kernel I use is this: ExpSineSquared(periodicity = 30)*RBF() + RBF() + RationalQuadratic() + WhiteKernel() . The independent variables I use are a 2D-array consists of [Date, Hour]. I set periodicity = 30 because I think 30 days is a period. I have done normalization on the dependent variable y. I am using the first 70% data in the time series to predict the last 30% data. The result is as below: The x-axis is the time difference from the first datapoint (minutes) and then divided by 15 so a full day has 96 points. The blue line is the real observation and the dash line is the prediction. The prediction results of first several days are OK. But I found that as the date increases, the amplitude become smaller and smaller and finally the prediction results of the model converge to 0. Could anyone explain this to me and how should I fix it to avoid the convergence? update: I have plotted the 95% confidence interval as the pink region.
