Avoiding too many submits to the page

I have an HTML page in which a table with innumerable no of cells are placed all over the page. In detail a employees 24 hour day schedule is divided into 30 min cell means 48 cells in row by 100 employees on average. Each cell on click opens a popup which on submit submits the whole page again.This is been in use since ages but a new client wants this should happen after all the random popups modfications are complete(means all changes should happen only once). This is mostly written in java,javascript with a custom framework.My qusetion is what is the dual approach for this kind of situation. Most generic answeres I researched is AJAX implementation but i feel some tweaking inside the javascript might fulfill the requirement.
