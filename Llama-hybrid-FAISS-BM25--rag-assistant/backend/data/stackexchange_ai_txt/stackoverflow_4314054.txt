Real World Windows Azure Costing Examples, Anyone?

OK, we're in Dec 2010, azure has been out now for a decent period. Sure I've come across silly articles predicting what it might costs to run with Azure (http://robburke.net/2010/01/28/windows-azures-pricing-model-discourages-small-scale-apps/). But what I'd really like to know is who has run Real World Live Azure Apps? What did your applications looks like - which services, how many roles, what storage, how many users etc. and ultimately how much did it cost you? Right now, trying to figure out whether to invest 6 months in developing an azure app is looking grim because it's such a black box predicting what is might costs to run an application. I'm surprised I couldn't find a good real world set of examples that would help developers have more visibility into helping them buy into the platform...
