In my job we have a system with a generic data structure that can be described as a tree. That means that recursion is a very effective technique to work with the data. Solving it without recursion would require a lot of unnecessary code. The problem with recursion is that it is not easy to follow what happens. You really have to concentrate when following the flow of execution. But when it works the code is elegant and effective.
