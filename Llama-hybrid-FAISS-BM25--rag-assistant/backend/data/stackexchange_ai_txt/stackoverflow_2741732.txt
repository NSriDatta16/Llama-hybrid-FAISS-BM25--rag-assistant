The entire point of your fragment shader is to decide what the output color is. How you do that depends on what you are trying to do. You might choose to set things up so that you get an interpolated color based on the output of the vertex shader, but a more common approach would be to perform a texture lookup in the fragment shader using texture coordinates passed in the from the vertex shader interpolants. You would then modify the result of your texture lookup according to your chosen lighting calculations and whatever else your shader is meant to do and then write it into gl_FragColor.
