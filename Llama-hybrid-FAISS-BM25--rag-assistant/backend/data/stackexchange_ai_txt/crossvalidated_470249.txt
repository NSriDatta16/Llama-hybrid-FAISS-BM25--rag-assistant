It seems like you'd be interested in reading about Bayesian hierarchical modeling , as that seems well suited for your kind of problem where you know something about the hyperparameters and hyperpriors. I don't know too too much about it, but I'm sure there's loads of stuff online to better understand it, and your problem seems like a classic problem it deals with.
