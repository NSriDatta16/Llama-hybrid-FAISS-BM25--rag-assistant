i tried $("#openxfrag").width() ,but it always return the same width that is defined in css Why wouldn't it? If you're assigning it a width in the CSS, then that's the width it'll have ! If you want its width to be dictated by its contents, you'll have to avoid specifying a width... and you'll have to make it shrink-wrap the contents . Only then can you expect $("#openfrag").width() to do something useful.
