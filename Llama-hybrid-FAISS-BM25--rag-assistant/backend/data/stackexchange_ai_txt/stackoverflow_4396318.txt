I see nothing particularly hackish in using hidden fields. If your concern is about security (you don't want that the end user is able to tamper with the data) you'll have to use some sort of persistent server-side storage such as a database or a PHP session. Whatever approach you choose, make sure your app doesn't break when the user opens several tabs.
