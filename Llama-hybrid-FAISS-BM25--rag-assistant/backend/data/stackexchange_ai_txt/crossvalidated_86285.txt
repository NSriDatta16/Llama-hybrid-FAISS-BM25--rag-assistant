Random number-Set.seed(N) in R

I realize that one uses set.seed() in R for pseudo-random number generation. I also realize that using the same number, like set.seed(123) insures you can reproduce results. But what I don't get is what do the values themselves mean. I am playing with several functions, and some use set.seed(1) or set.seed(300) or set.seed(12345) . What does that number mean (if anything)- and when should I use a different one. Example, in a book I am working through- they use set.seed(12345) when creating a training set for decision trees. Then in another chapter, they are using set.seed(300) for creating a Random Forest. Just don't get the number.
