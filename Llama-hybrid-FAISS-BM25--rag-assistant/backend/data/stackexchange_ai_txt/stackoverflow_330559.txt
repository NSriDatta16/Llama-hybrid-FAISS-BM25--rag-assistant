Java Statistics Package? (Markov Chains and advanced distributions)

I'm having trouble searching for a decent Java library that provides Markov chains, and other advanced distributions (as in, statistics). I've found http://sourceforge.net/projects/hydra-mcmc/ on source forge, and it looks somewhat useable, but does anyone know / use a more up-to-date package? (Haven't really have a trove through this package, but one would assume a more well maintained package would be desirable). Anyone able to make a suggestion?
