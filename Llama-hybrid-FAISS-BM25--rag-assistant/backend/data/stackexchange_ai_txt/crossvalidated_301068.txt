Update: I looked again at the documnetataion for glmnet and found that the beta returned by cvglmnet (CVerr.glmnet_fit) is "a fitted glmnet object for the full data". So I think this answers my question.. The beta coefficients returned by cvglmnet is neither (a) nor (b), but it is the result of running glmnet again on the whole training dataset. I think I had also misunderstood how to select optimal parameters from cross-validation as I mentioned in my second paragraph. We do not use the optimal parameters (lambda, alpha, beta-coefficients) from just one fold that gave the highest performane, but rather retrain the whole training dataset with the hyperparameters (lambda, alpha) to get a new set of beta-coefficients. And this is the beta returned by cvglmnet? If anyone could confirm that what I found is correct, that would be very appreciated!
