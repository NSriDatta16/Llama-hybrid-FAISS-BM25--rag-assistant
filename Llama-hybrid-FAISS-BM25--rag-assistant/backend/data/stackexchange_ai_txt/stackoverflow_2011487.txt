How to package Maven 2 generated-classes by Cobertura?

i have a Maven 2 project setup which nicely packages a war file using a pom.xml now i want to introduce Cobertura to that. I can succesfully instrument the classes but when i want to package the instrumented classes and deploy them to my jboss server the wrong files are being packaged. My target tree looks like this: \target \target\classes --> contains non instrumented classes \target\cobertura \target\generated-classes \target\generated-classes\cobertura --> contains the instrumented classes Whenever i try to package my war it packages the \target\classes and not the \target\generated-classes\cobertura is there a way to force the packaging to use the files which are located in \target\generated-classes\cobertura ??
