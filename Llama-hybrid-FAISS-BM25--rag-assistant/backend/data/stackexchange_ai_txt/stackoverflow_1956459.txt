Using define_method to define global methods outside of a module

I'd like to write this: [:p, :h1, :h3].each do |tag| define_method(tag) { |text| " #{text} " } end It's just some simple methods to wrap text in HTML tags. I want to be able to use these methods in the rest of the script. Unfortunately the define_method method seems to only work inside of a module. But if I did this inside a module, I wouldn't be able to cleanly write p "This is a paragraph." , it'd be something like HTML::p "This is a paragraph." which would be pretty terrible. So how do I define methods like this globally?
