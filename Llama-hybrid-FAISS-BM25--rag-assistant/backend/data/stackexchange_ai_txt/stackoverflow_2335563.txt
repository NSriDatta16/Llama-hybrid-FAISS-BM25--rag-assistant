Look up threading.Timer and pexpect . If you don't want to install pexpect, you can use subprocess.Popen instead. EDIT: In response to the comment: import os from signal import SIGTERM, SIGKILL os.kill(pid, SIGTERM) #you can also send SIGKILL instead of SIGTERM. #You might also have to put this call in a try block and catch OSError #Only available on *NIX EDIT2: If you want to hand-roll the packet capture, use pypcap . This should almost certainly do what you want, since tcpdump uses libpcap itself.
