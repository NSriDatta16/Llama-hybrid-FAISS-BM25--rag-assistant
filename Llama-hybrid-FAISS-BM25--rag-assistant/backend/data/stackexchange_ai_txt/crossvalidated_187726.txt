Calculating Median of Different Data Groups?

Bear with me here. I'm a newbie at this. Let's say we have this data : +----------+------------+---------+---------+-----+ | regions | # of orgs | metric1 | metric2 | ... | +----------+------------+---------+---------+-----+ | region 1 | 220 | 9800 | ... | ... | | region 2 | 18 | 1000 | ... | ... | | region 3 | 190 | 5400 | ... | ... | | region 4 | 33 | 900 | ... | ... | | ... | | | | | | region x | | | | | +----------+------------+---------+---------+-----+ For example, in geographical region #1 , we have 220 organization where their median number of customer (i.e. metric1) is 9800 . Now, we have 13 geographical regions that we are interested in, and we want to show metric1 (the median) for each group. Also, we want to show the median for ALL the regions . My question is: How to calculate the median for all organizations in all regions? Two answers came to us: Combine all data (# of customers) from all organizations, and we calculate the median like we did for each region. There is one problem, the size of the regions is not the same , which made us think that the result will be biased towards the large regions (region 1 & 3). Calculate the median for each region, then calculate the median of the regions' median values. This will remove the bias (we think) but we are not sure if this a valid thing to do , statistically speaking. Could you please advise us on the correct way to calculate the median without introducing bias?
