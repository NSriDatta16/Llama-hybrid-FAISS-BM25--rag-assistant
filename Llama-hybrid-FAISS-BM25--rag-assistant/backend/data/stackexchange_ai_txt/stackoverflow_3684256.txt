The solution ended up being that I had to properly set the IFRAME to have Application security level access, granting it privileges to use handle app-storage urls properly. For those interested in knowing how you can go about doing this, the first step is to simply have the IFRAME file you wish to load directly in the application's main directory: The key difference in this sandbox is that it doesn't have the parameter sandboxRoot . It's worth noting that I never once experienced any security errors during any of my testing. It seemed as though the app-storage URL was just not properly being handled by AIR itself.
