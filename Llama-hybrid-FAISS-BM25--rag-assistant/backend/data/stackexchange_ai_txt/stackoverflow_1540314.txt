There is no standard for US banks' account numbers. IBAN is not used in the US. There is a limit for ACH transactions (4-17 digits), but not all transactions have to be ACH. And yes, the US banking system is antiquated. I'm looking at a DW (Data Warehouse) of 38 different systems at a bank and the length of account varies widely depending on the product. Several of the systems have alphabetic characters in the account numbers. This is probably irrelevant since they are special types of customer accounts like brokerage accounts and other things which aren't accessible through ACH - you need to specify what kind of account you're interested in. If you restrict yourself to accounts which you can get to through ACH, you can simply restrict to numeric digits. You can get a lot more information about ACH at: http://www.nacha.org/
