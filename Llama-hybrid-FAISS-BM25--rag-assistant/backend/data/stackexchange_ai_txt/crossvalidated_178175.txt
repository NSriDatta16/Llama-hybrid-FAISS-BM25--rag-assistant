PCA is focused on linear correlation, while interdependence is a much wider concept that encompasses all possible ways that variables may depend on each other. The typical example for demonstrating this, is having data points in two dimensions arranged in a circle. Although these two variables are dependent in a very structured way, their correlation is zero. In addition, applying PCA would only result in a rotated circle, essentially provding no useful information. Copulas can describe more complex dependencies, but this is utlimately determined by the copula family in question. Some copula families are good for modelling symmetirc tail dependence, while other may be good for modelling asymmetric dependence etc. In order to simulate variables that conform to an observed joint pdf, you will have to first apply the probability integral transform to all your variables i.e. pass each dimension through its respective empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf). This leaves you with the dataset's dependence structure in the unit domain i.e. all variables now range from 0 to 1. This is your empirical copula. You can either simulate from this directly or you can choose to fit a parametric copula to your data. There are many copula families such as Gaussian, student-t, Gumbel, Clayton etc. A goodness-of-fit test should be performed to determine which parametric copula fits best. After having simulated from your parametric or empirical copula you have to apply the inverse probability trasnform to all your sampled observations i.e. pass each variable through its inverse ecdf (as caluclated from your original data in the actual domain). This way you end up with a new sampled observation that follows exactly the original ecdf's and its dependence structure conforms to the fitted copula. Finally, perform a two-sample test between you original and sampled population to evaluate your null hypothesis (original and sampled data originate from statistically indistinguishable models)
