I ran into something similar. According to various resources, including http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/offline/takingappoffline/ , cross-domain requests are not possible. EDIT: And from http://diveintohtml5.ep.io/offline.html The network section in this cache manifest also has just a single line, a line that contains just a single character (*). This character has special meaning in a network section. It’s called the “online whitelist wildcard flag.” That’s a fancy way of saying that anything that isn’t in the appcache can still be downloaded from the original web address, as long as you have an internet connection. EDIT 2: While looking into another cache issue I'm seeing I found this other Stack Overflow question: cache google map with HTML5 for iphone offline use error . See in particular the only answer to the question.
