Write-Verbose output that doesn't wrap to command width in Powershell

I'd like to Write-Verbose a lot of data to an out file. Here's how I'm doing it. Start-Transcript -Path $TargetDir\RunUnitTests.log -Width 1000000 Write-Verbose "five million character lines and stuff" This works great, except that the output is auto wrapped to the standard width of a console, this makes the log look absolutely terrible. I found a solution here dead link removed , but it's so involved and complicated that I don't want to just throw this in my script below a comment #Thar be dragons . Is there a better way to do this?
