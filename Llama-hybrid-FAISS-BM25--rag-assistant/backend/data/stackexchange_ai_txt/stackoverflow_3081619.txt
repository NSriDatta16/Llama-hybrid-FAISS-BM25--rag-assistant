Need "Processes with Network Activity" functionality in managed code - Like resmon.exe does it

I am needing to collect a list (In C#) of processes which currently (Or within the past x secs) have have network activity, the names of the processes, and the qty of data sent (Pretty much EXACTLY what is shown on the new Windows 7 Resource Monitor under the network tab). I know I could use WinPCap to write a complete sniffer myself, But I would prefer not to have the overhead, and I figured if I could do it the same way that win7 resmon.exe does it, I would be ahead of the game - Anyone have any info on how to do that in managed code without WinPCap? Even if its not managed code, I would be happy to wrap it.
