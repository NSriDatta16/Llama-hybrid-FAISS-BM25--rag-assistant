ssh-add and ssh (assuming you are using the openssh implementations) require an environment variable to know how to talk to the ssh agent. If you started the agent in a different command prompt window to the one you're using now, or if you started it incorrectly, neither ssh-add nor ssh will see that environment variable set (because the environment variable is set locally to the command prompt it's set in). You don't say which version of ssh you're using, but if you're using cygwin's, you can use this recipe from SSH Agent on Cygwin : # Add to your Bash config file SSHAGENT=/usr/bin/ssh-agent SSHAGENTARGS="-s" if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" -a -x "$SSHAGENT" ]; then eval `$SSHAGENT $SSHAGENTARGS` trap "kill $SSH_AGENT_PID" 0 fi This will start an agent automatically for each new command prompt window that you open (which is suboptimal if you open multiple command prompts in one session, but at least it should work).
