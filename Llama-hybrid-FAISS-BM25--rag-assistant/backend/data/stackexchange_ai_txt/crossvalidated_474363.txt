Corrections for logistic regression (multiple comparisons?)

I'll cut to the chase. Here's what I'm doing: looking at the influence of water temperature and salinity on the presence of water-borne parasites for a certain estuarine bird population birds are checked for parasites 3 times a year for 5 years (Spring, Summer, Fall) this is mark-recapture, and some birds are sampled multiple times across years and seasons logistic regression is for water temp and salinity predicting parasites Since some birds are included multiple times in my dataset (some twice a year, and many in multiple years), would it be wise to correct for multiple comparisons (Boneffori?) or am I thinking about this the wrong way? Thanks!
