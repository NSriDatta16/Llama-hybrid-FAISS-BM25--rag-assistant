Polling layer is used to extract the more finer information from data(and size reduction is its byproduct). Think this as following, On last dropout layer, you have (None, 25, 128) dims, which is nothing but 128 filters, each of 25 dims. As each filter carries information about input text. Pooling will helps to get rid of redundant or irrelevant information, which further helps Dense layer to focus on the more finer information of data. Note: Even concatenating outputs from Max-Polling and Global-Average-Polling, gives comparable result, in case of CNN1D. For more info
