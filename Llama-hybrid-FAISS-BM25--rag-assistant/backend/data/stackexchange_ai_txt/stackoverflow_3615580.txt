I'd upvote the answer using "subset" if I had the reputation for it :-) . You can also use a logical vector directly for subsetting -- no need for "which": d I'm surprised to find the logical version a little faster in at least one case. (I expected the "which" version might win due to R possibly preallocating the proper amount of storage for the result.) > d system.time(d[which(d$y == 0), ]) user system elapsed 0.119 0.067 0.188 > system.time(d[d$y == 0, ]) user system elapsed 0.049 0.024 0.074
