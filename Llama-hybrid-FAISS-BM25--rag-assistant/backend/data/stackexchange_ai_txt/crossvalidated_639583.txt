With a simple yes/no for infection status of each leaf piece, this should be handled OK by a binomial (e.g., logistic) regression, with the two-column outcome variable that you show in a comment. Incorporating Plant as a random effect will take the lack of independence of results within individual plants into account. Treating Days as numeric might get you into trouble. Numeric coding means that you are assuming a linear association between Days and the outcome (log-odds of a leaf piece being infected if you use logistic regression). That's probably unrealistic. With only 3 values possible for Days it's simplest to treat it as a 3-level categorical predictor, allowing each day to have its own association with outcome. Whether and how to adjust for Leaf_size depends on your experimental setup and your understanding of the subject matter. If I understand the experimental setup correctly, it seems that a smaller leaf will tend to have fewer pieces placed into the Petri dish; that provides one type of correction (higher variance in proportion estimates with fewer leaf pieces). If you think that the probability of a leaf piece being infected depends on Leaf_size , other things being equal, then you should use it as a predictor. As Leaf_size is a continuous predictor, you should consider flexible fitting (e.g., a regression spline) so that you don't implicitly make an assumption of a linear association with outcome. Finally, your original question used only additive terms for the predictors, but the model in a comment includes interactions among all fixed-effect predictors. I suspect that the interactions will be important, but that would depend on your understanding of the subject matter.
