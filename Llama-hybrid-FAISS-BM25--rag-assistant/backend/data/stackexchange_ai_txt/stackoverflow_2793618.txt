You don't need PHPMailer (thus the libphp-phpmailer package) to use the mail() function (also, I would recommend swiftmailer over PHPMailer anytime). Also, if you want to use the mail() function you will need a Mail Transport Agent ( MTA ). I recommend installing the postfix package (it's available by default in Ubuntu, just use sudo apt-get install postfix ). After that, your code should output Mail sent. :) -1 to the other two answers for not reading your question.
