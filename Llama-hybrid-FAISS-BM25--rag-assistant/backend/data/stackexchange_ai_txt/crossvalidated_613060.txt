While I haven't been able to find a conjugate prior, I believe the following MCMC algorithm will suffice: In each iteration $r$ : ( $r.1$ ) draw the missing elements ${X_{-c}}^r$ given $X_c, Σ^{r-1}$ , ( $r.2$ ) draw $Σ^r$ given $X_c, {X_{-c}}^r$ . Step ( $r.1$ ) just requires drawing from a Normal distribution while step ( $r.2$ ) can draw from an Inverse-Wishart as described in the original question. I believe that $Σ^r$ should converge in distribution to $Σ | X_c$ .
