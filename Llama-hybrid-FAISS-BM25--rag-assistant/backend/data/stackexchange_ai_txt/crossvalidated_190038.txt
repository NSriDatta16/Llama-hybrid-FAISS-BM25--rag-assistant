E(x) for uniform distribution

I would like to take a uniform distribution for example. Letâ€™s say a train will arrive at the station randomly within every 10 minute window, so the probability density function is $f(t)=0.1$,$\: t \in (0,10)$. The expected average waiting time for a traveller is $\int_0^{10} 0.1t \,dt \text{ minutes } = 5 \text{ minutes }$ But as we know, the probability for a single point (for example $t$ is exactly $2$ minutes) is zero, so $0\times 0+0.1\times 0+...+2\times 0+2.1\times 0+...+9.9\times 0+10\times 0=0$, any real number from the interval $(0,10)$ times its single point probability is $0$, so how come the expected average $E(t)$ is $5$ minutes?
