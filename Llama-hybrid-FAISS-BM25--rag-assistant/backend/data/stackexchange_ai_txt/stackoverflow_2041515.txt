To provide another perspective to the problem (as inferred from the title/contents of the original post): If you want to track down what is creating rogue underlines in your HTML, use a debugging tool. There are plenty to choose from: For Firefox there is FireBug; For Opera there is Dragonfly (called "Developer tools" in the Tools->Advanced menu; comes with Opera by default); For IE there is the "Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar", which is a separate download for IE7 and below, and is integrated in IE8 (hit F12). I've no idea about Safari, Chrome and other minority browsers, but you should probably have at least one of the three above on your machine anyway.
