Team City and Visual Studio 2010 and Coverage Tool

In my team we shall use Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0 as soon as possible and I have a question regarding VS 2010 and Team City. In VS2010 there is a simple tool to measure mstest coverage. Question: Is it possible to read the result of ms-Coverage from team city? If yes, how do we set up that configuration. best Regard Henrik
