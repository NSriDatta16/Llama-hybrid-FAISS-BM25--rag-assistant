It looks like you haven't copied the MPOAuth framework into your application bundle: "@executable_path/../Frameworks/MPOAuth.framework/Versions/A/MPOAuth" (file not found). The @exectuable_path is the path to your application binary inside of ".../MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS" You should create a new build phase for your target, "Copy Files Phase" that specifies the destination as "Frameworks". Drag the MPOAuth framework in your Xcode project into that path and it will be copied into the correct location. EDIT Nov 3rd, 2009: 17:59 EST : I would highly suggest reading the Xcode documentation as it saved me a ton of time when I learned how to use this tool effectively. Select "Xcode Help" from the "Help" menu while Xcode is active.
