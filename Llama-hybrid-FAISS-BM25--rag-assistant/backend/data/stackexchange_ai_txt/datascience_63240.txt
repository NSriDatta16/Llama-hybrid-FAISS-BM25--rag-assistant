You should convert the categorical variables to dummies. For each individual variable in general you want to have equal number of elements of each class, or at least the numbers should be close. If not, you can cluster smaller classes to form a larger one. For example, let's assume you have a categorical variable with 5 different categories. You want each class to be approximately %20 of the data. If it is not, you can define a new class which combines smaller classes to make each class approximately equal. For the second part, if you can actually quantify how much A1 is better than A2, or able to assign a relative value to them based on some heuristics; you can convert them to numerical variables. You can find an example of this in this notebook (section titled "Aggregating categorical variables"). It is from the course "Principles of Machine Learning: R Edition" on edX. You can watch the videos on audit mode for free; and the notebooks are on github.
