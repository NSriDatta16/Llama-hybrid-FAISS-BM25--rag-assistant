I'd have another anectode on test coverage I'd like to share. We have a huge project wherein, over twitter, I noted that, with 700 unit tests, we only have 20% code coverage . Scott Hanselman replied with words of wisdom : Is it the RIGHT 20%? Is it the 20% that represents the code your users hit the most? You might add 50 more tests and only add 2%. Again, it goes back to my Testivus on Code Coverage Answer. How much rice should you put in the pot? It depends.
