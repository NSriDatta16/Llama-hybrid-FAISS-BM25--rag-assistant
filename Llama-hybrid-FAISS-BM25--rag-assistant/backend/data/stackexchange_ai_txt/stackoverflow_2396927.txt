Perhaps SQLite where the overheads are minimal, but unless you need the indexing (fast access) and lots of storage it would be better for roll your own as SQL Server itself is overkill and heavy on system resources, not something you'd want running alongside your game. In summary, I would say no, SQL does not normally have a place in game design (client side stuff anyway).
