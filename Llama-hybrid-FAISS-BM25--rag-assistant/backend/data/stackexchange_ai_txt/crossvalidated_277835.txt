Predict multiple, potentially overlapping categories?

I have a training dataset that consists of movies that have category labels. There can be more than one label assigned to a movie. For example: Movie: Finding Nemo; Labels: children, animation Movie: Beauty and the Beast; Labels: children, fairytale, animation Movie: Ella Enchanted; Labels: fairytale, live action I want to build a model to predict labels for movies that I don't already have them for, based on a dataset of other features--not really important to the question which ones. At first I thought about using something like logistic regression with multiple classes. But, I want to allow for the possibility of more than one label being assigned. I guess I could build a model for each label, that predicts the probability that the given label describes a movie, and then choose a cutoff threshold on the probability for deciding to make the assignment. Can someone give me ideas about a better approach? Models that are built to handle this problem?
