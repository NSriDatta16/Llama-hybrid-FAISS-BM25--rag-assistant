If you are serious about developing an algorithm for a search engine, I'd seriously recommend you take a Linear Algebra course. In the absence of an in-person course, the MIT OCW course by Gilbert Strang is quite good (video lectures at http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/VideoLectures/ ). A class like this would certainly allow you to understand the mathematical symbols in the document you provide-- there's nothing in that paper that wouldn't be covered in a first-year Linear Algebra course. I know this isn't the answer you are looking for, but it's really the best option for you. Having someone try to explain the individual symbols or algorithms to you when you don't have a good grasp of the basic concepts isn't a very good use of anybody's time.
