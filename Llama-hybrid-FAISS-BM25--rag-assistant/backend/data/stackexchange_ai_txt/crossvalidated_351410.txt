After talking to many people I understood the following: Unlike more sophisticated algorithms such as Trees or Random Forest, Linear Regression doesn't have much "auto selected" functions, thus I either need to get domain knowledge in the field I write the model for or to use step() , which so far, is the only auto-selection function I know about. T-test is being shown in the summary() and is useful when I want to see if adding an individual variable is a good idea. anova() , also called the partial F-test, is useful when I want to see if adding several variables together make the model better.
