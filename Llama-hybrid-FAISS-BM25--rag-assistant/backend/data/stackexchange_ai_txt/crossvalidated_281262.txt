Logistic regression is very close to "single neuron/perceptron for classification in R". See here for details. What's the difference between logistic regression and perceptron? If you want to try logistic regression, here is an example using R glm function. > summary(glm(am~wt+hp,mtcars,family="binomial")) Call: glm(formula = am ~ wt + hp, family = "binomial", data = mtcars) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.2537 -0.1568 -0.0168 0.1543 1.3449 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 18.86630 7.44356 2.535 0.01126 * wt -8.08348 3.06868 -2.634 0.00843 ** hp 0.03626 0.01773 2.044 0.04091 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 43.230 on 31 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 10.059 on 29 degrees of freedom AIC: 16.059 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 8
