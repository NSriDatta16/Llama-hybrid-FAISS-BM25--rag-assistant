Why does my SVM take so long to run?

I am wondering can anybody spot any reason why this SVM takes so long to run. It takes days to do so where other models such as neural networks, random forest take minutes on the same dataset. I have X as a df size (111855,16) and y as a series size (111855,) Initially I had my gridsearch looking for a range of C parameters and PC components, but this took a week to run. I have reduced time by reducing the C parameter in size, choosing a less complex kernel than the default, and removing PCA but still it takes a almost 48 hours to run. Even taking the code out of the gridsearch format does not help. def SVM(X, y): SVM = SVC(kernel = 'poly') pipeline = Pipeline( [('scl', StandardScaler()), ('pca', PCA()),('clf', SVM)] ) param_grid= [dict( pca__n_components=[None], clf__C = [0.001] )] grid_search= GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid = param_grid, cv = 5) grid_search.fit(X, y) return(grid_search.best_estimator_, grid_search.best_score_)
