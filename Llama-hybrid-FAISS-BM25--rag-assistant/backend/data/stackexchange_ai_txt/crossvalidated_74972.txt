The answer is "Yes". This is Simpson's paradox applied to mean differences instead of odds ratios. You can read Wiki's article ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox ) to understand the mechanisms behind it. It's a projection problem: If you only see a two dimensional projection of a three dimensional object, you can get quite a wrong impression about the whole picture. In balanced settings (equal group sizes), this is not possible. Consider, for instance, the following simple setting: $A_1$ consists of 99 times the value 1 $A_2$ consists of the value 100 $B_1$ consists of the value -9 $B_2$ consists of the value 99 The average of $A = A_1 \cup A_2$ is about 2 and thus much smaller than the average 45 of $B = B_1 \cup B_2$. On the other hand, the average 1 of $A_1$ is larger than the average -9 of $B_1$. Similarly, the average 100 of $A_2$ is larger than the average 99 of $B_2$.
