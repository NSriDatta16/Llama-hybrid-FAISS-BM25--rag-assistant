If you split your data into smaller samples, you can definitely have your means change. If you split your data by removing all the low points, then you immediately increase your mean. The only time this will not be true is if all points are equal. Then removing points won't change the average. Note that this does not have any significance! The fact that you took a subset does not prove anything about the overall distribution or trend. It just happened. If anything, it could imply that you incorrectly split your data.
