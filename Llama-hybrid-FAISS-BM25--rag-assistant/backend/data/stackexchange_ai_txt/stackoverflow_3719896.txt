Adding const-ness after the fact in C++

Possible Duplicate: Is there some ninja trick to make a variable constant after its declaration? Consider the following minimal example: void MutateData(std::string&); int main() { std::string data = "something that makes sense to humans."; ::MutateData(data); // Mutates 'data' -- e.g., only changes the order of the characters. // At this point, 'data' should never be changed. // Mixing the above with const-correct code seems ugly. } Currently, I'm doing: namespace { std::string PrepareData(std::string data) { ::MutateData(data); return data; } } int main() { const std::string data = ::PrepareData("something that makes sense to humans."); } What are some elegant solutions to simulating const beyond the point of declaration? EDIT: I forgot to clarify that I can't easily (not my code) change MutateData .
