According to the Mobile Safari docs drag and drop is not supported, but it can be simulated. Since basically dragging your finger along will scroll the browser you will have to disable this. That can be done like this: $(document).bind('touchmove', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }, false); Otherwise the event you will have to handle are touchstart , touchmove and touchend .
