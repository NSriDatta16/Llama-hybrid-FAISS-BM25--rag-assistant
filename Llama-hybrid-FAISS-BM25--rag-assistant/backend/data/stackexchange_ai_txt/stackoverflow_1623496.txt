No, we have no intention of supporting such functionality. Currently, all memcached operations are O(1) (that includes flush). Having an operation that gives you a list of keys can't satisfy that constraint. It would require locks that will be held for the duration of the request, and give you information that may be inaccurate at the very moment you see it. It's the kind of thing people ask for frequently, but nobody has ever presented a use case where a) they needed it and b) they were using memcached in a way that wasn't harmful to their environment. Think Heisenberg uncertainty principal meets ephemeral storage.
