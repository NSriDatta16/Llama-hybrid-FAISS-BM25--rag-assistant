Results in the string "\n state \n" for each state in the array. So the output is technically correct. You could use But that's not as easy to read in your code. I've read there is a way to skip the trailing new lines but don't recall the exact method (Update: see @user156011's answer ). But the truth is - it doesn't really matter . HTML is for the browser - don't worry about how it looks. The only time you really need to pay attention is when two tags must exist one after the other without spacing to prevent browsers from injecting default whitespace - like in a series of tags sliced up from a larger image.
