Shell script to find, search and replace array of strings in a file

This is linked to another question/code-golf i asked on Code golf: "Color highlighting" of repeated text I've got a file 'sample1.txt' with the following content: LoremIpsumissimplydummytextoftheprintingandtypesettingindustry.LoremIpsumhasbeentheindustry'sstandarddummytexteversincethe1500s,whenanunknownprintertookagalleyoftypeandscrambledittomakeatypespecimenbook. I've got a script generating the following array of strings which occur in the file (only a few shown for illustration): LoremIpsum LoremIpsu dummytext oremIpsum LoremIps dummytex industry oremIpsu remIpsum ummytext LoremIp dummyte emIpsum industr mmytext I need to (from the top) see if 'LoremIpsum' occurs in file sample1.txt. If so, I want to replace all occurences of LoremIpsum with: LoremIpsum . Now, when the program moves to the next word 'LoremIpsu', it should NOT match against the LoremIpsum text inside sample1.txt. It should repeat the above for all elements of this 'array'. The next 'valid' one would be 'dummytext' and that should be tagged as dummytext . I do think it should be possible to create a bash shell script solution for this rather than relying on perl/python/ruby programs.
