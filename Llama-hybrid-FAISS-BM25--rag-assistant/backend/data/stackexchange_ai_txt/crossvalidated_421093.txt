Interrupted time series relies on correctly specifying the pre-intervention secular trends in order to detect departures-from-the-mean during the post-intervention era. An advantage of a balanced design is that a simple pre-mean adequately does that, in fact you don't even need to model time effects. Here balanced design means that ALL measures of time: relation to study start, age of participant, and calendar time are BALANCED between randomized intervention groups. Your design uses a historical control. There are no participants without control. So the imbalance in intervention time is precisely what enables modeling to summarize pre-post effects with some precision. In general, modeling time-series involves the AGE, PERIOD, and COHORT effects. All separate indices of time. There's a hefty literature on modeling so called "APC" effects. In the panel dataset, adjust for baseline age, and if necessary baseline calendar year, and adjust for a time-varying measure of time on-study, and at the point of intervention, create an indicator variable and its interaction with time on-study.
