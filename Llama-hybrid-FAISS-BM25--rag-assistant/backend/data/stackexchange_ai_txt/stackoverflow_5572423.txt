In my understanding, in openLDAP evey nod is considered as a container for every nod. You noticed that OpenLDAP prevents you from placing a bootableDevice below an organizationalUnit . In fact if you look at bootableDevice in the schema file, you will see that it's an AUXILIARY class objectClasses: ( 1.3.6.1.1.1.2.12 NAME 'bootableDevice' DESC 'A device with boot parameters' SUP top AUXILIARY MAY ( bootFile $ bootParameter ) ) So you just can't instanciate an AUXILIARY class. You can instanciate a computer and add to it, an AUXILIARY class in order to beneficiate of bootableDevice attributs in computer objects. Here is an example : In other directories, like Active-Directory the tree is partly designed in the schema. Each class has a list of class that can contain it. JP
