rb-libsvm - getting confidence of a prediction

I'm using rb-libsvm and the RBF kernel to make classifications. svm.predict(measurements) returns either -1.0 or 1.0. Is there a way to get a confidence for this classification? I am interested in throwing out low-confidence classifications and tweaking precision/recall.
