Logistic regression: how to compute a prediction interval

Suppose I have a simple logistic regression model: $log(p/(1-p)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$ Then I know: $p/(1-p) = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}$ and $p = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}/(1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x})$ How can I obtain a confidence interval for p? That is, how can I obtain a 95% confidence interval on the probability of success (would that be called a prediction interval? Maybe I'm using the wrong term)? I've looked in a few places, but I can't find the formula. For example, I've looked: here (which indicates such an interval is not of interest because each value in the response can only be 0 or 1, but that's not what I'm interested in), and here (and again, no formula, but similar question)
