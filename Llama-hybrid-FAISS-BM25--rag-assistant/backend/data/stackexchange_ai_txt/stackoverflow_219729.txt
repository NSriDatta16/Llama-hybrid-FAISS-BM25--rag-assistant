We're using FlexUnit on our project and I'm pretty happy with it. Assuming your project was designed with a fairly loose degree of coupling, you shouldn't need to change much at all (if anything) in order to test your code. If you're already using an MVC framework like Cairngorm or PureMVC , FlexUnit should integrate pretty painlessly. I will say however that my experience with Flash/Flex unit testing is not nearly as positive as it has been with other languages such as Ruby or .NET for three reasons. First being that such a high degree of actionscript code is UI related, and this sort of code is difficult if not impossible to test. Another reason is that the test runner doesn't lend itself well to being plugged into a continuous integration environment such as CruiseControl.NET or CruiseControl.rb since it requires a human to run it and click buttons. Lastly, a huge benefit of unit testing is usually that you can run it alongside a coverage analysis tool such as NCover or rcov . Flash/Flex doesn't lend itself to this sort of analysis with out a modified compiler such as Flexcover .
