"Clustering by firms" doesn't exclude OLS as a possibility. One could simply adjust for a dummy variable indicating the firm and objectively call that a "cluster". More commonly, "clustering by firm" means adding a random intercept term for firms. This is the preferred approach when the number of firms is large relatively to the sample size. Adding a random intercept makes this type of model a mixed effects model. Pooled OLS will estimate a random intercept and a random slope, thus is a more general model. However, the estimates can be very unstable when the number of observations-per-firm is small. Time can be handled using fixed effects as a dummy variable. It's better as a continuous variable. Splines interpolate dummy variables without requiring that all (or even more than 1) firm measure outcomes at exactly the same time. This can save you from binning or matching times and improves analysis significantly. You can still add a dummy variable for season if there are cyclic effects relating to time-of-year. Without a prespecified hypothesis about the impact of omitted variables, variance structures, or other things, the Hausman and Breush Pagan test make no sense in isolation. Diagnostic tests are prone to reject too often because they are simply over powered by moderate-to-large samples. It is better to use diagnostic plots like a variogram. One way to check pooled OLS vs fixed effects is to do a likelihood ratio test. They are both fully ML procedures. The numerator degrees of freedom for the pooled OLS would be $n_c * 2 + p$ where $p$ is the number of endogenous parameters (like firm type, season) and $n_c$ number of firms, 2 is the slope and intercept terms within each subOLS though they may be different.
