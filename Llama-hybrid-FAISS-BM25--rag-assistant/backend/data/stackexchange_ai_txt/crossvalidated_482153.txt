How to present seasonality in time series?

I study the temperature related mortality using daily data of 25 years and I am confused about the effect of seasonality. In many papers, the only variable is used to present seasonality is Time (Time=1:length(Data$date)), and day of the week(dow) as factor: model other papers use day of the year(doy) as factor: model and others use a variable called Season model I would like to ask what exactly is the variable "Season" and how should I present the seasonality?
