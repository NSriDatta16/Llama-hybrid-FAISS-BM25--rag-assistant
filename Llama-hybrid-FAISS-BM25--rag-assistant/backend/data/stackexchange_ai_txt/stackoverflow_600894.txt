This is a little beyond where you might be at the moment, but a CSS pixel is not necessarily exactly the same size as a single pixel on your display. According to the spec : If the pixel density of the output device is very different from that of a typical computer display, the user agent should rescale pixel values. It is recommended that the reference pixel be the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm's length. So if you have one of those incredibly expensive extra-high-resolution displays that doesn't count as “typical”, the browser and/or OS may choose to redefine what a “pixel” is. The useful definition for a ‘px’ as far as CSS authoring is concerned is: a ‘px’ is the quantity of length equal to the pixel in an unscaled HTML or CSS ‘background-image’.
