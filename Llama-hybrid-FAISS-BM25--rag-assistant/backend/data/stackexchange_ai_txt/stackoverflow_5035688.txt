jQuery Cookie plugin doesn't really seem to be setting a cookie

My code sets a cookie with javascript (using the cookie plugin for jQuery), then makes an ajax call to a php script that needs to read that cookie. It appears that the jQuery cookie plugin has a bug, because the PHP script isn't able to read this cookie. Furthermore, when I look in the Resources panel of Chrome, I don't see the cookie under the relevant domain. Additionally, if I set the cookie using the standard document.cookie method of Javascript, the cookie DOES appear in the Resources panel and my PHP script is able to read it. The main reason I want to use the jQuery plugin is because the cookie value I'm setting has line breaks, and the jQuery cookie plugin seems to handle that elegantly. It's a value that is going to be stored in a MySQL database, and those line breaks will be automatically converted to (br) and (p) tags when output. So the jQuery cookie plugin seems to give me the value I want... but not in a real cookie! Anyway, here's the code I'm using. Feel free to just tell me how to maintain the linebreaks I need without using the jQuery cookie plugin rather than trying to figure out what's going wrong with the plugin/my implementation of the plugin. Javascript: $.cookie('flavor','chocolate',{expires:7}); $.get('http://example.com/readCookie.php',function(data){ console.log(data); }); readCookie.php $myCookie = $_COOKIE['flavor']; echo $myCookie; The 'echo' statement above doesn't echo anything at all, not even an empty string. If I try var_dump with the cookie, I get NULL. I can, however, enter $.cookie('flavor') into the console and see that it was in fact set. But as I said before, it doesn't appear in the Resources panel of Chrome's developer tools, so I'm not convinced that it is actually a real cookie... and my PHP script seems to agree with that doubt as well :)
