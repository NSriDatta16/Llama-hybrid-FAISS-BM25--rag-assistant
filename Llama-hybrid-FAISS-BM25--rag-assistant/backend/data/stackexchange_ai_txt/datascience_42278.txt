Model parameters are estimated from data automatically and model hyperparameters are set manually and are used in processes to help estimate model parameters. Model hyperparameters are often referred to as parameters because they are the parts of the machine learning that must be set manually and tuned. Basically, parameters are the ones that the “model” uses to make predictions etc. For example, the weight coefficients in a linear regression model. Hyperparameters are the ones that help with the learning process. For example, number of clusters in K-Means, shrinkage factor in Ridge Regression. They won’t appear in the final prediction piece, but they have a large influence on how the parameters would look like after the learning step.
