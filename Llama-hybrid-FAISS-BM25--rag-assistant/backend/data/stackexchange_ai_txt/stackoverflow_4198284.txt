Deployment Options for Prism Apps for

Does anyone have any experience with deployment options for Prism Apps? I tried ClickOnce and found it to be too buggy and too hard for my users (With Prism 4 and .NET 4). Clearly I could just go make a normal installer using installshield or something. But what I really want is something that lets me leverage the fact that my app is in modules. Something that will allow me to re-deploy a single changed module/dll and not have to require re-deploying the whole application. Is there anything out there (besides ClickOnce) that works that way?
