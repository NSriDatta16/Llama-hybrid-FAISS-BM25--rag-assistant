As already said, the use of multiple PHP includes helps to keep your code organized, so it is not a bad idea. It will become a problem when too many includes are used, because the web server will have to perform an I/O operetation for each include you have. If you have a large web application, you can boost it using a PHP accelerator , which caches data and compiled code from the PHP bytecode compiler in shared memory. If you have lots of PHP includes in a specific file they will be performed just once. Further calls to that file will hit the cache, so no PHP require will be performed.
