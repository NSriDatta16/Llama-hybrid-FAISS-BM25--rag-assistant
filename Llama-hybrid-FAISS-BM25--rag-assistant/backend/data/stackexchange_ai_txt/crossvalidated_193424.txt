Is decision tree output a prediction or class probabilities?

A Random Forest works by aggregating the results of many decision trees. Recently, I was reading about how the RandomForest aggregates the results, and it made me question whether the results from Decision trees are a single class prediction or a probability of each class. the documentation for predict_proba says "The predicted class probabilities of an input sample is computed as the mean predicted class probabilities of the trees in the forest. The class probability of a single tree is the fraction of samples of the same class in a leaf." the part about "mean predicted class probabilities" indicates that the decision trees are non-deterministic. Furthermore, the lecture by Nando De Freitas here also talks of class probabilities at around 30 minutes. My question is - how is it possible to get class probabilities from a single decision tree? As far as I know, the default for a RandomForestClassifier in sklearn is a deterministic decision tree (for something like ExtraTreesClassifier, that is not the case). So, where do these said "class probabilities" for a single tree come from?
