The single time where you can not use a reference and must use a pointer is if you allow the concept of "no argument" by passing a null pointer. However, you might want to use pointers as arguments when you are actually storing a pointer to whatever was passed. Most C++ developpers will notice that you aren't using a reference and pay special attention to what your documentation says.
