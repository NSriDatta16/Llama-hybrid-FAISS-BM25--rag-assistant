How can I get a radiobutton to be pre-selected in ASP.NET MVC 2?

Let's say I've this public class OrganisationData { public NavigationData navigationData {get; set; } } Then public class NavigationData { public string choice {get;set;} //other properties omitted } I've this on my view x.organizationData.navigationData.choice, "1")%> //More choices The first the user gets to that view I want the first RadioButton to be pre-selected. Thanks for helping.
