Likelihood of 10000:1 probability happening exactly once in 10,000 tries

I am interested in understanding the difference between "likelihood" of a random event with a particular probability actually occurring the exact probability it is said to be likely. i.e. if an event has a 1 in 10000 probabilty, what is the likelihood that in 10000 trials it will occur exactly 1 time, not 2 times, not 0 times, not 3 times, etc. and how does one express (and account for) the deviation? If an event has a probability of 1:10,000, therefore in 100,000 trials it would then be likely to occur 10 times; in 1,000,000 trials, it would be likely to occur 100 times, but would it not be also just as likely that it occur in any given set of 1,000,000 trials any number of times, for example: 98 times, 99 times, 101 times, 96 times, 102 times, etc. Statistically speaking how many trials must be averaged and accounted for to approach a statistical certainty that a particular result is actually 1:10000, and not 1:9999 or 1:10001 or 1:10000.5, etc.?
