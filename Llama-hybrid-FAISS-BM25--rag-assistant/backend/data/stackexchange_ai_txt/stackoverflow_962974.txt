Rotate graphic towards mouse in WPF (like an analog dial)

In WPF/C# how would I rotate a "graphic" to face the current mouse position? Basically what I want is a "wheel" UI Control (like an analog volume dial ). I want to be able to click and drag the dial and it will rotate to follow the mouse. Then when I release the mouse it will stop following (obviously!). How would I create one of these? does one already exist somewhere?
