Optimal Database Structure for MicroStrategy

I have spent most of my career developing data warehouses\marts as Star Schemas because they were typically used in conjunction with Microsoft's Analysis Services. However, we are starting to leverage MicroStrategy 9.0.1, and I have been told that Star Schemas are less than optimal for this platform. MicroStrategy does not have an official stance on this topic so I thought I would ask this community. Should I still continue to use the denormalized structures, or should I consider a more normalized approach in reagards to this platform? My intent is not to start a Kimball vs. Inmon vs etc war, any real world experience would be appreciated
