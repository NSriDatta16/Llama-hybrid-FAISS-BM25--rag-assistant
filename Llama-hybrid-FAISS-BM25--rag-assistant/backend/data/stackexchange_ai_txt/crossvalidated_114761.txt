Comparing two models

I am interested in comparing two logistic regression models. The two models are nested: model 1 contains all predictors, and model 2 contains all predictors except 1. My goal is to test if removing that one variables makes the modelling significantly worse. I understand that I can use the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for the comparison. But I'm wondering if I can use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to compare the two models. Use of AIC seems more elegant, and gives stronger results in the study that I am looking at. On the other hand, I see that LRT is specifically designed for nested models. Is it acceptable to use AIC to compare the two nested models, or is the LRT test more accurate than AIC when the models are nested? Thank you, Fijoy
