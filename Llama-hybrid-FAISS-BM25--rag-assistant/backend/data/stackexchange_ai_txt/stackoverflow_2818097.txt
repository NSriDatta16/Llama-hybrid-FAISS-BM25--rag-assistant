mimicking iPhone main screen slide in JavaScript

I'd like to mimick iPhone main screen in JavaScript on Safari / Chrome / Firefox. By mimicking I mean: - Having a couple of pages - Switching between the pages by clicking & dragging / swiping with my mouse - Having those dots from the bottom iPhone main screen displaying which page it is The closest to what I want is: http://jquery.hinablue.me/jqiphoneslide/ But the sliding doesn't work nearly as good as in iPhone (i have to slide first, and the animation appears after i release the mouse button), and there are no dots at the bottom.
