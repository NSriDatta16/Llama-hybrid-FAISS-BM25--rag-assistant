Comparing two groups of time series correlation coefficients?

I have two groups of data, each consisting of 100 correlation coefficients. I am interested in essentially seeing if the correlations in group 1 are stronger than group 2. However, I am unsure of the proper statistic to use. I know I cannot take the mean correlation coefficient value for each group and then run a t-test, however that is essentially what I am trying to achieve if this makes sense.
