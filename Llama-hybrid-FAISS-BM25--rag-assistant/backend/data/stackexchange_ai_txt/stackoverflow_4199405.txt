In addition to clockworkgeek's point about later upgrades to the system, you also avoid much of the complexity of Magento's EAV system by using the framework. User data in Magento is strung out between the customer_entity_* tables that you mentioned, and adding new data to the system will require you to grab each of the column definitions (from eav_attribute ) and place the data appropriately. This is even more of a pain than it seems. In summary, no, your update statement is not enough to save user data. Magento executes dozens of queries to add customers to the system, and you'll need do the same. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
