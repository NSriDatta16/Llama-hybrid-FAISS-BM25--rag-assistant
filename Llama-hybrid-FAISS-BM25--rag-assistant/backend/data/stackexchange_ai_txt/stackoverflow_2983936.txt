Start by defining the scope. Write a paragraph to a page and try to describe your website. A top-down approach would be to start thinking of functionality you'd like to implement and refining it by adding more detail. A top-down approach (is also known as step-wise design) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is first formulated, specifying but not detailing any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of "black boxes", these make it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to elucidate elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design . There are many other approaches, however. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_project_management#Software_development_process Again, the most important step is to be able to put your idea in words; before you can adequately do that, I wouldn't even consider starting to write one line of code .
