Looking at the code of the networksis package for R might be helpful. I believe that efficient computation requires fancy Markov Chain sequential importance resampling techniques, so you might want to avoid reimplementing this if you can avoid it. Edit: The relevant paper is Chen, Diaconis, Holmes, and Liu (2005) . In the words of the authors, "[o]ur method compares favorably with other existing Monte Carlo- based algorithms, and sometimes is a few orders of magnitude more efÔ¨Åcient."
