In general when people use some kind of a ensemble a mean of the the multiple metrics is considered the 'typical' predictive capability of that model, unless there is some sort of uneven weighting of the constituent models. So, yes, I understand that this means with a few 0 averaged in there you get a big shift in the mean. However, short of modeling mistakes or some kind of bias in building the model, that is likely not unexpected. So, if that value is unacceptable (or not translating into a useful prediction), then you need to reconsider this particular modeling path. Potentially try to build a single more predictive model that provides a MAE you find acceptable across the full range of your data
