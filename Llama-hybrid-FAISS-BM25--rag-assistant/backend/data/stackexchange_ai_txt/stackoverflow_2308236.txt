Is there a clean way that I can capture when a user left clicks and then drags the mouse?

I am trying to make it so that the user can scroll a richtextbox by clicking the window the richtexbox is on and dragging the mouse. Unfortunately I haven't gotten very far: private void Main_PreviewMouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed) { } } I've seen some suggestions on the web to track the last several x,y coordinates of the mouse and compare them to the x,y coordinates each time the mouse move event is triggered. Is there any less messy way to do this?
