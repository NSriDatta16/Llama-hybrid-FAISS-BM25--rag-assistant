IP Camera implementation in Android(View live video from IP Camera)

I have a requirement to implement IP camera's for my client's Organization(May be 5 or more). I need to provide facility to view these camera's preview in their Android mobiles. I found an application already available in Android Market(IP Cam Viewer) and it is what exactly my Client asking. Can anyone suggest me the best IP camera(It should be operated by their mobile i.e moving it up and down, as well as left and right)? And how can I implement this functionality in Android(i.e Viewing live video from the IP Camera)? Thanks & Regards, Raghavendra K.
