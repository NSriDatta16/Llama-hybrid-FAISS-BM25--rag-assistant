Drag a point in flash, and have lines, connected other points move

I have a set of dots displayed on the canvas (key bits of code pulled out): // Drop points based on x y coords for (var i = 0; i I then connect the dots - one dot could have 50 connections // Draw connections for (i = 0; i 0) { itemConnect[k] = new Shape(); itemConnect[k].graphics.lineStyle(1, 0x000000); // Connect the line to the dots itemConnect[k].graphics.moveTo(itemPoint[i].x, itemPoint[i].y); itemConnect[k].graphics.lineTo(itemPoint[j].x, itemPoint[j].y); addChild(itemConnect[k++]); } } } I have drag and drop working for the dot: /** Drag and drop functions */ function initDragger(mc:MovieClip):void { mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, mouseDownHandler); mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, mouseUpHandler); } function mouseDownHandler(e:MouseEvent):void { e.currentTarget.startDrag(); } function mouseUpHandler(e:MouseEvent):void { e.currentTarget.stopDrag(); } However, I am really stuck on how to redraw the lines as I move a dot. Also there could be many lines connected to any single dot. Do I need to somehow register which lines are connected to which dot? How do I redrew the lines based on this? Thanks
