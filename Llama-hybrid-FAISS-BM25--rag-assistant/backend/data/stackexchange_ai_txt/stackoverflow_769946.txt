Validation and display issues?

I am developing a website for a friend which was earlier developed by some other guy, basically, I am a PHP pro and don't ve much experience in HTML (or until now) ... now, I am trying to validate my webpage, earlier it was showing 162 errors, I 've brought it down to 1 error (thank you) ... haha earlier with 162 errors, it was looking good in firefox3 but not loading at all in ie6 or ie7 ..... now since I 've managed to get it down to 1 error, it's looking good in Firefox as usual and loads on ie6 and ie7 as well but not rendering properly in ie's .... page layout is a bit garbled. the only error which remains now is .... Attribute "height" exists, but can not be used for this element. ..... now when I take care of all these mistakes ... i.e removing height="100%" in tables .... even firefox refuses to show it properly. Please point me in the right direction ... I 've been working on this whole site for the last five days .. and it's pro-bono .... I don't know the rules about posting links .... anyways ... here's the link for the page I am talking about ...... I hope I am making sense ... http://www.shivgangaresorts.com/dev/aboutus.html please view this page in ff3 and ie6 or ie7 to see what I am saying .... any help would be greatly appreciated .... thanks a million in advance
