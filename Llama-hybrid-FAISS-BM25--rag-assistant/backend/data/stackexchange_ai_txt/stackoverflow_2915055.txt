I had the same issue and Mario's answer solved it for me. I was converting an iPhone app to work on both the phone and the iPad. For some reason it didn't put the new xib file into the Copy Bundle Resources underneath the target. Once I added it by dragging the XIB file from the Resources-iPad directory down, it fixed everything. Thanks, Mario!
