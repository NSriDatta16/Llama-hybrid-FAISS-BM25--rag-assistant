$X_i \sim N(\mu_i ,1)$ A discussion on unbiased concept

I am really confused with following discus. The authors ask a question and answer it. I have problems to understanding this discussion. For example: Where come from "upward bias" ? why largest $X_i$ has "upward bias" for its mean? Is this make sense to you? The discussion about Bayesian approach is not easy to understanding for me? especially I do not know what exactly means in this line: "This isnâ€™t obvious, but follows from the fact that any data-based selection process does not affect the likelihood function". For understanding this discussion , I think a simulation studies works fine. how I can use a simulation studies in R(just needs steps of it and I can do it). thanks. According what I understand for the patients gen of number $610$ measured and the mean of it used and it equals $5.29$ . so we did not use any order statistics. Am i wrong something? also the plot is the data for all gens not just for gen $610$ . \begin{eqnarray} \begin{array}{c|cccc|c} gen number & obs_1 & obs_2 & \cdots & obs_n & x_j=mean(x_{ji})=\hat{\mu_j} \\ \hline gen 1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1n} & x_1=mean(x_{1i})=\hat{\mu_1} \\ \hline gen 2 & x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2n} & x_2=mean(x_{2i})=\hat{\mu_2} \\ \hline . & . & . & . & . & . \\ \hline gen 610 & x_{(610)1} & x_{(610)2} & \cdots & x_{(610)n} & x_{610}=mean(x_{(610)i})=\hat{\mu_{610}}=5.29 \\ \hline . & . & . & . & . & . \\ \hline gen N=6033 & x_{N1} & x_{N2} & \cdots & x_{Nn} & x_N=mean(x_{Ni})=\hat{\mu_n} \\ \hline \end{array} \end{eqnarray} The Source.pdf
