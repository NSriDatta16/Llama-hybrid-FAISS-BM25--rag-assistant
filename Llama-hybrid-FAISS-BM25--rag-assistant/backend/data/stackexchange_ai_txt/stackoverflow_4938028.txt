How to use Routing ASP.NET 4 WebForms with Query String?

First, this is not MVC, WebForms only.. I'm using routing to keep my site backwards compatible for our clients, while make my project organized. I'm also thinking of moving our encrypted query string to a more friendly url. How this works is our clients have to bookmark a huge encrypted url to prevent them from guessing our other clients by changing an id around. But instead of having this huge url, wanted to add a route like LoginClientName.aspx for each client and have the encrypted query string hard coded or maybe in database. But don't see a way to add a query to the MapPageRoute.. Was thinking of something like this (know it doesnt work) routes.MapPageRoute("MapClient1", "LoginClient1.aspx", "Login.aspx?secure=mylongquerystring"); routes.MapPageRoute("MapClient2", "LoginClient2.aspx", "Login.aspx?secure=differentmylongquerystring"); Now this throws exception since it doesn't allow a ? in url.. any ideas how to accomplish this? or is it impossible?
