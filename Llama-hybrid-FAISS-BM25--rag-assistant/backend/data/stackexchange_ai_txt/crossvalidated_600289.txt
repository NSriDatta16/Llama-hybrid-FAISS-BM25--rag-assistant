Does the Precision-Recall AUC approach the ROC AUC as the data becomes balanced?

I am working on a Machine Learning classifier. It is a binary response and most predictor variables are categorical. I have several years of data and for some years, the response is imbalanced (more 1s than 0s) and for more recent years is gradually becomes balanced (roughly the same number of 1s and 0s). I am calculating/plotting both ROC AUC and Precision-Recall AUC. Would you expect that the Precision-Recall AUC approaches the ROC AUC as the data becomes balanced? Because that's not really what I'm seeing. I'm still seeing a difference between the Precision-Recall AUC and the ROC AUC as the data becomes balanced. Since the positive case is what I am interested in, is the ROC AUC necessary at all?
