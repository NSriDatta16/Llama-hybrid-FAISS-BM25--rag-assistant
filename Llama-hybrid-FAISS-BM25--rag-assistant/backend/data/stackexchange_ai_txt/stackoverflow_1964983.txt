You need to go into the jquery code for the draggable ui effect. There must be a line in the code where the z-index of the element is changed to a very high number so that it appears above all other elements. You can remove this line and it should make it so the elements do not change their vertical layer when dragging. I would run a find for "z-index" in the ui file.
