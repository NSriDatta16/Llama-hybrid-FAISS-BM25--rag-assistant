Moving Average Model over error terms

This is a basic question on Box-Jenkins MA models. As I understand, an MA model is basically a linear regression of time-series values Y against previous error terms et,...,et−n. That is, the observation Y is first regressed against its previous values Yt−1,...,Yt−n and then one or more Y−Y^ values are used as the error terms for the MA model. But how are the error terms calculated in an ARIMA(0, 0, 2) model? If the MA model is used without an autoregressive part and thus no estimated value, how can I possibly have an error term?
