How to specify the word-breaking conditions in IE?

Specifically, say I have a string like ABC-123-NNN. I would like the paragraph to have line breaks, but not to break at the dashes. i.e. if my text is "The serial number ABC-123-NNN is not valid", I would like to keep together the entire serial number if it exceeds the container width. So the following is ok: The serial number ABC-123-NNN is not valid But the following (which is the behavior of IE6) is not: The serial number ABC- 123-NNN is not valid Currently IE seems to break at dashes. Is there any applicable CSS or whatever I can apply to avoid it?
