You're mixing up two different worlds here. One is the OCI world where sqlldr lives. It expects Oracle instance names defined in TNSNAMES.ORA (or a similar service). The other world is the JDBC world that uses connection identifiers with words like "jdbc" or "thin". So you have two options: If your environment has a proper TNS setup, you have to change the command line to something like sqlldr GANUKA/GANUKA@MONTY.CORP control=... If not, you can use an Easy Connect string: sqlldr GANUKA/GANUKA@//172.21.0.180:1521/orcl control=...
