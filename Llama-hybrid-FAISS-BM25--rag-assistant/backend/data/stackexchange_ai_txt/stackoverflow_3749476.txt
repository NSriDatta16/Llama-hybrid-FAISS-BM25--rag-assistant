Updating a "developer rejected" app: "No eligible applications were found"

I'm updating an existing app. I first uploaded a binary for the new version, but had to reject it; the status is now "Developer Rejected". However, I can't seem to upload a new binary. Both Application Uploader and Organizer say "No eligible applications were found", and in iTunes Connect, I can find no way (buttons, options, check boxes) to activate the system for a new binary.
