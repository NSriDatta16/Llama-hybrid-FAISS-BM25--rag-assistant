Is there a simple, consistent way to change the color scheme of Eclipse editors?

I'm going crazy trying to get all of the editors to look similarly. It looks like there's a different color editor option for each file type/code type, which means it takes FOREVER to customize the view. Add to that: each code/file type color option seems to honor the default set in the generic options only if it feels like it (seems buggy). I'm currently using Eclipse 3.4.1 (Ganymede). Is there a version that is less buggy or is there a more consistent way to change the text colors? Barring that, has anyone gotten a Zenburn -like color scheme in Eclipse that would be willing to share?
