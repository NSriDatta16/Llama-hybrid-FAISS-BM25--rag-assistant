Is survey response number big enough

This is a fictional example to demonstrate my question I'm trying to figure out at work. I sent out surveys to all organizations of a specific type in the US asking them what is the average time it takes their employees to apply sunscreen and average number of applications a day. This means I surveyed the whole population = 400 organizations. I have received 100 complete responses that I can use. Example, organization X said on average their employees take 10 minutes to apply sunscreen with an average number of applications being 3 times a day. I want to find the industry average. So I'm taking the average of all organizations that responded answers to their sunscreen time which is 7.8 minutes. And the average of all respondents application numbers is 4.2 times a day. Basically in this industry, the average sunscreen application time is 7.8 minutes and # of times it's applied is 4.2. How do I know if having 100 complete responses for this type of survey is sufficient? Is there a specific formula?
