No, modifications will not help you. Object properties in OWL do not hold between classes but only between instances. For example, it is not possible to have a relation between Government and Embassy in (the decidable fragment of) OWL, but only between their instances. If Government has "USGovernment" as instance and Embassy "USEmbassyInEthiopia", you can assert that a relation (maybe embassy-of ) holds between both. Between classes, you can assert axioms. For example, you can state that all embassies must be an embassy-of some Government (Embassy SubClassOf: embassy-of some Government). If you are interested in visualizing these relations, you may want to look at some graph-based ontology development tools such as OBOEdit .
