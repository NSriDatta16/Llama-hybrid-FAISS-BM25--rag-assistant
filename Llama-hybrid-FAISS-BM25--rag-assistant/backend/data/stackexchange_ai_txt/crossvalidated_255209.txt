Books in Machine Learning via C/C++

I have been reading two excellent textbooks (Murphy, Mohri) in the machine learning. Although I am familiar with R and its utilization for ML, I was thinking of learning C/C++ via machine learning. There are quite many books that introduce the practical ML via R, Python, or Java, but I have not seen any book that introduce ML via C/C++....Is there a book or two (or any other resources) you know that does it? My plan is to learn C/C++ as I code for ML algorithms.
