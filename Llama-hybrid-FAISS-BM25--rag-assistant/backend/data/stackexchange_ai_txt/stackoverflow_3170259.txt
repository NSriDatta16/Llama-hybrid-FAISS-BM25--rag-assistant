I know this is a bit heretical but I find writing documentation for the solution helps. Just putting it down on paper forces you to think and organize the problem differently than coding on it. Attempting to describe the solution in terms of the business problem tends to help point out were the gaps lie and these in turn suggest alternate solutions. In the best cases you end up with new approaches. At worst, you end up with documentation. Give yourself a set amount of time. Start with an outline and work until you run out of time, you complete the documentation or you are inspired with alternate solutions.
