How to forecast time series analysis for more then one dependent variables?

I have three datasets: Dataset_1= column name as ID, Date, counter_id Dataset_2= column name as ID, no. of tickets sold Dataset_3= column names as ID, country_code . Here, country_code ranges from 1 to 30 as codes for different countries and counter_id as counter codes ranging from 1 to 100. I merged the datasets based on common column ID . I have to estimate how many tickets will be sold during the next 20 days in a given country and through a specific counter. What I have done is predict the number of tickets sold for next 10 days using time series forecasting. But, I'm not able to decide how I can predict the counter_id and country_code along with tickets sold? Please give me some useful feedback. I am a beginner in data science. Thanks!
