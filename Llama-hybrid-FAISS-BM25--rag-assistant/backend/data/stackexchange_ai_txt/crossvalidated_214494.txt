specific example of reinforcement learning using linear function approximation

I can think of two cases when linear function approximation in reinforcement learning is useful: when the state space is large enough, or when the state space is continuous. I have been reading many materials about this concept, and there are certain concepts that I would like to see in an example rather than in proofs. Is there a more 'gentle' introduction or example of how linear function approximation is applied in reinforcement learning? Currently, I am lost as to how to formulate it in a program to solve a particular problem. I am looking at Q learning right now, and trying to extend the framework to accommodate linear function approximation. But it seems difficult.
