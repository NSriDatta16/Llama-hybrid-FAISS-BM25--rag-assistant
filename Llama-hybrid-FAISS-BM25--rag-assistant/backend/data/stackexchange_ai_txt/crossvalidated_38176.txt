Given what Peter has said and what he and the OP said in the comments, I think the categories should just be assumed to be correct and do the analysis from there. I don't see exactly why a factor analysis was conducted. A test of the difference between the means of the two groups may be informative but since it is the average of Likert scale variables which are ordinal in nature a nonparametric test such as the rank sum test might be more appropriate. I agree with Peter that a logistic regression using the respondents' individual average Likert score from the first set of questions and the same average Likert score for the second set of questions could be used as covariates for predicting the group. The importance of these variables in the model might address your question.
