You have taken a careful look at your data using some sensible methods. Here are a few comments that might help with some of your questions. Normality and outliers: With only $n=7$ replications in each group, it is difficult to assess normality. It seems likely that the outlier in G3, triggered the significantly non-normal result there. However, outliers are not necessarily an indication of non-normality unless they are extreme. It is typical of normal data to show occasional outliers. You did not explicitly say whether your outlier in G3 is extreme. More precisely, the following simulation with 100,000 normal samples of size $n=7$ indicates that about 1/4 of of them show at least one boxplot outlier (according to the 1.5 IQR rule), with an average of about 0.3 outliers per sample. set.seed(816); m = 10^5 nr.out = replicate(10^5, length(boxplot.stats(rnorm(7))$out) ) mean(nr.out); mean(nr.out >=1) [1] 0.29368 [1] 0.24806 Non-significance of ANOVA test: Your sample variances average about 107, so standard errors of the sample means are about 4. Also, the differences among the three sample means are smaller than about 10, so I am not surprised that an ANOVA does not find significant differences among means. More precisely, it seems that in your ANOVA, MS(Group) $\approx 202$ and MS(Error) $\approx 107,$ so that $F \approx 1.89,$ which is much smaller than the critical value $c = 3.55,$ for an F-test with degrees of freedom 2 and 18. If I'm right about that, then the ANOVA finds no significant differences. a = c(33.01, 31.2, 22.93); v = c(129.1, 116.56, 75.12) f = 7*var(a)/mean(v); f; qf(.95, 2, 18) [1] 1.890591 [1] 3.554557 Multiple comparisons: It is not good practice to test for significant differences among pairs of group means unless the ANOVA suggests some such differences exist. Nevertheless, I admit it is tempting to take another look at the comparison of G1 with G3 (ignoring the existence of G2 and perhaps assuming normality), but then you should use a Welch t test to account for the differences in sample variances, and you should not make claims about the result unless the P-value is as low as .01 or .02. Looking at that difference more carefully might prompt a subsequent experiment.
