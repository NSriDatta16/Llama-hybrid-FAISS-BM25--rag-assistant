Stars light up when mouse hovers Simple, have an image for yellow star and an image for white star. When a star is hovered, all stars to the left have their "src"s changed to the yellow star, all stars to the right have their srcs changed to the white star. Page isn't reloaded when star is clicked Look into Ajax/XHR http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming) Hint: Have a .php file called vote.php , and pass into it the ID of your food and the rating given by the user. Some sort of average shown between the stars Most websites only show 0%, 50%, and 100% stars... users won't really freak out if they don't get 'exact precision' Rating should be stored in MySQL database Any database system is fine. But yes, you would probably want to use an SQL database for this
