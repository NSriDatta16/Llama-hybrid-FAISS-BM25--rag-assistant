Significance of subcategories

My data includes a total sum of around 30 different subcategories. If I want to find if the subtotal of these subcategories is significantly different from previous quarters I can run a chi square test of this years data against the average of previous quarters data, correct? However, if I want to check if one category is significantly different, then do I simple compare it to the mean and sd of that categories' previous quarters? For example, if this is my data: Subcategory 2020Q4 2020Q3 2020Q2 2020Q1 2019Q4 SC1 2 6 4 7 12 SC2 53 100 123 118 129 subtotal 55 106 127 125 141 How do I determine if the changes from each subcategory and for the subtotal are statistically significant?
