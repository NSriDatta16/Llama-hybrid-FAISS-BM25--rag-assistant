If you want to change the content of the paragraph without reloading the page you will need to use JavaScript. Give the paragraph an id. Some text here and then use innerHTML to replace it's contents. document.getElementById('something').innerHTML='Some new text' . If you are reloading the page then you can use PHP. One way would be to put a marker in the HTML and then use str_replace() to insert the new text. eg in the HTML and $html_string = str_replace(' ', 'New Text', $html_string) assuming $html_string contains the HTML to output.
