At first I was interested in how different programs worked, so I started by looking at the source code. Then when I began to understand how the program worked, I would change certain parameters to see what would happen. So basically I learned how to read before I learned how to write. Which coincidently is how most people learn English. So if I was trying to teach someone how to program I would give them a small program to try to read and understand how it works, and have them just just play around with the source code. Only then would I give them "assignments" to try to accomplish. Now if they had a particular reason for wanting to learn how to program, it would certainly be a good idea to start with something along the lines of what they want to accomplish. For example if they wanted to be proficient in an application like blender , it would definably be a good idea to start with Alice . I would absolutely recommend sticking with a language that has garbage collection, like D , Perl , or some interpreted language like javascript. It might be a good idea to stay away from Perl until Perl 6 is closer to completion, because it fixes some of the difficulties of reading and understanding Perl.
