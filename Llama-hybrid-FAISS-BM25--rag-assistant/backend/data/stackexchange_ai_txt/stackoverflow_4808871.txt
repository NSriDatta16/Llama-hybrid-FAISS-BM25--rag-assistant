If I understand what you're asking, no you cannot. MySQL will not run on an Android device. Android supports SQLite which is a file-backed SQL database for storage. If you want to use MySQL on some server some where and transmit JSON data to your application, then yes, you can do that. You'll need to clarify a bit before I can give you a better answer.
