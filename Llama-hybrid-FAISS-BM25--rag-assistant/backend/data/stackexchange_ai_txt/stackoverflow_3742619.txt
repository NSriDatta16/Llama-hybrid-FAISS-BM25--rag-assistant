It is because your try_it() is not returning a value, while your add() is. Try something like this: var try_it = function (a, b) { var result; // storage for the result of add() try { result = add(a, b); // store the value that was returned from add() } catch (e) { document.writeln(e.name + ': ' + e.message); } return result; // return the result } This will return the result of the add() . You were getting undefined because that is a default return value when one is not specified. EDIT: Changed it to store the result in a variable instead of returning immediately. This way you can still catch an error.
