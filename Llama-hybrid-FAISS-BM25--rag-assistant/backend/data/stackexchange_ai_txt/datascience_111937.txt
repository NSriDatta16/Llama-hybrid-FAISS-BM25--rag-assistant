PCA is interesting but hard to interpret because it is a linear algorithm. Consequently, the result using many features will be probably not OK, overall if you have non-linear correlations or complex variances. I would recommend keeping PCA to do some studies on 3 features and using non-linear dimensional reduction algorithms such as t-SNE, or UMAP. As a picture is always better than thousands of words, here you can test the difference between PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with different datasets: https://projector.tensorflow.org/
