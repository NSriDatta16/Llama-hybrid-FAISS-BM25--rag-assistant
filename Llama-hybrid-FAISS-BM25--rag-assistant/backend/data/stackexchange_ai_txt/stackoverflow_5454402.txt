Generally you shouldn't pay attention or care, but if you really need to, you can use something like if (isatty(fileno(stdin))) // getting input from console else // probably getting input from a file. Neither isatty or fileno is a standardized part of C proper, but both are included in POSIX (if memory serves) and available on most non-POSIX systems as well (e.g., on Windows, though MS considers these names deprecated, and advises useing _isatty and _fileno respectively).
