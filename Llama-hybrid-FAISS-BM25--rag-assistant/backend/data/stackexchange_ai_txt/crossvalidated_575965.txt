All the same considerations for cross validation apply for neural networks as for any other type of model. I.e. the usual scikit-learn (or other options for special situations like grouped+stratified CV) approaches would be used. A common mistake with CV for neural networks is to do data augmentation before creating CV (and/or test) splits.
