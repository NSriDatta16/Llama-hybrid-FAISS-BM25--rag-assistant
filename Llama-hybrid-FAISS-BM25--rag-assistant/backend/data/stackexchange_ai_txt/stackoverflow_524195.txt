What about using Flash? Yes, I know the overhead of using Flash, plus the fact that some users will be locked out of buying the bag-o-crap (i.e.: iPhone users) might make this detrimental, but it seems to me that Flash would prevent screenscraping or at least make it difficult. Am I wrong? Edited to add What about including a couple of "hidden" fields on your submissions form like what I found below: Actually, best practice seems to be to use two hidden fields, one with an initial value, and one without. It's the rare bot which can ignore both fields. Check for one field to be blank, and the other to have the initial value. And hide them using CSS, not by making them "hidden" fields: .important { display : none ; } Please don't change the next two fields. Bots tend to like fields with names like 'address'. The text in the paragraph is for those few rare human beings who have a non-CSS capable browser. If you're not worried about them, you can leave it out. In the logic for processing the form, you'd do something like: if (address2 == "xyzzy" and address3 == "") { /* OK to send / } else { / probably have a bot */ }
