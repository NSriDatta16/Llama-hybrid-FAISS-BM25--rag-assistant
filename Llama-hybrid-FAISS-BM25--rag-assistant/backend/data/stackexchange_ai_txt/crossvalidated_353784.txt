What is the optimal strategy to invest a limited resource in N uncertain options?

Suppose I have a Â£100 to invest in 2 options. Each option has a expected value, but the value is unknown. Option A has the highest average expected value, but a bigger uncertainty range. If we just looked at means we would invest everything in A. What circumstances would cause a mixed investment strategy?
