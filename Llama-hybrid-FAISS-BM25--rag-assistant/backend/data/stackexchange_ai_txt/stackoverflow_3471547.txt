SELECT AVG("...") with Criteria API

I'm having difficulties with translating following SQL syntax into Criteria API: SELECT AVG(dbo.Member.Points) FROM dbo.Member WHERE dbo.Member.PaidMemberRegDate IS NOT NULL; I have a Member class with a Points property. I just want to get the average Points of all Members that have the property PaidMemberRegDate set to null.
