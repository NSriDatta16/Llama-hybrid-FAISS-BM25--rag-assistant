If I am not mistaken, the observations in this beer time series were collected 12 times a year for each year represented in the data, so the frequency of the time series is 12. As explained at https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/timeseries.html , for instance, frequency is the number of observations per unit time. This means that frequency = 1 for data collected once a year, frequency = 4 for data collected 4 times a year (i.e., quarterly data) and frequency = 12 for data collected 12 times a year (i.e., monthly data). Not sure why you would use frequency = 1 instead of frequency = 12 for this time series? For time series data where frequency = 4 or 12, you should be concerned about the possibility of seasonality (see https://anomaly.io/seasonal-trend-decomposition-in-r/ ). If seasonality is present, you should incorporate this into your time series modelling and forecasting, in which case you would use seasonal = TRUE in your auto.arima() function call. Before you construct the ACF and PACF plots, you can diagnose the presence of seasonality of a quarterly or monthly time series using functions such as ggseasonplot() and ggsubseriesplot() in the forecast package in R, as seen here: https://otexts.org/fpp2/seasonal-plots.html .
