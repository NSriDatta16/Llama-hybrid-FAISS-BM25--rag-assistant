Unsure how to approach evaluating statistical significance for two very different sized samples

Some basic overview: Problem Statement: Comparing average transactions per user between two groups Group 1 Size: 6.5M Group 2 Size: 500K Now, it's been a month and we've seen about of unique users with a transaction within each group: Group 1: 500K Group 2: 25K Here are our initial results: Group 1 Stats: Mean: 2.75 SD: 4.6 Group 1 Stats: Mean: 2.81 SD: 4.9 Now, my initial thought was to run a Z-Test but I had some questions: I'm starting to think it is too soon to analyze results. Only Am I going to run into issues comparing vastly different sample sizes in this case. I hope this is appropriate for this site.
