Let's say a grid is defined by an orientation Or (within 0 and 90 deg) and a resolution Res . You could compute a cost function that evaluate if a grid (Or, Res) sticks to your points. For example, you could compute the average distance of each point to its closest point of the grid. Your problem is then to find the (Or, Res) pair that minimize the cost function. In order to narrow the search space and improve the , some a heuristic to test "good" candidate grids could be used. This approach is the same as the one used in the Hough transform proposed by jilles. The (Or, Res) space is comparable to the Hough's gamma space.
