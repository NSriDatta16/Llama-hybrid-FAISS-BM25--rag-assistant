How to prove predictive use of a biomarker?

I have a binary endpoint (cured/not cured) and a continuous biomarker measured on each patient. Every patient recieved one of two treatments. The biomarker predicts the effect of the treatment, if there is an interaction between the biomarker and the treatment effect on the endpoint. One can test for this interaction by logistic regression. However, the biomarker has to be dichotomized by some cutoff for clinical use. The dichotomized biomarker might perform different. What is the method of choice to prove that the biomarker predicts the outcome of the treatment after suitable dichotomization? Would one of the approaches below work? Some approaches I thought of: Find the cutoff minimizing the $p$-value of the interaction test with the dichotomized biomarker. The biomarker will be validated if this minimal $p$-value is below some threashold reflecting $\alpha$ and the multiplicity involved. (Let's put aside how to adjust; I'll find a way.) What I don't like about this idea is that the distribution of $p$-values favours of course balanced sample sizes (best power for balanced sample sizes), so the cutoff estimation might not be reproducible if the sample distribution of the biomarker is different in another study. Split the dataset in a training and a validation set. Pro: It's easy. Con: In my opinion this wastes sample size. Also, I don't like the result to depend on my arbitrary choice of splitting procedure. For regression model validation, Efron suggested a bootstrap method. I would probably prefer this, but I intent cutoff selection and not variable selection, so I'm not sure about the details.
