How to apply moving average with multiple identical dates

I have dataset with a (unique) ID, a date (yyyy-mm-dd format) and an arbitrary measuring value x. The dataset is sorted by date (first) and, multiple IDs have the same date, by ID (second). If I plot the data in a scatterplot everything is fine, until I intruduce a moving average for my data. As some dates can appear multiple times with different measuring values, if I add the moving average to the plot, I have some vertical lines for these days (as there are multiple measuring values as well as multiple moving averages for these days). Would it be acceptable to have a per day average on which I calculate the moving average or are these vertical lines better in any way or is there yet another way I haven't considered yet to implement the moving average even better? The dataset and plots are executed with R/Studio. If necessary I can add some code snippets that help to visualize my problem. Edit: The measuring data are the value of the power output measured in Watts) of a given ID (which is unique as mentioned above and is therefore not repeating). The moving average is needed to help visualizing the change in the power output from day to day. Edit 2: example data: ID Date Power 1 2023-01-01 10 2 2023-01-01 20 3 2023-01-02 5 4 2023-01-03 15 5 2023-01-05 25 6 2023-01-06 5 7 2023-01-06 30 8 2023-01-06 10 "ID" is a unique Identifier, "date" is the date the system goes live and and "power" is the net power usage reported by the system with the respective ID. For this I want to have an moving average to have a visual hint/overlay in my scatterplot (where each system is marked with date and power) with the mean power up to the last system as the moving average. If I add a column for the moving average the following happens: ID Date Power mov-avg 1 2023-01-01 10 10 2 2023-01-01 20 15 3 2023-01-02 5 11.7 4 2023-01-03 15 12.5 5 2023-01-05 25 15 6 2023-01-06 5 13.3 7 2023-01-06 30 15.7 8 2023-01-06 10 15 In this case I have two values for the moving average for the date 2023-01-01 (10 and 15) and 3 for the date 2023-01-06 (13.3, 15.7 and 15), which would be displayed as vertical lines if I plot these values on top of my scatterplot.
