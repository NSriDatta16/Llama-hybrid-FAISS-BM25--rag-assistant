Embedding Perl in your project just to do regular expressions would be like trying to stuff an elephant into a Miata to get more trunk space. (Badump!) Boost would be one way to handle regular expressions, or if you're writing in an environment that supports POSIX.2, look into the regcomp() , regexec() and regfree() functions. After you've written your own lexer, investigate a tool called lex which is pretty much the gold standard for developing lexical analyzers. It has a partner called YACC for developing parsers. Both are time tested and generate tight, bug-free code. (GNU-ish environments call these programs flex and bison .)
