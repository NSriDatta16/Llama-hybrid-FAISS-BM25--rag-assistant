Can I use Logistic regression to remove 0s from a multiple linear regression?

I have a large data set (~17k data points) on which I would like to do a multiple regression. However, the explained variable has several instances of 0 (~6k). In finding an appropriate model for this data set, would I be able: to find the likelihood of the explained variable being positive using a logistic regression, and then using just the positive explained variable data points to run a multiple regression? When applying this model to new data, could I then find the chance of a positive result? And then the second model to find the expected amount, and then multiply the chance by the expected amount to get an average value? (Which won't be good for individual predictions but across a new large dataset would give a useful average value?) I found a couple of papers that seemed to use this approach, but they didn't go into the details of the model. Would there be a confidence interval formula for the average over a large new dataset as well? Thanks!
