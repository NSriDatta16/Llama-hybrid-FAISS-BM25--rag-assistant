Time series and multiple variables

I created a time series in Excel (not ideal) using Holts-Winters to forecast daily loan values in a month and it works very well. I've been asked to build a similar model that integrates other variables but other than a multiple regression model (which has it's own issues) I'm not sure with my limited experience how I could achieve this and within Excel. Any suggestions would be most welcome Regards
