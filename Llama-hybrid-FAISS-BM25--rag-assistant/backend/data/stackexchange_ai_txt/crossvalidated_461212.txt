The log-likelihood (with possibly different variances) is log(1,…,|,21,…,2)=−12∑=1log(22)−∑=1(−)222. Note that here we cannot take 2 out of the summation. Thus, to solve this, we need to take the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to set it equal to zero. Doing so, we obtain ∑2 =∑12, which yields ̂=∑2∑12, which is not necessarily the same estimator as before. That is, the sample average of 's is no longer the ML estimate of .
