How to feed multi-channel spectrograms to Deep Neural Network?

I am using a 14 channel EEG device. To do away with the need for any handcrafted features, I wish to implement an ML classification task with the EEG data collected using deep neural networks (such as 2D-CNN) directly on the spectrograms. I get decent results by concatenating all 14 spectrograms (per training example) side by side, to get a single spectrogram. Though this is the only thing that makes sense to me, what is the normal/right way to feed multi-channel spectrograms to a deep neural network?
