According to MySQL's docs , there are a couple things you need to pay attention to. The CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), CURRENT_TIME(), CURRENT_DATE(), and FROM_UNIXTIME() functions return values in the connection's current time zone, which is available as the value of the time_zone system variable. So, the results of your query are already in the "local timezone", where what local is depends on various settings (both per-connection and global). In addition, UNIX_TIMESTAMP() assumes that its argument is a datetime value in the current time zone. The implication of this is that when you insert the timestamp into the database, you should either be calling it without an argument or ensuring that the date time string you give it is from the same timezone that MySQL is considering its local timezone for that connection. Since it looks like you simply want to retrieve the information from the database and then decide how to format it in PHP, it may be wiser to simply pull out the unmodified timestamp from the database. Then your PHP code can handle making sure it is formatted according to the timezone that's relevant to the user.
