Indeed, importance sampling is about approximating the value of an integral$$\mathfrak{I}=\int_\mathcal{A} f(x)\text{d}x$$using a manageable density $\omega$ with [at least] the same support as $\mathcal{A} \cap \text{supp}(f)$ and easy to simulate. A sample simulated from $\omega$ is then produced, $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, and the average$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \dfrac{f(x_i)}{\omega(x_i)}\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}(x_i)$$is an unbiased estimator of $\mathfrak{I}$ with variance going down to zero as $\text{O}(n^{-1})$ [if the variance is finite]. Given that you picked a Beta B(1,3) as your choice of $\omega$, you simply need to find a random generator for this distribution. If working with R, you should check the details of the function rbeta .
