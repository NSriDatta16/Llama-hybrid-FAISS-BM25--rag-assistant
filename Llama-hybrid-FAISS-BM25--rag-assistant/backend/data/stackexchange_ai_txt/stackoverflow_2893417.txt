Using matlab and Time Series object (fints), how can I make an array of them?

I am getting stock prices from yahoo, and want to have each stock have its own time series data structure, but also don't want to have hundreds of variables, so naturally I would want to have an array, but when I do something like array = [stock1 stock2]; it actually merges the series together. How can I make a real array? Thanks, CP
