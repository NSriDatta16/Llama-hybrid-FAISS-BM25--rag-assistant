The answer to your question is contained in the title. Backward step-down as implemented by the fastbw() function used by calibrate() in the rms package "prints approximate parameter estimates for the model after deleting variables," as the help page says. If you were doing ordinary least squares the coefficients themselves would be exact, but with logistic regression neither the coefficients nor the standard errors reported are exact. You will notice that the "approximate" coefficients are quite close to those for the lrm() model, differing only in their third significant figures, so this is not a big practical problem. Be sure to pay attention to the validate() and calibrate() results themselves, as they provide important information about the likely generalizability of your model when applied to new data. My guess is that the "optimism" in the coefficient estimates (provided by validate() ) will be much greater than these very minor differences you found in the regression coefficients. Finally, as "Death" is your outcome variable do consider whether you should be performing survival analysis that considers time to death, not just whether or not death has occurred.
