I would recommend not writing a regex for this. If you want to get the hostname, just do what vol7ron suggests. If you really do need to parse a URI in JavaScript, take a look at Appendix B of thehttp://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.html and use the match array returned from myString.match(myRegex) . Appendix B. Parsing a URI Reference with a Regular Expression As the "first-match-wins" algorithm is identical to the "greedy" disambiguation method used by POSIX regular expressions, it is natural and commonplace to use a regular expression for parsing the potential five components of a URI reference. The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a well-formed URI reference into its components. ^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))? 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The numbers in the second line above are only to assist readability; they indicate the reference points for each subexpression (i.e., each paired parenthesis). We refer to the value matched for subexpression as $. For example, matching the above expression to http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related results in the following subexpression matches: $1 = http: $2 = http $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu $4 = www.ics.uci.edu $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/ $6 = $7 = $8 = #Related $9 = Related where indicates that the component is not present, as is the case for the query component in the above example. Therefore, we can determine the value of the five components as scheme = $2 authority = $4 path = $5 query = $7 fragment = $9
