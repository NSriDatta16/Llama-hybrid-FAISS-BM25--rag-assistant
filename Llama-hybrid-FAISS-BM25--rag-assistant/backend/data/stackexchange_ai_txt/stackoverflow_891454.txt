You should reorganize your files. Have a "common.php" file that includes all the needed files. You shouldn't have a chain like that. I sincerely doubt a couple of includes are slowing down your server. Most web applications have tens, maybe even hundreds of PHP files. There is no way 3 extra files will slow down your application that much. Also, the speed difference between the functions you mentioned is negligible, although you should use include_once / require_once instead of their counterparts, to make sure you don't include the same file multiple times.
