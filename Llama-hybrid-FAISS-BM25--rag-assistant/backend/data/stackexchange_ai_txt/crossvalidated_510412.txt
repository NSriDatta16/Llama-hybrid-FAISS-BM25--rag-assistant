I strongly suspect that this particular part of the table, explicitly based on a multi-predictor logistic regression model stratified by sex, has an error in the p-value entry. The odds ratios are presented with respect to a reference category for each of the predictors, so that the p-values should represent the p-value corresponding to a null hypothesis of an odds ratio of 1 (equivalently, a logistic regression coefficient of 0). The width of the confidence interval is similar to those of other coefficients, leading to my suspicion that the error is in the p value. The posted odds ratio and confidence interval are equivalent to a logistic regression coefficient estimate of 0.171 with a standard error of 0.097. The z-value of 1.76 doesn't pass the usual significance criterion, it's about p = 0.08 for a two-sided test. The error in the table is unfortunate, but having put together many tables like this I have some sympathy for the authors on that account; proofreading such tables is hard. What's perhaps more unfortunate is this type of presentation of "significance" for multi-leveled categorical variables. Do you really care whether women with "tertiary education" have significantly different odds of getting checkups than do women with only primary education? Or do you care that the level of education is more generally associated with the odds of getting checkups? The display in that table only shows the former 2-level comparison, without an overall test of the significance of educational level. For that (in my opinion more useful) analysis of overall significance, you need to look at a likelihood-ratio test between models that include and exclude education as a predictor, or perform a Wald test on the multiple parameter estimates for the coefficients associated with education.
