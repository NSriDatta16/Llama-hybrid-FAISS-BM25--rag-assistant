The following resource demonstrates how to detect the client IP in ASP.NET: http://bytes.com/topic/asp-classic/answers/439176-how-get-clients-ip-address-asp-net Once you have the IP, load your whitelist from the storage mechanism of your choice, perhaps during an Init event (if in a page), and if the IP fails to match, respond like so. (Use HttpContext.Current.Response if not in a page.) if (!mySafeIpList.Contains(clientIP)) { Response.Clear() Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized Response.End() } Or, just simply redirect to a valid page: Response.Redirect("~/Head-Fake.aspx") I hope this helps.
