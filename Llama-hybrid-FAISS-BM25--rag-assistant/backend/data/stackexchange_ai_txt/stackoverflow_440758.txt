assuming by "line of business app" you mean "a simple CRUD app", then you've defined the scope narrowly enough that you probably do not need reflection to make it work - or even to make it better reflection makes the language "closed" in the sense that operators in the language can be used to investigate operators in the language; contrast this with the C language, which has no reflection. Want to call a function by name in C? Can't do it, no reflection. Does the typical C application need to do this? No, or rarely. Similarly per your question "Why would I use Reflection in a business app?" the answer is that you probably wouldn't, while others may have clever uses for it, but in fact for basic CRUD applications it is not "necessary". that doesn't mean that you shouldn't understand it; knowing what it is and what it can do can mean the difference between writing a ton of brittle code or a little elegant reflective code, in the event that you ever encounter something more difficult or complex than a 'line of business app' ;-)
