Python Debugging: code editing on the fly

I am new to python and haven't been able to find out whether this is possible or not. I am using the PyDev plugin under Eclipse, and basically all I want to find out is, is it possible to edit code whilst you're sitting at a breakpoint? I.e. Edit code whilst you're debugging. It allows me to do this at present, but it seems to still be executing the line of code that previously existed before I made changes. Also, are you able to drag program execution back like you can in VBA and C# for example? If either of these are possible, how can I enable them?
