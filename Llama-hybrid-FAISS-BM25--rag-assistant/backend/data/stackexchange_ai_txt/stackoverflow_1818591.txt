The flip -solution suggested by Logan Capaldo can also be written using a operator (here >. ): let (>.) x f = (fun y -> f y x) List.map (1 >. (-)) [2;4;6] Or if you prefer the operands the other way around: let (>.) f x = (fun y -> f y x) List.map ((-) >. 1) [2;4;6] Edit: Using an operator that "looks more like a placeholder" (here >- ) gets you very close to your suggested syntax: List.map ((-) >- '_' is unfortunatly(?) not a valid operator symbol in F# .
