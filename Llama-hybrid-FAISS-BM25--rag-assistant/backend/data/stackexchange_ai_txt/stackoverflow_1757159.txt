the compiler doesn't seem to accept Agent class

probably the answer is quite silly but I need a pair fresh of eyes to spot the problem, if you will. this is the excerpt from _tmain: Agent theAgent(void); int m = theAgent.loadSAG(); and this is agent.h, which I included in _tmain: #ifndef AGENT_H #define AGENT_H class Agent { public: Agent(void); int loadSAG(void); ~Agent(void); }; #endif and agent.cpp relevant function: int Agent::loadSAG(void) { return 3; } so why in the world I get this error: error C2228: left of '.loadSAG' must have class/struct/union ? Thanks in advance.
