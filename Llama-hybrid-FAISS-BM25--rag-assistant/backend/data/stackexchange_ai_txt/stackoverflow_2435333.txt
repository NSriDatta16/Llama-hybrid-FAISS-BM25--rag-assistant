Personally, I'd look at systems that are already out there, such as Magento or OSCommerce. Why reinvent the wheel, especially with all the cool features that already exist? Plus, doing online stores, the number one priority is security. Most likely the systems that are being used by thousands of stores will have better security than one you create yourself, no matter how experienced you are, as there's thousands of people looking and finding the holes.
