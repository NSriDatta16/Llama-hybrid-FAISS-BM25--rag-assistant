All those techniques are available in R in the same sense that all of algebra is available in your pencil. Even p-values are available through many many different functions in R, deciding which function to use to get a p-value or a Bayesian posterior is more complex than a pointer to a single function or package. Once you learn about those techniques and decide what question you actually want the answer too then you can see (or we can provide more help) how to do it using R (or other tools). Just saying that you want to minimize your loss function, or to get a posterior distribution is about as useful as replying "food" when asked what you want to eat for dinner.
