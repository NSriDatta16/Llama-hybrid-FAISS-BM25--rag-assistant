Ralph, the particular URI patterns are orthogonal to the question how RESTful your application will be. What matters with regard to RESTfulness is that the client discovers how to construct the URIs at runtime . This can be achieved either with forms or URI templates. Both hypermedia controls tell the client what parameters can be used and where to put them in the URI. For this to work RESTfully, client and server must know the possible parameters at design time. This is usually achieved by making them part of the specification of the link relationship. You might for example define a 'my-subset' link relation to have the meaning of linking to subsets of collections and with it you would define the following parameters: listType, date, userID. In a link template that spec could be used as Note how the actual parameter name in the URI is decoupled from the specified parameter name. The value for userID is late-bound to the URI parameter user_id. This makes it possible for the URI parameter name to change without affecting the client. You can look at OpenSearch description documents ( http://www.opensearch.org ) to see how this is done in practice. Actually, you should be able to leverage OpenSearch quite a bit for your use case. Especially the ability to predefine queries would allow you to describe particular subsets in your 'forms'. But see for yourself and then ask back again :-) Jan
