The problem is fully processed by Wikipedia . As stated in my book , Lemma 2.25 $^0$$^1$ If $\delta_0$ is a Bayes estimator with respect to $\pi_0$ and if $R(\theta,\delta_0) \le r(\pi_0)$ for every $\theta$ in $\Theta$ , $\delta_0$ is minimax and $\pi_0$ is the least favorable distribution. Example 2.26 (Berger, 1985a) Consider $X\sim{\mathcal B}(n,\theta)$ when the probability $\theta$ is to be estimated under the quadratic loss, $$ \mathrm L (\theta,\delta) = (\delta-\theta)^2. $$ Bayes estimators are then given by posterior expectations and, when $$\theta \sim{\cal B}e \left({\sqrt{ n} \over 2}, {\sqrt{ n} \over 2} \right)$$ the posterior mean $^2$ is $$\delta^ \ast (x) = {x+ \sqrt{n}/2 \over n+ \sqrt{ n}}.$$ Moreover, this estimator has constant risk $^3$ , $$R(\theta,\delta^*) = 1/4(1+\sqrt{n})^2$$ Therefore, integrating out $\theta$ , $$r(\pi) = R(\theta,\delta^*)$$ and $\delta^*$ is minimax according to Lemma 2.25. Notice the difference with the MLE, $\delta_0(x) = x/n$ , for the small values of $n$ , and the unrealistic concentration of the prior around $0.5$ for larger values of $n$ . [ The Bayesian Choice , 2007, Chapter 2] $^0$ The statement is correcting for a typo on the range of $\theta$ 's for which the inequality occurs: it should be the entire parameter set and not only the support of $\pi_0$ , as shown by the counter-example of a Dirac mass prior in $\theta_0$ , whose (null) risk $R(\theta_0,\delta_0)$ is equal to $r(\pi_0)$ $^1$ The proof is not detailed in the book for being straightforward: if $R(\theta,\delta_0) \le r(\pi_0)$ for every $\theta$ in $\Theta$ , then $$r(\pi_0) = \int_\Theta R(\theta,\delta_0)\,\pi_0(\theta)\text d\theta$$ implies that $R(\theta,\delta_0) = r(\pi_0)$ almost everywhere on the support $\Omega$ of $\pi_0$ . Now, if the estimator $\delta_0$ is not minimax, it means there exists an estimator $\delta_1$ such that $$\sup_\theta R(\theta,\delta_1) meaning that $$\int_\Theta R(\theta,\delta_1)\,\pi_0(\theta)\text d\theta which exhibits a contradiction. $^2$ The posterior distribution is $$\theta|X=x \sim{\cal B}e \left(\frac{\sqrt{ n}}{2}+x, \frac{\sqrt{ n}}{2}+n-x \right)$$ $^3$ The risk is obtained by $$R(\theta,\delta^*) = (\mathbb E_\theta[\delta^*(X)]-\theta)^2+\dfrac{\text{var}_\theta X}{(n+\sqrt{n}/2)^2}$$
