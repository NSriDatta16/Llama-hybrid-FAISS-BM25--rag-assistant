Can I add my caching lines to global.asax?

Take the following lines of code that would work fine in a c# asp.net file: Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(300)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); Can I set these in some way in global.asax so that by default my entire application will support 300 second public caching?
