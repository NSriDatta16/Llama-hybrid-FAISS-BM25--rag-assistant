I've always been more pragmatic about questions like these. If you want to go full-OOP, you should obviously stick these into classes. However, these classes are only going to be container classes, because they don't really represent objects of any kind. Also: using classes would require you to either have an instance of that class, using the singleton pattern or declaring every function static. The first one is slower (okay, might not be that much, but in a large framework things like that get large, too - especially in interpreted languages like PHP), while the second and third ones are just plain useless and simply an OOP wrapper for a set of functions (especially the third approach). EDIT : Feel free to prove me wrong. I might be. I'm not too experienced and always saw it that way, but I might be wrong.
