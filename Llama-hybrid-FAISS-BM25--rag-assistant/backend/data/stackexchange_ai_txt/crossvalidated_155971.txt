Besides getting the correlation structure right as @Peter Flom stated, with missing records in longitudinal data, other than baseline data (used to adjust for covariates) the recommendations are to use all available data in a full maximum likelihood setting. There are basically three types of models satisfying this recommendation: generalized least squares (used to be called growth curve models), mixed effects models, and Bayesian hierarchical models. Any model that fully specifies the multivariate distribution of repeated measurements is probably OK, if it fits. Full models are the most robust methods to non-random missing data (e.g., non-random dropouts). GEE is not robust to such missing data.
