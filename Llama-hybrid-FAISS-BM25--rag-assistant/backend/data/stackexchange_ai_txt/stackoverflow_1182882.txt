The CS department at my old university has had a historic interest for algorithms inspired by nature since the seventies (I think the correct academic term is Natural computation . That's how I came into contact with some of those algorithms, especially Evolution strategies , the widely-known neural networks, and the exotic art of Membrane computing . I also did a class on data mining, where we studied some algorithms that allowed a computer system to learn from a set of data. I would say that every kind of algorithm that makes the computer "learn" something falls into the category that is derived from nature. Therefore, even the rather basic algos like naive Bayes fall into this category, and we probably all use them in some way or another e.g. to filter out spam e-mail. Personally, I have only implemented this kind of algorithms in university classes or my personal programming experiments. I think it is generally taught that they are powerful albeit in many cases less efficient than "classic" deterministic algorithms. Therefore a deterministic algorithm should always be preferred -- if there is one that solves the problem! It is only when the problem is too complex to be solved using deterministic algorithms that natural computation can offer a better solution. From my personal experience this is actually true. One small example: the evolution strategy I implemented to solve Sudoku puzzles took me half a day to implement and ran for several hours to find the same solution that the classic backtracking algo found in under a second (which took me less than thirty minutes to write ;-)) I just remember that a fellow student used evolution strategies to solve the problem of how to optimally distribute a set of files onto several DVDs for archival, which is I think an application of the knapsack problem or bin-packing problem, and it worked quite well. Apparently, ant colony algorithms can be used for this as well. Anyway, thanks for this interesting question.
