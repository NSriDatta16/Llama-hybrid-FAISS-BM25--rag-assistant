Expanding on Robert Long's answer (+1 to Robert) I'd say that testing for a difference between these is folly, regardless of sample size. Look! Is 0.239 different from 0.234? Well, maybe it is. There are situations where a very small effect size is very important. If a plane crashes 1 in 1,000 flights, that's a big big problem. I can't think, offhand, of a situation where this tiny difference in correlations could be meaningful, but maybe there is one. Whether it is significant or not is not the point. Also, the dependence will surely be a problem. If you really wanted to see something like this, I'd find a third correlation: The correlation between the test after removing the subtest. Then you can compare that to the correlation with the subtest. Finally, it's unclear to me what you are trying to show, but I think you are trying to show that these are not different. In that case, the usual null hypothesis tests are inappropriate. You should be looking at tests of equivalence (if, in fact you want to look at significance at all).
