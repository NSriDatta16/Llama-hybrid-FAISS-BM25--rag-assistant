This is perfectly possible in problems where a simpler neural network would have done the job. Think for example of a neural network that takes an input, passes it into a hidden layer (consisting of only one neuron) and then returns the output, which should be always 0. Here we have two connections, but the only relevant one is the second. The value of the first one is irrelevant and therefore it could be changing arbitrarely producing always the same error.
