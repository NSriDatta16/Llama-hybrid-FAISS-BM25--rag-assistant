I would agree that REST and JSON would be the default approach. Also of interest are some of the emerging binary protocols like Apache Thrift and Google's Protocol Buffers , if the idea of using IDLs in 2010 doesn't trigger raging fits of PCSD (Post- COM Stress Disorder). I would think these would only be an option if performance and bandwidth were really at a premium for your app.
