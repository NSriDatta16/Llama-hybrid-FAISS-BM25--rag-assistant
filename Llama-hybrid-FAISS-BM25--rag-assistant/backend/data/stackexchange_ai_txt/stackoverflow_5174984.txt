Use DOMDocument::loadHTML ? It uses libxml under the hood which is fast and robust. Don't try to parse HTML with regex's. I made that bold because I see it a lot on here and the solutions are always fragile at best and buggy at worst. Once you use a true HTML parser to get the attributes you want then using a regex is more reasonable.
