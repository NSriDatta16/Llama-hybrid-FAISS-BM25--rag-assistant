TSQL- Finding the difference in days of multiple records in SQL Server

Is it possible to find the difference of days of different records in SQL Server 2008 R2? SELECT OrderDate FROM OrdersTbl WHERE SKU='AA0000' ORDER BY ORDERDATE DESC OrderDate ----------------------- 2009-12-03 00:00:00.000 2009-04-03 00:00:00.000 2008-02-22 00:00:00.000 2008-02-21 00:00:00.000 2007-02-18 00:00:00.000 2007-01-27 00:00:00.000 2006-10-13 00:00:00.000 I would like a way to get how many days in between there are for each order date so that I could find the average frequency. Thanks in advance.
