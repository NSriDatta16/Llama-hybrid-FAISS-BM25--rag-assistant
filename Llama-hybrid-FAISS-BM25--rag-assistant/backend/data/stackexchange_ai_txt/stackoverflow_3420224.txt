We use continuous integration to detect whether someone has made a breaking change so do not need to find out the dependency graph (well sort-of, see below). What this does is building all solutions with all their projects inside each time there was a commit to SVN. Of course we need to know the sequence of the solutions (6 solutions, so that is bearable). Inside of each solution the projects (up to 65) are set up with their dependencies so they build in the correct order. We use a build grid of three agents to keep the response time low. As a consequence we know within one hour or less whether a change broke the build. In your situation other factors might be at work so the solution that works fine for us may be unsuitable for you.
