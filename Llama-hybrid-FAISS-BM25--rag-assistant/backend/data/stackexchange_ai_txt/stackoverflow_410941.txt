Best modules to develop a simple windowed 3D modeling application?

I want to create a very basic 3D modeling tool. The application is supposed to be windowed and will need to respond to mouse click and drag events in the 3D viewport. I've decided on wxPython for the actual window since I'm fairly familiar with it already. However, I need to produce an OpenGL viewport that can respond to the various mouse events. It wouldn't hurt to have some convenience math in place for converting the 2D mouse positions in "camera space" into world space coordinates to make selection tasks easier. I'm looking for recommendations on which modules I should be looking at.
