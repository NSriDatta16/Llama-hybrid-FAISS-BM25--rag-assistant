If you have access to AIR features, you can save large amounts of data in a file: var storage:File = File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath("data.xml"); var stream:FileStream = new FileStream(); stream.open(storage, FileMode.WRITE); stream.writeSomething //there are various .writeXXX functions stream.close(); I would save xml file (just to avoid inventing custom parser), then read it back.
