Classifier performance difference

I am using SVM and Random forest for classification purpose on a dataset. I am able to optimise the SVM parameters and SVM is providing very good performance in terms of accuracy, recall. But,at the same time Random Forest (RF) is not providing good perforamnce on the same datset. There is big diference between the two classifier's performance. I have tried many permutations combinatiosn for RF configuration, but its perfroamnce is not improved. Please suggest what should I try further for RF.
