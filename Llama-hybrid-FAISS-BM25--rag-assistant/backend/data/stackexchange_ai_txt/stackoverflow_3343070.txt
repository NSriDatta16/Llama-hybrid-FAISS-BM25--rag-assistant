Assembly becoming 32bit specific when built in release rather than debug in VS2008

I am having a strange issue when building assembly's for one of my modules. I was getting errors when running on 64bit which I traced back to being related to the assembly being 32bit specific. Our modules are(or should) all be built to be bit agnostic. Running CorFlags.exe on the assembly showed the following. Version : v2.0.50727 CLR Header: 2.5 PE : PE32 CorFlags : 11 ILONLY : 1 32BIT : 1 Signed : 1 However I then went back to rebuild the module and just so happened to build in debug mode. (Note: this is the simplified version of the story missing out the hours of solution testing, googling and a fight with a dragon :D) This time when I checked CorFlags.exe it gave the following: Version : v2.0.50727 CLR Header: 2.5 PE : PE32 CorFlags : 9 ILONLY : 1 32BIT : 0 Signed : 1 So now I am confused, having torn apart the visual studio build configs and found them to be exactly the same (i.e. all set to "Any CPU") I am now at a loss as to how to fix this. What would cause this behaviour?
