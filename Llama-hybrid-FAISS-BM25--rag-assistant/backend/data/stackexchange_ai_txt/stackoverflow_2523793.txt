Try to request as Firefox does. You can see the request headers in Firebug, so add them to your request object: import urllib2 request = urllib2.Request('http://your.tld/...') request.add_header('User-Agent', 'some fake agent string') request.add_header('Referer', 'fake referrer') ... response = urllib2.urlopen(request) # check content type: print response.info().getheader('Content-Type') There's also HTTPCookieProcessor which can make it better, but I don't think you'll need it in most cases. Have a look at python's documentation: http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html
