Many systems employ an independent data layer to handle persistence to and from a database. There are several models for the organization of such a layer. Some use a sort of factory-like implementation, others employ a one-to-one mapping with one data layer class per domain class. The model for the data layer often depends on style and preference. What is important is separating the persistence layer from the domain layer. I believe there are tools out there that will help you generate this layer, but my PHP knowledge is thin so I can't name any specifically for PHP.
