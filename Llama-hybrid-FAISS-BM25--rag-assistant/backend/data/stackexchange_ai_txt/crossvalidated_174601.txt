Difference between principal directions and principal component scores in the context of dimensionality reduction

I have performed principal component analysis (PCA) of data matrix $X$ by doing singular value decomposition (SVD) $$ X = U S V', $$ where the columns of $V$ are the principal directions/axes and the columns of $US$ are the principal components (scores). I have 12 attributes so I also get 12 principal directions/axes. I have found the variance explained and chose to consider only 6 of the 12 principal directions since these 6 explain enough of variance. But I get a little confused: Most websites about PCA say that I should choose some principal components, but isn't it more correct to choose principal directions/axes since my objective is to reduce dimensionality? I have seen that my matrix $V$ consists of 12 column vectors, each with 12 elements. If I choose 6 of these columns vectors, each vector still has 12 elements - but how is this possible if I have reduced the dimensionality? Besides, there are 12 column vectors of $US$, representing the principal components (scores), but each column vector has an awful lot of elements. What does it mean? I am really confused. I have read a lot about this, but I still don't quite understand it.
