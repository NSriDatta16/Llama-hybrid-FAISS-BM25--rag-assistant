I'm not interested in identifying this variation, but simply does the mean percent of sales vary between country ... I have the actual numbers - but they vary wildly between stores (some store have ten times as many customers) - the relevant metric for comparison is percent. Since the question you're asking is the percent between countries, and the absolute number of sales varies greatly between stores in the same country, perhaps you should consider working at the granularity not of store-sales by months, but of single sales. Consider the case where some country has two stores, with figures that never vary from month to month. The first store services 1000 customers per month, out of which 200 make a sale, and the second store services 10000 customers per month, out of which 1000 make a sale. The country has an average sales rate of $$ \frac{200 + 1000}{1000 + 10000} \neq \frac{\frac{200}{1000} + \frac{1000}{10000}}{2}. $$ Working in single-sale granularity is easy. Suppose there are $m$ countries, and country $i$ had a total of $c_i$ customers, out of which $s_i$ made sales ($s_i \leq c_i$). The null hypothesis, according to your question, is that the country does not affect sales. Under the null hypthesis, if $S_i$ is the random variable of the sales in country $i$, then $$E[S_i] = c_i \frac {\sum_i s_i}{\sum_i c_i}.$$ In fact, $S_i$ has the hypergeometric distribution $$P(S_i = k) = \frac{{\sum_i s_i \choose k}{\sum_i c_i - \sum_i s_i \choose c_i - k}}{{\sum_i c_i \choose c_i}}. $$ If $S_i \neq E[S_i]$ (which will almost certainly happen), you can use a summation of the above to see what is the p-value of the result (i.e., the probability of obtaining a result at least as far away from the expectation as this one). As $m$ is small, it might pay to directly use here the Bonferroni correction . That is, multiply the p-value obtained per each country by $m$. If it is still smaller than some threshold, reject the null hypothesis.
