First, you should note that for the reduced model (in this context), $\bar{Y}_j$ is the average of $Y$ values where $X=x_j$ . That is, we relate to the $X$ variable (in this case, hours ) as a category rather than to its actual value. This is simply a one-way ANOVA model. The full model, where we do relate to the nominal value of $X$ , is the simple linear regression (just as you said). It's a bit confusing in R because the anova function is for comparing models, but an ANOVA model is built using the aov function. In any case, this is what you're looking for: df the models are > summary(full) Call: lm(formula = concentration ~ hours, data = df) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.5333 -0.4043 -0.1373 0.4157 0.8487 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
