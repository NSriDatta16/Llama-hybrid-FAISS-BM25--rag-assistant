I would advice against using a neural network or equivalent as, I assume, you have got such a good prior based on your experience with the store (ie that there are probably day-to-day / seasonal trends and some level of smoothness) and I imagine a relatively small amount of data. A better option IMO would be to go for a kernel method such as a Gaussian Process or SVM.
