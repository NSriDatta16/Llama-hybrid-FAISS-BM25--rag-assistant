I can't help you with the user permissions (Lars hit the important points), but I wanted to share some information that may be of use. You mentioned that you're trying to move site collections between content databases and haven't found an API the can be leveraged. Have you looked into SharePoint's Content Deployment API (also know as the PRIME API) to see if it can assist? The types of which I'm speaking are located in the Microsoft.SharePoint.Deployment namespace, and they provide you with mechanisms to export (via SPExport ) site collections as CAB files and then import them (via SPImport ). SharePoint leverages types in this namespace for its own content deployment paths and jobs (in MOSS); it's also the API that is leveraged by the STSADM.EXE executable for export ( STSADM.EXE -o export ) and complementary import operations. For that matter, it's also used by SharePoint Designer for it's site "backup" and "restore" operations. For an example of how this API can be leveraged, check out the SharePoint Content Deployment Wizard tool on CodePlex ( http://www.codeplex.com/SPDeploymentWizard ). I hope this gives you a potential alternative to shelling out to a command line in your timer job!
