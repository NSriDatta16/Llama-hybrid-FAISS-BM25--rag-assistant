C#: custom array sorting

I would like to sort an array of strings in a directory, given a custom mapping (it's actually a sorting of stock names based on their sector). I am unsure of what data structures to use to represent the mapping, and how to write the custom sort method. So for instance, suppose I had the following string array: string[] fileNames = "bac.csv", "c.csv", "cvx.csv", "java.csv", "msft.csv", "xom.csv"; And here are the mappings: {"bac", "c"} => 0 {"msft", "java"} => 1 {"xom", "cvx"} => 2 I would like string[] customSort(string[] fileNames) to return the following: "bac.csv", "c.csv", "java.csv", "msft.csv", "xom.csv", "cvx.csv" What data structure would you use to represent the mappings, and what's an elegant way of writing the sort method?
