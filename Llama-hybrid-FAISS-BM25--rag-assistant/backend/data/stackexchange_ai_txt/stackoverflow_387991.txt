printing a list of persons with more than one home, each home with more than one phone number

I have a class Person which can have several Homes, each one with one or many Phone numbers. I have defined the classes, but now i am trying to create a view wich list every person, with all its homes and all the phone numbers for each home address... something like: john smith 123 fake str 305-99-8877 305-99-8876 321 oak road 444-98-7654 peter guy 453 north ave... so far i have something like this: (on my views.py) def ViewAll(request): people = Person.objects.all() render_to_response('viewall.html', {'people': people}) (and on my template) {% for guy in people %} {{ guy.name }} {% if person.home_address_set.all %} {{ home_address }} {% for ?????? in ???? %} #print phone numbers in each home {% endfor %} {% endif %} {% endfor %} any idea of how to write the for I'm missing? of course, if there is another way (a better more elegant or efficient way) of doing what I need, I would love to hear it.
