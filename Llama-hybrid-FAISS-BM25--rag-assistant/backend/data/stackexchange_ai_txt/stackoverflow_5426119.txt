Problem with error about model being passed into partial view

So I am trying to render a partial view into my page and I am getting the below error: ERROR The model item passed into the dictionary is of type 'System.Collections.Generic.List`1[GettingOrganized.Models.Todo]', but this dictionary requires a model item of type 'GettingOrganized.Models.Todo'. I don't see what is wrong with the partial view or controller. PARTIAL VIEW " %> Fields model.Title) %> model.Title) %> model.Title) %> Controller Index View that Renders the Partial View: Any thoughts? I would like to keep it as close to this setup since is strong typed. UPDATE So to provide a few more details, now that problem is becoming more clear. I am rendering the view on the page in a div and hiding it the user clicks a certain link. Then I want to show the div. This same partial is used in a "Create" view where you can create a "Todo". But I am now wanting to use the partial in the Index view which shows a list of the model "Todo". The model passed in, in the "Index" view: Inherits="System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage >" %> So if I don't want to loop through a foreach loop, and just want to show one instance of the model, who do I do that? Also I can use the following view for the partial and it will work which takes away the strongly typed to the model: WORKING PARTIAL Fields Title: Possible Answer However, I believe I might have found an answer. Is this a proper way to handle this?
