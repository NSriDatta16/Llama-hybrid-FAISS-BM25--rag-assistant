You've got some good ideas, i'll try to push you along a bit in the right direction. In this kind of simple situation, your first instinct should be to make pictures! A good plot can really point you in the right direction. To that end, i'll put your data into R df A decent suspicion is that a higher frequency of families will own a house when their income is higher, let's look. I'll calculate the frequency that a family in a certain income bracket owns a house, and the log odds of that frequency df$rate and then make a simple plot plot(df$x, df$logodd) This is quite suggestive that the log odds of owning a house increases as a linear function of income . You mention R , so you're going to want to study the glm function, setting the family to "binomial" for logistic regression. I don't want to give away the whole thing, as checking the documentation and figuring out how to fit the model is a really important skill. Try ?glm to get yourself started.
