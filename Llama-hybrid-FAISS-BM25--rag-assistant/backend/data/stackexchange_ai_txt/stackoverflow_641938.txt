TDD ensures that developers give equal importance to test cases as compared to their business logic. I followed it in my project and i could see the advantages: Since i started with writing my test cases first, i ensured that my test cases handle all the possible coverages of a business logic, thereby catching/reducing the number of bugs. Some times its not practical since it requires enough time to write these test cases. The bottom line is you need to unit test your code really well.So either you start with implementation and then ensure that there are enough test cases for all the scenarios (Most people dont hence this practice has emerged.) or write the test methods do a dry run and then write your implementation. Your implementation is said to be complete only when all your testcases pass successfully.
