Welcome to the site! In short - yes, it is fair to say that components 1 and 2 are weaker linear predictors of your target. PCA converts a set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables - it's a dimension reduction technique to weed out correlated features - and involves only the predictor variables. It is perfectly reasonable to see that the principal components are not strong predictors of the target response, as they were formed without a view (i.e. independently) of the target response.
