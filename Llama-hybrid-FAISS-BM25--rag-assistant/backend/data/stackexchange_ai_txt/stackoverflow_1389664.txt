In what way do you want them to be organised? More specifically what doesn't the Task View do that you want to do? For information you can do the following with the standard tasks view: Click each column header in the task view to sort by that column ascending/descending. Select the View Menu (downward triangle in top right of view) and Group tasks by type Show only a particular task type Select Configure Contents... then : Select a Scope to restrict the tasks shown to your desired scope (I find On selected element and its children particularly handy). Filter tasks by description text (using contains or does not contain ) Filter based on Priority and/or Completed status and Task Type There are also a few other options you may find useful if you dig through the View Menu.
