How is 1-bit bitmap data converted to 8bit (24bpp)?

Supposing I have 4 bitmaps, say, CMYK, all of which are 1bit/pixel and are of different colors, and I wanted to convert them to an 8bit/color (24bpp) bitmap, how would I do this? if the data looks like this: // the Cyan separation CCCC CCCC CCCC CCCC CCCC CCCC CCCC CCCC ... // the magenta separation, and so on.. MMMM MMMM MMMM MMMM MMMM MMMM MMMM MMMM ... Say, the Cyan had an RGB value of (0,255,255), and at Pixel 0 (first pixel), I had a value of 1 (on), and the Magenta had an RGB value of (255,255,0), and at the same pixel, had a value of 1.. What would the first RGB pixel look like? Would it look like this? BBBB BBBB GGGG GGGG RRRR RRRR // would this 3-byte sequence actually be 255,255,255 // because the cyan has (0,255,255) and the // magenta has (255,255,0)? Thanks, just confused as to how to convert 1bit separations into an 8bit image.. Thanks..
