I am working on a similar problem -- generating word documents from information stored in a SharePoint site. The real magic here relies on using Content Controls in office 2007 - as the new version of the Office suite is based on Office Open XML, generating documents from data is almost trivial. Enabling the documents to be editable after creation is a simple configuration change that can be made either programmatically or in the document template itself. In fact I think the true value of the platform wills shine when you can see how easily you can your organizations business processes to SharePoint. Getting content from deep within a segment of your company, through the various approval steps to the public facing internet site is breathtakingly simple, once everything is configured properly. Here are some good blog posts on generating OOXML docs on the server ECMA Office Open XML - Options for Generating Word Documents (on the server;)) Generating Word Documents on the Server (Part 2) - Dynamically Adding Content Controls / Structured Document Tags (SDT) using System.IO.Packaging Note that clients DO NOT need to run Office 2007 to open these documents, you can either have a conversion process, or you can install the free compatibility packs for Office XP, 2000 & 2003 As far as SharePoint as CMS, I think its a pretty compelling proposition. There is definitely some configuration and implementation challenges, but I think that will be the case with any enterprise CMS package. One important consideration is the amount of traffic your CMS'd site will see. I don't think SharePoint is ready to scale up to google-esque traffic, but its certainly going to be good enough for a typical corporate internet presence. Here is a list of some public sites that are running MOSS Once you get past the hurdle of initial configuration, it becomes very easy to enable CMS tasks across the organization as it works so well on both sides of the Firewall. I think its a great product, and amazed by its flexibility and extensibility. jt
