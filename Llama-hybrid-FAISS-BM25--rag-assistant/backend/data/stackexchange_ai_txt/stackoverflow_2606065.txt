To paraphrase Francis Penov's solution. The (usual) problem is: given an array of integers of arbitrary length that contain only elements repeated an even times of times except for one value which is repeated an odd times of times, find out this value. The solution is: acc = 0 for i in array: acc = acc ^ i Your current problem is an adaptation. The trick is that you are to find the element that is repeated twice so you need to adapt solution to compensate for this quirk. acc = 0 for i in len(array): acc = acc ^ i ^ array[i] Which is what Francis' solution does in the end, although it destroys the whole array (by the way, it could only destroy the first or last element...) But since you need extra-storage for the index, I think you'll be forgiven if you also use an extra integer... The restriction is most probably because they want to prevent you from using an array. It would have been phrased more accurately if they had required O(1) space (1000 can be seen as N since it's arbitrary here).
