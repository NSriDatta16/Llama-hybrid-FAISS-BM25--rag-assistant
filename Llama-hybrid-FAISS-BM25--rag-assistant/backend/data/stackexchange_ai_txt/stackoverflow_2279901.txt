Hook in datatemplate view switch/change

I am switching my UserControls via DataTemplate. When I leave the UserControl/DataTemplate View I need to ask wether the user wants to save or not because else all data will be lost like graphical location points x,y of a user drag/dropped Rectangle on a canvas. How can I hook into the datatemplate change and bring up my own save dialog?
