Memory allocation for Java Webstart Application

I'm using a Java webstart application called BLAST2GO I'm running into problems with memory allocation. It needs to load a large data set into memory, so I've been trying to allocate 3-6GB to this application. However, no matter what I set as the max heap size, it always uses 455MB (as indicated by the message bar: 'Memory usage: xxMB of 455MB'). I've tried setting it to very reasonable levels (1024 MB), but still only 455MB are allocation. Any ideas? BTW, I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit with 24GB memory, 8 procs. Update : Here is the JNLP they provide. I get the same result when I edit the values of the initial-heap-size and max-heap-size attributes. Blast2GO 3072M CIPF - UPV - IVIA Blast2GO 3072M Blast2GO 3072M Update : I tried changing the href attribute in the root jnlp tag and I got a very strange message on the terminal. I wonder if Java is re-downloading the JNLP from this URL each time and ignoring my attempts to edit the JNLP. Is there a way I can prevent this? > javaws blast2go3GB.jnlp Error occurred during initialization of VM CCoouulldd nnoott crreesaetrev et heen oJuagvha svpiarcteu aflo rm aocbhjiencet. heap Final Update : Turns out this was a problem with the Java Version. I got the expected behavior when I downloaded and used Sun Java.
