**I just realized you might be looking for a Python library that can do this for you. If so, I apologize for the dud answer lol, but if you're trying to visualize a DB so you can perform maintenance, then my answer is the same :) ** It's not free, but I assure you SQL Dependency Tracker from RedGate is well worth the money. It produces a graph like you're describing, allowing you to see all the participants in every procedure, key, view, trigger, etc. Awesome software: http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-dependency-tracker/ I know you said free, but I was in the same boat as you several years ago and looked quite a bit for something that could do the job, free or not. Until I found this software, nothing else could do what I needed. I strongly encourage you to find the money for this tool if you need to do this sort of thing on a regular basis.
