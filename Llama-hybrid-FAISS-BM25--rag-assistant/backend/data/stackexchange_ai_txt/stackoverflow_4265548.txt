I found old project nux : a http://acs.lbl.gov/software/nux//api/nux/xom/pool/XOMUtil.html jaxbMarshal/jaxbUnmarshal use DOMConverter ;-( b. http://acs.lbl.gov/software/nux/api/nux/xom/io/StaxUtil.html ...also includes a XOM Builder implementation that uses a StAX parser instead of a SAX parser; plus a XMLStreamReader implementation reading from an underlying XOM Document or fragment; plus other tools. StaxUtil.createXMLStreamReader(Node root) Constructs and returns a StAX XMLStreamReader pull parser implementation that reads from an underlying XOM Node; typically a Document or fragment (subtree); Ideal for efficient conversion of a XOM tree to SOAP/AXIOM, JAXB 2, JiBX or XMLBeans, for example when incrementally converting XQuery results via an Unmarshaller, perhaps in combination with a StreamingPathFilter. May be this can help?
