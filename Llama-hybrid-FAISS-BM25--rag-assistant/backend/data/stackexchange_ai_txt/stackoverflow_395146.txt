You could do something like this with virtual machines, though obviously there would be a performance penalty and I'm not sure whether you can run Leopard itself under a virtual machine. (You just suspend the VM duplicate it and then restart it). Certainly doing this natively for the OS would require a huge amount of storage as you have to duplicate the memory and the entire hard drive (as changes to the hard drive could be incompatible with the saved state). I imagine that at somepoint in the future something like this could be done using ZFS.
