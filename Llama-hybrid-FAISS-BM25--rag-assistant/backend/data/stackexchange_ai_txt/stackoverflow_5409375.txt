"T1" is the ID of a textarea. Using jQuery: var content = $('#T1').html().replace(/¶/g,"") //get rid of existing indicator content = $('#T1').html().replace(/\n/g,"¶\n") //add indicator $('#T1').html(content) You cannot do this without modifying the content of the textarea. You can't see what you don't have in your page. You'd need to strip out the paragraph character before saving. Hook up the code to the onkeyup event.
