Where is EnqueueDelay method call in silverlight unit testing?

I have created a silverllight unit test page and it has the reference to both Silverlight.Testing and ...UnitTesting.Silverlight. I have reference to both of them in my test project as using as well. When I tried to do EnqueueDelay(1000), VS does not recoganise this as a valid method call. What am I doing wrong? Thanks,
