matrix factorization with non-negative constraint only on one of the factors

I have a 2D spectral data time series with a wavelength dimension and a time dimension, and I'd like to decompose it to the time evolution ($SV^T$ for SVD and $H$ for NNMF) of several spectral complements ($U$ for SVD and $W$ for NNMF). The time traces must be non-negative and spectra must NOT have sign constraints. SVD gives negative elements in both left and right singular vectors. NNMF, as it should, gives non-negative elements for both factors. What I need is somewhere in the middle: non-sign-constraint left vectors and non-negative right vectors. Is it possible to alter the algorithm of SVD or NNMF to achieve that ? Perhaps using the result of SVD or NNMF as initiation of some sort of optimization ? I'm not very familiar with statistics, so could you please define all the terms if you use mathematical expressions ?
