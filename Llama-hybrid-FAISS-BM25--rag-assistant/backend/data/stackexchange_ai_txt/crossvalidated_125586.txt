There are two issues you should pay attention: We don't need the distribution of any kind for $Y$ - we only want to be able to predict $y$ values using given $x$. Many people how use linear regression don't derive it using statistics, rather they minimize $l_2$ norm of residuals - and achieve the same result. In some cases we can't evaluate marginal distribution, while we are still able to calculate mean value of this distribution. See, for example, paper on heteroskedastic Gaussian processes regression http://www.icml-2011.org/papers/456_icmlpaper.pdf , at the end of the section 4: we can evaluate mean value of predictive distribution, but we can't calculate density for predictive distribution (as it is analytically intractable).
