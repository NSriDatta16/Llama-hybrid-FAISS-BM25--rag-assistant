I am not able launch JNLP applications using "Java Web Start"?

Up until recently, I was able to launch/open JNLP files in Firefox using Java web start . Don't know what happened all of a sudden JNLP files stopped launching, a splash screen appears saying Java Starting... and then nothing happens. Even the Java Console in the browser and javacpl.cpl applet doesn't open. Tried all possibilities: removed all older version and installed the latest JRE (java version "1.6.0_17"), still it doesn't work. Done some googling for this problem, people suggested to start javaws.exe with -viewer option but same behavior (a splash screen appears saying "Java Starting..." and then disappears) The problem is that I don't know any place (logs etc.) to look for to see what is causing the problem. I am using WinXP SP3, and some of the screenshots below shows further info about my system. I can provide any other detail if required but please help me solve this problem.
