permutation test for a difference in means of an autocorrelated time series over two unequal time periods

I'm trying to figure out a way to test for a difference in the means (for instance) over two somewhat unequal periods in an AR(1) time series. For data without any AR structure, I might do something like the example below using a permutation test. But, knowing that the data aren't ~iid, how can I modify my approach? E.g., fit an AR(1) model for each sample and then add it back into each random sample? library(ggplot2) set.seed(123) # an ar1 ts with an offset n testStat) / m #0.048 ```
