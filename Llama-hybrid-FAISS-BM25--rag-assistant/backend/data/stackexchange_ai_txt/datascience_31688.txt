How to improve when starting out in data science

A little bit of background info,I recently started a new job as a data analyst where I have to use data to provide insights on the IT operations and devops process of my company. I’m fresh out of college, I have a bachelors in engineering, which covered the basics of statistics such as discrete/continuous probability distributions, naïve bayes probability and some hypothesis testing. Regarding data science, I used Splunk to analyze machine data and applied a few basic machine learning models during an internship and taught myself how to use some python libraries such as pandas and numpy. But now I’ve hit a brick wall, I don’t really know how to apply the statistics that I’ve learnt, and how probability distributions and hypothesis testing all gel together to provide insight. My immediate task involves providing some insights, machine learning will come at a later stage and although I am interested, I intend to work on it later. My question is, where do I go from here? Are there any books that I can read that provide examples on how to apply the statistical theories that I’ve learnt? Most ebooks that I’ve found don’t really touch much on this, and most internet articles give examples in a business context, which I don’t find helpful or applicable.
