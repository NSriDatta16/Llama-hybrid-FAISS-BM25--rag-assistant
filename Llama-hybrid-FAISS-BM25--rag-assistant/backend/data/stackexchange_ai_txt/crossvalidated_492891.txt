How to calculate a confidence interval in R for a binomial mixed-effect model (which was fit using the R package glmmLasso)?

How does one calculate confidence intervals for a binomial mixed-effect model that was fit using the R package glmmLasso? I am interested in the 95% confidence intervals for the fixed effects. confint throws "no applicable method for 'vcov' applied to an object of class "glmmLasso"", and intervals does not seem to work either. edit: I see that the recommended approach to calculating standard errors in LASSO is to use Bayesian LASSO , but the packages recommended there do not handle random effects models. Nonetheless, on closer inspection glmmLasso does seem to produce standard errors for the parameters: is there any issue with simply turning these into confidence intervals using the standard approach described in the top answer here for getting confidence intervals from standard errors in logistic regression ?
