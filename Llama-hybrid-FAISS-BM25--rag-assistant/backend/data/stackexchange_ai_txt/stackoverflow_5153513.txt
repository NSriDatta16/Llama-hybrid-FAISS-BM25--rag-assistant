Resize Height of Object/Embed with jQuery?

I have an object/embed on my page: When I click a button, it activates some jQuery scripting... $('#chat_shell').animate({ height: $('#chat_shell').height() + slideHeight }, slideSpeed); But instead, when I click the button, I get the following error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined Why is this happening and how do I fix it? I know a possible solution is to wrap the object/embed into a DIV, set the height to 100% and then edit the height of the DIV; but that is an inelegant solution and often has compatibility problems as height should really never be set to 100%.
