p@10 is indeed precision at 10, but normally you would perform something like cross validation and take the averages across the many train-test repetitions. So my guess is that the values you see on the table are the averages across test datasets. You are right it's not very clear in the methods. I checked the paper, there is a section under "Evaluation metrics": To quantitatively evaluate the proposed methods, in each test case, we use historic collaboration data (data before 2001) for training and the last four years (2001-2005) for validation So most like the values you see are averages across years or whatever test case might entail.. just my educated guess
