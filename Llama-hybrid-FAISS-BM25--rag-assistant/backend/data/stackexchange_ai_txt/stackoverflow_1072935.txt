Looks like some nastiness in your CSS. If I've got this right, and I hope that I have, you are looking to have the committee members list just to the right of the title 'Committee members' With IE6 I tend to avoid using margins where possible as there are some fun and interesting bugs there for the unwary developer. The following may help you out, but I can't honestly say what it will do to the rest of your page. .organizer-label { float: left; width: 145px; } .organizer-value { padding-left: 5px; float: left; } .organizer-value ul { margin-left: 1em; margin-top: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-top: 0; line-height: 1.1em; } Hope that this helps R.
