How to play a sound when user touches a particular area on the screen

I am designing an app which consists of an image... I am trying to play sound by using the following code... - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint point = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if (CGRectContainsPoint(CGRectMake(320,480,0,0),point));//CGRectMake(5, 5, 40, 130), point)) { AVAudioPlayer *player; if(!player){ NSString* resourcePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath]; resourcePath = [resourcePath stringByAppendingString:@"/try.wav"]; NSLog(@"Path to play: %@", resourcePath); NSError* err; //Initialize our player pointing to the path to our resource player = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL: [NSURL fileURLWithPath:resourcePath] error:&err]; if( err ){ //bail! NSLog(@"Failed with reason: %@", [err localizedDescription]); } else{ //set our delegate and begin playback player.delegate = self; [player play]; } } } } In the above code the sound play when touch is detected anywhere on the screen. I want to play 5 different sounds when user touches differern place on the screen(say 1.wav when user touch between 100-200 in width and 50-100 in height). Can anyone please help me how to set the radius and also to play different sounds when touched in the radius specified...
