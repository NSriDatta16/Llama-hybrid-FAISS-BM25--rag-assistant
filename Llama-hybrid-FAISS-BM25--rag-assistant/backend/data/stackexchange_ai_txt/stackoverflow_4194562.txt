Have a look at the UIGestureRecognizer class available in iOS4. This can be used to detect certain gestures like rotation, panning & pinching. Once the gesture has been detected it's up to you to add the correct transform to the picture for instance. The gesture recognizers really are the way to go, no more touchesBegan/Ended madness. But they come at a cost, as they are iOS4 only. Link: UIGestureRecognizer Class Reference
