how do I get the difference between two R named lists?

OK, I've got two named lists, one is "expected" and one is "observed". They may be complex in structure, with arbitrary data types. I want to get a new list containing just those elements of the observed list that are different from what's in the expected list. Here's an example: Lexp Lwant is what I want the result to be. I tried this: > setdiff(Lobs, Lexp) [[1]] [1] "ni" Nope, that loses the name, and I don't think setdiff pays attention to the names. Order clearly doesn't matter here, and I don't want a=1 to match with b=1 . Not sure what a good approach is... Something that loops over a list of names(Lobs) ? Sounds clumsy and non-R-like, although workable... Got any elegant ideas?
