Does MS Access deserve to be learned?

It comes with Office, it is a "medium good" database, it has more than 800 questions here until today, but I never paid attention to it. I'm losing something interesting? I am talking about MS-Access as an IDE for rapid prototyping (or something similar), not about MS-Access as a database only.
