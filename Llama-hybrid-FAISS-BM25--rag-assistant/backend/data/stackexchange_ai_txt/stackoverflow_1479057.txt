Your object model should be designed so that it makes sense to an object consumer. It should not be tied to the data model to the greatest extent practical. It sounds like it is more intuitive for the object consumer to think in terms of the three attributes. If there are no performance concerns that speak to the contrary, I would let the object consumer work with those attributes and not concern him with the internal workings of data storage (i.e. not require them to know or care about an internal index).
