What you're encountering is a pretty common issue. Fortunately, you have a very good size dataset (380K rows), so even though curse of dimensionality applies, I think you might be able to get away with actually not putting that much effort into transforming your data. Have you tried just one-hot encoding it and seeing what happens? Also - did you mention one-hot encoding because you're using a neural network? Have you tried not one-hot encoding and using RandomForest? This is not perfect, but I would recommend using your subject matter expertise (and knowledge of the data) to slightly reduce the dimensionality by grouping the data together a bit. As a side note, you said "So, I wish to transform high cardinal variable without using any encoding approach". Someone should please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's impossible, by definition. If you're transforming it (esp. in a way that changes dimensionality or representation, you are by definition encoding it). Try just using the segment field instead of product (I know you said you think it's really the product, but just give it a try. See if the results you get are good enough). If not.. Try using the product field as is in a RandomForest model (no encoding) and remove the segment field (it probably wouldn't add much value on top of the specific product, right?) Look at the frequency distribution of your product purchases. It'll probably be some kind of exponentially decaying distribution, where there are some products that account for hugely disproportionate fractions of all purchases (one product accounting for 5% of all purchases because it's so popular), and others that barely ever get purchased. Find what you think is an appropriate cutoff (for example, maybe you say if a product hasn't ever been purchased more than X times) you throw all of those into an "Other" bucket. This will probably be some combination of you trying different thresholds + reasonable deduction. If your dataset is 380K and you have a product purchased 5 or 10 times, your model probably won't be able to figure out anything useful about that specific product. So now, your "product" field becomes, for example, your top 100 products + one "Other" category that is everything else. See if this starts to give you any kind of result.
