Filter Visual Studio (or ReSharper) Intellisense by type

Is there a way to filter the Visual Studio Intellisense by type? Example: when I'm using a control such as Infragistics' XamDataGrid there are a seemingly endless number of fields, properties, events and methods. I'd like to be able to filter the intellisense by type, i.e., show me only events. I've found these suggestions on the JetBrains site, but no resolutions: RSP-27166 - Filter Events/Properties/Methods in IntelliSense RSP-101619 - Enhanced control over items displayed in completion popups (intellisense window)
