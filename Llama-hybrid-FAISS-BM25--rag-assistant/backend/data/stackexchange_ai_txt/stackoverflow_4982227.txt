Unfortunately, I cannot address all your questions. However, if you don't know where to start, I would recommend having a look (if possible) at Pro Zend Framework Techniques: Build a Full CMS Project . The book is not perfect, it does not cover plugins or extensions, but it gave me some information and a basic idea of how to build a CMS using ZF. One of the more interesting things that I learned from this book was using Node pattern as your data structure for CMS and how to use it in ZF as well as how to make layout skins. Additionally, you could have a look at the code of existing ZF's CMS systems such as TomatoCMS and Magento .
