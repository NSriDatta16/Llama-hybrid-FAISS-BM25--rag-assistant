Is it ok to have "fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred" in the case of predicting disease?

I know this isn't directly related to statistics but I didn't know where else I should post this so please let me know and I will remove the question if this is the wrong forum. My question is very simple. I have a logistic regression model that is predicting whether or not a patient has a certain type of disease. And I'm getting the warning "fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred". Should I be worried or super happy about it?
