I agree with Jonathan Oren - in general, GPT-4 works fairly well for straightforward sentiment analysis, e.g. product reviews. One caveat though is that there are most certainly biases inherent in the dataset which was used to train GPT-4. The GPT-4 tech report here: https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf has much more information. GPT-4 has various biases in its outputs that we have taken efforts to correct but which will take some time to fully characterize and manage. It can represent various societal biases and worldviews that may not be representative of the users intent or of widely shared values.
