For example, assuming text file is named mydata.txt and is organized as follows: time(row1) bVar(row1) dVar(row1) aVar(row1) cVar(row1) time(row2) bVar(row2) dVar(row2) aVar(row2) cVar(row2) ... time(rowN) bVar(rowN) dVar(rowN) aVar(rowN) cVar(rowN) So, the desire is to create a table that is ordered with these columns and then use the numpy.genfromtxt command to populate the table. # Column and Table definition with desired order class parmDev(tables.IsDescription): time = tables.Float64Col() bVar = tables.Float64Col() dVar = tables.Float64Col() aVar = tables.Float64Col() cVar = tables.Float64Col() #... mytab = tables.createTable( group, tabName, paramDev ) data = numpy.genfromtxt(mydata.txt) mytab.append(data) This makes for straightforward code and is very fast. But, the table columns are always ordered alphabetically and the appended data is ordered according to the desired order. Is there a way to have the order of the table columns follow the class definition order instead of being alphabetical.
