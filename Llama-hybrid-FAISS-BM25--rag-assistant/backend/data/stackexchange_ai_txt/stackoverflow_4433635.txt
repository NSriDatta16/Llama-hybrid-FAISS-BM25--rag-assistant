Those failures are not from the mirroring connection. Those errors are from your client trying to connect to the mirror instance. The first error is from a local service that is attempting to open an explicit database that is offline (perhaps is trying to connect to the mirrored database). The second error is from a client that had failed the SSPI handshake. And the third one is from a client that has succeeded the hansdhake but is not trusted. You have to verify your client apps connection strings and, your agent jobs etc etc and see who is attempting these connections.
