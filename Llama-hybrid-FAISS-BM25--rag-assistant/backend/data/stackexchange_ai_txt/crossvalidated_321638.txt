It's not the right analysis. Putting aside the issues from self-report, and even the issue that smokers rarely "quit" indefinitely, and even the issue of what a terrible measure BMI is, this is not a difference-in-difference analysis. A difference in difference requires that crossover cases have a control group that does not cross over. For instance, in a matched experiment of physical fitness, two athletes lifting weights will expectedly gain muscle mass as a function of their routine exercise, but if one athlete supplements with protein and creatine, I need to calculate difference-in-difference to see what the incremental effect (eq. interaction) of supplementation is on physical fitness. It matters not, by contrast, whether the crossover period was set administratively or out of one's own volition. A method similar to difference in difference is interrupted time series which follows the approach I'll outline below. Approach 1: case cohort design : You can make a difference-in-difference analysis out of cohort data using a case-cohort design. I am assuming, as I said, you have a reliable measure of those who definitely did quit smoking and those who continued smoking continuously. Here you match a quitter to a non-quitter 1:1 using similar baseline covariates (age, sex, socioeconomic status, site, etc.) you can compare trends in a participant who quit smoking to those of a person who did not quit. Fit in this subsample a model with a random effect for the pair ID, a time trend as a numeric or categorical variable, baseline BMI, smoking status as a time varying covariate, and the interaction of smoking status and time trend. Test this against the statistical model which does not adjust for smoking status. Approach 2: APC time smoking interaction As before, adjusting for confounding variables (age, sex, SES, and such), fit a time series model with random intercepts for repeated measures within participant, BMI at the start, and a fixed effect for time (either linear or categorical). Such a model can carefully claim to capture the effects of age, period, and cohort (APC) on BMI. As before adjust for smoking and its interaction with time. Test against the null model which does not adjust for smoking.
