Neural Network Categorical Inputs - 200k Inputs

I am building a neural network and one of the inputs is a unique customer number. There are about 200k customers and it is important that they are an input. What is the best way to prepare these as inputs in my model? Is 200k 1-of-C categorical inputs the best way to do it?
