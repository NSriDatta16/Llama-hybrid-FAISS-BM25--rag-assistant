The OpenID Membership Provider project might be what you are looking for. And even though you're not using Login controls, it's still recommended to leverage the Membership Provider model for authentication. It's not usually necessary to go as deep as implementing FormsAuthentication specific functionality, since writing a MembershipProvider is pretty trivial, and I've never found a case where it wasn't flexible enough to handle. Note that often you only need to implement one method (ValidateUser()) of the interface to get a working provider.
