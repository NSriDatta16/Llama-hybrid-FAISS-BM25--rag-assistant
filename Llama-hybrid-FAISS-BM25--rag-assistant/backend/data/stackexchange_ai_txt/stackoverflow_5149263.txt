Behold, the filtered index . From the documentation (emphasis mine): A filtered index is an optimized nonclustered index especially suited to cover queries that select from a well-defined subset of data. It uses a filter predicate to index a portion of rows in the table. A well-designed filtered index can improve query performance as well as reduce index maintenance and storage costs compared with full-table indexes. And here's an example combining a unique index with a filter predicate: create unique index MyIndex on MyTable(ID) where RecordStatus = 1; This essentially enforces uniqueness of ID when RecordStatus is 1 . Following the creation of that index, a uniqueness violation will raise an arror: Msg 2601, Level 14, State 1, Line 13 Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.MyTable' with unique index 'MyIndex'. The duplicate key value is (9999). Note: the filtered index was introduced in SQL Server 2008. For earlier versions of SQL Server, please see this answer .
