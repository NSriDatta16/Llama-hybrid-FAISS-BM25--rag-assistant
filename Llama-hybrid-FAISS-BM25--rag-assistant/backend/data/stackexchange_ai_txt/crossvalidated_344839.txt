How to determine the type of regression to be used?

I am relatively new into the machine learning field and I came up with the following problem that is giving me some headaches, so any help on it would be greatly appreciated for my inner peace. Consider the following example. For each day of every week of 2017 we have a set of tickets that are classified in 3 main categories (P1, P2 and P3) and we came of with the following results: Year 2017 Category P1 | Week number | Day of week | Number of tickets| | ----------- | ------------| ---------------- | | 30 | Monday | 9 | | 30 | Tuesday | 4 | | 30 | Wednesday | 9 | | 30 | Thursday | 12 | | 30 | Friday | 9 | | 30 | Saturday | 1 | | 30 | Sunday | 1 | | 31 | Monday | 3 | | 31 | Tuesday | 2 | | 31 | Wednesday | 13 | | 31 | Thursday | 10 | | 31 | Friday | 5 | | 31 | Saturday | 0 | | 31 | Sunday | 2 | ...... Category P2 | Week number | Day of week | Number of tickets| | ----------- | ------------| ---------------- | | 30 | Monday | 51 | | 30 | Tuesday | 59 | | 30 | Wednesday | 59 | | 30 | Thursday | 94 | | 30 | Friday | 43 | | 30 | Saturday | 16 | | 30 | Sunday | 29 | | 31 | Monday | 48 | | 31 | Tuesday | 59 | | 31 | Wednesday | 41 | | 31 | Thursday | 47 | | 31 | Friday | 32 | | 31 | Saturday | 18 | | 31 | Sunday | 38 | ....... Category P3 | Week number | Day of week | Number of tickets| | ----------- | ------------| ---------------- | | 30 | Monday | 40 | | 30 | Tuesday | 41 | | 30 | Wednesday | 44 | | 30 | Thursday | 34 | | 30 | Friday | 32 | | 30 | Saturday | 13 | | 30 | Sunday | 4 | | 31 | Monday | 41 | | 31 | Tuesday | 56 | | 31 | Wednesday | 44 | | 31 | Thursday | 46 | | 31 | Friday | 46 | | 31 | Saturday | 17 | | 31 | Sunday | 4 | ...... Basically I want to predict the number of tickets for each category (P1, P2, and P3) that might be generated on the next day and I use the number of weeks as a reference to lock up this problem, that is, I start on week 1 and every time I finish with Sunday then I go on the next week and I continue with my prediction of tickets based on the data of previous days, besides, once I have reached week 53 then I should stop with the prediction because that is the beginning of another year. I am not sure what type of regression I should use for this problem but my guess is that I could use a simple linear regression because I am predicting the data of the following day based on the previous number of tickets that were opened and week number is just like a boundary for setting up a start and end point. On the other hand, if I were to predict the number of tickets that might be opened in this 2018, then I should use multivariate multiple regression on data of years 2015, 2016 and 2017 because I should use week number and day of the week as my dependent variables to predict the number of tickets that might be opened. If I am wrong, please correct me because I am in this site to learn as much as I can in this exciting field of machine learning.
