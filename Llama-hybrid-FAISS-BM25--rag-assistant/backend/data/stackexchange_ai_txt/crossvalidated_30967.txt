Reinforcement Learning Value Iteration Explained

I am having a hard time to understand the value iteration derived from the Bellman equation: $$V_{k=0}(s) = 0$$ $$\forall s : V_{k+1}(s) = \max_a \Bigr[ R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s, \pi(s)) V_k(s') \Bigr]$$ I am trying to understand this on a concrete example I have thought of: A maze and a rat in it: +------------------+ | s2 s3| +------+ s1 +------+ | | | R | There are only three states. $s_1$ is a T-junction with the possible actions, left and right. $s_2$ and $s_3$ is food and something else poision or so. Thus granting rewards $(2,0)$. Everything is determinstic and I would like to use a discounting of $\gamma = 0.5$ How would a concrete example look like: Here are my thoughts: $R(s,a)$ is the reward which would be granted immediately (isn't it?), so I guess for $s_1$ this would be $0$? the sum $\sum_{s'}$ is the sum over the possible transition states, that would be $s_2$ and $s_3$? the transition probability $P(s'|s, \pi(s))$ is not given, but maybe it's just $1/2$ When I try to write it down it does not seem to make a lot sense: \begin{align} V_{k=1}(s_1) = 0 + 0.5 + (0.5 \cdot 0 + 0.5 \cdot 0) = 0 \end{align} This would just become zero again, is that correct? \begin{align} V_{k=1}(s_2) = 3 + 0.5 + (0.5 \cdot 0 + 0.5 \cdot 0) = 3 \end{align} How would the $a$ be evaluated? Its the state of the rat and it should choose the one with the highest result, but what are possible $a$?
