With javascript, how to you get the browser to make sure one part of the page is displayed?

have a DIV with a scroll bar on the page. trying to ensure a particular item is visible to the user. the DIV itself is always contained in the visible area of the page, and the page never has a scrollbar itself. for example, the DIV might have 8 paragraphs, and I want to make sure in certain situations that the user can see paragraph 5 within the DIV right now.
