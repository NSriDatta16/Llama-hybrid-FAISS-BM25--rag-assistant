Can you use a rank test such as Wilcoxon signed-rank test? There is an example http://www.biostathandbook.com/wilcoxonsignedrank.html . I think it's similar to your scenario: Clones in your example would be sites Metal content in your example would be average CO2 concentration August in your example would be 1950-1970 November in your example would be 1971-1991 If the average CO2 do increase over the period, your pairs should not follow a symmetric distribution. You can use the test to reject the null hypothesis that the median difference between pairs of observations is zero.
