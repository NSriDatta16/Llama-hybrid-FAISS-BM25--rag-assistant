The objective with supervised learning is to try to create a model of your data that helps you predict future values. You do that by selecting features on your data set - what you call variables - that you believe represent well the problem. I'm no expert but I understand economy is affected by an enormous number of variables, so even if you create a model that fits the data you currently have based on some of those variables, it might become obsolete the moment variables you did not consider start affecting the end result. That's what I believe your boss was talking about. Now, if you do decide to train a neural network in order to predict Bucket and NPA your first step will be to choose which variables you'll consider in your model. Keeping the 'static' variables will likely make your network have different predictions for, for example, different Product types but that depends on how the data is distributed across this static variables. If you choose to not use the static variables your model will completely ignore them when making predictions, which might not be what you want.
