As noted by microhaus in the comment, the formula you wrote for the variance, $$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N(x_i- \overline{x})^2$$ is actually the sample variance . The formula used in the probabilistic proof of the Chebyshev inequality, $$\sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^2]$$ Is the second central moment or the variance . The equations are not equal and are not meant to be. Rather, the sample variance is meant to be a finite sample analog of the variance which itself is a population parameter. Intuitively, you can see that this is a natural estimator because the expectation can be thought of as an average. This discussion might also be helpful in understanding the difference. You might find this previous question on the difference between the sample and population instructive.
