Interpreting the loads in a biplot

I came across a doubt about the interpretation of the biplot. I know that there are lot of questions related to this topic but I have a very concrete question, but I don't find any response. Suppose the tipical biplot. For that, I attached an image with a biplot. In this picture you can appreciate the axes with PC1 and PC2, the points , colored according a categorical variable and five red lines . These red lines represent the variable loads. This is my question: Taken one of the red lines (loads). Should we expect that ALL the points to get big (or small) as we move along the load lines? Or should it happen only on average? The issue is that I expected that, but I am realizing that it doesn't happen. For a particular load line, I get big(small) values in both sides of the line, and it doesn't make sense for my.
