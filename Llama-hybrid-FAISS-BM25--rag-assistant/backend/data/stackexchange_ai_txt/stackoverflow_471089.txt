Thanks for your suggestion. I was trying to create an interactive component that can be peeled off the page, moved to a new location, and set back down. Just one page - so page flipping is not necessary. I was able to create something suitable. I used the link provided in my question. Originally I was attempting to do this using more difficult code that a coworker discovered. Here is a link to what I am trying to accomplish. http://beeppeep.com/peel/peelndrag.html
