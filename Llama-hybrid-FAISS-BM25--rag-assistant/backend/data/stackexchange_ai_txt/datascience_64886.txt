Is copying parameter considered as plagarism?

So my friends and i are writing a kaggle assignment and the base code is written by me. One of my friend use my base code(feature engineering, labeling, etc.) and put it into a loop to find the best parameter. And the resulting parameter has 7 decimals accuracy which outperforms every other people's result. So if we copying his parameter is it consider as cheating?
