I am assuming that delete/freeing the class object doesn't free what it's member pointer points to, is that correct? That's correct by default, which is why C++ classes have destructors. For example: class C { int* x; public: C () : x (new int[10]) {} // constructor }; C* cptr = new C; // a pointer to a C object If I delete cptr , there will be a memory leak since x isn't freed. So I will add a destructor to C : class C { ... ~C () {delete [] x;} // destructor }; (There are tons of issues with the rest of your question. You seem to have confused Java and C++, which is why most of your question doesn't make sense. I've answered only this fragment to give you an example of how to free resources automatically. I suggest you read a C++ book to get a better understanding of the language.)
