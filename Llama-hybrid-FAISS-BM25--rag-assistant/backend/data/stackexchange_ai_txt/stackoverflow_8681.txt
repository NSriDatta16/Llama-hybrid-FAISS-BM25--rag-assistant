JQuery.Validate failure in Opera

If you're using Opera 9.5x you may notice that our client-side JQuery.Validate code is disabled here at Stack Overflow. function initValidation() { if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Opera") != -1) return; $("#post-text").rules("add", { required: true, minlength: 5 }); } That's because it generates an exception in Opera! Of course it works in every other browser we've tried. I'm starting to seriously, seriously hate Opera. This is kind of a bummer because without proper client-side validation some of our requests will fail. We haven't had time to put in complete server-side messaging when data is incomplete, so you may see the YSOD on Opera much more than other browsers , if you forget to fill out all the fields on the form. Any Opera-ites want to uncomment those lines (they're on core Ask & Answer pages like this one -- just View Source and search for "Opera" ) and give it a go?
