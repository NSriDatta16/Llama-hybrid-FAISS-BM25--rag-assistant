Dealing with autocorrelation using Generalized Least Squares

I have a time series data set where the auto correlation of the residuals follow an exponential decay. I was wondering how I should deal with this? I would like to fit a linear model and have tried using the gls function with the AR1 input. However The AIC is MUCH larger than the original model.
