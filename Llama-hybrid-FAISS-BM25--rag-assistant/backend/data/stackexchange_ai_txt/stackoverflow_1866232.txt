Help me optimize the if else in JavaScript (jQuery)

Is it possible to somehow shorten this code: var i=GetStringFromServer('/url'); if(i){ $('#Div1').hide(); $('#Div2').show(); } else{ $('#Div1).show(); $('#Div2).hide(); } In C# I'd simply do this: bool smth=GetBool(); _el1.Visible=smth; _el2.Visible=!smth; Is it possible to mimick the logic in JavaScript? UPDATE: Thank you guys for nice answers, I peeked at toggle myself before asking but what confused was the method signature: toggle(fn1, fn2); I thought that function expected some tricky callbacks but apparently it's flexible enough to handle both plain booleans and callbacks. UPDATE2: Thanks to Robert's and Fabien's comments, the true answer was finally found. Toggle will always make elements visible or invisible based on evaluating the argument to bool.
