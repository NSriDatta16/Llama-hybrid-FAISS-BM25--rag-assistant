Forgot to reply my solution. The main reason of this output was that the variable muertos which was very noisy inside the random forest. So to avoid modifying the RF (which wasn’t an option due to time restrictions) I’ve choose to separate this variable and fitted a GLM to it. I think the problem could’ve be solved using the Random Forest with variable weights, but I couldn’t try this approach.
