Shell:How to substitute the field of the text while keeping the same blank space

I want to substitute a certain filed of the text while keeping the same blank space: For example, my text is: Please help me with this problem Any suggestion or help will be appreciated Thanks to all who give help And I want to replace the sentence "Any suggestion or help will be appreciated" with "I want the solution" So that the text will be: Please help me with this problem I want the solution Thanks to all who give help I have a solution: awk '{if($1=="Any" && $2=="suggestion" && $3=="or" && $4=="help" {$1="I";$2="want";$3="the";$4="solution"};print $0}' eg.txt I will get Please help me with this problem I want the solution will be appreciated Thanks to all who give help As you can see, it has two problems (1) the blank space is not the same with others. (2) $5, $6,$7 " will be appreciated " of the former line are still kept. I know another solution: awk '{if($1=="Any" && $2=="suggestion" && $3=="or" && $4=="help" print "I want the solution";print $0}' eg.txt will solve the problem. But I just wondering if there is better way? Thanks a lot for your attention!
