If you have a regular expression to match the number, you can install a regex extended stored procedure on your SQL Server. I installed this extended stored procedure at work and we use it quite a bit. There are several procedures (each with corresponding function wrappers): check for matches (yes, no) check for matches (count) search and replace format split To find matches you would use it as such: select number from numberTable where dbo.fn_pcre_match(number, 'someRegex') = 1 Where 'someRegex' is the regular expression matching the format you are looking for. This site has some matches on it, but I'm not sure how well they work since I'm not familiar with UK numbers whatsoever.
