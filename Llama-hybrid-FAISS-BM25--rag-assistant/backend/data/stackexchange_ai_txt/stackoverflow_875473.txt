The performance for getting an item from a Dictionary is affected very little by the number of items. The items are divided into buckets accoding to their hash code, so there are generally only a single or very few items in each bucket. The operation is close to a O(1) operation. Adding items is also close to an O(1) operation. If the capacity has to be increased you will get a performance hit, but by average that is very small. As the capacity doubles each time, the amount of data that is moved when increasing the capacity is really not that much. The data is by average moved 1.3 times extra, so the average extra work for each add comes down to moving about 16 bytes. If you know how large the Dictionary will get, or just have a decent estimate, you should use that when you create it, to reduce or elliminate the need to increase the capacity.
