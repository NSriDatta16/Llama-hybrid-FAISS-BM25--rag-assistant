You could do $headers = get_headers( 'http://www.exampledomain.com/images/2?num=1' ); The $headers variable will then contain something like Array ( [0] => HTTP/1.1 200 OK [1] => Date: Thu, 14 Oct 2010 09:46:18 GMT [2] => Server: Apache/2.2 [3] => Last-Modified: Sat, 07 Feb 2009 16:31:04 GMT [4] => ETag: "340011c-3614-46256a9e66200" [5] => Accept-Ranges: bytes [6] => Content-Length: 13844 [7] => Vary: User-Agent [8] => Expires: Thu, 15 Apr 2020 20:00:00 GMT [9] => Connection: close [10] => Content-Type: image/png ) This will tell you whether the resource exists and what content-type (which is not necessarily also the image type) it is. EDIT as per Pekka's comment, you still might want to determine it's mime-type after downloading. See How Can I Check If File Is MP3 Or Image File . Some of the given approaches work on remote files too, so you can probably skip the get_headers pre-check altogether. Decide for yourself which one suits your needs.
