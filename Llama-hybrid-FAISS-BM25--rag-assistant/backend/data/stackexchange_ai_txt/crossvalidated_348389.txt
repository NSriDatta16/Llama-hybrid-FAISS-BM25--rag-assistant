Bayesian credible interval calculation: posterior distribution or marginal distribution

Let's say we want to obtain the 95% credible interval for theta, where theta|x ~ Beta(a,b), which one of the following is correct and why? [E(theta|x) - 2*se(theta|x), E(theta|x) + 2*se(theta|x)] [E(theta)-2*se(theta), E(theta)+2*se(theta)] Thanks ahead!
