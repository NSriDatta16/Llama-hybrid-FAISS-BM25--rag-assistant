Speeding up RSpec tests in a large Rails application

I have a Rails application with over 2,000 examples in my RSpec tests. Needless to say, it's a large application and there's a lot to be tested. Running these tests at this point is very inefficient and because it takes so long, we're almost at the point of being discouraged from writing them before pushing a new build. I added --profile to my spec.opts to find the longest running examples and there are at least 10 of them that take an average of 10 seconds to run. Is that normal amongst you RSpec experts? Is 10 seconds entirely too long for one example? I realize that with 2,000 examples, it will take a non-trivial amount of time to test everything thoroughly - but at this point 4 hours is a bit ludicrous. What kind of times are you seeing for your longest running examples? What can I do to troubleshoot my existing specs in order to figure out bottlenecks and help speed things up. Every minute would really help at this point.
