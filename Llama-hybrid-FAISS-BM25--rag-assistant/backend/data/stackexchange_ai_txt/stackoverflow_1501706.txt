Need help getting DIV inside DIV to stretch to width of contents in Firefox

I am using a layout similar to the one from Dynamic Drive here: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/layouts/item/css-right-frame-layout/ The main content area (white) has overflow set to auto. I have given the innerTube inside this main content area a border. However if the contents within this innerTube are greater than the width of the main content area, a horizontal scroll bar will appear as expected, but in Firefox these contents will 'overlap' the border and go off screen (can be retrieved by scrolling horizontally). In other words, the right hand border remains in place, and the content just goes over the op of it, and disappears behind the right hand column. In IE it behaves exactly as I want - the content pushes the border off screen to be visible only once you scroll over there. I guess the easiest thing is to paste the source code here. If you copy it into a blank file you'll see what I mean. I've just used one really long word to replicate what happens if a wide image is there instead. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out. body{ margin: 0; padding: 0; border: 0; overflow: hidden; height: 100%; max-height: 100%; } #framecontent{ position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; right: 0; width: 200px; /*Width of frame div*/ height: 100%; overflow: hidden; /*Disable scrollbars. Set to "scroll" to enable*/ background: #cccccc; color: white; } #maincontent{ position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 200px; /*Set right value to WidthOfFrameDiv*/ bottom: 0; overflow: auto; background: #fff; } .innertube{ margin: 15px; /*Margins for inner DIV inside each DIV (to provide padding)*/ } .innertubeWithBorder { margin: 15px; border: solid 1px #666666; } * html body{ /*IE6 hack*/ padding: 0 200px 0 0; /*Set value to (0 WidthOfFrameDiv 0 0)*/ } * html #maincontent{ /*IE6 hack*/ height: 100%; width: 100%; } CSS Right Frame Layout Sample text here Dynamic Drive CSS Library AReallyLongWordWhichIsSimilarToHavingAnImageWithWidthGreaterThanTheWidthOfThisDivToShowOverFlowProblemWithBorderSoIfYouResizeThisWindowNarrowerYouWillSeeWhatIMeanWorksFineInIEButNotFirefox So I want that border over there ------> to dissappear behind the right hand column like it does in IE, and be visible once you use the scrollbar below and scroll to the right Credits: Dynamic Drive CSS Library
