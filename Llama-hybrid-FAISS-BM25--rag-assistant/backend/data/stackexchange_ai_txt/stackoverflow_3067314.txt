How to create a gesture controlled rotating image for a UI

I'm trying to figure out the best way to make an image rotate along with a user's finger dragging it left or right. I want to try and match the rate a user's finger is moving with the rate the image is rotating. I've got the basic setup for my application going, with the menus and whatnot I want to have, and that's all running great on the emulator, I'm just not sure how to approach this part. I can code all the logic I need for my app, I'm just not doing to well designing the UI, I have a picture in mind, I've actually made a couple mock images of it, I just can't figure out how to get it going in Android, and any help would be appreciated.
