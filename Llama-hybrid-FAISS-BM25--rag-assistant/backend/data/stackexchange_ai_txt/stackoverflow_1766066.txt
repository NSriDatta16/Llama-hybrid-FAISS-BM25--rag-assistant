Supporting both existing forms authentication login and Federated WebSSO

We are having a hosted web application and it uses forms authentication. This webapplication is accessed by users belong to different partner organizations. Currently users belong to the partner organizations are accessing the application using the credentials that we give it to them. Now, some partner organizations wants their users to access the application using their active directory credentials. We are planning to use ADFS for these partner organizations, so the users will be authenticated using Active Directory within their network and claims will be sent to the webapp via the Authentication token cookie set by the ADFS. From the claims, we map the users to the internal userIds of the web application. My questions are , if we make the web application ADFS enabled, 1)Is it possible to still allow the other partner organization users(who don't want to use ADFS) to login to the web application using the existing login page(forms authentication)? 2) Should every page in the ADFS enabled webapp be accessed through https? Any solutions or pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks -arul
