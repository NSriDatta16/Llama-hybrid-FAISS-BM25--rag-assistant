You are correct that if you have a conjugate prior, there's no need to use MCMC as the posterior has a closed form solution. MCMC tutorials that present a problem where we know the posterior already do so as nothing more than a demonstration, very similar to simulating some data from a given set of parameters and then demonstrating that our MLE estimate is fairly close to those values. In practice, the set of models that are conjugate is much, much smaller than the set of non-conjugate models. Since those models do not have a closed form solution, we often use MCMC to approximate them.
