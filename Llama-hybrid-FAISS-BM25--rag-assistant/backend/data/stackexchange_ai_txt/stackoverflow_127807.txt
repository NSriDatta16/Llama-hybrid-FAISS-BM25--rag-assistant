What does a scrum master do all day?

To quote wikipedia: Scrum is facilitated by a ScrumMaster, whose primary job is to remove impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the sprint goal. The ScrumMaster is not the leader of the team (as they are self-organizing) but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The ScrumMaster ensures that the Scrum process is used as intended. The ScrumMaster is the enforcer of rules." Working on this basis, and the fact that most businesses are running 2-3 projects at a time, what actual work tasks does a SM do to fill a full time job? Or, is it not a full time job and that individual do other things such as development, sales etc? Do any SM's out there have anything to share?
