Task scheduling frameworks - not thread scheduling!

I'm working on a Java application which should allow users to optimize their daily schedule. For that, I need a framework that helps calculate optimal times for "tasks" taking note of: Required resources and resource usage limits Dependencies between tasks (can do with only F->S relations though) Earliest and latest start-finish times, slack times Baseline vs. actual times - allowing to report actual start and finish times, updating the rest of the tasks accordingly Some clarifications: I am not looking for neither a framework to draw these gantts, nor a framework that deals with one specific problem domain (such as classrooms), and definitely not a framework that deals with thread scheduling. Thanks!
