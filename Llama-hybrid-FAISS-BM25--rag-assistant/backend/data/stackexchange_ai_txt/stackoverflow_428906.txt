In my opinion, the biggest advantage of Spring is that it encourages and enables better development practices, in particular loose coupling, testing, and more interfaces. Hibernate without Spring can be really painful, but the two together are very useful. Retrofitting an existing project to any framework is going to be painful, but the refactoring process often has serious benefits for long-term maintainability.
