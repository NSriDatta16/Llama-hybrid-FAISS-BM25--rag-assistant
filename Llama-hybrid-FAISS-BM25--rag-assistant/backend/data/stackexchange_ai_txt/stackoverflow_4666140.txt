This is because .resizable() calculates the initial size based on the target. In your case, you are making the image resizable before appending it to the DOM, and as such the size of the image is not known since it hasn't been loaded yet, which results in a size of 0. If you append the image before making it resizable it should work just fine. Like this: var spanid = 1; $("button").click(function() { var elm = $(' '); elm.appendTo('p').resizable().parent().draggable({ cursor: "move" }); spanid++; }); Also, I recommend you to disable the browsers default image drag and selection. You can do this by adding .disableSelection() (currently undocumented) to your image element.
