Is there a value to show how fragmented is a group?

I would like to know if there is a way to calculate a number that can show how fragmented is a group? It should be something like "variance of categorical data"? For example I want to see how fragmented is Android/iOS in terms of OS version. The number would be high for Android, where there are a lot of versions, and the usage percentage of each version is small. For iOS, the number would be small, since there is a dominant usage percentage of one version.
