Display the form again?

I want to ask about the form in Javascript. I want to do a game where the user enters the correct word, then an alert message will appear for this correct word. When the user does the first word correct, the program will display another word (to be corrected). But the problem which I faced that I can't make the form display again to continue the game. I used: var d = document.getElementById("form1"); d.style.visibility = "visible"; but it doesn't work! This is my code: Word Decoder function checkWord(word, score) { var ok = words[score].valueOf(); var ok1 = document.getElementById("wordid"); if(ok1.value == ok) { score ++; alert("Correct, your score is: " + score); var d = document.getElementById("form1"); d.style.visibility = "visible"; return false; } else { alert("Wrong Spelling"); return false; } } var words = new Array ("apple", "orange", "banana", "manago", "table"); var reWords = new Array ("alpep", "ergano", "aaabnn", "goamna", "lbeat"); var count = 0; var score = 0; " "; document.write(reWords[score]); Enter the correct word: Again: I want the game will display a scrambled word and the user must unscrambled the word to move to the other word. The problem is I can't display the form again to make the user unscrambled the second, third etc. words.
