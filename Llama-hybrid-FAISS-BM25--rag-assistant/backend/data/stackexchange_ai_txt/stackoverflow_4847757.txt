Still had problems. I traced it down at last to this line in the JNLP: Jnlp files are a weird hack. They basically reload themselves off the href parameter if it is available. This allows them to use their own caching and versioning mechanism for the jnlp file. Unfortunately, it meant it was reloading WITHOUT the get parameters. I probably could have added the get parameters to the href, but since its optional anyway I just took it out. That fixed the problem. Moral of the story: be VARY aware of what href does if you include it.
