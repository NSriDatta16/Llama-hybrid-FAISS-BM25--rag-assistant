This is one of those areas with few, clearcut right or wrong answers, but some ways are clearly better than others. All rankings are fraught with many, many pitfalls as this article by Malcolm Gladwell about them makes clear. Your friend's problems begin with his assumption that the different indices of "mass deprivation" can be summarized into a single number. Among the problems Gladwell enumerates are: 1) Omitted variables bias, it can be really hard to identify the right set of measures for ranking. If there are key constructs that define a construct that are left out of an analysis, then any resulting ranking will be compromised 2) The subjective nature of the weightings employed 3) The quality of the input information is often suspect 4) The nearly infinite ways to develop the rankings 5) The loss of complex information in generating an ordinal ranking http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/14/the-order-of-things Simplistic and easily derived methods like your friend's will pass muster among the technically illiterate and naive but are guaranteed to flame out if anyone with any statistical insight takes a look under the hood -- like a PhD dissertation committee. In other words, there is a serious element of risk in what he's proposing. At the end of the day, there is no substitute for analytic rigor and stubbornness is no answer for ignorance.
