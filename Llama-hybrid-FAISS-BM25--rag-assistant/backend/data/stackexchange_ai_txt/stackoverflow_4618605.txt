Android: Speeding up display of (html-formatted) text

My app uses a StringBuilder to assemble paragraphs of text which are then displayed in a TextView within a ScrollView. The displaytext.xml layout file is: and the code that displays the StringBuilder object sbText is setContentView(R.layout.displaytext); TextView tv = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.display_text); tv.setText(Html.fromHtml(sbText.toString())); This works OK, except that it gets very slow as the amount of text grows. For example, to display 50 paragraphs totalling about 50KB of text takes over 5 seconds just to execute those three lines of code. Can anyone suggest how I can speed this up, please?
