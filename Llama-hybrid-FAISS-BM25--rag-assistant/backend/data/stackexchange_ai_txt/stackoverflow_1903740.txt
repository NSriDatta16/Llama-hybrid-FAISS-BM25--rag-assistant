Without the nil initializer, in some cases your variable may be initialized with garbage (whatever was in the memory space previously). There are specific rules regarding which types of variables (scope-based, static storage, etc.) are nil-initialized automatically for you, but I've always found that it's easier to explicitly initialize all variables instead of memorizing those rules. That said, because both branches of your if statement clobber any previous value of addChar, there should not be any case in which you can see an invalid value. But it's certainly not hurting anything to explicitly initialize to nil, and if a future maintainer comes along and changes the code paths you might find that the initializer saves you!
