Probably you can workaround Robot lack of ability to know the borders of the window, by allowing the user to select the area he wants to screen shot. You have two approaches, if the option is fullscreen you don't need to worry, follow the Robot approach described before. If the applicatin is for desired area: Start desired application. Take a full screen of the desktop. Create a full screen app using the screenshot as the background, ONLY to allow the user to select the area where to capture the image ( you start with an small square and let the user drag until he creates the desired screen capture ) Pass this information to Robot and take the screenshots from that area. Something like this: alt text http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/8622/screencapturebb3.png If you don't like the option to use a full screenshot as background, you can use a transparent window . And do the same : - ) Aaahhh second option is to try to identify borders analyzing the images, but honestly , I don't think it worth it. There's a third option, but is a secret.
