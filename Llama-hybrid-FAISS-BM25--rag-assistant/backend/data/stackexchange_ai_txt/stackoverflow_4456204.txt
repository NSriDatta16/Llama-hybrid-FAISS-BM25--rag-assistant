Objective C: ResignFirstResponder with a button

Is there a way for a UIButton to trigger resignFirstResponder? I have my program set to do so in a function when you tap outside of a textfield, but I want the keyboard to go away when the user hits the submit button. This is what I have for the UITextFields - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [x1 resignFirstResponder]; [x2 resignFirstResponder]; [y1 resignFirstResponder]; [y2 resignFirstResponder]; }
