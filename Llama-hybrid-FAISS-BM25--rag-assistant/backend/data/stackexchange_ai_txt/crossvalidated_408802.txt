Whenever we have a prior on a parameter $p(\theta)$ , and some likelihood function $p(\mathcal{D} | \theta)$ , the posterior is proportional to $$\pi(\theta) \propto p(\mathcal{D} | \theta) p(\theta),$$ since the evidence does not depend on $\theta$ - it has been averaged out. Now, if you want to run a MCMC sampler that targets the density $\pi(\theta)$ , you define a proposal mechanism $\theta' \sim q(\theta'|\theta)$ . Then your Metropolis-Hastings ratio is $$\frac{\pi(\theta')q(\theta|\theta')} {\pi(\theta)q(\theta'|\theta)} = \frac{p(\mathcal{D} | \theta') p(\theta')q(\theta|\theta')} {p(\mathcal{D} | \theta) p(\theta)q(\theta'|\theta)},$$ so as you can see the prior does enter into the acceptance ratio. This also illustrates a nice principle if you choose your prior as your proposal mechanism, such that $\theta' \sim p(\theta')$ . In this particular case the priors cancel out with the proposal ratio, and you are now just comparing the likelihood of the relative points.
