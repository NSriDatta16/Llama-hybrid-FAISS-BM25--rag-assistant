Another possibility may be using a compressed filesystem, depending on types and distribution of the files also with deduplication. Pro: -Has almost the same effect als a .zip file ( Storage wise ) -No change on the Webserver part needed Cons: -Possibly new FS for the zip DIR -Maybe not present under used OS ( e.g. ZFS ) Maybe there's another way if you clarify what you are trying to achieve.
