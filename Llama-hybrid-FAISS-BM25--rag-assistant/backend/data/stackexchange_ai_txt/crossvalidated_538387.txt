Understanding number of rnn units in RNN networks

I am trying to learn about recurrent neural networks from here . There are rnn_units = 1024 in the model and each batch contains 64 sequences. What I am trying to understand is, do each sentence goes through all 1024 gru units, then an output is produced (GRU ouput)? In the figure, I feel each character goes to each GRU unit, so I cannot understand how it is working because I think we do not have 1024 characters in each batch. I am a bit confused how this network works. I appreciate a little more detailed explanation. Thanks in advance
