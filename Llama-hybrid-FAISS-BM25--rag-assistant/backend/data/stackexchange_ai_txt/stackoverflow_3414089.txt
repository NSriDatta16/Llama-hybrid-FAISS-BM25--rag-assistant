Implications of package permissions (All android developers invited to contribute)

I was working on understanding what the implications of granting a package a particular permission are. To my utter disbelief I could not find any material which would answer the questions satisfactorily. 1.) What permissions are reserved to be used by whom? 2.) What level of effect does granting a permission to an application have, in security aspects. 3.) What kind of permission does a user need to beware of and understand completely what the repercussion might be (at install time.) 4.) How to identify when an application is misusing a permission granted to it? I hope with a series of example programs and bits and pieces of documentation we can organize a clear working model for permission on android. I hope people would paste code for relevant examples in an attempt to understand this and help us develop better applications as well as develop user understanding on how secure they are. thanks Shouvik EDITED:What I eventually intend to achieve out of this discussion is that when I cluster a group of permissions, I should be able to get a concise picture of what my application will be capable of doing to my data. I then should be able to weigh those risks with the application installed and determine if its worth the risk. Please note, I am not here to suggest that all apps request perms for malicious use! I am here for that 0.1% of apps which might do it with that intent! =) Don't take my word for it. Here is a link I came across in the discussion group which puts my idea into a clear perspective. http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/88b69b590c4d1482/d4bfb0e544d8a3a9?lnk=gst&q=permissions#d4bfb0e544d8a3a9
