May I recommend the book Clean Code by Robert C. Martin which provides a great set of heuristics for writing readable and maintainable code. Now another option would be to extract the conditional into another private function and name it so that it describes your intent. It doesn't work too well with the supplied code as it's generic but it would look something like: public void function(string value, string value2) { if (valuesAreValidAndEqual(value, value2)) { DoSomething(); } } private void valuesAreValidAndEqual(string value, string value2) { return value != null && value2 == value; } Clearly this is more useful if the variable names and function names are related to your domain.
