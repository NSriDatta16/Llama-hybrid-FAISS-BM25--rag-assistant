Think of a singleton like a service. It's an object which provides a specific set of functionality. E.g. ObjectFactory.getInstance().makeObject(); The object factory is an object which performs a specific service. By contrast, a class full of static methods is a collection of actions that you might want to perform, organised in a related group (The class). E.g. StringUtils.reverseString("Hello"); StringUtils.concat("Hello", "World"); The StringUtils example here is a collection of functionality that can be applied anywhere. The singleton factory object is a specific type of object with a clear responsibility that can be created and passed around where required.
