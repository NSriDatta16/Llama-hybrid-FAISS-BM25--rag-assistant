How do Bayesians compare distributions?

So, I think that I have a decent grasp of the basics of frequentist probability and statistical analysis (and how badly it can be used). In a frequentist world, it makes sense to ask such a question as "is this distribution different from that distribution", because distributions are assumed to be real, objective and unchanging (for a given situation, at least), and so we can figure out how likely it is that one sample is drawn from a distribution shaped like another sample. In the Bayesian world view, we only care about what we expect to see, given our past experiences (I'm still a bit vague on this part, but I understand the concept of Bayesian updating). If that is so, how can a Bayesian say "this set of data is different from that set of data"? For the purposes of this question, I don't care about statistical significance, or similar, just how to quantify difference. I'm equally interested in parametric and non-parametric distributions.
