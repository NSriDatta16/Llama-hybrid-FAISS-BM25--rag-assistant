Creating labels for Text classification using keras

I have a text file with information that needs to classified based on keywords. The text file contains many number of paragraphs. And the paragraph contains keywords that we want (lets say salary amount, interest rate and so on..) I want to write a model which will extract the paragraph (or 3 to 4 lines of text) containing the keyword i want. How do i create a label in this case? All i have is a raw text. I am new to NLP. Any suggestions how i can approach this?
