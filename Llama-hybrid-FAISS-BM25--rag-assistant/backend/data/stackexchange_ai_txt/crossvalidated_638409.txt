We can use parameters organized in the usual manner: $$ L = \begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & 0 & 0\\ x_{21} & x_{22} & 0 \\ x_{31} & x_{32} & x_{33} \\ \end{pmatrix} $$ And then map this onto the set of correlation matrices in a two step process. First, mapping it onto the set of covariance matrices, per usual: $$ \tilde{\Sigma} = \mathbf{L}\mathbf{L}^\top $$ Second, mapping this covariance matrix onto the set of correlation matrices by scaling the rows and columns by the inverse square root of the variances. Linear algebraically, this looks like forming a diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ : $$ \textrm{diag}(\mathbf{D}) = \Bigg[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tilde\Sigma_{1,1}}}, \ldots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tilde\Sigma_{N,N}}}\Bigg] $$ and then pre and postmultiplying $\tilde{\Sigma}$ by this matrix: $$ \Sigma = \mathbf{D}\tilde\Sigma\mathbf{D} $$ When implementing this on a computer, it will be more efficient to simply scale the columns and rows of $\tilde{\Sigma}$ , rather than explicitly computing the matrix multiplication.
