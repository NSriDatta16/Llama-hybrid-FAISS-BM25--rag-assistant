Dispersion measure - probability density function

I am wondering whether someone has a tip on this potentially very basic question. i have done some grid-based bayesian analysis and ended up with a non-standard discrete posterior density function over an interval of 100 observational values (per graph) below and as shown in the vector format per below. I can easily find the corresponding value of the distribution in R (which.max) but am struggling to find a way to calculate any measure of dispersion of the probability distribution. Ideally - i would like to have a quick way of calculating in R that gives me the answer that x% of the density lies between e.g. the index values of 20 and 80; any tips very welcome...
