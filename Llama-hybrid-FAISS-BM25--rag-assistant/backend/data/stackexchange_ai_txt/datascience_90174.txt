The NER model performance on a particular text depends on which data it was trained with originally, and naturally the standard models (like en_core_web_sm ) are trained with English data which doesn't contain a lot of names from non-US/UK origin (same for other kinds of entities like organizations or locations). Better performance can be achieved by training your own model with your own labelled data, but that requires you (or somebody) to annotate a reasonably large sample of data manually.
