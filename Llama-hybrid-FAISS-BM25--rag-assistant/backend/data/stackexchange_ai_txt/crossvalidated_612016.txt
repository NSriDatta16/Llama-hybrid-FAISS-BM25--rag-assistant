Since the observation times are non-random, logistic regression can be used to estimate the event rate per each 24h interval. You can even just use proportions tests to estimate CIs, unless there are stratification features you want to implement, like species, weight, etc. For fish sacrificed at time 1, denote the probability of event as $p_1$ . At time 2, the event occurrence has probability $p_1 + p_2$ . And so on. A standard survival analysis does not apply in this case because fish who were sacrificed at time 2 were not known to be event free at time 1, and so it would be inappropriate to include them in the denominator of "risk set" as non-events for the time 1 stratum as would be typical of a Cox model. This considerably simplifies the model, although knowing the event status for surviving fish at each time point would inform different models that could be considerably more powerful. You can use these probabilities to report the cumulative incidence of the event. See R implementation to make things crystal clear. set.seed(123) n From this basic approach there are a number of interesting and more sophisticated things to consider. Is there a single-pass modeling procedure that constrains the empirical cumulative incidence to be strictly increasing? Consider maximum likelihood constraining $p_1 . Alternately, can a fitting procedure be used for the time-based event incidence to produce a stepwise increasing curve? maximum likelihood approach A convenient way to constrain the probability so that $p_2, p_3, \ldots >0 $ while keeping $p_1 + p_2 + \ldots is to use the log odds. The result is somewhat better than the above approach. ## parameterize the log odds difference, constrain non-index LO to be positive, i.e. increasing probability lodiff.to.p curve fitting We might use the empirical probability estimates to fit a monotonic increasing curve via least-squares. This approach is similar to the above, just swap binomial likelihood with normal. negloglik
