Adapted from my post on your other similar question: For a more general approach, you can always dump your current format to a string, like how you have it, and use string operations to substring and reorganize. I know for a fact that MySQL accepts string values for DATETIME fields. $day = substr($input, 0, 2); $month = substr($input, 2, 3); switch($month){ case "Jan": $month = "01"; break; ... } insert this string into your database as its display format
