In order to use the component you need to have it in the library. One way of adding it is: Get Adobe Flash Professional and install it;(Wine may run (enough to get you going) CS3 by now) Drag the ScrollBar component(from the components panel in your library) Set Flash to generate a swc file (see File->Publish Settings->Flash); Add this swc file to your library ( check flexTasks documentation on how to do this,basically you need to provide the path to it when doing the compile with FlexSDK ); In my opinion you're better off with a scroll class someone else created. There is a tutorial here http://www.goflash.org/blog/tutorial-scrollbar-flash-as3/ The page is in Romanian but I'm sure you'll figure it out as the source code is posted (Download Source) Hope it helps! Have fun!
