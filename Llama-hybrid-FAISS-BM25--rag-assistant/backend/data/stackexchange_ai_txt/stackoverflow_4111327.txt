How to include JavaScript for a specific browser?

Including a css sheet is easy and works well with the code below. However this must not be a good way to include a javascript file because I get an error when I view it in the iPad. Something about an unclosed tag. I assume I'm getting nested tags by doing it this way. What should I be doing instead? //Sniff out iPads if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('iPad') != -1) { document.write(' '); document.write(' '); }
