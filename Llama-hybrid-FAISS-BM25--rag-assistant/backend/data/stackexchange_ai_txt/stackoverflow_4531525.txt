jqgrid not loading data

i've got a RoR app that's pushing out json data to a jqgrid. the grid loads up, shows the proper page/row counts, but doesn't show any rows. data: { "total":333, "page":1, "records":3333, "rows":[ {"id":"267","cell":["42883","Enhancing Personal and Organizational Creativity (XP)","1"]}, {"id":"268","cell":["42883","Enhancing Personal and Organizational Creativity","1"]}, {"id":"266","cell":["42815","Strategic Decision Making (XP-Elective)","1"]}, {"id":"265","cell":["42811","Strategic Planning","1"]}, {"id":"264","cell":["42809","Best Practices in Innovation (XP)","1"]}, {"id":"260","cell":["42808","Grave to Cradle - The Basics of Restructuring and Bankruptcies","1"]}, {"id":"261","cell":["42808","Corporate Restructuring","1"]}, {"id":"262","cell":["42808","Grave to Cradle Corporate Restructuring","1"]}, {"id":"263","cell":["42808","Failure - Grave to Cradle Corporate Restructuing (XP)","1"]}, {"id":"259","cell":["42800","Competitive Strategy (XP)","1"]} ] } html: $("#list").jqGrid({ url:courseSource + "/fulldata?instructor=" + instrId + "&course=" + courseId, datatype: 'json', mtype: 'GET', colNames:['Course Number','Course Title', 'Number of Instructors'], colModel :[ {name:'course_no', index:'course_no', width:200}, {name:'name', index:'name', width:500}, {name:'ins_count', index:'ins_count', width:260, align:'right'} ], pager: '#pager', rowNum:10, rowList:[10,20,30], sortname: 'course_no', sortorder: 'desc', viewrecords: true, caption: 'Courses' }); any ideas? i'm beyond lost here - i've got the common problems tackled - the locale is loaded before the jqgrid.js, the css is loaded, jquery and friends are loaded. what's goin on?
