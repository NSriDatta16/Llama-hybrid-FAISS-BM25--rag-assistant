Vertex shaders are executable programs that execute as part of the programmable geometry pipeline in modern graphics APIs such as e.g. Direct3D or OpenGL. Vertex shaders are usually hardware accelerated on consumer hardware nowadays. The vertex shader processes one vertex at a time, followed by primitive assembly, optionally geometry shader and transform feedback, clipping, and finally rasterization and fragment processing.
