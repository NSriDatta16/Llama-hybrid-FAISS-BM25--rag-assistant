Running a python script with heavy memory requirements

I need to run a python script where I am loading several(~15) large modules including keras and load several (approx 20) LSTM models and large amount of data for computation. These script has several methods which are needed to build an environment class for a reinforcement learning problem. The process seems to be working very slowly on my 16GB RAM i7 CPU(haven't tried out multiprocessing module yet but might not work as most of the task is not parallelism friendly.) Can you provide me some alternative possibly going for a higher end hardware setup ideal for such heavy computations which can be done on a local machine. Since it's a problem I am facing in ML related work which other researchers over here might have faced, that's why I am adding the question in this forum. Please suggest other forums if possible where I can get a better suggestion
