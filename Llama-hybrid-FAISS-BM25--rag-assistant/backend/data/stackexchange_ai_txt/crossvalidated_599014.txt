Your input and output are random. Every time you run the code, they take different values; of course the neural network gives different results for the different data. This turns out not to be a statistics problem. Just stick np.random.seed(2022) (or some other number, but I learned to go with the year from our late friend, BruceET ) at the top of your code to lock in your $X$ and $y$ variables. The generation of those variables will be random, but it will be the same random generation every time you run the code.
