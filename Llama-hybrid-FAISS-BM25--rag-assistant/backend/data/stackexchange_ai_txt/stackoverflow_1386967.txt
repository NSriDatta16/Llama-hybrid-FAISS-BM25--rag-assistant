There's nothing wrong with the regex or embedding it in a class. You're convincing yourself that your test situations are equivalent when they're not. In the immediate case, the string you're sending the class version, (TV series) aka "Hammer Time" - USA (working title) isn't matched by the regex because the regex requires exactly one space between the and the aka . This revision of it works: const REGEX_AKA = "# \s*aka \"([^\"]*)\" (?: (?:-?)(?:,?) ([^ ]*) (?: \(([^\)]*)\) )*)*#i";
