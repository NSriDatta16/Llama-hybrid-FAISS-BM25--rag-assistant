What you are talking about is called feature engineering. Basically it is done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. What we are doing is combining 2 or more features which provide the same info, into one feature. For example I had this dataset where I had to predict the price of a used car. There were 2 features month of registration and year of registration . So I combined the into 1 feature called age of car . That way I reduced 1 dimension of my dataset. Keep in mind that this is mostly done for numerical features and not for categorical ones. Doing this for categorical features will result in textual dataset which will need NLP.
