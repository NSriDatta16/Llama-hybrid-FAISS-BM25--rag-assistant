“My Documentes” is not there on my Nexus. Instead I have an “Documents” directory. So that won't help in a portable way. With SDK 8 you should use getExternalFilesDir - but beware there is a catch. I wrote a little article in my Blog . In the end I used: final java.io.File Storage = android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory (); final java.io.File Dir = new java.io.File (Storage, "Android/FX-603P"); Dir.mkdirs (); I used the “Android” base directory as it seem the new preferred way since SDK8.
