You mouse movements are reported at discrete time intervals. That is, the faster you move the mouse, the farther apart the reported mouse positions are. Dragging the mouse fast from inside to outside the window can report a position well inside the window (PointA), while the next report will be well outside the window (PointB). If you use the CaptureMouse call while dragging you can still receive mouse position reports while the pointer is outside the host window. When you discover you have moved beyond the window you can assume the mouse is at the edge of the window. That is, if you were to draw an imaginary line from PointA to PointB, you can assume your last point is where that line crossed the window border. If you do not use MouseCapture, or you are using a windowless plugin, I don't think you will see mouse events when dragging outside the window. In that case, estimating the position where the mouse crossed the window border is more difficult.
