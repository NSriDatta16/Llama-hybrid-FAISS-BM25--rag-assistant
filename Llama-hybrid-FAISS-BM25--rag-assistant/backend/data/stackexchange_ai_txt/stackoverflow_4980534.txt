Dragging UIView under finger

I want to tap on a UIView and drag and have that view follow my finger, simple enough. But the easiest way of doing this is by setting the objects center to where the tap happened (Which is not what I want), I want it to move as if you grabbed the object wherever you tapped it. There was a very useful way of doing this and it was reference in one of the iTunes U videos. The script didn't use deltaX, deltaY for dragging the image underneath where you tapped on it instead of having it center underneath your finger but I can't remember what that code was! Does anyone have a reference to this code? Or perhaps have an efficient way of moving UIViews under a finger without having the uiview.center = tap.center concept?
