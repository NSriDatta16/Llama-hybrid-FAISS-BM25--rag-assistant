You can use any metric you want. The best metric to use depends on the data you have. You can consider using the F1 score. Depending on the averaging technique you use, you can nudge things towards reducing false negatives. If you are using python/sklearn, you can pick your averaging method in the argument ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html ).
