Remove All id Attributes from nodes in a Range of Fragment

Is there a way to remove the id attribute of every node in a range or fragment? Update: I finally found out that the bug I'm struggling with is based on a being included in a range, and therefore unexpectedly cloned, when a chrome user does a ctrl+a. My goal would be to remove any instance of from the range (or doc fragment), such that it is not replicated when cloned.
