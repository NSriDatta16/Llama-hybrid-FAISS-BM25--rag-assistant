there is a list of ways to analyze logs on the wiki - http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-jmeter/LogAnalysis I use jmetergraph.pl for nice summary reports. Note that there is a bug with the default jmetergraph.pl, you need to add this to line 313, at the end of the while loop: close(IN); } $glabels{'entire'} = \%entire; # this line added. print "Found $#labels labels\n" if $DEBUG; Otherwise you can use the jmeterlog class to create your own images by writing custom code for it.....
