Eclipse RCP and using org.eclipse.ui.activities to filter UI

I am leveraging org.eclipse.ui.activities and have been successful thanks to this guide . However, I am having a problem applying this strategy to CTabItems. These are tabs within a CTabFolder which is in a PageBookView. I can filter out PageBookView easily because it has a clear ID being set by static String. I cannot find a way to assign an ID to the CTabItem which I can reference in my 'activityPatternBinding'. Any advice is most welcome! Thanks.
