These sort of algorithms often predate machine learning and have their roots in the linguistic community. A commonly used such measure of "clarity" is the Gunning Fog Index , which estimates the years of formal education a person needs to understand the text on the first reading. An alternative is the Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability test that quantifies how difficult a passage in English is to understand. I have seen both examples above (and others) being used in NLP problems. The short answer to your question is " search in the linguistics domain rather than the machine learning community to start learning about such algorithms ".
