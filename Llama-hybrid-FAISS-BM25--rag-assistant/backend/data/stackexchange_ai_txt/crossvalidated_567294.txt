Predicting time to event / duration data

I've built a parametric survival model (survreg in R) to predict injury recovery duration using features such as age and treatments. I'm looking at trying model-based boosting using mboost with Weibull, loglog, or lognormal distribution (as described here ). Can anyone recommend other alternatives? Has anyone tried neural network methods to predict time to event / duration data?
