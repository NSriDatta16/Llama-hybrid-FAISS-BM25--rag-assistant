WCF Security Problem with UserName clientCredentialType

First of all I apologize for my english... Then: I have a problem! I wrote the code for a simple WCF Service and with the configuration #1 all works fine. Conf #1 - server Conf #1 - client The problem occurs when I try to set userName authentication with a personal validation class I created. I post configuration #2. Conf #2 - server Conf #2 - client When I start the application and I get a System.ServiceModel.Security.SecurityNegotiationException private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { WCF.XnottaLightServiceClient client = new WCF.XnottaLightServiceClient(); client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = "user"; client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = "pass"; string[] s = textBox6.Text.Split('ยง'); int[] i = new int[s.Length]; for(int j = 0; j Any ideas? Thanks, Alberto
