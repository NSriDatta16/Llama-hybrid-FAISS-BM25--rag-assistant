You can use word embedding , to encode words as vectors of real numbers. Then all calculations, such as comparison of words (to find similarity), are performed in that high-dimensional space. "What would be the best way to format my input (and my output) for this problem?" I cannot tell which is the best approach (depends on your problem) but this one is very common. It's also very easy to implement in Keras, using the Embedding layer.
