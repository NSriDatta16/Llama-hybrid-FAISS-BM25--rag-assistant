The interesting part of this is that you're seeing a different result when drawing directly to the backbuffer. Since you're on the iPhone platform, you're always drawing to an FBO, even when you're drawing to the backbuffer. Make sure that you have a depth buffer attached to your offscreen FBO. In your initialization code, you might want to add the following snippet right after the glBindFramebufferOES(...) . // attach depth buffer GLuint depthRenderbuffer; glGenRenderbuffersOES(1, &depthRenderbuffer); glBindRenderbufferOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, depthRenderbuffer); glRenderbufferStorageOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16_OES, width, height); glFramebufferRenderbufferOES(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_OES, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_OES, GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, depthRenderbuffer);
