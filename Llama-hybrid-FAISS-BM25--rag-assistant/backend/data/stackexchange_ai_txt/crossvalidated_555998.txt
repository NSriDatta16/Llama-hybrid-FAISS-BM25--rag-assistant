The issue here is not quite with imbalanced data, which logistic regression handles fine, but in the fact that the imbalance means that you will have few observations of the minority class. If you really do have only a $1\%$ chance of observing a minority case, there's a real chance that you won't see any such cases in $100$ or $200$ observations. Consequently, you need to collect many observations in order to observe enough minority cases, or you need to get creative. Based on the abstract, the paper you linked wants to avoid the considerable expenses that could go along with needing a large sample size to assure enough minority cases wind up in the data, and it gets creative in order to do so. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. This could come from the fact that, even if your true prevalence of minority cases is $1$ in $100$ , if you sample $500$ total observations, it is plausible that you would just end up with $2$ minority cases, tricking you into thinking the rate is $0.4\%$ instead of $1\%$ . Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few...explanatory variables If you need $100$ minority cases, and there is considerable class imbalance, you will need to sample a lot more than $200$ total cases like you would expect for a situation where there is a balanced class ratio.
