Padding that shouldn't be there

I have a 2 column layout that I'asked about earlier ( Simple 2 column layout ). What I've noticed is that it's not the positioning of the content column on the right that's the problem, but rather it's the way the content in that column is positioned. I've been looking for a while and I can't see where the problem is. It looks as though the content in the right column has padding on it equal to the height of the left column. Here's my css: #wrapper { margin-left: 100px; width: 1000px; border-left: 1px solid #bcbcc6; border-right: 1px solid #bcbcc6; border-bottom: 1px solid #bcbcc6; } /* Main page content, puts actual content and sidebar side-by-side */ #sidebar { float: left; padding: 5px; width: 189px; border-right: 1px solid #b6bcc6; } #content { padding: 0 !important; margin: 0 0 0 200px; width: 790px; background-color: #ff00ff; } EDIT: To see what's actually going on, you can check out http://www.logansarchive.za.net/bad.jpg and http://www.logansarchive.za.net/firebug.jpg I'm also going to add the page and style related files (stylesheet and images) as I have it so that you can inspect at your leisure: http://www.logansarchive.za.net/Default.aspx
