Can this be modelled?

Context: USA economy Background: Its generally accepted that the growth of e commerce has certain curbing effects on the CPI-inflation. Because search costs are much lower online, people always go for the lowest prices and this makes online retailers fight to price their products lower than everyone else. Plus, there are not much fixed costs in online retail which helps reduce overall prices. Now with the rise of e- commerce's relevance and ease of use, people are switching to it for grocery shopping and electronics shopping, etc and therefore this is seen to have a curbing effect on inflation CPI, as prices are driven lower. Consider the two processes: Let one process be the CPI inflation Let another process be the growth of e commerce in US(maybe in terms of %of GDP or some other metric) Is there a way to do a time series analysis(or any other type of analysis if you feel time series is not the way to go) to test if this inflation curbing effect of e commerce exists? Will this test be meaningful? This is for a project so I'd like some input on whether its going to give me interesting results or if this analysis is too general to yield anything useful. Thank you!
