7.1.1/7: The linkages implied by successive declarations for a given entity shall agree. That is, within a given scope, each declaration declaring the same object name or the same overloading of a function name shall imply the same linkage. 7.1.1/6: (Thanks Steve - this is also needed for the answer to be clear) A name declared in a namespace scope without a storage-class-specifier has external linkage unless it has internal linkage because of a previous declaration and provided it is not declared const. Objects declared const and not explicitly declared extern have internal linkage. Yes, those two are the same. This however is invalid: int foo(); static int foo() { return 0; }
