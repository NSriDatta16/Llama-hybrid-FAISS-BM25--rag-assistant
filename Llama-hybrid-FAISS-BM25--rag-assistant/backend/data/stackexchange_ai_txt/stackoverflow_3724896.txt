A native library is a library written in a language that compiles down to native code for the platform it runs on, i.e. C++ creating PE files with x86 code. A binding, or language binding is the "glue" that makes it possible / more comfortable to use such a library from within another programming language, possibly providing a more elegant interface than just calling directly into the native code (think: better than P/Invoke, for example). The question as to why it is needed is a simple one: To use the very large number of already existing libraries.
