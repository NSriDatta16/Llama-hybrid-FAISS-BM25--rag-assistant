Check out Jonathan Starks book on iphone apps. He shows how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make iphone apps. You can distribute them from a server or use phonegap to convert them to native apps (legally!). This is probably the first direction to look into to leverage your existing skills. http://building-iphone-apps.labs.oreilly.com/
