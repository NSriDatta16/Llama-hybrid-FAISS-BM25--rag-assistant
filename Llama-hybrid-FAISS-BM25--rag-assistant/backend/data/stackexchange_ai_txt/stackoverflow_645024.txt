I just ran into this in some of my own code. It was in a magento admin template for category selection: /* * OK; before you read the following code know what I am trying to do. * I needed to get the list of child catagories from the root node so that * the root node didn't appear in the selection box. But for some stupid * fucking reason the stupid fucking DBA wont let me access the items using * indicies and I instead have to use their stupid fucking Iterator * implementation. So there. */ $firstList = $this->getRootNode()->getChildren(); foreach ($firstList as $node) { $nodes = $node->getChildren(); break; // wtf? } I am going to remove the language of course out of our flagship product; but I remember I was super frustrated. If I hadn't left a comment, I would try to revise it but then run into the same problems I had before.
