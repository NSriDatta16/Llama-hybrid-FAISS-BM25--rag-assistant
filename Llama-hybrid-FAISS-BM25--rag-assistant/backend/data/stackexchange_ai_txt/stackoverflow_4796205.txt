You can use Runtime Weaving with AspectJ. You don't have to compile the aspects into yout app, it is enought to include them when testing. Since there has to be a META-INF/aop.xml on the classpath when using AspectJ, and since you have to start the JVM with -agent:myPath/aspectjweaver.jar, you have your tools at hand to use AspectJ only when testing. Oh, and if you use AspectJ to compile your app, you can still use additional aspects when testing if you combine runtime weaving and compile time weaving.
