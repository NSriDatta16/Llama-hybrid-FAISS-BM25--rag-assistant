Of course it's possible to use the Windows API's CreateThread directly. But that leaves the runtime library uninformed about the new thread. For the multi-threading support in the runtime library (and that includes functions that rely on static storage, e.g. I imagine it includes strtok ) you need to keep the runtime library informed, and not only informed, but partially in charge so that e.g. failure to allocate whatever resources it needs for a thread, results in thread creation failure. Cheers & hth.,
