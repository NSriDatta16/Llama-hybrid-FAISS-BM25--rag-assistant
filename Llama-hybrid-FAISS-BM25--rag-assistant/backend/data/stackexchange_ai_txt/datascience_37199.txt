The score you get is determined by the estimator you use. In your case this is Factor Analysis . Looking at the documentation of the algorithm, you can find the explanation: FactorAnalysis performs a maximum likelihood estimate of the so-called loading matrix, the transformation of the latent variables to the observed ones, using expectation-maximization (EM). and the reference: score(X[, y]) Compute the average log-likelihood of the samples So your number is the logarithm of the maximum likelihood estimate of the factor loading matrix .
