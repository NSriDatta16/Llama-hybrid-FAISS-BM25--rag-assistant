No -- the paper Maximum Likelihood Estimates of Non-Gaussian ARMA Models studies ARMA models with Student-t and Laplace distributed errors. Here is the abstract: "We consider an approximate maximum likelihood algorithm for estimating parameters of possibly non-causal and non-invertible autoregressive moving average processes driven by independent identically distributed non-Gaussian noise. The normalized approximate maximum likelihood estimate has a global maximum which is consistent and ecient. The estimates and their associated asymptotic covariance matrix are calculated with a subroutine implemented in FORTRAN 77."
