Try replacing in = new ZipInputStream(getAssets().open( Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + zipPath)); with in = new ZipInputStream(new FileInputStream( Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + zipPath)); Context.getAssets() returns an AssetManager , which is normally used to access files in your project's /assets folder, not external files. (Also, if you have your phone connected to your PC with a USB cable, it might not be allowing access to your SD Card. Try unplugging from USB when you run your app. Might just be an issue with my phone, though.)
