Android - Pull data from two databases into one cursor

I made a note taking app that organizes notes by contact. I'm looking to create a ListActivity with two rows to each list item. The first row will have a basic title that the user assigns to the note. The second row I would like to place the Contacts name there. I have no idea how to even start doing this. I've been researching for the past two days, trying code out here and there, and nothing seems to come together correctly. I keep seeming to come back to MergeCursor, but I cant get it working right and I cant find any good examples out there that will help me to understand it. My main database table is: _id, contactId, title, body, datetime. When a note is created, the Contact ID from the built in Contact Database is passed in to the row in my database. I'm sure this is something simple but I cant seem to get it! Any help is appreciated!
