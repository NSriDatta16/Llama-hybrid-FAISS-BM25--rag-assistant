My suggestion is the following: using a logistic regression of the category regressed on the score of the test. Find the 50% cut-off for A vs B-or-C-or-D-or-E repeat but find the 50% cut-off for A-or-B vs C-or-D-or-E repeat this process for all cumulative boundary points But, do not stop here. Next, obtain information on how well these boundary assignments work for the next batch of students. For example, Â¿did they fare well in their assigned course? You can revisit the cutoffs using this information. Finally, if you are so inclined, you can also do an analysis that looks at each question, and how well that question correlates (is associated) with the total score (and by extension the cut-off scores). If there are certain questions that demonstrate high discrimination, these items can be highlighted for later use as "drop-dead" boundaries. These are separate from the thresholds, and are must-pass questions to make to a certain level.
