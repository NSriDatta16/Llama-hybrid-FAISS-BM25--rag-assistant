If you're looking for an explicit solution, we can use Kolmogorov forward equations for continuous time Markov chains. In particular, we have the following rate matrix, $$ Q = \begin{pmatrix}-\alpha & \alpha \\ \beta & -\beta \end{pmatrix} $$ Let $P(t)$ represent the transition probability matrix at any given time $t$ . Then, the Kolmogorov forward equations satisfy, $\frac{d}{dt}P(t) = QP(t)$ which has the unique solution, $P(t) = e^{Qt}$ . To make this calculation simpler, notice that $Q$ has the eigendecomposition, $Q = PDP^{-1}$ where, $$ P = \begin{pmatrix}-\alpha & 1 \\ \beta & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \;\;\;\; D = \begin{pmatrix}-(\alpha + \beta) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \;\;\;\; P^{-1} = -\frac{1}{\alpha+\beta}\begin{pmatrix}1 & - 1 \\ -\beta & \alpha \end{pmatrix}$$ Then, $P(t) = e^{Qt} = Pe^{Dt}P^{-1}$ . If you work out the matrix algebra here, you should obtain, $$ P(t) = \frac{1}{\alpha+\beta}\begin{pmatrix}\alpha e^{-(\alpha+\beta)t} + \beta & \alpha e^{-(\alpha+\beta)t} + \alpha \\ -\beta e^{-(\alpha+\beta)t} + \beta & \beta e^{-(\alpha+\beta)t} + \alpha\end{pmatrix} $$ In particular, if you look at the first column of this matrix, they represent the probabilities of being in state $A$ given the initial state $A$ and $B$ respectively. In either case, the limiting behaviour as $t \rightarrow \infty$ (almost) matches your guess that the long run probability of being in state $A$ will be, $$\frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta}$$
