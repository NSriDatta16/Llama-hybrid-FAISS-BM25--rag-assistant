Regardless of the model you fit, there's a "lack of variability" problem here. In all samples the difference between genders is 10cm, so the variance of this effect size is 0. This will cause any linear model testing for gender differences to choke. You can interpret this from a mathematical standpoint or take the broader perspective that linear models are only useful when there is uncertainty in the data. But there are other possible issues too. In both cases the model would likely be improved by using individual person data rather than aggregated averages. In the first example it sounds like you are suggesting that the same cohort of individuals were followed over time. This implies a repeated measures structure with individuals as subjects. In the second example you have only 1 observation for each age group * gender combination, so to test the effect of gender you would not be able to include a model effect for age group.
