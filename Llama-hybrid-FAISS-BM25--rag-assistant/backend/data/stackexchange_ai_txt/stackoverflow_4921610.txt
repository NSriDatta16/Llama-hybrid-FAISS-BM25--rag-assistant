Yes, you'd need to serialize it. Then you can store it in anything you like. SQLite, MySQL, PGSQL, flat file, etc. Since you are serializing it, there shouldn't be a problem with locale. [edit] Of course you should serialize and PHP object you are trying to store. And you should not edit it directly via the storage medium. You should unserialize it and manipulate it via PHP. [edit] Since you have stated you do not want to use a database server, you have to use a flat file. I would use SQLite. If you don't want to do that, you'll need to create your own file parser. You could store one object per file and identify the objects via the file name. You'll have to think about user space though. If that is an issue, you can use sessions. This is quite common for caching data. Just to reiterate, you need to serialize the data before using any method of storage. It's not serialize vs. SQLite. It's serilaize + SQLite. You need to serilaize it then insert it into and SQLite db or serialize the data and then store it in the session. Caching data is nothing new. You are not breaking new ground. It's been done many times before.
