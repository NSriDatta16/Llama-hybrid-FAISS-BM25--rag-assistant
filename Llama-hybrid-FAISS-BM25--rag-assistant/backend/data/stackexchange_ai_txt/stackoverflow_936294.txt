Mmm... If the entire XAP is loaded check how is stored in browser cache. On the other hand, you can perform partial loads as markti commented, how to define your views? use interfaces contract, so you can deferr the load the views to show on demand (main XAP loads application, plus interface assemblies, the you divide the views into several DLL's, maybe main page is loaded and the rest just loaded in background). You can as well use isolated storage to cache that Dll's (then your application will read that Dll's from the local computer). http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/09/24/silverlight-isolated-storage-caching.aspx
