Opencv does quite a bit of clever memory management to avoid unnecessary copies. It often makes sense to write the simple niave solution and then profile to check if it needs or can be improved. See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/memory_management.html Merge may be very efficient if the destination image is planer - if it is flat then the individual real and imaginary values are all going to have to be copied anyway.
