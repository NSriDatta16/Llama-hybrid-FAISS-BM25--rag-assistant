your div "divInnerDiv" must be styled as positition: relative; in order for the img with position: absolute; to be positioned from the origin of the div. otherwise, it's absolutely positioned from the origin of the page. i think you can also get away with absolutely positioning your div if you want to place it manually rather than in the flow of the document. you have some different issues with firefox/chrome, but it's time to go home and this will at least keep your image from popping out of its container as soon as you touch it. edit: firefox/chrome issues in the function mouseMove where you are setting the position of the element, firefox and chrome require units with the value. it should look like something this: dragObject.style.top = (mousePos.y - mouseOffset.y).toString() + 'px'; dragObject.style.left = (mousePos.x - mouseOffset.x).toString() + 'px'; there's also a general issue with how the script determines where to move the element to but i'm not sure what it is right now. edit2: how to fix the jumpy image we're going to change the procedures a bit. rather than placing the image based on how far the mouse has moved from the last move event, we're going to see where the mouse is compared to where it was when mousedown fired and move the image that far from where it started. add a new variable (towards the top) to hold the starting coordinates of the img element var imgStartLoc = null; we'll set this in the onmousedown function (maybe not the cleanest way to do this but it works) imgStartLoc = { x: isNaN(parseInt(dragObject.style.left)) ? 0 : parseInt(dragObject.style.left), y: isNaN(parseInt(dragObject.style.top)) ? 0 : parseInt(dragObject.style.top) }; also in the mousedown function replace mouseOffset = getMouseOffset(this, ev); with ev = ev || window.event; mouseOffset = mouseCoords(ev); since we want to know where the mouse is on the page rather than in the div. in the mouseMove function change the top/left assignment lines to var mouseDelta = { x: mousePos.x - mouseOffset.x, y: mousePos.y - mouseOffset.y } dragObject.style.top = (imgStartLoc.y + mouseDelta.y).toString() + 'px'; dragObject.style.left = (imgStartLoc.x + mouseDelta.x).toString() + 'px'; all should be well after this.
