I've figured out something that works in my case. It's not necessarily the most elegant but it gets the job done. I set the default Opacity of the WebBrowser to 0. Then, I attach an event handler for the LoadCompleted event: private void browser_Post_LoadCompleted(object sender, NavigationEventArgs e) { browser_Post.Opacity = 1; } Now, before I load a new HTML page, I set the Opacity back to 0 so it hides the browser while the new HTML is being rendered so there is no flickering of backgrounds. When the HTML is finished loading the event will fire and the new HTML page will be shown as expected.
