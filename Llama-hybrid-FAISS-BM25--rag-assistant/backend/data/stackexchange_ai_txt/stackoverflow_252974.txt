Use Silverlight Isolated Storage To Keep Authentication Token?

I would like to hear some opinions about using the isolated storage in Silverlight for storing sensitive data. For example, is it OK to store an authentication token (some GUID that identifies a server-side session) in this storage, or is it better to use cookies? The isolated storage gives an advantage over cookies in that it is shared across browsers, but it might be more difficult to handle expiry, and there might be some other issues (security?) that I am not aware of. So... what are your opinions? Or do you know any great articles about the topic? Thanks, Jacob
