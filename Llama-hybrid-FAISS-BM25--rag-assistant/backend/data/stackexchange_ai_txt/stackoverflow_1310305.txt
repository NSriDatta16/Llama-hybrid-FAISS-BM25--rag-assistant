There is no general answer to this question. A solver finding the solution to any equation does not exist. As Lance Roberts already says, you have to know more about the functions. Just a few examples If the functions are twice differentiable, and you can compute the first derivative, you might try a variant of Newton-Raphson Have a look at the Lagrange Multiplier Method for implementing the constraint. If the function F is continuous (which it probably is, if it is an interpolant), you could also try the Bisection Method, which is a lot like binary search. Before you can solve the problem, you really need to know more about the function you're studying.
