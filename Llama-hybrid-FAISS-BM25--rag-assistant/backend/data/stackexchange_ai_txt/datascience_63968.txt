You can try using pretrained model and take the output. You might need to apply dimensionality reduction e.g. PCA, to get a more managable size input. After that you can train novelty detection model to identify whether the output is different than your training set. Another method would be using autoencoder. So the idea is if the tested image is "similar" to the training set the network will have no problem reconstructing the input and hence lower reconstruction loss. But I think the issue might be the lack of training data since I believe 1000 is small for your network to generalize the concept of a vehicle, but who knows if you dont try.
