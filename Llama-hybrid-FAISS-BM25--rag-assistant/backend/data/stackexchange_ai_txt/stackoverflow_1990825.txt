C only reserves some uses of a _t suffix. As far as I can tell, this is only current identifiers ending with _t plus any identifier that starts int or uint (7.26.8). However, POSIX may reserve more. It's a general problem in C, since you have extremely flat namespaces, and there's no silver bullet. If you're familiar with CapCase names and they work well for you, then you should continue to use them. Otherwise, you'll have to evaluate the goals of the current project and see which solution best meets them.
