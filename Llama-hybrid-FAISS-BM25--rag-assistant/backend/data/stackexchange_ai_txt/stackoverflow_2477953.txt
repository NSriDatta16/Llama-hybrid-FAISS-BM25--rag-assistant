If you have made many changes to the table and not run a re-index or defragment on the tables in question you probably should. Check out this article . The reason i suggest this is because the procedure at one time was fast and now over time it has degraded performance. I don't think making changes to an already existing procedure that was tested and worked well at one time should change on account of degraded performance over time. This usually only treats the symptoms not the actual problem.
