There is a number of correlation measures for binary data including $\phi$ coefficient and Cohen's $\kappa$ among the commonly used ones. Alexander et al. (1985) after conducting a simulation study concluded that $\phi$ and $\kappa$ are not the most efficient ones with the odds ratio based coefficient by Chambers being the best in their study. Below you can see a table summarizing different measures provided in this paper. Modern methods as tetrachoric correlation are implemented in different software, like R's psych library . Since a number of different measures exist, you should probably start with doing a review of their pros and cons for your particular purpose. As @Glen_b noticed, you seem mention testing the difference about those two binary variables. If it is so, you may be rather interested in methods such as $\chi^2$ test , binomial test , or logistic regression (cf. here ) and odds ratios , for learning more about those methods see here and here .
