A simple method would be to take the average success rate weighted with actual success rate of an item [where the total trials for an item is low eg below 10, or below 15. In a nice scenario the average success rate for every item would be in theory be 50% if left to chance and normally distributed. Any threshold can be used to start with but it will be better to find the statistically significant point where 4 out of 4, or 7 out of 7 is very unlikely to have happened by chance [if there are 500+ items, 9 or 10 probably will be the minimum starting point for average 50% and may be higher / lower dependent on the average probability of success]. The threshold must be kept low though, or this method could mute statistically significant items [20 out of 20, with 50% expected success]. Based on a threshold of 10: If trials If trials >=10: Use actual success rate. Example: If an item has a success rate of 8 out of 8 [100%]. Then due to low confidence as it possibly occurred entirely by chance, it is averaged with weighted average success rate. Now if the success for the item continues, line 2 shows the new confidence based expected success rate. Finally if the success continues and reaches 10/10 [line 3], the average success of item is nolonger weighted with actual success rate. This requires programming / formulas to avoid using the formula once 10+ trials are reached and you are confident in success rate. 8 out of 8: 8/10 * 8/8 + (10-8) * 50% = 90% 9 out of 9: 9/10 * 9/9 + (10-9) * 50% = 95% 10 out of 10: 10/10 * 10/10 + (10-10) * 50% = 100% 11 out of 11: 11/11 = 100% *Use actual success rate This method can be used in an exponential manner as well [which will add considerable improvement]. An even simpler method is to simply exclude items below the threshold from being ranked. Important: Items likely will not naturally all have same expected success rates which needs to be accounted for in any method unless the list is for the most part arbitrary. Example: comparing sales success of an inbound call centre verse a telemarketer salesperson. The average salesperson might have an expected success rate of 50% [average of all sale staff] for a customer calling who is already interested, so a success rate of 16/20 [80%] from is great. BUT a telemarketer might have an expected success rate of 5% who achieves a success rate of 5/20 [25%] is actually a slightly better salesperson than the call centre worker and if a list were to be made for all phone based salespersons between the two companies, that telemarketer would be unjustly ranked very poorly in such a list.
