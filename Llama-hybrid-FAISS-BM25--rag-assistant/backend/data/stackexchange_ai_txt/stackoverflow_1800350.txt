If you change your HQL a bit to look like that: var topTen = UoW.Session.CreateQuery( @"SELECT distinct rss.FeedUrl FROM RssFeedSubscription rss group by rss.FeedUrl order by rss.SubscriptionCount DESC ") .SetMaxResults(10) .List(); the topTen variable will be an object[] with 2 elements in there being the 2 feed URLs. You can have this returned as strongly typed collection if you use the SetResultTransformer() method of the IQuery interfase.
