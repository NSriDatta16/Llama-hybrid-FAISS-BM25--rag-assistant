(I'll try to avoid rehashing issues that are already well covered in the other answer; in particular I strongly agree with its first paragraph and much of the remainder, though I will expand slightly on one of its points along the way.) If you're comfortable with some smoothing by eye, make your density estimates (like histograms or KDEs or whatever else) rougher than the supposed "optima" offered by many packages. They are generally aimed at giving minimum MSE estimates of the density under some set of assumptions, and while they work well for what they're designed for, they're not optimized for what they're actually used for . For visual impression purposes -- where as you note, you already smooth by eye -- I think they oversmooth, often quite heavily. I'll often use the default and half of the default as binwidth/bandwidth - and sometimes halve it again - to give several views of the data at different settings (the choice of kernel is generally less critical).
