How to use a material number as a feature for Machine Learning?

I have a problem. I want to use a classification algorithm. I also have materialNumber as a column. Could I use that as a feature for my Machine Learning algorithm? (I have the materialDescription, but as a catergorial feature I can not use them e.g. as a One Hot Enconding matrix, because there is too much different materials) If yes, do I need to standardize/normalize the number ? Or what is neccessary to use them.
