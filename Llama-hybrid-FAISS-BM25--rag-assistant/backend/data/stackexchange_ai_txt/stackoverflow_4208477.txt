XSD: Either/Or syntax

How can i do either/or validation in an XSD? e.g. in the following xml fragment, if the action is A ( add ), then subsequent attributes and elements are required : ... but if the action is D then subsequent attributes, and attributes, are forbidden:: That is: if the action is delete ( D ), then the remaining attributes change from required to prohibited and the subsequent elements switch from minOccurences="1" maxOccurrences="unbounded" to minOccurrences="0" maxOccurrences="0" Is it possible to use XSD to define xml structure?
