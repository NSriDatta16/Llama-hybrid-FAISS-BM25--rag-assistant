Error with the Geometric Bayesian multiplicative replacement of count zeros with "cmultRepl"

I'm new with the treatment of compositional data and I'm working with a microbiome dataset which contains 107 observations and 3246 variables. I'm trying to use the cmultRepl function of the zCompositions package in R to impute zeros in the dataset. There are no missing values in the dataset and all columns contain at least one non-zero data. I tried using the function with the default settings and I get this error: zcomp colmins[z])) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed I tried using the Bayes-Laplace method instead and it worked well. zcomp Does anyone know why I get an error with the Geometric Bayesian multiplicative (default) method, but not with the Bayes-Laplace method? Here is my dataset : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1awS9xew241JsPABUc4NH9sY-YW2-_a23
