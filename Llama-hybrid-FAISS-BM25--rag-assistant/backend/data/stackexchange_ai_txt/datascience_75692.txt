About the data, you can use any question answering (QA) dataset to build your training and validation datasets. SQuAD is probably the most popular now, but there are many others (see here ). From these datasets, you will be able to create a collection of pairs to question and their correct answers and questions and the wrong answers. About the model, BERT is prepared to classify pairs of sentences. Originally, it classified whether the second sentence followed the first sentence in the original text (next sentence prediction), but you can fine tune it and repurpose it to receive the question as first sentence and the potential answer as second sentence, and classify whether the answer is actually answering the question.
