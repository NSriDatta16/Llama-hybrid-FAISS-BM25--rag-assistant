Flex 4 Changing style options with states

I'm interested in finding out the best approach to this issue, it's not technically difficult but there must be an elegant solution. Basically i have a form that features mostly text inputs, i would like to change the style of the input boxes based on the current state. I can do this in the mxml on each input... But that involves creating properties on every single item in the form. There must be a better way of doing this without adding a property to each item? Thanks!
