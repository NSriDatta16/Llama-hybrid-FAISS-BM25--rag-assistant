For this problem you need two response variables. One Boolean response that indicates whether the lake froze or not, and one integer response giving the day of the year, conditional on the indicator being true. In years when the lake froze, both the Boolean and integer are observed. In years when the lake didn't freeze, the Boolean is observed and the integer is not. You can use a logistic regression for the Boolean. The regression for day of the year could be an ordinary linear regression. The circular nature of the day of the year shouldn't be a problem as long as you number the possible freeze-over days consecutively within a given time period. If you are wondering where to start the numbering, I would suggest the day when the predictors were measured. If you want the model to represent causal effects, it must be the case that all predictors were measured before any possible freeze-over. To handle the integer and bounded nature of the day of the year, could use a discretization model. That is, there is a real latent value which generates an observation in the following way: if the value is within the bounds then the observation equals the latent value rounded to the nearest integer, otherwise the value is truncated to the bounds. The latent value itself can then be modelled as a linear function of the predictors plus noise.
