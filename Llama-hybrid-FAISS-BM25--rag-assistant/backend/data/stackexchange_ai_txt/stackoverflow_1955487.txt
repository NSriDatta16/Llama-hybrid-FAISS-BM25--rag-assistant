You could create a unique hash for each invite and keep an association of hashes with user names. This would require a bit of storage overhead, but you could have expiration of invites to help combat that. So http://mydomain/invite/RgetSqtu would be an example link, with a DB table that stores RgetSqtu/profile until it is used. You would probably want to provide a helpful error page if the hash could not be found, like the following: We are sorry but the invite you entered could not be found. This could be caused by the invite being typed incorrectly, being used already, or being too old (invites expire after 3 days).
