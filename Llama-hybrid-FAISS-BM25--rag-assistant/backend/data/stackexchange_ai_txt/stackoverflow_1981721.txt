Using an Instance Variable in more than one method

How would I save an Instance so that I could use it in another method? This is the code I have: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint touchedStart; // find position of the touch touchedStart = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint touchedEnd; // find position of the touch touchedEnd = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; } I want to be able to use the touchedStart variable in the touchesEnded method. How would I do this?
