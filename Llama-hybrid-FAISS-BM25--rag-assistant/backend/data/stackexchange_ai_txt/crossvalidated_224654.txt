Is Robert Rutledge's calculation of the probability of similarities between Michelle Obama and Melania Trump's speeches reasonable?

Melania Trump has given a speech in support of her husband's campaign that many people believe has been plagiarised. An astrophysics professor, Robert Rutledge has calculated that there is a 1 in 87 billion chance that certain similarities in phrasing are coincidental. While not necessarily arguing the overall conclusion, given that word orders is restricted by grammar, and they were obviously talking about overlapping topics, this low probability seems too low. Are there methods to put a more realistic probability on coincidence that is conditional on these other features of the problem?
