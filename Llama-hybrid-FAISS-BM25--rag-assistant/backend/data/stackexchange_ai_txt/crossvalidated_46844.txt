What is the best way to show visually the connection between prediction value and independent features?

After applying a machine learning algorithm on some data, I have a table with one column being the prediction value (can be either binary or continuous). The other columns are the independent features (mostly numeric values). I'm trying to look for a way of visualization which answers the question: Which of the independent features have the most correlation with the prediction value? I tried to find something but couldn't find anything; it might be though that I'm not looking for the right terms. Please excuse if my question lacks clarity as I'm still new in the realm of machine learning.
