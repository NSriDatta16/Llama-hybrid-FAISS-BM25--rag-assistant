In many cases, the reason for overfitting is too little data, and very complicated model. If you are using Neural Network, even with drop out, it is very easy to have millions of parameters. This means you can fit the training data perfectly. And such model will fail on some data other than training data . You said you are simulating data, so, I assume you many not have the computational power to simulate the data large enough for the model. Try following things: use simple neural network with 1 hidden layer, and few hidden unit. you can forget about the regularization if you are using this simple model. Run this model again to see the results.
