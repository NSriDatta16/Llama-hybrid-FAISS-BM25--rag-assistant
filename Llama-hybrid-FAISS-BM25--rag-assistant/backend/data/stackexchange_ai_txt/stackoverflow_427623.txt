Generally speaking, RDBMSes handle these types of queries very well. Both commercial and open source database engines have evolved over decades using all the reasonable computing algorithms applicable, to do just this task as fast as possible. I would venture a guess that the only way you would beat RDBMS in speed is, if your data is specifically organized and require specific algorithms. Some RDBSes let you specify which of the underlying algorithms you can use for manipulating data, and with open-source ones, you can always rewrite or implement a new algorithm, if needed. However, unless your case is very special, I believe it might be a serious overkill. For most cases, I would say putting the data in RDBMS and manipulating it via SQL should work well enough so that you don't have to worry abouut underlying algorithms.
