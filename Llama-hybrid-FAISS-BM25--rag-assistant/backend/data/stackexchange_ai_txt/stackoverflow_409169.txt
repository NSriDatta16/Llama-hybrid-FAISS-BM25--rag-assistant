I'm coming to this thread very late, and that you've already realised some of the issues. But as an ex-master and an ex-professional chess programmer, I thought I could add a few useful facts and figures. There are several ways of measuring the complexity of chess : The total number of chess games is approximately 10^(10^50). That number is unimaginably large. The number of chess games of 40 moves or less is around 10^40. That's still an incredibly large number. The number of possible chess positions is around 10^46. The complete chess search tree (Shannon number) is around 10^123, based on an average branching factor of 35 and an average game length of 80. For comparison, the number of atoms in the observable universe is commonly estimated to be around 10^80. All endgames of 6 pieces or less have been collated and solved . My conclusion: while chess is theoretically solvable, we will never have the money, the motivation, the computing power, or the storage to ever do it.
