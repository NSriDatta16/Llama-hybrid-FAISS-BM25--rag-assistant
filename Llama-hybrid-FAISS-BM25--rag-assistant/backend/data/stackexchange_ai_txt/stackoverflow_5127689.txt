This is because of task-switching (and maybe additionally paging). If there is only one prgram that needs a lot of CPU-time and/or memory-accesses it will be given many CPU-time-slices and thus will be able to run un-interrupted for a "long" time. On the other hand if multiple processes need a lot of CPU-time, Windows will task-switch frequently between them and thus introduce additional overhead (because it needs to store/load process-state on every task-switch). If you have 2 CPUs this is less problematic but still measurable because background-processes also need attention albeit less frequent. See here for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch Insert Sleep(10) calls into your program; your program should get longer but less-frequent time-slices: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686298%28VS.85%29.aspx
