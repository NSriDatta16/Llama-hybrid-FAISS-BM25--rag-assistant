You should be able to create a UDF that will get the value of tasktype and call this from within your data retrieval sproc. Something like CREATE FUNCTION dbo.TaskType() Returns int SELECT ... stuff that gets task type END then from with your data retrieval sproc call DECLARE tasktype int SELECT tasktype = dbo.TaskType or something like that...might need a bit of reworking :-)
