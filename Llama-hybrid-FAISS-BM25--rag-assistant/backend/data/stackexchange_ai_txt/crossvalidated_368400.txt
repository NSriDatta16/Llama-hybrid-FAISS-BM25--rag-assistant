What are some left skewed models for curve fitting?

I am working on some data on thermal performances on my organism for my thesis. I came across the Ricker Model which is a right skewed curve as shown below. How can I modify it to become a left skewed curve with a peak to the right hand side at higher x values. Hence, performance of the organisms slowly increases from at smaller x values until it hit an optimum, then decreases as x continues to increase. This is the general form to which my data conform, but I don't know much about models and equations to find one to would fit my data set and explains the biology observed. So far, I have been this coding below to fit my data. However, the initial increase is a little to abrupt compare to what is measured. fit Pointers, help, comments are extremely appreciated! Thank you.
