I think the correct answer depends on the question. If your question is, "On average have the observed sales of my company decreased over time?" there is no reason for statistical inference. Suppose on the other hand you think that the data generating process is: observed_sales = constant + fundamental_trend * year + white_noise You are interested in testing the hypothesis "fundamental_trend = 0". In this case, you can think of the observed sales of your company as a finite sample of an infinite data generating process, and employing statistical inference makes sense.
