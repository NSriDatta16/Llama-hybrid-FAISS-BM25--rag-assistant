This is too long for a comment, but I believe it's an important comment here. What is discussed here is a mathematical approach under some specific assumptions on the process being measured, but we can have time series data that do not follow these assumptions! The modelling approach must answer the question of «why is the time series irregular?» and respond to it correctly. Some potential answers: Observations missing at random (e.g. we observe a process in social sciences and we just can't sample it often enough) → approaches based on approximation at regular timestamps, e.g. Kalman filter, are fine and simplify the problem a lot. Series of externally observable events (e.g. loan payments) → we need to model spacing explicitly, because shorter or longer intervals will have meaning. Series of observable events where the act of observation changes the object (e.g. modelling spaced repetition methods or… some surveys) → can of worms.
