From the docs : (scroll down to "Embedding SWF Symbols") If the SWF file contains any ActionScript code, Flex prints a warning during compilation and then strips out the ActionScript from the embed symbol. This means that you can only embed the symbol itself. Depending on what you want to do, I think you'd be better off embedding the entire SWF, or loading things in at runtime. Incidentally, regarding not being able to access stuff within the embedded symbol, did you make sure that the target SWF is AS3? If you're embedding (or loading) AS2 content, then interoperability is only allowed through LocalConnection. This is also covered on the doc page I linked.
