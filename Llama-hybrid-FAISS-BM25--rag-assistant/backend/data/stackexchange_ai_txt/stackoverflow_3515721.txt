IIS Redirect Moved Files

I would like to reorganize the directory structure on a hosted website (i.e. I can not go in and configure the IIS settings). Say I had 3 files in the root directory: fruitcake.html, chocolateCake.html, and appleMuffins.html Now, I want to move them to a new folder called Recipes . This is easy enough, but there are a lot of existing links out there that point to the other files. How would I construct a 404.aspx page to read in which file was in the address bar, then update the browser to go to the new location?
