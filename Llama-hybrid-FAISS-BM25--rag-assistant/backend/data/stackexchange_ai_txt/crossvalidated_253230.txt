What does this loss function mean?

I had a interview on deep learning internship job yesterday, and the interviewer showed a loss function formula(below) and asked me 2 questions: \begin{equation} J(\theta)=-\mathbb{E}_{x,y\sim\hat{p}_{data}}\log{p_{model}(y|x)} \end{equation} How to understand $p(y|x)$ in the formula above? On what task does this loss function used for? Since I have no idea on this loss function, how to answer these 2 questions?
