How to implement a generic DOM data structure in C++?

I'm trying to write a very simple implementation of Document Object Model library in order to provide a generic data structure to use in my further projects. Just to keep things simple I defined only three main classes: node , element and attribute . A node is defined by it's name (e.g. all html tags) and basically is a container for an element which can be both text and sub-nodes (stored in a std::vector ). I just can't figure out how to define a whole tree structure. I need templatized interfaces for the classed I referred. Example of usage: element txt1("Some text"); element > div1("div", txt1); I don't want to create a complete DOM abstraction level with full support of XML. I just need ideas to organize information in DOM-like style. No parsing is required. Thanks in advance!
