Interpretation of R-squared score of a Neural Network for classification

My Neural Network has an $R^2$ score of 0.30. What I know is that it is not zero and not negative so it's not super bad and it's not close to one so it's not perfect but it's hard to find any more useful information other than that. Is $R^2$ even a good measurement for classification? Simplified my network tells if something is A or B so what does an $R^2$ score of 0.3 say about it? I use this command from sklearn for r2_score : r2_score sklearn
