This was an issue with the code, specifically the variable "params" wasn't being passed correctly to xgboost. The wrong code (from above, with asterisks around the wrong area): parameters = list(eta = 0.005, max_depth = 15, subsample = 0.5, colsample_bytree = 0.5, seed = 1, eval_metric = "auc", objective = "binary:logistic") # Fit a model xgb_reduced = xgboost(data = xgbtrain_reduced, **parameters**, nround=which.max(cvreduced$evaluation_log$test_auc_mean)) The correct code (replacing params with params = parameters): parameters = list(eta = 0.005, max_depth = 15, subsample = 0.5, colsample_bytree = 0.5, seed = 1, eval_metric = "auc", objective = "binary:logistic") # Fit a model xgb_reduced = xgboost(data = xgbtrain_reduced, params = parameters, nround=which.max(cvreduced$evaluation_log$test_auc_mean))
