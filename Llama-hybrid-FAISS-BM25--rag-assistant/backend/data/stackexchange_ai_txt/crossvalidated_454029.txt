I resolved this problem some time ago and thought I would present the answer for those who are looking. In short, the Sklearn SVM does not perform in a typical one-vs-rest implementation. Instead it uses a wrapper to develop a decision function that combines the decision functions of several one-vs-other classifiers to perform its classification. This approach has changed between implementations and I encourage you to refer to your installation of Sklearn to find out how yours is being performed.
