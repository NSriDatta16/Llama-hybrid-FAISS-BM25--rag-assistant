It's a regression machine learning problem. Assuming you have 30 characteristics, one-hot encoded into 30 columns. And your target is the character score, min-max scaled into $[0, 1]$. So we have X.shape=(None, 30) , Y.shape=(None,) (just like what ncasas has stated), thus we can train a regression model using your favorite algorithm (linear regression, random forest, even neural network). After we have this model working, as each person has and only has 3 characters, we can predict the character score for each character combination one by one. The time complexity is roughly $O(n^3)$. However, $n$ is small in your case, so maybe we can just brute-force every score on every combination. That's what you want.
