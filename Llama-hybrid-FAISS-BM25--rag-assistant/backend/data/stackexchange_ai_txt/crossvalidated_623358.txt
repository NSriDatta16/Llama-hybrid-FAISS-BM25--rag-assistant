How do you refer to data that's not part of train/test/validation?

The purpose of creating a machine learning model is to deploy in live situation, e.g., classification in the wild. The model is trained on the training set, tuned on the validation set, and evaluated on the test set. When it is being used in the wild, how do practitioners typically refer to data that is fed into the model during deployment? Obviously this data is typically more general than the data in train/test/validation sets. I had always assumed this term is called "out of sample" data...but it seems that there is some conflict between this terminology and test data.
