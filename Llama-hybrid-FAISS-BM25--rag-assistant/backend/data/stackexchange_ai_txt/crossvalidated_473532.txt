Your intuition that it seems weird not to include measures of uncertainty in predictions is, I would say, correct. If your concern is solely in the sample you collected, then typically you wouldn't fit regression models. Means and averages are typically all that you would report. However, the fact that you are interested in regression models and in prediction in particular suggests that the greater "population" you wish to make inference on is not restricted to your sample. More specifically, it seems you wish to make inference in various "what-if" scenarios, e.g., what if participant 1's height was increased by 1 while every other attribute of his stays the same? This falls more generally under the "causal inference" paradigm, which some would argue is at the heart of epidemiology. Now, methods for causal inference can be quite involved, but the simplest of these is the linear regression model, which we can write in equation form as $$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \cdots + \epsilon. $$ Although some textbooks may interpret $\epsilon$ as sampling error, this is not necessary in general. $\epsilon$ can represent general "uncertainty" in a modeling exercise, where the goal is to derive a simple, parsimonious, mathematical relationship between the various variables. $\epsilon$ can also represent the effect of "all other variables you have not measured", which I think is the standard econometric interpretation. For your application, I think the former is more appropriate. If you can gain access, the following article is a good discussion of the mathematical basis of various epidemiological models. https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/1990/11000/Randomization,_Statistics,_and_Causal_Inference.3.aspx
