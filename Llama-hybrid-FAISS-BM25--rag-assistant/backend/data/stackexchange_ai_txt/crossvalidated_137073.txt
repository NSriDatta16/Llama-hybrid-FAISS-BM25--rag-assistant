Extracting information from auto correlation signal

I have an auto correlation signal that looks like this: This is an autocorrelation graph of a single column taken from a certain image using a CCD camera. You can see the autocorrelation strength vs. the delay / drag (in pixels). I can see that the high-frequency spikes sit on top of a low-frequency curve. My question is: what is the meaning of all the sharp spikes in the graph and the spacing between the spikes? Do the spikes represent real high-frequency periodicity in the image or they represent a different phenomena? What is the meaning of the low frequency curve? Thank you very much for your time and efforts, Shai Yefet
