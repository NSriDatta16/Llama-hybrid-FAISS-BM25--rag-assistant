It all depends on what your good memory remembers.. I've worked on the same project for 10 years or so and I can't remember every line and who wrote it and why. But... I can remember pretty much all the user requests and user issues. Who wanted what and when. I can remember pretty much all the support issues we have had. Finding old code is easy - we have great tools for that. Finding old issues is a much more abstract process: we have JIRA and Wikis but sometimes they don't cut it because they fail to provide the semantic meaning. So. Pay attention to what REALLY matters and remember that.
