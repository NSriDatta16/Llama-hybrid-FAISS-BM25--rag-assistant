What are possible approaches for learning causal DAG of events?

I have historical data of event logs. Each event has an associated contextual Id, which can be used to tell that event A happened first in some context, then event B happened in same context and then C and so on. I want to use this data to find which events are causing other events ( in a context) represented in DAG form. Which machine learning approaches can be used for this type of task? I know Bayesian causal networks is one approach. Are there any others?
