The best practice that I've seen today separates all of the business logic from the presentation layer. Classic ASP.NET Webforms tend to make this a bit more difficult and encourage lazy programming because you can use all of the events off of the page rather than forcing good code separation and single responsibility principle. If you were to utilize the ASP.NET MVC framework, you will most likely have a structure in place that would lend towards better coding practices. However, you can still find ways to fall back to the webforms style of coding. If you focus on the single responsibility principle and ASP.NET MVC , you're going to be off to a great start. Domain Driven Design may also be worth looking at.
