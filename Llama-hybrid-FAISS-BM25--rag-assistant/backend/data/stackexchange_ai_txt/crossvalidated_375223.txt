My question is, how do I extract the 'equation' out from the model It all depends on the model you are using. Some models do not have a straighrforward formula you can extract, and are often called blackbox models. I presume you are looking for some form of interpretability of your model... Since you are using an XGBoost model then the answer is not straightforward. You could try the following: Extract the first decision tree and use it as a basis for extracting some form of equation (in the shape of a decision tree) - but this won't be as useful as the decision tree from a standard decision tree model due to the bagging and boosting effect of XGboost Extract the weights of the different trees, and then compare it with the structure of the trees. But again you won't get any straightforward equation Compute the partial dependency plots for a particular feature (or interaction of features)
