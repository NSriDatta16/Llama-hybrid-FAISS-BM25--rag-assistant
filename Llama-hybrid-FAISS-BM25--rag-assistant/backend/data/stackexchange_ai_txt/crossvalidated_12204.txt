Gaussian processes might be something worth looking at (although in machine learning kernel methods mean something slightly different). Essentially if you use a squared exponential covariance function, you end up with something like a Bayesian radial basis function regression model, with a prior over the function implemented by the model rather than its parameters. There is a very nice book (with MATLAB software) by Rasmussen and Williams.
