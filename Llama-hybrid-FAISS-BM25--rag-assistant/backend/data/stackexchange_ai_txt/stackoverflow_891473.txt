The start of each element is aligned with the address of the union itself. so the individual comparisons in the expression you ask about are true, but the expression as a whole is false unless the union is located at address 0x0001. The deleted text applied to the following comparisons : &u.l == &u.i == &u.s == &u.c[0] The revised version compares distinct pointer types - the pointers should be cast to void pointers. I was asked to quote the standard - or identify the section of the standard. C99 - section 6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers (paragraph 14): A pointer to a union object, suitably converted, points to each of its members (or if a member is a bitfield, then to the unit in which it resides), and vice versa.
