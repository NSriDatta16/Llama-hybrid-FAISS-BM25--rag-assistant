php upload settings in a portable web application

I'm building a web app dealing with online file storage/access. In my local environment I used .htaccess to set php_value upload_max_filesize 100M php_value post_max_size 101M After testing the app on a variety of servers I found that not all setups allow you to use the .htaccess method of modifying the ini settings. The solution I'm thinking of is to check for that permission during the install script and depending on what is allowed use either .htaccess, user directory php.ini, or ini_set(); for that particular installation. ini_set() apparently doesn't work for post_max_upload. For some reason even though my php.ini has user_ini.filename = ".user.ini" it won't read the 2 directives in that file. Neither will it read the same information in the application directory named php.ini And the .htaccess directives stated above result in a 500 Sever Misconfiguration Error. There's has to be a way to change the post_max_upload and upload_max_filesize on the fly. The problem is that i don't know how to check for what is and isn't allowed on a particular server. Can someone help with that?
