I would definitely look at the built-in type List. They have a bunch of useful features built-in and are pretty well tested. You should define a type for those, as it will make the code a lot clearer and will allow for easy future enhancements. I see no specific properties of Director or Actor, they are just people. So I would simply have a class Person, that is the type of field Diretor or Actor in a separate Movie Class. This also elegantly solves the problem of people that are actors and directors at the same time. PS: This looks like a one of those first examples in OO books :-)
