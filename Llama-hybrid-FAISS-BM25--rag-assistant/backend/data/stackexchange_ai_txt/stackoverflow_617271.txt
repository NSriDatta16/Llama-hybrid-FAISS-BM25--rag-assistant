I'd forget about it and just put a spinning circle! Seriously though, to take MrTelly's idea further, there are dynamic management views that can give you average execution times for certain queries - maybe that can get you somewhere. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188754.aspx edit: I have seen percent complete in the sp_whoisactive procedure from Adam Machanic. Maybe that is another place to look into. SQL 2016 has the query store which persists plan cache information - a substitute for the dmv plan cache, which is cleared on reboot.
