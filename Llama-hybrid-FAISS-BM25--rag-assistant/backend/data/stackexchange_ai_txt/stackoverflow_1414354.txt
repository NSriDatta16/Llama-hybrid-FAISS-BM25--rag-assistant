My advice would be to leave it alone. You're right about the fact that you would need to go to a lot of work (as you described) to get rid of it. Why? Why mess with something that just works? To save space in the database? With as cheap as storage is these days, and the average size of a hard drive or storage array, you're talking about a completely insignificant amount of space savings. There is no Return on Investment for this idea.
