average number of tossing coins till 'Head-Tail-Head' series of observation comes up

I know that we use 'geometric distribution' to solve problems such as 'Expected number of tosses till first head comes up' or 'expected number of rolling dice till first 'number 6' comes up'. However, this question 'average number of tossing coins till 'Head-Tail-Head' series of observation comes up' is a little bit different because the observation that we want is not just one event, but a SERIES of events. It seems like we will still use the geometric distribution to solve this problem. But is the answer for this question 8 because the expected number is '1/p', and 'Head-Tail-Head' probability is (1/2) (1/2) (1/2) = 1/8 ?
