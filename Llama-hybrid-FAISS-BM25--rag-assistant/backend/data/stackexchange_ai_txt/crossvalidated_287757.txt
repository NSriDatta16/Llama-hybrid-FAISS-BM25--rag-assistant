Observational study design method vs hypothesis testing vs other?

I am trying to understand the following: do more customers purchase an item because it is discounted 'now' because they engaged with the product before (viewed it, added to a wishlist etc) vs just brought it because its on discount 'now'. Different products are discounted at different times, so I'm assuming a date range, and all discounted products in this range need to be considered. I am confused how to set this up as a statistical test in order to prove / disprove the hypothesis. My thoughts so far: T-Test of set 1 = customers engaged with product_i vs customers not engaged with product_i prior to product_i being on sale. Not sure this accounts for many products though or takes into account time. Logistic regression = probability of a customer purchasing product_i having engaged previous vs not. Again its limited to a product, and then there is an argument over what is a "good % of conversion". Not sure how to solve this through a robust statistical method. Any thoughts?
