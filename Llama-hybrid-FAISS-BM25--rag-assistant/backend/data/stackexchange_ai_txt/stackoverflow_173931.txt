I personally never tested on any real case, but I would suggest using code fragmentation: basically you split your project in a number of libraries, define interfaces and unit tests for each of them, then you separate SVN repositories so that each group have access to a limited part of your precious source code. This is also a good practice no matter what and should help if you are outsourcing abroad.
