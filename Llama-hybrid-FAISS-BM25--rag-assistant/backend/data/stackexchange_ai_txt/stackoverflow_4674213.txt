I had a similar issue. It appears it is related to a DNS issue in that Magento is looking for a valid type URL of the form http://xxxxxx.xxx where x is whatever name you create. Dont use a .com, .net etc..create some random one .ecs for example. You can't use 127.0.0.1 as the URL or localhost for Magento (at least that was my experience using XAMPPLITE. I downloaded HostXpert (free) and assigned a dummy URL like demo.ecs to 127.0.0.1 and then did the Magento install to demo.ecs Before you do the install, verify that your localhost demo.ecs works when you load it into your browser. Hope that helps.
