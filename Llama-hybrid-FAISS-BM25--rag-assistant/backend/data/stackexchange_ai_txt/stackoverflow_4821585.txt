Cloned jQuery draggable can't be dropped on itself

Using jQuery UI, I have a div foo which is both draggable and droppable, and a div bar which is only droppable. The dragging happens with the helper: 'clone' option turned on, so the original foo isn't actually moving. When I drop the cloned foo on top of the original foo , the drop: function doesn't get called. This seems weird, because it works when I drop the cloned foo onto bar . It also works to drop other draggables onto foo . The only problem is that I can't drop foo onto itself. I just said foo and bar and draggable and droppable so many times that even I'm confused, but this example should clear things up: http://jsfiddle.net/5KATZ/ If you try to drag the first box onto the second or third, it works. But if instead of dropping it onto the second box, you start dragging it, then try to drop it onto itself, nothing happens. If this is how things are supposed to work, then what am I doing wrong? If this is a bug in jQuery UI, then can you think of any good workarounds?
