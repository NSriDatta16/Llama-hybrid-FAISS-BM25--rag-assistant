automated choosing the best models(using R)

Is there the library in R, which work in the next way? 1. load the data! 2 it iterates model using different methods (neural network, random forest,(g)lm, etc) and different setting until it gets the best results which is possible on this data? Something like is implemented in SPSS Modeler , but works very bad! Maybe this feature there is in R or another language?
