Rotating in OpenGL relative to the viewport

I'm trying to display an object in the view which can be rotated naturally by dragging the cursor/touchscreen. At the moment I've got X and Y rotation of an object like this glRotatef(rotateX, 0f, 1f, 0f); // Dragging along X, so spin around Y axis glRotatef(rotateY, 1f, 0f, 0f); I understand why this doesn't do what I want it to do (e.g. if you spin it right 180 degrees, up and down spinning gets reversed). I just can't figure out a way for both directions to stay left-right and up-down relative to the viewer. I can assume that the camera is fixed and looking along the Z axis. Any ideas?
