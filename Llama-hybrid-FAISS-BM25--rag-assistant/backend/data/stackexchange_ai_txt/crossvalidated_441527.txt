There is no general result that says that it is always better to use more than one instrument. If you have more instruments than endogenous regressors, you can test the exogeneity of the instruments using the so-called overidentifying restrictions test. However, the validity of that test ignores the fact that each instrumental variable may capture a different so-called local average treatment effect (please search and read about this if you have not heard about the term). If each instrument is valid, then each instrument will individually pick up a local average treatment effect that is specific to some group of compliers, which is often a subsample of your total sample. With ivregress in Stata one can do an overidentifying restrictions test. The best way to generate important tests, however, is to base your instruments on some theory/story, and derive testable implications concerning your instruments from the theory/story.
