MVC is a way of organizing code that seems uniquely well suited for web applications. You'll have to organize your code in some particular way, try MVC and see if you like it. It's also the de-facto standard in web app design, so it makes your code easier to understand for other programmers. It helps me minimize mixing languages -- views contain all the HTML, models all the SQL, and controllers describe and handle the API and support code (like authentication).
