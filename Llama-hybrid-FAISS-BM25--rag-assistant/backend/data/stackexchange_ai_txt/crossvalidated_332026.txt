Can we think of a probability in both the classical and subjective sense simultaneously?

I'm a statistics student. I am trying to understand the classical and objective definitions of probability and how they are related to frequentist and Bayesian inference. It's not obvious to me why classical probability is paired with frequentist inference and why Bayesian inference is paired with subjective probability. In some sources I've read statements like the following from this paper by Wellek (sorry I couldn't find a version that wasn't behind a pay wall): From the frequentist viewpoint, population parameters are unobservable constants about which no meaningful probability statements can be made. I am trying to understand if this is due to the classical definition of probability as repeated trials or if it is due to the constraints of frequentist inference. My specific questions are at the end if readers would prefer to skip ahead, but I wanted to share my thoughts in case that helps. Consider the random variable $X$. Under the classical definition of probability if I wanted to scientifically empirically measure the probability that $P(X=x)$, I would think I just have to repeat the experiment a large number of times and make a tally. By the subjective definition, I think am expected to initially consult my own beliefs or the beliefs of a rational agent. As I collect more data, those beliefs are then rationally modified. Now it seems to me $H_0|X$ can't be observed so there is no way to compute the value of $P(H_0|X)$ by my classical empirical procedure. In contrast, I can always believe in things I can't directly observe such as $H_0|X$ and so assuming I know some relationship between things I can observe like $X$ and things I can't observe like $H_0$, this allows me to have beliefs about $P(H_0|X)$ which I can rationally modify over time. It occurs to me that I can also argue that for the frequentist, $H_0$ is a fixed property of the universe anyway so I am perhaps stuck with the notion that $H_0$ is fixed even if I could observe it. But what if we think about the typical experiment of flipping a coin and we modify it to say I have a large supply of quarters and I always use a new one every time I record a flip. So in that case, I suspect there is an underlying parameter $p$ which is coin specific but I can never directly observe it. Therefore, $P(p=0.5|X)$ is meaningful but I can't compute it via direct observation of $p$. So just to circle back to my high-level questions. Is there any meaningful way to interpret a Bayesian inference procedure as a frequentist? Is there any meaningful way to do Bayesian inference where the probabilities are defined according to the classical definition of probability?
