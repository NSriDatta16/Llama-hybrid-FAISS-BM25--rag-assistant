So called 'Frequentist' statistical tests are typically equivalent to the in principle more complex Bayesian approach under certain assumptions. When these assumptions are applicable, then either approach will give the same result, so it is safe to use the easier to apply Frequentist test. The Bayesian approach is safer in general because is makes the assumptions explicit but if you know what you are doing the Frequentist test is often just as good as a Bayesian approach and typically easier to apply.
