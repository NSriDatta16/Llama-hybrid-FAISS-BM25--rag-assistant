Update confirmation email on the event checkout_onepage_controller_success_action

I’m facing an issue and i’m wondering if you could help me with it .. I need to update my confirmation email on the following event: checkout_onepage_controller_success_action, and send it only after my updates are done inside it.. Problem is I don’t find where is sent the confirmation email in the code ? and it’s probably not an observer on an event no ? Maybe you could help me with it because i need to update this email with some important Information that I only got after I have a payment confirmation .. Anyway I wish you a nice sunday and maybe you will be able to help me, All the best for your different projects, Anselme PS i'm using magento 1.4.0.2
