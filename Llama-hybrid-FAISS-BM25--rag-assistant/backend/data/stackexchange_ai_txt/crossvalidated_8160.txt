How to create one score from a mixed set of positive and negative variables?

I have 3,000 observations (administrative communities) characterized by five variables. Four of them work in the direction 'the more, the worse' and one goes in the opposite. I'd like to create one score or an ordered list of these observations that will best take into account all of those five variables. I have tried clustering using MCLUST package in R, and it gives some meaningful results but it's hard to decide about the ordering of observations on the basis of cluster membership. My second attempt was to run PCA and extract the first component, which is closer to what I'd like to get. What other solutions (R- or Stata-based preferably) could I use to deal with this problem?
