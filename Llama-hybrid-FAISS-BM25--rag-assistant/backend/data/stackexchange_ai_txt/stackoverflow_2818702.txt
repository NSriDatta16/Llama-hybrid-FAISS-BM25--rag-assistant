Java technologies for web-development

I'm PHP-programmer, but I'm extremely interested in learning Java. So I decided to change speciality from PHP to Java. At the moment I have an opportunity to try to make quite simple web-application (it should contain 2-3 forms, several pages with information from the database and authorization module) and also I have a chance to choose any technology I want. Besides I have about 3 months for this task. I've decided to develop site with Java technologies for the purpose of studying. I've already read a book about Java ("Java2 Complete Reference" by P.Naughton) and currently I'm reading "Thinking in Java" by B.Eckel. I clearly understand it's not enough for efficient development, but I want, at least, to try. I would be very appreciated for the advises, which framework (for example) or technology to choose (Spring, Grails etc.) and what primary aspects and technologies of Java should I pay attention to? Thank you in advance.
