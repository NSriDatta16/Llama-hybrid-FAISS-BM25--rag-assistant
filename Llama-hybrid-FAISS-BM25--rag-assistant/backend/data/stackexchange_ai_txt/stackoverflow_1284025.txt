After more research it is apparent this is not actually possible in Maven 2 in the way I want, a hack of some form is necessary to introduce integration tests. While you can add additional directories (as suggested by Rich Seller) there is no plugin to remove the other sources or to compile a directory separately from the main compilation. The best solution I have found for adding integration tests is to first use the build helper plugin to add the directory inttest directory to be compiled as tests. org.codehaus.mojo build-helper-maven-plugin add-test-source generate-sources add-test-source src/inttest/java Now in order to get the integration tests to execute on the integration-test phase you need to use excludes and includes to manipulate when they get run as below. This allow any custom parameters you might want (in my case an agent being added via argline). org.apache.maven.plugins maven-surefire-plugin **/itest/** inttests test integration-test none **/itest/**/*Test.java
