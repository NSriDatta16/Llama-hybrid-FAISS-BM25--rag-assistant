Sklearn classification report is not printing the micro avg score for multi class classification model

There are 6 class labels encoded as 0,1,2,3,4,5 While executing classification report score it outputs accuracy,macro avg,weighted avg .The micro average score is missing in the output . Im not sure why micro average score is not getting printed . What should i do to get micro average score as well ? print(classification_report(y_test, best_preds,labels=[0,1,2,3,4,5])) precision recall f1-score support 0 0.65 0.76 0.70 46 1 0.74 0.56 0.64 41 2 0.60 0.68 0.64 41 3 0.65 0.59 0.62 41 4 0.75 0.79 0.77 61 5 0.76 0.70 0.73 40 accuracy 0.69 270 macro avg 0.69 0.68 0.68 270 weighted avg 0.69 0.69 0.69 270 I went through the sklearn documentation and i changed the class labels from 0-5 to 1-6 to just simply see what scores are printed by classification report and to my suprise the micro average score was printed in the output but the entire score in this classification report is wrong as the class labels are 0-5 and not 1-6 that is why there is a warning printed in the output as well . print(classification_report(y_test, best_preds,labels=[1,2,3,4,5,6])) precision recall f1-score support 1 0.74 0.56 0.64 41 2 0.60 0.68 0.64 41 3 0.65 0.59 0.62 41 4 0.75 0.79 0.77 61 5 0.76 0.70 0.73 40 6 0.00 0.00 0.00 0 micro avg 0.70 0.67 0.69 224 macro avg 0.58 0.55 0.56 224 weighted avg 0.70 0.67 0.69 224 UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples.
