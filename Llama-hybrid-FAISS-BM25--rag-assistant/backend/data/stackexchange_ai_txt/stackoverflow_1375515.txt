VB/C#: Placing disposible objects in global scope: Is this okay?

As an optimization, I decided to put an object I frequently need - an SDL surface with a prerendered image of the entire level (called S_AreaBMP) - at global scope. Now it doesn't have to be created and destroyed in the DrawScreen function every frame. I only need to dispose and change it when a new level or GFX sheet is loaded, which I do via this function: Public Sub PrepareAreaImage() ''#dispose old image before it becomes unreferenced If AreaBMPExists S_AreaBMP.Dispose() End If AreaBMPExists = True ''#declare an appropriately sized bitmap w/ a GDI Graphics object Dim AreaBMP As Bitmap = New Bitmap(Area.W * TLDIM, Area.H * TLDIM) Dim AreaGrph As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(AreaBMP) ''#...(omitted: iterate through Area and draw each tile to AreaBMP) ''#Store to the SDL surface S_AreaBMP = New SdlDotNet.Graphics.Surface(AreaBMP) ''#Dispose AreaBMP.Dispose() AreaGrph.Dispose() End Sub (AreaBMPExists and S_AreaBMP are global scope) Question: Is this fundamentally sound? It works fine, but I can't help but feel that this sort of thing is discouraged...
