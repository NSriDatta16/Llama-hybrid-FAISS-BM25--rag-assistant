RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) might be a good candidate, as historically it was used as a sort of "average magnitude of error". To calculate it, all errors are first squared (to remove any negative values). Those squared values are averaged (the "mean") and then the square root of that mean is taken. In effect it is similar to a "average magnitude of error". As I understand it, the historical reason that the average magnitude of error was not directly used originally was that "absolute value" was not a differentiable function and as such was an intellectual no-no in the early days - that is, "absolute value" could not be used in the reasoning of calculus. Whatever its origins, RMSE is a widely used and widely understood fit statistic.
