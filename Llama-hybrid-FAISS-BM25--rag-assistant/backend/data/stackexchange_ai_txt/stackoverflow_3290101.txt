Just a little remark from my side. I've been having the same issues with GMail, but somehow it seems to work when I store the file in question on the SD card first and retrieve it from there, rather than from the assets. So my code is the following: Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND); i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "Title"); i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "Content"); i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, uri); i.setType("text/plain"); startActivity(Intent.createChooser(i, "Send mail")); and here, uri = Uri.fromFile(new File(context.getFilesDir(), FILENAME)); does not work, whereas uri = Uri.fromFile(new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), FILENAME)); does.
