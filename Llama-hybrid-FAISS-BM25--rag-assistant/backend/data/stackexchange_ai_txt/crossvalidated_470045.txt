Can I use beta priors in zero inflated poisson model?

Please I have a two fold questions and I am not sure how to phrase the title of my post to capture both. I am trying to fit a regression model in jags, and I am new Bayesian modeling. In my model I have two variables x1 and x2 that are proportions with values between 0 and 1. In addition x2 has some missing values. Below is my code and questions: cat("model{ for(i in 1:N){ y[i] ~ dpois(mu[i]) mu[i] My questions are: is it proper to use beta priors as stated above in this context? is it okay to have a normal prior for beta[1] and beta priors for beta[2] and beta[3]? If I have a variable say x4 with two categories what prior distribution should I use normal or uniform? Thanks for your responses. Edit: The x2[i] ~ dbeta(1,1) is to imput missing values. Edit2: The response variable contains quite a number of zeros which was the reason I opted for the Zero inflated approach.
