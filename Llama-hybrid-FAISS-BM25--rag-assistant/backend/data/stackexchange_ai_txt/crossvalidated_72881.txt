I think Cameron and Trivedi's Microeconometrics fits the bill. It strikes a nice balance between breadth, intuition, and rigor (if you follow up on the references). The target audience is the applied researcher. Not everything is Greene is covered: I: PRELIMINARIES 1. Overview 2. Causal and Noncausal Models 3. Microeconomic Data Structures II: CORE METHODS 4. Linear models 5. ML and NLS estimation 6. GMM and Systems Estimation 7. Hypothesis Tests 8. Specification Tests and Model Selection 9. Semiparametric Methods 10. Numerical Optimization III: SIMULATION-BASED METHODS 11. Bootstrap Methods 12. Simulation-based Methods 13. Bayesian Methods IV: CROSS-SECTION DATA MODELS 14. Binary Outcome Models 15. Multinomial Models 16. Tobit and Selection Models 17. Transition Data: Survival Analysis 18. Mixture Models and Unobserved Heterogeneity 19. Models of Multiple Hazards 20. Count Data Models V: PANEL DATA MODELS 21. Linear Panel Models: Basics 22. Linear Panel Models: Extensions 23. Nonlinear Panel Models VI: FURTHER TOPICS 24. Stratified and Clustered Samples 25. Treatment Evaluation 26. Measurement Error Models 27. Missing Data and Imputation APPENDICES A. Asymptotic Theory B. Making Pseudo-Random Draws Peter Kennedy's Principles of Econometrics book does the same with more emphasis on intuition. The target audience is students of different sorts. All the material is covered at three levels. The first one provides the intuition and the main idea, the second one introduces some very basic notation, and the last one provide references to the more complicated topics. Sadly the 6th edition is the last one. TOC is here .
