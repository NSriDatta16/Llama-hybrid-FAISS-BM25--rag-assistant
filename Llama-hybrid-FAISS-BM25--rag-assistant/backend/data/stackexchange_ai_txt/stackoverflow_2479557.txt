Why is it bad practice to use links with the javascript: "protocol"?

In the 1990s, there was a fashion to put Javascript code directly into href attributes, like this: Press me! And then suddenly I stopped to see it. They were all replaced by things like: Press me! For a link whose sole purpose is to trigger Javascript code, and has no real href target, why is it encouraged to use the onclick property instead of the href property?
