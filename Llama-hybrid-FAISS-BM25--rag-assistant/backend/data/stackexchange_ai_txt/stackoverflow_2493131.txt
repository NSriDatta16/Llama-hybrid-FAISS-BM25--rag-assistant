Which type of design pattern should be used to create an emulator?

I have programmed an emulator, but I have some doubts about how to organizate it properly, because, I see that it has some problems about classes connection (CPU Machine Board). For example: I/O ports, interruptions, communication between two or more CPU, etc. I need for the emulator to has the best performance and good understanding of the code. PD: Sorry for my bad English. EDITED: Asking for multiple patterns.
