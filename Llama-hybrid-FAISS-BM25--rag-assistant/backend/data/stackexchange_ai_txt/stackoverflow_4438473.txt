If you want to create a file in the sdcard , you should check if the sdcard is ready (more info here ), apart from the fact you need this permission in the AndroidManifest.xml Try not use hard-code the path of the sdcard, use instead the API for that. On the other hand, if you want to create a private file on the phone storage you can use this methods: FileOutputStream fos = context.openFileOutput(FILE_NAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
