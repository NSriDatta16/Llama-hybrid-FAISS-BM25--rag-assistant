Differencing not only removed the trend but also created a pattern of integrated moving average of order one, MA(1). Your data was generated as $$ x_t = t + \varepsilon_t $$ where $\varepsilon_t \overset{iid}\sim N(0,1)$. After differencing that becomes $$ \Delta x_t = (t+\varepsilon_t)-(t-1+\varepsilon_{t-1}) = 1 + \varepsilon_t-\varepsilon_{t-1}. $$ As @ChristophHanck correctly notes, the ACF of an MA(1) cuts off after the first lag, while its PACF decays to zero gradually - so the simulated behavior is precisely what was to be expected.
