The covariance matrix $ C $ as well as the Gram / kernel matrix $ \mathbf{K} $ have to be scaled by $ \frac{1}{n} $ with $ n $ being the number of samples in the data, assuming the data is centered: $$ C = \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X} \\ \mathbf{K} = \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{X} \mathbf{X}^T $$ While the covariance matrix does get scaled in sklearn.decomposition.PCA (actually, PCA is computed via the SVD and the eigenvalues result from $ \lambda_i = \frac{S_i^2}{n-1} $ with $ S $ being the singular values), $ \mathbf{K} $ doesn't get scaled in sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA . After scaling the eigenvalues of $ \mathbf{K} $ manually by $ \frac{1}{n - 1} $ , the descrepancy vanishes completely.
