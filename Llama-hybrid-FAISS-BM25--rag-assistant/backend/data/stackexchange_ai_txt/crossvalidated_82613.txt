TSA package features detectIO and detectAO, but (although you haven't stated what you're trying to do, just FYI) the arimax function will only allow you to fit a model, not forecast with it. Robert Hyndman's code in the question linked to by Stat does not identify 'types' of outliers or possible dynamic impact.
