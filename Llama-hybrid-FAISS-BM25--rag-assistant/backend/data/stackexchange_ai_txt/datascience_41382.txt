Practical examples/tutorials of using One-Class Support Vector Machines

I am a newbie in machine learning, and hope to solve an anomaly detection task using One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) . Despite the availability of several general introductions, definitions and academic papers on OCSVM, I do not find tutorials with practical examples except a few provided by scikit-learn . I'd appreciate some pointers to such resources especially with code examples/datasets as this will aid better understanding, than reading academic papers.
