You seem to want strcmp to work like a (hypothetical) int isEqual(const char *, const char *) To be sure that would be true to the "zero is false" interpretation of integer results, but it would complicate the logic of sorting because, having established that the two strings were not the same, you would still need to learn which came "earlier". Moreover, I suspect that a common implementation looks like int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2){ const unsigned char *q1=s1, *q2=s2; while ((*q1 == *q2) && *q1){ ++q1; ++q2; }; return (*q1 - *q2); } which is [ edit: kinda] elegant in a K&R kind of way. The important point here (which is increasingly obscured by getting the code right (evidently I should have left well enough alone)) is the way the return statement: return (*q1 - *q2); which gives the results of the comparison naturally in terms of the character values.
