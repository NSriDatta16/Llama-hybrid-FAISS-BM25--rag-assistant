Can a 2-2-1 feedforward neural network with sigmoid activation functions represent a solution to XOR?

I'v been playing around with back propagation, trying to see if I can find a solution to the XOR problem using a 2-2-1 network. Based on my simulations and calculations, a solution is not possible without implementing a bias for every neuron. Is this correct?
