Logit regression and Poisson relative risk estimators

I am running a logistic regression and have determined that Risk Ratios are better to explain my results than odds ratios. I have a dichotomous variable but I have both categorical and continuous predictor variables. My question is, if I use the Relative risk estimation by Poisson regression with robust error variance which coefficients do I report. The ones from the original logistic regression or the ones produced using the Poisson regression, which I only ran to get the RR. If it's the Poisson coefficients have I changed the regression from a logistic to a Poisson regression? or is it just a genearal linear model used to get the RR? And if so what type of diagnostics do I run. I've never used Poisson regressions before but it seems the only way to get the risk ratio's for both my categorical and continuous variables. I am a little confused.
