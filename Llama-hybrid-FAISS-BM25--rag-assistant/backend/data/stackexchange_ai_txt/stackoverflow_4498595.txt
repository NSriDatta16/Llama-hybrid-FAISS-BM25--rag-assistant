Is it possible that what you load is a bit different - not textArea, or not summary? Just by mistake? Additionally, consider using $.ajax() method: $.ajax({ url: '/addSummary', success: function(response) { $('#summary_form').append(response); summaries = $('textArea.summary'); } }); This way you will not need any temporary storage, but will be able to append obtained html directly to you form. Maybe this will also fix your issue. (I could be a bit wrong with the parameter names or function arguments order, but you have got the main idea, have not you?)
