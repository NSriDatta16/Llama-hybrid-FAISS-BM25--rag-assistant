What is the difference between using an integer representation vs using an ordered factor? Depends on the model. In GLMs for instance, coding as integers makes the assumption that the difference between 1 and 2 is the same as the difference between 3 and 4. If that is true of your data, then using integers is best as you don't need to estimate 5 coefficients. If however that assumption about the differences between levels is not the case, then using the factor representation is best. Are prediction models (rpart, randomforest or similar) considering the ordered characteristic of a factor feature or do they treat them just as a regular unordered factor? Again, depends on the model. Random forests seem to do better for some models when the data are integers. This is completely anecdotal however, and I can't comment on how this generalizes.
