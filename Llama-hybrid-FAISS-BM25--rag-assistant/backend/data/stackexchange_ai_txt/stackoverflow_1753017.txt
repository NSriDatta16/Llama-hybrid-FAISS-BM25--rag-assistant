Hashing or randomizing identifiers or other URL components can be a good practice when you don't want your URLs to be traversable. This is not security, but it will discourage the use (or abuse) of your server resources by crawlers, and can help you to identify when it does happen. In general, you don't want to expose application state, such as which IDs will be allocated in the future, since it may allow an attacker to use a prediction in ways that you didn't forsee. For example, BIND's sequential transaction IDs were a security flaw . If you do want to encourage crawling or other traversal, a more rigorous way would be to provide links, rather than by providing an implementation detail which may change in the future. Using sequential integers as IDs can make many things cheaper on your end, and might be a resonable tradeoff to make.
