Derive the conditional pdf of data on prior parameters

In Bayesian statistics I see this derivation often. Given the likelihood function $f(X|\theta)$ and the prior $f( \theta |a, b)$, the author will derive $f(X|a,b)$. The steps in between are considered trivial but I cannot derive $f(X|a,b)$ myself. Can anyone please provide some hints, perhaps how to "introduce" $\theta$ into $f(X|a,b)$?
