To the best of my knowledge, it turns out there are 3 ways to obtain a BIC-like proxy for $p(x|M)$ when $M$ is a model with correlated data: One can use the previous approximation $-2 \log p(x|M) \approx -2 \log \pi(\hat{\theta} |M) -2 \log p(x|\hat{\theta},M) -k \log (2\pi) + \log(|-D^2 \log p(x|\hat{\theta},M)|)$ and explicitly compute the Hessian $D^2 \log p(x|\hat{\theta},M)$ ; In case this computation is impossible (e.g. if the model is too complicated), a numerical approximation of the Hessian can be obtained through MCMC method, event without an explicit expression for the gradient, see for example Spall, J. C. (2005). Monte Carlo computation of the Fisher information matrix in nonstandard settings. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 14(4), 889-909. Data can be "decorrelated" using for instance a mean-field approach, which allows to use the classical definition of the BIC for IID data.
