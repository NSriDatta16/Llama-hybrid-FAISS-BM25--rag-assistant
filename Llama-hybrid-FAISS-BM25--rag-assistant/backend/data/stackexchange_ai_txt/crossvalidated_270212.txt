You will not be able to show this result (by simulation or otherwise) because it does not hold. When the true AR parameter is unity, the OLS estimator is superconsistent, not inconsistent. See for example the discussion in Hamilton's Time Series Analysis , section "Asymptotic Properties of a First-Order Autoregression when the True Coefficient is Unity" (17.4). What you can illustrate with simulation is this superconsistency. Simply repeat several Monte Carlo simulations of the OLS estimate (I did just 1000), similar to what was done above, but for a range of sample sizes. See plots below: What you should observe is that the sample bias of the OLS estimate gets closer to 0 faster in the nonstationary $\phi=1$ case (although it started out larger) and the variance shrinks to zero faster as well. OLS works just fine in that case. Edit: In the text mentioned above, the following expression is derived in the case where the true coefficient is unity: $$\sqrt{T}\left(\hat{\rho}_T-1\right) \to^P 0$$ Essentially, $\hat{\rho}_T$ (the OLS estimator) converges to 1 much faster than $\sqrt{T}$ goes to infinity. It's typical for consistent estimators to converge at a slower rate, so this behavior is termed "superconsistency".
