When you reuse tools from the standard library, rather than "reinventing the wheel" by coding them yourself from scratch, you're not only getting well-optimized and tuned software (sometimes amazingly so, as often in the case of itertools components): more importantly, you're getting large amounts of functionality that you don't have to test, debug and maintain yourself -- you're leveraging all the testing, debugging and maintenance work of many splendid programmers who contribute to the standard library! The investment in understanding what the standard library offers you therefore repays itself rapidly, and many times over -- and you'll be able to "reproduce from memory" just as well as for reinvented-wheel code, indeed probably better thanks to the higher amount of reuse. By the way, the term "group by" has a well defined, idiomatic meaning for most programmers, thanks to its use in SQL (and the similar use in itertools itself): I would therefore suggest you avoid using it for something completely different -- that's only going to breed confusion any time you're collaborating with anybody else (hopefully often, since the heyday of the solo, "cowboy" programmer is long gone -- another argument in favor of standards and against wheel reinvention;-). Lastly, your docstring doesn't match your functions' signature -- arguments-order error;-).
