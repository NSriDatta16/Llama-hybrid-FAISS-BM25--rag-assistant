The usefulness of the Tanimoto coefficient over the traditional accuracy (i.e. Russell-Rao) is evident in image analysis, when comparing a segmentation to a gold-standard. Consider these two images: In each of these images which are binary 'masks', we have two objects of the same size but placed at slightly different locations, and we want to evaluate to what extent these objects are identical in shape and position by assessing their overlap. Usually one (e.g. the purple mask) is a segmentation (produced by a computer algorithm), e.g. this could be an attempt to locate the heart from a medical image. The other, (e.g. green) is the gold-standard (i.e. the heart, as identified by an expert clinician). Where there is white colour, the two shapes overlap. Black pixels are background. The two images are identical (i.e. the outcome of the segmentation algorithm, as well as the gold standard, are the same in both images), except for a lot of background "padding" in the second image (e.g. this could represent two experiments with two different x-ray machines, where the 2nd machine had a wider ray covering more body area, but otherwise the size of the heart is the same in both image sets). Clearly, since the segmentation and gold standard in both images are identical, if we evaluate the segmentation accuracy against the gold standard, we would like our metric to output the same 'accuracy' result in both experiments. However, if we attempt to assess the quality of the segmentation using the Russel-Rao approach, we would get a misleadingly high accuracy for the right image (close to 100%), because "background pixels identified correctly as background pixels" contribute towards the overall accuracy of the sets, and background pixels are disproportionately represented in the second set. The objects whose overlap we want to evaluate in medical segmentation are often tiny specks in a massive background, so this is not very useful to us. Furthermore, this would lead to problems if we were trying to compare the accuracy of one segmentation algorithm to another, and the two were evaluated on images of different size! (or, equivalently, at different scales). The scaling / size of the embedding image should not make a difference in the evaluation of a segmentation against a gold-standard! . By contrast, the tanimoto coefficient does not care about the background pixels, making it invariant to 'scale'. So as far as the tanimoto coefficient is concerned, the similarity of both these sets will be identical, making it a far more useful similarity metric for us to use to evaluate the quality of a segmentation algorithm.
