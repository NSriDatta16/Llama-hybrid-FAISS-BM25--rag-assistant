If you only know collective past production and not the production of every turbine or even their share of production, you can only forecast the collective production instead of forecasting every turbine and then combining the forecasts. This will most likely lead to less accurate results. If this is the case, you'll have to combine the weather conditions into some sort of average. You could also calculate minimums, maximums or even quantiles of all the weather variables and add them as predictors in addition to the predictors you already have. The latitude and longitude would then be constant and cannot be used as predictors. If you are forecasting the production of a single date, you'll have to aggregate all the variables to daily. Again, you could try different functions but in this case the mean might make most sense.
