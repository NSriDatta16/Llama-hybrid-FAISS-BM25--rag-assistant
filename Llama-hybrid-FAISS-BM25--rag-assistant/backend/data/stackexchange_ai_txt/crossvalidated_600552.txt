You should do some feature engineering, to present the relevant data to your anomaly detection model. In this case it sounds like you have already identified time-of-day and number of events in time period sounds as the relevant features. Then you can use a standard anomaly/outlier detection method, for example IsolationForest or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
