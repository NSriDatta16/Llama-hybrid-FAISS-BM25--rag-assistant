Is it acceptable for a server-based application installer to create a new group?

We're building an application designed to run on Windows-based servers. One of the considerations we're looking into at the moment is how to control access to the application's GUI, which allows configuration and controls the "back end" services. In order to secure the application properly, there are several objects which will need ACLs to be applied - files, directories, Registry keys, named pipes, services etc. We need to provide administrators with some way to configure those ACLs in order to limit access to authorized users only. One approach we have considered is to create a tool which can modify the ACLs on all those objects simultaneously, but that would be a fair chunk of work and could be fragile. The other possible approach we're looking at is to create a custom group (e.g. "My App Users") so we can give that group the appropriate rights to each object. This means that administrators will be able to add/remove authorized users by using familiar Windows group membership tools. So: is creating groups at install time an acceptable thing to do, or is it likely to upset administrators? I'm more familiar with the UNIX world, to be honest, where server-based apps are more or less expected to create groups, but I'm uncertain of the etiquette in the Windows ecosystem. Also: is there a better solution to this that I've missed? Thanks in advance!
