so, I fixed the problem... the reason - my inattention... so, I use fiddler again to analyze my requests/responses... so, 1) go to Default 2)redirect to Login and input login-password 3)the user found in db - FormAuthentication ticket created 4)redirect to Default 5) User became non-authenticated and move back to login page.... so Fiddler shows that on step 3 cookies created and debug shows that the user authenticated. But no cookie passed to Dfeault page. I found that cookies from Login page has "secure" mark. It means that I have requireSSL=true property in webconfig... but requireSSL has value false on default... so, something overwrites it... I found one more config file in folder of top level with requireSSL=true... when I remove top-level config file - everything start work fine... surely standard situation to miss someting... but such interesting effect I see first time - to do authentication and its break during redirect to default page - may be it helps somebody to save his/her time in further... but anyway - thanks the people answer me for the problem :)
