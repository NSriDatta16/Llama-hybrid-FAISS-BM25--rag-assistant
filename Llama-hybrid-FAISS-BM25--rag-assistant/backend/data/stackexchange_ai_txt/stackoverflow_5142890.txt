How can i use fragment project for my plugin?

I have working plugin deployed. Now i need to add catalog contribution to existing plugin for xml validation. I have created fragment plugin for that. Now i need to know How do i publish the fragment? Will there be two separate jar file generated for the plugin and placed at client side? Do i need to take care for something important?
