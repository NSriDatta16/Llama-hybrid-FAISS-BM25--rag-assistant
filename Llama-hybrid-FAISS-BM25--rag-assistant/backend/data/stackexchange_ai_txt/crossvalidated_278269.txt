Multinomial logistic regression vs. Dirichlet regression

I am looking for a tool to carry out regressions on probability vectors given a continuous variable as input (or covariate in statistics words). Typically, this can be done through multinomial logistic regression where the inputs are $x^{(i)} \in \Re^{n}$, and where given a test input $x$, we want our hypothesis to estimate the probability that $P(y = k | x)$ for each value of $k = 1, \ldots, K$. I was wondering if a more compelling approach would be to use Dirichlet regression where (broadly speaking) the Dirichlet distribution concentration parameters $\alpha_i$ are a function of the input variable $x$, and the output is the distribution support $y_1, \ldots, y_K$ where $y_j \in (0,1)$ and $\sum_{j=1}^Ky_j=1$. The "flaw" I can see when using Dirichlet regression is that none of my output variables can have a value of zero or one, in contrast to the multinomial logistic regression. Any advice here? I would really appreciate it!
