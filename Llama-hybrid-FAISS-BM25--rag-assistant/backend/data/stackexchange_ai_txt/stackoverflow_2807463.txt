I resolved this by taking a step back and reevaluating the way I was structuring my data. The end result was that my business entities were too closely coupled to my database schema and didn't reflect the domain I was working in. I redesigned my app. using POCO's to represent my business entities that better reflected my domain and this had the effect of 'flattening' the relational structure in this scenario, so instead of model.Organisation.Name I now have model.OrganisationName.
