What's are the benefits of using Web.config scheduled tasks over for example a Windows scheduled task

We are thinking of ways to get our scheduled tasks centralized as much as possible by dragging a lot of tasks from website specific web.config files to one Windows schedules task. I can imagine that this has some negative consequences, but I want to list them so I can make myself a good explanation of what will work best. We have different types of task that have to be done periodically like for example: Keepalive Imports in different websites we run Sitecore has it's own scheduler and that makes imports very easy to run by just using this scheduler. On the other side, Sitecore also has it's own "KeepAlive" setting in the web.config that makes sure the website runs faster. What will be the pro's and the con's on this issue and what will you advice? Keep the scheduled tasks centralized? Split the normal imports from the Keepalive tasks and put one of them in a centralized environment?
