buttons ontop of everything in android

I am currently working on a calculator application for android. I am finding it difficult to conveniently take a screen shot of the app. So i have put my calculator on pause so I can write a simple screen shot app. It runs in the notification bar and when you click the notification the notification bar slides away and a few seconds later a snapshot is taken. This works perfectly. Now I would like to add functionality to take snapshots even for full screen apps. I have seen apps that put a sliding drawer on the screen onto of whatever app is running. That is there is always a button on the screen no matter what you are doing that when you click/drag it that sliding drawer came out. How did they do that? It should be a simple process to use a button instead of a drawer and when it's clicked hide it, snapshot and unhide it. So my question bsically is How can i put a usable button on the screen that stays above whatever app is running, even the homescreen
