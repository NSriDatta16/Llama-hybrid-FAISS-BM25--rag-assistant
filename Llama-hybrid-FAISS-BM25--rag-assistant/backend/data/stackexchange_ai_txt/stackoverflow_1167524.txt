I use the "R" command with the standard R.app GUI download, and would recommend using that instead of macports. After running the installer, I see: $ which R /usr/local/bin/R $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/R lrwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 47 Nov 12 2008 /usr/local/bin/R -> /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R $ R R version 2.8.0 (2008-10-20) ... > I actually prefer to use this rather than the GUI, because it uses the current working directory for the workspace and history files (.Rhistory and .RData). It makes it easier to organize projects in this way by filesystem directory, and is very natural if you're using the commandline for other tasks as well (like running data preprocessing scripts). Also, the terminal version lets you more easily cancel an expensive computation by pressing Ctrl-C. The GUI sometimes locks up during these. By default, I think Mac terminal R uses the X11 display system, which isn't as good as the Quartz one used by the GUI. You can change this though: get the CarbonEL package, then put the following into your ~/.Rprofile : goquartz = function() { library("CarbonEL") options(device='quartz') Sys.unsetenv("DISPLAY") } if (.Platform$GUI == "X11") { # this means we're running in the terminal (not GUI) version. # if you actually want the X11 display, comment out the following line goquartz() }
