Prediction Interval for log-tranformed data

I am doing a linear regression on log-transformed data and I use the bayesian approach to model the predictive distribution and construct my 90% prediction Interval. The problem with this approach is that my confidence interval are very large because of the exponential transformation. for an aleatoric standard deviation of 5% on my data set, the relative prediction interval width is of the order of 1.5 which is very large. I think that the exponential transformation of the irreducible noise is making my confidence interval very large and not fitted to the data and I was wondering if there is any other approaches to attack this problem instead of the bayesian approach on the log-transformed data: Any solutions to obtain smaller prediction intervals ?
