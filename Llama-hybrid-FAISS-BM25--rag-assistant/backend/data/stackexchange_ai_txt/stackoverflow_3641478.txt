Changing click to skip gallery to sliding photo gallery?

i just bought a joomla template from template monster. there is photo gallery on home page which skips to photos by clicking onto them. what i need is a self sliding photo gallery you know what i mean automatically skipping photos in preset interval. http://www.mirelmuhendislik.com/home-tr/index.php this is the homepage. i tried to do it by function clicker() { document.getElementById('photo2').click(); } setInterval("clicker()",5000); but it didnt work. i dunno why it didnt work is it because of javascript embedding options of joomla or is it because my javascript code?? and how can i solve this problem? i'd be glad to see some suggestions please help :/
