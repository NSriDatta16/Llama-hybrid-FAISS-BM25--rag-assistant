Tipically, having all features from the same nature is very rare. You mostly have various and very different categories of data. Take for instance patient data. It usually consists of age, weight, height, and various lab results or other diagnostics - all very different from each other. The machine learning algorithms aren't picky about the nature of each feature (attribute). They just look at the raw values and try to find some patterns or infer some knowledge/rules from them. When using generic machine learning algorithms, they usually don't even understand the meaning of the attribute. You can look at some sample datasets at the UCI repository to get an idea of how this is done in practice. It would also help if you would say more about your problem and the possible features you could use.
