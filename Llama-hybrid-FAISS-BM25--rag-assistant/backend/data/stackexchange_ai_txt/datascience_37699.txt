Text topic classification in tensorflow

I want to create a CNN in tensorflow that does the following: Classify a recipe headline and find out the topic. For instance super yummy cheesy cake should result in cheese cake and so on. I thought for going with tensorflow , but need some help in getting things started. My strategy is like that: Normalize the headlines so cheesy becomes cheese and cheesecake becomes cheese cake for instance and so on. Having a dataset like: super yummy cheesecake | cheese cake summer strawberry cake | strawberry cake Train the model to learn what matters for the topic and what is just additional information. The way, the dataset is modeled, I have no static lables, as I understand. This makes things complicated, right? As this is my first AI experiment with tensorflow , I don't really know if this will work out, or if I should go with another strategy, therefore I need your help.
