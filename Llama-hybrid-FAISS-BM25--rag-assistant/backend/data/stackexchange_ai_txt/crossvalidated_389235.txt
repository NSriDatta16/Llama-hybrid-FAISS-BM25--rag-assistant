Per the title, certainly discrete series can be nonstationary. The total count of events in a Poisson process is one example - let $N_t$ be the number of events by time $t$ and consider the time series formed by looking at $N_t$ at integer times: $N_1$ , $N_2$ , $N_3$ ,... We have that $E(N_t)=\lambda t$ , $\text{Var}(N_t)=\lambda t$ ; so the above time series is not even weakly stationary. But is there such thing as a time series that might start out with balanced mix of class 0 and class 1, but eventually turn into mostly class 1's? Sure, you could readily construct a binary time series process that was non-stationary. Let's make an example. Let $Y_t$ be the random binary value at time $t$ ( $t=1,2,...$ ). Let $S_t$ bet the number of $1$ 's observed up to time $t$ ; i.e. $S_0=0,S_t=\sum_{i=1}^t Y_i\,,\: t = 1,2,...$ . Now make $p_{t+1}=P(Y_{t+1}=1|S_t)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\alpha S_t)}$ for some $\alpha>0$ . So $p_1=0.5$ . It will remain at $0.5$ until you observe a $1$ , at which point $p$ increases. e.g. if $\alpha=0.3$ , then after the first $1$ is observed, $p$ increases to about $0.574$ whereas if $\alpha=0.1$ , $p$ only increases to about $0.525$ . (There are many other ways to make nonstationary binary series) Here's an example using the above scheme with $\alpha=0.005$ , for the first 1000 observations. You can see that it starts out with a similar density of 0 and 1 values but the 1-strip rapidly starts to get heavier and the 0-strip gets lighter and lighter, until near the end the 0's have become quite rare. The conditional probability of a 1 for the last observation ( $y_{1000}$ ) was about 0.979.
