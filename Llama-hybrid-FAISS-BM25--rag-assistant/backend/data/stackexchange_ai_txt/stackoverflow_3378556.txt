Changing node ids from mysql.. is it possible?

Can I change node ids (nid) in mysql tables in order to update the IDs of the nodes in Drupal ? In other terms, if I change the nid (paying attention to keep they unique for each node) in the 'node' table, directly from phpmyadmin, am I going to introduce bugs ? thanks
