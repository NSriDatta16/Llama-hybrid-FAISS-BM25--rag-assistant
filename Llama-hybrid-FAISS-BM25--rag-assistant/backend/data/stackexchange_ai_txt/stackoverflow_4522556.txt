Getting error #2032 when calling WCF Service even though call succeeds

We are developing an application using Adobe Air from the client gui with a mix of WCF and REST on the backend. One of the requirements of this application is that it must work offline. So, when the user clicks save, the application stores it in a local sqlite database. Every 15 seconds, the application checks if it is online, and if so, sends any pending requests out. Then if the call succeeds it updates the local database so it won't try to send that case out again. For this particular operation - OpenMedicalCase, the app sends out the request and can't decode the response. I am verifying that the WCF side of things is working correctly. The response message is well formed. The network monitor in flashbuilder says I am receiving 100 Continue: POST /services/medicalcase.svc HTTP/1.1 Referer: app:/AWC_MRDS.swf Accept: text/xml, application/xml, application/xhtml+xml, text/html;q=0.9, text/plain;q=0.8, text/css, image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif;q=0.8, application/x-shockwave-flash, video/mp4;q=0.9, flv-application/octet-stream;q=0.8, video/x-flv;q=0.7, audio/mp4, application/futuresplash, / ;q=0.5 x-flash-version: 10,1,53,64 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 SOAPAction: "http://tempuri.org/IMedicalCaseService/OpenMedicalCase" Content-Length: 8534 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) AdobeAIR/2.0.2 Host: localhost:11934 Cookie: RememberMe=1147670691^1#3435272784175716681 HTTP/1.1 100 Continue Server: ASP.NET Development Server/10.0.0.0 Date: Thu, 23 Dec 2010 21:23:49 GMT Content-Length: 0 Calls to other operations at the same endpoint are returning 200 OK like expected. So what ends up happening is that flex thinks the call did not succeed and sends it over and over again. AFAIK flex is not sending Expect: 100-Continue in the headers either. Update: I attached debuggers to the wcf service AND the gui, setting a breakpoint right before the server sends a response. Flex receives 100 Continue before the service code returns anything. Please note that I am only testing this using the ASP.NET development server. Is there some property or configuration option I need to change on the flex side? WCF?
