Tcl had event driven I/O from the 1990's (if I'm not mistaken). Certainly before 2000 because it was when tclhttpd beat Apache in benchmark tests sometime in 2000 that people really started paying attention to non-blocking I/O. When people saw that, they started re-writing web servers. One of the early result of that was Lighttpd: one of the first non-blocking web servers written in C. At that time, using event-driven I/O in tcl via the fileevent command was already considered standard practice in the tcl world. AOLserver had (and still does) have a tcl core and it's hosting one of the busiest sites on the web (at least in the early days): http://www.aol.com/ . Though the server itself is written in C, it uses tcl's C API to implement event handling and I/O. The reason AOLserver used tcl's I/O subsystem is because it uses tcl as a scripting language and the developers thought that since someone else have written it then might as well use it. I believe AOLserver was first released in 1995. That should confirm that event-driven I/O was already available in tcl back in the mid 1990s. Tcl is one of the earliest, if not the earliest language to have an event-driven engine built it. The event subsystem was originally implemented for the Tk library and was later merged into tcl itself.
