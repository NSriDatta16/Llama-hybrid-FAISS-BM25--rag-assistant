I think you can do this using a pre-commit hook in your repository. Edit To the people who think this a bad idea (I'm not saying it isn't): It's not uncommon for organizations to enforce a specific code style or code formatting. Sometimes these rules can be quite pedantic and strictly enforced, and although they are usually human actions involved in this (i.e. formatting to the correct style before you commit anything to the repository), automating the process can sometimes be useful. An alternative approach might be to do the verification automatically before the commit, but still allow the commit even if the check fails, but then only send an e-mail or some other notification to indicate that someone didn't follow the style.
