Searching for the correct approach

I'm writing my Bachelor Thesis within the field of neural networks and I need some preparation of the data I'm using. Do you have an idea how I am able to identify the four levels in this graph via machine learning? Especially changing points are of importance for me. In this case it would be the x-values roundabout 2700, 3700 and 4700. I already thought of Clustering, but since I'm interested of the different levels, this does not quite work out. Thankyou, Lukas
