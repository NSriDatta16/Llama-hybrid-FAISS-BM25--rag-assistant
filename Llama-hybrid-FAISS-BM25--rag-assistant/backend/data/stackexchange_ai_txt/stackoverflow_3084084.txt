ASP.Net Outputcache programmatically not working in partial view

The following code is not working in a partial view. 0) { Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.ServerAndPrivate); } else { Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); } %> Can anyone tell me why? The partial view is never cached and there is no apparent reason. Should I write code to activate the cache? How?
