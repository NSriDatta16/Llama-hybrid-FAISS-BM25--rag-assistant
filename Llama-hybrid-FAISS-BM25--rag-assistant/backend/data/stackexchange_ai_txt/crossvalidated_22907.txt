At first I thought I'd lean to your second option too. It seems a slightly more orderly approach to the data and makes the most of the fact that subjects may have several pairs of close events. However, the argument for the first option would be that it better represents your research question, which as I understand it is about the characteristics of subjects that lead to them experiencing events in close succession. A natural way of going about this is to identify the subjects who experience such an issue and look at their characteristics - which is your option 1. An extension of option 1 would be to actually produce a count for each subject "how many times has this subject experienced a second event close after a first event?". This count variable would then be the response in a generalized linear model with a poisson response. Once I'd thought of this, I decided I prefer option 1. If you go for option 2, whether you can collapse your outcomes 2 and 3 together depends a bit on your research question and the underlying theory you want to test. How arbitrary is the three days limit for example? If you don't collapse them however you don't want a multinomial logit model, you want ordinal logistic regression. A multinomial model would be if you have three outcomes with no real ordering to them - in your case, clearly there is a natural order between "another event within three days", "another event before observations finished" and "no other event". One argument in favour of collapsing your outcomes 2 and 3 will be that if you don't you have a problem similar to many survival studies. That is, the chances of getting the second outcome rather than the third depend on how late in the study the first event happened, purely due to the fact that you observe the post-event environments earlier in the experiment for a longer time. Collapsing outcomes 2 and 3 fixes that problem at least. To control for subjects under option 2 you must introduce a level of randomness for subject. Otherwise you certainly stuff up your research question (and would be better off with option 1). You can do this with a generalized linear mixed effects model, for which there are implementations in various software applications.
