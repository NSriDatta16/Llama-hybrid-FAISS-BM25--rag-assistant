The actual problem is that a linear regression forcing the intercept=0 is a mathematical inconsistency that should never be done: It is clear that if y=a+bx, then average(y)=a+average(x), and indeed we can easily realize that when we estimate a and b using linear estimation in Excel, we obtain the above relation However, if we make arbitrarily a=0, then necessarily b=average(y)/average(x). But this is inconsistent with the minumum squares algorithm. Indeed, you can easily realize that when you estimate b using linear estimation in excel the above relation is not satisfied
