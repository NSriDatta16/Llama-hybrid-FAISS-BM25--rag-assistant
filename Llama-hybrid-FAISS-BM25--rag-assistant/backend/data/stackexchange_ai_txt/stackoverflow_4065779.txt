An elegant, pythonic, always-working way is this: def powers(x): """yield powers of x, starting from x**0 forever""" power = 1 while True: yield power power *= x def bools_to_int(bools): # in Python 2, use itertools.izip! return sum(int(place) * place_weight for place_weight, place in zip(powers(2), bools)) Note that you can get rid of powers (by enumerate and squaring in the comprehension, as other answers do) - but maybe it's clearer this way.
