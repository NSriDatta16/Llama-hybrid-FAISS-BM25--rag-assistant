A very simple solution would be to consider the measurements after each molt as separate features. So, for each insect you would have a vector like: $$ [head_{molt1}, length_{molt1}, head_{molt2}, length_{molt2}, ...] $$ You can also add the number of days between molts, and maybe some more data. Then you can use any standard clustering/classification algorithm. The problem with this is that it assumes that each insect has the same number of molts, which is unlikely, I suppose. How to fix this? The simplest approach would be to use the minimum number of molts that each insect has. For those insects with more molts, you simple discard the latest molts. Another approach would be to use the average number of molts. If an insect has fewer molts, you have some missing data, that you could fix using the average value for that feature, for example. Or infer the value with linear regression. By the way, if you want an algorithm to distinguish the 3 species, a supervised algorithm will very likely perform better than any clustering method, which are unsupervised. One of the simplest would be logistic regression, which will also tell you which features are important.
