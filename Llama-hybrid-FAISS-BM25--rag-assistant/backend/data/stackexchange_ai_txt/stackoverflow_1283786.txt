Well, obviously you have to predict how many children (or simply total load) each process will have on average. Than you can use classic assignment algorithms, they're usually quite simple. The most important issue is of course to decide what you want to minimize. Usually we want to minimize lateness (how much "behind schedule" we get), but not always... Edit: If you know all children/parents in advance, and children of a process must be in the same machine, you can consider a process and all its children to be the same process to begin with. Then you can use a very simple algorithm to minimize whatever you want to minimize. Edit #2: Read about Job Scheduling to get a better idea
