Standardizing the residuals allows you to view them on the standard scale, which can make outlier detection easier. For example, any |residual|>2 implies that your observed value is quite far from your prediction (over 2 standard deviations from your average error). In other words, it helps you to put them on a scale of units (standard deviations) you understand, and it may simplify the detection of extreme cases.
