Leverage browser caching

I have a website and when I check page speed with Google plug-in, I receive: Leverage browser caching The following resources are missing a cache expiration Searching only returns information on using htaccess under Apache, but my site is running on Windows 2003 Server, in plain HTML language, and I don't even have access to the server. Is there any way to specify expiration and gzip compression, as it recommends?
