Increasing MySql Innodb Row length to avoid Error 139

I'm creating a table in MySql (Innodb engine) with more than 15 TEXT datatype columns. After table creation, I'm trying to insert a row in to this table with more than 500 characters in all the columns. While doing so, mysql returns the following error, [Error Code: 1030, SQL State: HY000] Got error 139 from storage engine Upon searching, I found that there is a row length limitation of 8000 bytes in mysql. I wanted to know if this limit can be configured (by a parameter or even compiling the code) to the desired level. I see some links talking about innodb plugin where this is resolved but I couldn't get a clear idea on that. I'm trying this in windows. Any help on this is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Ashok.
