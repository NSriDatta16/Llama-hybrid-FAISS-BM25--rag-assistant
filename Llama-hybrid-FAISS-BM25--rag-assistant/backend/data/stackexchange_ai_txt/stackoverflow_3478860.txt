Rotation about a given point

I have a point, let's say p(0.0, 0.0, 20.0) which I want to rotate about point a(0.0, 0.0, 10.0) in XZ plane. What is the simplest way to do it? I am using Qt with QVector3D and QMatrix4x4 to perform transformations. Everything I can think of is something like that: QVector3D p(0.0, 0.0, 20.0); QVector3D a(0.0, 0.0, 10.0); QMatrix4x4 m; m.translate(-a.x(), -a.y(), -a.z()); p = m*p; m.setToIdentity(); m.rotate(180, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0); p = m*p; m.setToIdentity(); m.translate(a.x(), a.y(), a.z()); p = m*p; But it seems conspiciously complex to me and I wonder if there are any simpler or more elegant solutions?
