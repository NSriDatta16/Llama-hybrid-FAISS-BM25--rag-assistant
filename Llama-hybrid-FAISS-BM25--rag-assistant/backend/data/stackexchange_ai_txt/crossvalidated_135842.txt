Similarly to the previous answers, most of the following answer of mine is not specific to SAS, as I use R. However, there is one exception to that - please see below. It seems that there exist substantial research efforts towards development of clustering algorithms for mixed data . More specifically, some algorithms were developed and/or adapted with a focus on categorical data . In particular, some adaptations of traditional k-means clustering approach include k-modes , fuzzy k-modes , k-histograms and k-populations (for example, see this paper ). Other solutions to the problem include hierarchical clustering , including ROCK , CACTUS and others. Probability-based clustering approaches for categorical data include already mentioned Two-Step cluster analysis procedure (seems to be SPSS-specific). Recently some other streams of research, related to the topic, have appeared. They include using such approaches, as neural networks and genetic algorithms (for examples, comparisons and references, see this paper and this paper), information theory (for example, see this paper and this paper ). An interest to the model-based clustering , specifically based on latent class analysis , is also growing (for example, see this paper and this paper - latent tree models - seems to be a mix of latent-based and hierarchical approaches). Speaking of latent class analysis (LCA) , finally, I would like to share the promised SAS-specific relevant information. This paper describes a LCA-based approach, called latent class clustering , and its implementation, using a free SAS add-in , which is available for download on this page .
