I am not sure if I have correctly understood the Occam's Razor principle or not. Let's first address Occam's razor: Occam's razor [..] states that "simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones." - Wiki Next, let's address your answer: Because as per Occam's Razor, choose the simpler classifier which does a decent job rather than the complex one. This is correct because, in machine learning, overfitting is a problem. If you choose a more complex model, you are more likely to classify the test data and not the actual behavior of your problem. This means that, when you use your complex classifier to make predictions on new data, it is more likely to be worse than the simple classifier.
