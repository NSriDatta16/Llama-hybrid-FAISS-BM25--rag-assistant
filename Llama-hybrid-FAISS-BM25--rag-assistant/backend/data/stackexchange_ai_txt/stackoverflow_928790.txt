Normally if I want to capture data from a spreadsheet in textual form I use CSV (which Excel can read and write). It's easy to generate and parse as well as being compatible with many other tools but it doesn't rank high on the "human readable" chart. It can be read but it's awkward for anything but simple files with equal field widths. XML is an option, but YAML is easier to read. Being human-readable is one of the design goals of YAML. The YAML::Tiny module is a nice and lightweight module for typical cases. It looks like what you have in mind is a plain text table, or possibly a tabular format with fixed with columns. There are some modules on CPAN that might be useful: Text::Table , Text::SimpleTable , others ... These modules can generate a representation that's easy to read but parsing it will be harder. (They're intended for data presentation, not storage and retrieval.) You'd probably have to build your own parser.
