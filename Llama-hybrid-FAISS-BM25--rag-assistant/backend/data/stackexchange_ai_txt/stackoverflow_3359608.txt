Looking for an elegant and efficient C++ matrix library

Greetings, googling for that subject brings, e.g., MTL , exmat , LAPACK and also here . I also seem to remember that Microsoft Research released one, but can't put my hands on it. I look for advice from someone who actually used (or developed...) one of those, hoping to achieve a Matlab experience inside C++ (as much as possible). Thanks in advance, Robi
