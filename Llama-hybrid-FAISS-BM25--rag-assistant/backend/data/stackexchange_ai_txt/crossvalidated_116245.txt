Disadvantages of Neural network method

I want to list the advantages and disadvantages of Neural network methods for classification or estimation purposes. I have already found the advantages of NN method in many papers. But they didn't write anything special about disadvantages of NN method as it was their own proposed method ;) . I guess they have some disadvantages too. For example as we know the performance of NN method is based on some settings, like number of hidden layers nodes for MLP neural network, Also there is no analytical method to fine-tune these settings except trial and error. Am I right? If yes, Do you guys have some references about this disadvantage? Please give some strong references(Books or papers). Please also do tell if there are other disadvantages exist and provide some references for them.
