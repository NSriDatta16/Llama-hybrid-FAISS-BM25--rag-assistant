System.ComponentModel.Component in Visual Studio 2008

I'm maintaining a .Net 2.0 application using Visual Studio 2008. When the application was built, it was originally in Visual Studio 2003 and made use of the System.ComponentModel.Component class for data access. You can drag and drop commands, connections, etc onto the designer surface of the component. In 2008, the data access classes don't "stick" to the component. I.e., the code for the command does not get generated in the class. when did this change? 2005? is there a replacement for this behavior, perhaps using the db pro edition? Thanks.
