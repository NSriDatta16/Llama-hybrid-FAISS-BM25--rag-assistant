ICA - independence of coefficients and maximizing independence

Hopefully this isn't too silly a question but I'm wondering how in independent component analysis when we've got independent coefficients then we identify parts of a face such as eyes, mouth, nose, etc. What exactly does the independence of the coefficients have to do with this? Isn't it more to do with the independence of the proposed feature vectors? Also, is the primary difference in PCA and ICA that PCA aims to maximize the variance of it's projections which is given by the directions provided by the eigendecomposition of its covariance matrix and ICA aims to maximize the independence of its feature vectors? But since the the covariance matrix is a symmetrical matrix, aren't all the eigenvectors independent anyway? How exactly does ICA maximize independence in a way that makes them more independent than the orthogonal basis vectors produced by PCA? Thanks
