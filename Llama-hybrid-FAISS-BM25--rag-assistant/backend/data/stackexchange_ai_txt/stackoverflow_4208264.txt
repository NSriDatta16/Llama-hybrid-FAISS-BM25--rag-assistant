Looking for a sample C++ program for learning how to start up a project

I've learned the most basic of C++ but I feel like I don't know how to organise the code and start up a C++ project. I've searched for guides about project/code organization without very much luck. So I want to find a litle well-coded real program to see how is it organised, but I find nothing. Do anyone know a real well-organised program in C++? Preferably open source, terminal based and unix-only. Thanks.
