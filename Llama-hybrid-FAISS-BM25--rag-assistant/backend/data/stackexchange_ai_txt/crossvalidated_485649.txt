I think ideally you create a different model for each type of user since it is likely that each type will display different characteristics. A model tailored for that type of user would therefore likely perform better than a generalized model of similar architecture and size. However, there are some key considerations if you want to do so. Size of Dataset: Training a neural network requires a lot of data, it is very possible that after you split the data into different types of users, you wouldn't have enough data to train, validate, and test for every type. Time and Resources: Training a neural network takes time, effort, and resources. Training and tuning a new model for every type of user may be too expensive depending on the size of your LSTM. If every model performs only marginally better than a generalized model of slightly larger complexity, it may not be worth the cost. From my experience, most people simply add the user's type as a feature and train a generalized model. This is because unless types of users display wildly different characteristics it is not worth the cost of training multiple models for the marginal amount of increase in performance. If you only have, say, two or three different types of users and have a large enough dataset, it may not hurt to try out building multiple models to see how they fare against a generalized model.
