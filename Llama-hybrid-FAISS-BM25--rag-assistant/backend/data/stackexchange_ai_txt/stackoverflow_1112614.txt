Struts Tags and Expression Language

I am having a problem using expression language and struts tags together in a struts2 project. The following code snippet from a jsp file illustrates my problem. The fruits object is passed by a servlet. I know that the error is not from the servlet because when I comment out the form code, it correctly prints out each fruit. This doesn't work, and the following error is returned: "According to TLD or attribute directive in tag file, attribute label does not accept any expressions". What I'm wondering is, is there a way to do this in a similar elegant fashion that doesn't require expression language? I really want to use the struts tags for my jsp page. I've also tried with %{fruit} with no luck.
