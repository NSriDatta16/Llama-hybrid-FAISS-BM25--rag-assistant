Aside from very small projects on very small CPUs, I would not set out to ever program an entire project in assembly. However, it is common to find that a performance bottleneck can be relieved with the strategic hand coding of some inner loops. In some cases, all that is really required is to replace some language construct with an instruction that the optimizer cannot be expected to figure out how to use. A typical example is in DSP applications where vector operations and multiply-accumulate operations are difficult for an optimizer to discover, but easy to hand code. For example certain models of the SH4 contain 4x4 matrix and 4 vector instructions. I saw a huge performance improvement in a color correction algorithm by replacing equivalent C operations on a 3x3 matrix with the appropriate instructions, at the tiny cost of enlarging the correction matrix to 4x4 to match the hardware assumption. That was achieved by writing no more than a dozen lines of assembly, and carrying matching adjustments to the related data types and storage into a handful of places in the surrounding C code.
