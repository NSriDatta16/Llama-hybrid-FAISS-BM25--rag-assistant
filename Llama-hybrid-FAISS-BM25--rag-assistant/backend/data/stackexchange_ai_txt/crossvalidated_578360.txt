How to deal with compass variables (quasi-continuous) in time series modeling?

When analyzing trajectories of airplanes or ships, one often has to deal with sensor variables like "course", which indicates the direction of travel. The course variable exists on [0,360] and is quasi continuous in the following sense. If an object has a course of 359 degrees and then tilts a bit to the right by 2 degrees, the new course value will be 1 degree. That is, changes that cross the interval limit result in values at the other end of the interval. Similarly, if the course is 5 degrees and a course change of -15 degrees is made, the new course will be 350 degrees. My question is if there are any good ways to recast the variable such that a prediction model for example does not have to deal with these jumps? Is it sensible to recast the variables as "course_change", e.g., [+2, -15, ...]? If so, do we loose information on the direction of travel and can one account for that? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_(navigation)
