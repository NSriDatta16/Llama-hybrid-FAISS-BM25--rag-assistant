I usually go by the concept of a ViewModelLocator. The ViewModelLocator is a StaticResource in App.xaml. The ViewModelLocator uses leverages IoC for Dependecy injection (Ninject/Unity/...) and it is possible to define a scope in the DI for the Livetime of your ViewModel... There are also some blogposts out there which work with MEF and the ViewModelLocator Concept...
