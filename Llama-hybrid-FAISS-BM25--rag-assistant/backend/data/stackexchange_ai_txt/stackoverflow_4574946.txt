With :before and :after you specify which content should be inserted before (or after) the content inside of that element. input elements have no content. E.g. if you write Test (which is wrong) the browser will correct this and put the text after the input element. The only thing you could do is to wrap every input element in a span or div and apply the CSS on these. See the examples in the specification : For example, the following document fragment and style sheet: Header h2 { display: run-in; } Text p:before { display: block; content: 'Some'; } ...would render in exactly the same way as the following document fragment and style sheet: Header h2 { display: run-in; } Some Text span { display: block } This is the same reason why it does not work for , , etc. ( seems to be special).
