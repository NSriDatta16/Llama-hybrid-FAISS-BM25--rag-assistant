How add cutom header in WCF with dynamic user values to every call?

I am consuming one java webservice with WCF client. I want to pass user related information to service in header. I have aleady gone to through thread How to add a custom header to every WCF calls? I have implemented IClientMessageInspector interface with BeforeSendRequest () method. Now, I want to pass user related information in SOAP header like Oraganization, which may differ for every user. I have all this information in my ASP.net application, which uses this service. Is there anyway I can pass user related information to this BeforeSendRequest () method from asp.net session and build Message header before sending any request?
