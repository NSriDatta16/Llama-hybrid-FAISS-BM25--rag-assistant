What loss function should I use for auto encoders for text

I'm trying to implement an autoencoder for text. But I don't know which loss function I should use ? I tried using the mse but I get a huge loss 1063442. I'm trying to build a very simple autoencoder using only LSTM layers in Keras. On the keras-blog they use binary-crossentropy but I think the reason for this is because they use black and white images. Thanks
