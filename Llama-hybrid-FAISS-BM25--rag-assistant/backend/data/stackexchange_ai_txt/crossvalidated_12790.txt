What's the appropriate spss test?

Context I have 25 men and 25 women as participants, and they did exactly the same thing: Each of them heard an attractive dialogue and they had to choose between a photo of a woman in red and a woman in green. Then each of them heard an unattractive dialogue and they chose again between the red and the green shirt. My hypothesis is that men are attracted to women in red in contrast to women. So, I 've got gender (2levels:0=male, 1=female), attraction (1=yes, 0=no) and trials/colour (0=green, 1=red) I am interested in showing that the colour (red) predicts attraction as far as men are concerned and that there are gender differences! Men are much more attracted to it. Questions Should I use a test which combine all of them or a test that combine first the attraction and colour for men, then the attraction and colour for women and then the gender differences? I've been told to run a pearson's correlation (one for men and one for women) but I think that it demands interval data.I was also told to use the chi- square test but it's not for participants who parrticipated in the same experimental conditions. What about repeated measures logistic regression? If so, can you give me some advice how to process my data? Any suggestions? P.S. I really appreciate everyone who answered my previous posts here and here , they helped me to go one step further!
