It is impossible to even begin to interpret these data without knowing the natural history of the disease. As Placidia mentioned, if the disease is self-limiting (like a common cold), then these results are meaningless. The second treatment, whatever it is (even placebo), will seem to be effective. In contrast, if the disease is relentlessly progressive, these are impressive results that encourage you to set up a proper study. It seems to me that this kind of study is worth doing to get a sense of whether the new drug works, as a prelude to a proper controlled study. I doubt that any kind of statistical analysis will prove useful.
