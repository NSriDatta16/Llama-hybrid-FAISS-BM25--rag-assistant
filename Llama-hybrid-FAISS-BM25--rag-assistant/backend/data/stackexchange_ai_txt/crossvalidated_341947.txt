Time series forecasting: exponential smoothing, MA, or regression for future observations

Given a set of time series data from 0 to t as $x_t$, we would like to predict time series for t+1 and, say, t+2, using trend $m_{t+1}, ...$ Now, exponential smoothing trend is defined as: $m_{t+1} = \alpha x_{t+1} + (1-\alpha)m_{t}$ (this is from Brockwell chapter 1). Where am I supposed to get the observation $x_{t+1}$ to calculate $m_{t+1}$ if $x_t$ is the last observation? The same problem goes with moving average trend estimation, but there even more points to the right from the last observation $t$ are needed depending on the window size. Now, as for regression, it can fit pretty nice. But how about the rule that " Regression should never be used for prediction outside of the interval of observation " (from my former stats course)? In time series the observations to predict $x_{t+1}, x_{t+2}$ are always outside of the interval on which the regression was fit ($x_0, ..., x_t$)!
