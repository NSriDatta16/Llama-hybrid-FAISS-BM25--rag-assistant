Triggering event handler attached to it's own object, but inside a chain?

Right now I have: $("#myElement").bind("buildTimeline", function (event, newViewObj) { curDomObj = $(this).children(".timeline"); //this refers to #myElement curDomObj.draggable({ axis:"x", drag:curDomObj.trigger("drag") }); }); I'd much rather just have one chain, but is there a way to refer to the current element at your position in the chain?: $(this).children(".timeline").draggable({ axis:"x", drag:$(this).trigger("drag") //this still refers to #myElement, but I want //it to refer to #myElement .timeline });
