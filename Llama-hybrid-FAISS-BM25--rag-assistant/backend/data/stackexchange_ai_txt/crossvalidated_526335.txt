In general, a GARCH model can be written as: \begin{align} r_t&=\mu_t+\epsilon_t \\ \epsilon_t &=\sigma_t z_t \, ,z_t \overset{iid}{\sim}(0,1) \end{align} Where $\mu_t=E(r_t\vert {\cal F}_{t-1})$ is the expected value of $r_t$ given the information set ${\cal F}_{t-1}$ and $\epsilon_t$ is the error term. $\mu_t$ is often called the mean equation, since dynamics in the mean of the time series are modeled by $\mu_t$ . Dependence in the second moments are modeled by using the variance equation, i.e. the functional form of $\sigma_t^2$ since $Var(r_t \vert {\cal F}_{t-1})=\sigma_t^2$ . Depending on the functional form of $\mu_t$ and $\sigma_t^2$ and also the distribution assumption for $z_t$ , you get a different model. However, your mean equation is known and you want to use a GARCH(1,1)-model for the variance equation, so you have the model: \begin{align} IR_t&=c+IR_{t-1}+\epsilon_t \\ \epsilon_t&=\sigma_t z_t \\ \sigma_t^2&=\alpha_0+\alpha_1\epsilon_{t-1}^2+\beta_1\sigma_{t-1}^2 \end{align} So the only thing you need to specify in this case is the distribution of $z_t$ . Standard assumptions are the standard normal distribution or standardized t- distribution. Now you can estimate your model via ML. A quick example using rugarch package in R: library(rugarch) #Specify GARCH(1,1)-model with normal innovations Model
