While you can use a repeated measures ANOVA, I would recommend conducting an ANCOVA, as advocated by Vickers & Altman (2001) . This analysis adjusts the changes from baseline to follow-up for the baseline measurements. Specifically, this is a multiple regression with the follow-up measurements as dependent and the baseline measurements, dummy variables for the groups and other variables you want to adjust for as independent variables. Here is a simulated dataset in SPSS. The data have to be in the wide-format, as shown here: ID is an identifier for each subject, group indicates the group, sex indicates the gender and t1 and t2 are the measurements at baseline and follow-up. We can visualize the data using boxplots: The analysis itself is simple. Using the menu, go Analyze $\rightarrow$ General Linear Model $\rightarrow$ Univariate . I find it much easier to use the syntax directly. For this example, the syntax could look like this: UNIANOVA t2 BY group sex WITH t1 /METHOD=SSTYPE(3) /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE /SAVE=PRED ZRESID /EMMEANS=TABLES(group) WITH(t1=MEAN) COMPARE ADJ(BONFERRONI) /PRINT PARAMETER /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05) /DESIGN=t1 group sex group. The results are as follows: We can see that there is evidence that the baseline value t1 has an influence on the follow-up measurements (this is often not of interest). The line called group provides evidence that the change from baseline to follow-up differ between the groups. On the other hand, there is little evidence for a difference among genders with respect to change. Next, we can compare the groups pairwise: These comparisons were corrected using Bonferroni adjustments. We can see that there is evidence that groups 1 vs. 2 and 2 vs. 3 differ with respect to their changes from baseline to follow up. Specifically, group 2 changed 5.65 points more on average compared to group 1. Group 3 changed 6.5 points less compared to group 2. (Note that these comparisons are calculated at the mean of the baseline measurements.) This analysis can be expanded by including interaction terms or adding more covariates. One could, for example, include an interaction term of sex with group, allowing to test whether the change in each group depends on the gender. Don't forget to perform model diagnostics as applicable to all (multiple) linear regression models: The syntax above saves the predicted values and the standardized residuals. These can subsequently be used to create a scatterplot of predicted values vs. residuals (Tukey-Anscombe plot) or a Q-Q-plot of the residuals.
