The process you just described is very similar to the approach a model like a random forest might take. If your sole goal is predictive accuracy, you should definitely try a random forest. In general, it's a bad idea to split your data and model on each subset. Its better to find a way to better represent the subsets to the model, perhaps by using a random forest, or perhaps by adding an interaction between gender and age. Assuming you're using a linear model, I suspect the interaction approach will yield better results than the "subsets" approach you are already using, because it lets the model learn an overall effect of age on income and a modification of that effect for male vs female. In R, this is the difference between lm(income ~ age + gender) and lm(income ~ age * gender)
