You need to have a reference to the text field in your CustomSign.m file. This can either be an outlet which you then connect up in Interface Builder, or you can store a reference to the text field directly if you're creating it programmatically. You then call the -setDelegate: method of the text field to assign your object as the delegate: //in CustomSign.m - (void)awakeFromNib { //assume textField is an ivar that is connected to the textfield in IB [textField setDelegate:self]; } You can also set the delegate of the text field in Interface Builder by control-dragging from the text field to your object. Note that you should not call -resignFirstResponder yourself.
