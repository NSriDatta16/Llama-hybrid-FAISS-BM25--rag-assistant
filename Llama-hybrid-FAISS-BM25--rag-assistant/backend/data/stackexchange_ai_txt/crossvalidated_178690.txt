I believe that the relaimpo package will give you a measure of the relative importance of each coefficient, which seems to be what you are after. The lmg measure provided by using calc.relimp(mdl) is not $R^2$ but closely related one. From help("calc.relimp"): lmg is the R^2 contribution averaged over orderings among regressors, cf. e.g. Lindeman, Merenda and Gold 1980, p.119ff or Chevan and Sutherland (1991). > calc.relimp(mdl) Relative importance metrics: lmg cyl 0.12134515 disp 0.12023870 hp 0.10698627 drat 0.07327014 wt 0.15828880 qsec 0.03827073 vs 0.06588052 am 0.07337623 gear 0.04409332 carb 0.06726591
