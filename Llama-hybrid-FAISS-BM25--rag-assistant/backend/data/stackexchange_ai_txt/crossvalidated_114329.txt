How to compare concentration ratios

I did a spectrometry measurement with the evaluation of the concentration of an element. For the element of interest I've two peaks (with normal distribution). $ C_1 ± \sigma_1 $ where $ \sigma_1 = \sqrt{C_1} $ and number of counts n $ C_2 ± \sigma_2 $ where $ \sigma_2 = \sqrt{C_2} $ and number of counts m The concentration is evaluated by the ratio between counts $ C_i $ and mass $ m ± \sigma_m $ and time $t$ (with negligible measurement error). $ A_i = C_i/(m*t) $ and the measurement uncertainty is $\sigma_{Ai} = f ( \sigma_i ;\sigma_m) $ At the end I quantify the ratio $ R=A_1/A_2 $ with $\sigma_R = f ( \sigma_{a1} ;\sigma_{a2}) $ I measured the ratio R for three different samples of soil (they were sampled in different places.) soil s1 --> $ R_{s1} ± \sigma_{s1} $ soil s2 --> $ R_{s2} ± \sigma_{s2} $ soil s3 --> $ R_{s3} ± \sigma_{s3} $ question I have to compare these three results to evaluate if they are similar or different. How could I make this comparison? How could I make the comparison between the soil s1 and the average( s2 ; s3 )? one sample t-test ?
