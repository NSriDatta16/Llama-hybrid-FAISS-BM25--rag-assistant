Calculating priors of leaf nodes in Bayesian networks

I am studying the book Bayesian Artificial Intelligence . There is an example bayesian network see the figure: For this network the author calculated some numbers. I could not understand how author calculated highlighted probabilities for Xray and Dyspnoea when there is no evidence. See the figure please: I am trying to reproduce the results represented in the table. If you can at least help me with no evidence column, I guess I can replicate reproduce remaining ones. However, I don't mind seeing the calculation for other reasoning cases (i.e. diagnostic or predictive or intercausal). Bel refers to posterior probability. E.g., Bel(D=T) refers to posterior probability of Dyspnoea being true.
