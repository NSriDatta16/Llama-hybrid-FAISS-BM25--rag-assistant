Sandboxing web services with Python

I'm building an integration test for a web application that has multiple interdependent services. All of them depend on a shared resource in order to run correctly. I'd like to make sure that the data in the system is sane when its live so I'm leveraging a live service. I'm using Python to build it and this is my idea on how to sandbox the services: build a test runner using multiprocessing's BaseManager chroot jail each of the services, run them as a background service have a listener respond to incoming connections from the services and spit out the data Does this seem sane? Other ideas include running each service as a process or make each service have its own python virtualenv to run in.
