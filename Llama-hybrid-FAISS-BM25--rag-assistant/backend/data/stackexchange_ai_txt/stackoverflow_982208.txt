Hope this helps. Trick is to use absolute positioning and configure the top and left columns. Of course "dead center" will depend on the size of the object/div you are embedding, so you will need to do some work. For a login window I used the following - it also has some safety with max-width and max-height that may actually be of use to you in your example. Configure the values below to your requirement. div#wrapper { border: 0; width: 65%; text-align: left; position: absolute; top: 20%; left: 18%; height: 50%; min-width: 600px; max-width: 800px; }
