You haven't given us enough information. For example, you don't say if GameObjectUtilities is defined or what its value is. (I'm guessing it is set to true .) I highly recommend that you buy the second edition of Roberto Ierusalimschy's superb book Programming in Lua , which explains the idiomatic use of require and module very simply and clearly. It is also an excellent book for anyone using Lua to help get the most out of the language and libraries. As luck would have it, there is a free sample chapter which at the moment covers exactly the topic you're looking for. But buy the book anyway; it is $25 well spent :-) If you don't want to buy the book, you can read the free sample chapter , and you can also read about how to do things the "old" way, without module(...) , because the entire previous edition is free online. One possible short answer is that your "utilities" script should probably create a table and return it .
