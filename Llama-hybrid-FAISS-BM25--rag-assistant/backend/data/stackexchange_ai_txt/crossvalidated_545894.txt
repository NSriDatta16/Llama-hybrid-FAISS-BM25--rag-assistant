What variant of logistic regression is correct here?

Here is my setup: I have M=200 municipalities who all rank high in corruption For each municipality, I pick a random sample of N=100 employees from the city government I ask these people a dichotomous Y = 1/0 question, with slight variations v1, v2, v3, v4 such that 25 people are assigned to v1 ... 25 to v4 etc I control for a vector of X_m municipality characteristics (e.g: size, population, etc) I want to build a model predicting whether a given person will say yes to the question. And further, I want to recover specific intercepts for: Each of the municipalities Each of the question variants Is this a case for Bayesian multilevel logit? Simple mixed logit? etc
