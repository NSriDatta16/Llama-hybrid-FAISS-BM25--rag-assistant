How to structure time series for binary classification in Keras?

I'm trying to classify churn (1 or 0) for a user based on day-to-day time series and activity levels, something like this: User Date Activity Churn 1 09-01-2018 35 0 1 09-02-2018 17 0 2 09-01-2018 0 1 2 09-02-2018 13 1 etc... Could someone give a few pointers on how this would be setup in Keras to predict the churn value?
