Aspect based sentiment analysis using machine learning approach

I am very new in machine learning. I have annotated data with category, aspect, opinion word and sentiment. for example, for the bellow text "The apple was really tasty" I have category->food, aspect-> apple, opinion word ->tasty and sentiment->positive. I have training data like this format. How can I train a SVM classifier using this format of training set? How to extract features like n-gram, POS and sentiment word to train the classifier? Could you please suggest any beginning step for this aspect based sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms?
