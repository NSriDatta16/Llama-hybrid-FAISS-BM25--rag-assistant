API for controlling the OWI-535 robot arm

For fun I've been fiddling with the OWI-535 robot arm, and I came across this blog post about controlling the arm in Linux(or OSX). Has anyone done an API for it in .Net? Once again, a case of trying to not reinvent the wheel... I did find this about controlling it in Python, but I wanted to check if anyone had done a .Net version before I began chasing down the pipe.
