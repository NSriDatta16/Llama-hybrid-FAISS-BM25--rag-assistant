I also tested getting 1 byte(about) from the server through http (an asp.net httphandler that responds with the plain/text =1). I would expect that this method would use more bandwidth because of the http headers. But after testing the Iphone device reports that each 1byte request from the server (with all the http headers) costed about 3.5kb. Still less compared to the average cost (5kb - 7kb) of each packet when using direct tcp sockets.
