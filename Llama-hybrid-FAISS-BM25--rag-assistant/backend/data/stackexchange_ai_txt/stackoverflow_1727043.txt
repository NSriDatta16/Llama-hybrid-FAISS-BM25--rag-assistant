My thought: If you can get access to the raw microphone data: Average the set and remove all noise outside the standard deviation (this will get rid of most background noise) Normalize the data set Focus on the higher tones Configure your software to register an event on loud tones within a range of frequencies Depending on the amount of effort that you want to throw into this: you could use Bayesian or neural networks to determine if the sound was the baby or not. It would make the program a bit more complicated, however it would try to sooth said baby when the baby does not wish to be.
