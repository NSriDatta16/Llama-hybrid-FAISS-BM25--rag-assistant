Linq to Entities averages within a predefined grouping

I have used linq to entities to basically create an anonymous type with properties bookId and rating which I have grouped by bookId. all I need to do is take this and form an anonymous type which groups by bookId and gives the average rating for this bookid so anonymous type results currently looklike: bookid = 1, rating = 2 bookid = 1, rating = 4 bookid = 2, rating = 3 bookid = 3, rating = 5 and the results need to look like bookid = 1, averagerating = 3 bookid = 2, averagerating = 4 bookid = 3, averagerating = 5 averagerating just based on the grouping. thanks
