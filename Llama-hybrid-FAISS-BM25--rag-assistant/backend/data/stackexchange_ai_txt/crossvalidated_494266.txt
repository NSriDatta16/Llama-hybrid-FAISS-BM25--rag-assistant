Is Prices law a consequence of Benford's law?

Background Price's law says this: In an company, half of all value is created by the square root of the people. I'm sure Dr. Price looked at more than the median, but I suspect this was how the technically-illiterate average person could ingest the rule. Benford's law (reduced) says this: For many sets of real world numbers the first digit is 1 about 30% of the time. According to wikipedia Benford's law applies to: "...electricity bills, street addresses, stock prices, house prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, and physical and mathematical constants" This prevalence is related to power-laws underlying a wide variety of natural phenomena. Question: So can Prices value-creation law be derived from a Benford-like premise? Or, restated, does the power-law behind Benford's law speak to the mechanisms driving Price's law?
