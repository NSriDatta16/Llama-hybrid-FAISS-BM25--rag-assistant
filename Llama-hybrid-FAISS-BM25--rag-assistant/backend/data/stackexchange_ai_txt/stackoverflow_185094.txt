How do I determine my controllers in MVC?

I'm fairly new to MVC coming from a php background where I designed by view and created pages when I needed something like say a login form. I'd have a file called login. This only sucked when I needed a new login form to login a different type of user. Say an admin. I'd then have to create a new page called login-admin.php or something of that nature. Recently I began to explore MVC and particularly frameworks and the biggest problem I am having is determining how exactly you come up with your controllers. I've been told to either go the one controller per view file route, or get your controllers based upon your domain objects. I understand I can have a user controller and a lot of methods to manipulate that object say user/add, user/edit, user/delete, user/profile. But in this instance it seems that once you need views that don't necessarily fit within a "domain object" that it's hard to decide where to stick them. So, what is the best practice when determining what your controllers will be???
