What is the marginal posterior distribution?

Based on this question: How to build a Bayesian regression model of a response that is a Gaussian mixture Consider the mixture of normal, $$y_j\sim (N(0,\sigma_1))^{\pi}(N(0, \sigma_2))^{1-\pi}, j=1,2,3,4.$$ My question is what is the conditional distribution of $y_j|\sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2, z$ .
