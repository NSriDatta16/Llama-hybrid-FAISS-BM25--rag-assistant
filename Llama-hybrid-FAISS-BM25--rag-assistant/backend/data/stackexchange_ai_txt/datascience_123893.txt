What options do I have when performing RAG on similarly phrased chunks?

I'm building a RAG pipeline to extract real estate phrases from excel documents. These phrases are short (2-5 words) and are often phrased differently. I've manually added in different phrases to each prompt to suggest the LLM to look for them. What else could I do? What more powerful options do I have? Search for each term manually? -> slow due to loads of calls Embed the terms in the excel doc and similarity search the embedding of 'Total Income' against those in the excel doc? # Example prompt with 4 similar terms income = f"""What is the Total Income? It may also be called: - Total Revenue - Effective Gross Income - Total Operating Receipts - Total Operating Income Or something similar Return a signed number or nan. Do not write anything else.""" """ ```
