Trouble running liquibase with different agent

I need to execute the same db-changelog by ant and then by spring. I hope that ant will run the changelog and when spring run, it will not do anything and just stop normally. Ant run the db-changelog successfully and then spring run but it throws an exception, part of the stack trace : Reason: liquibase.exception.JDBCException: Error executing SQL CREATE TABLE action (action_id int8 NOT NULL, action_name VARCHAR(255), version_no int8, reason_required BOOLEAN, comment_required BOOLEAN, step_id int8, CONSTRAINT action_pkey PRIMARY KEY (action_id)): Caused By: Error executing SQL CREATE TABLE action (action_id int8 NOT NULL, action_name VARCHAR(255), version_no int8, reason_required BOOLEAN, comment_required BOOLEAN, step_id int8, CONSTRAINT action_pkey PRIMARY KEY (action_id)): Caused By: ERROR: relation "action" already exists; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException.... Any help will much appreciated. Regards,
