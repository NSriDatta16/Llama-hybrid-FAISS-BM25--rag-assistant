statistical regression vs machine learning regression

I was trying to understand the difference between statistical regression VS machine learning regression. My background is from Economics and learned regression from statistical point of view for the first time. I learned machine learning later on and it also had regression. There might not be clear distinction between two but wanted to ask major differences. What I can say (I might be wrong) now is there're from different areas and the model is different where statistical regression represents outcome consists of a set of independent variables with an error term whereas machine learning regression consists of outputs and inputs. Also, ML regression requires the process of training, testing to predict the unseen data sets but statistical regression doesn't require this process but analyze the past data and derives out the parameters (similarly weights in ML). An intuitive explanations (no math or complex equations) using example might be helpful!
