If the alternative had a small a priori probability, then an experiment that fails to reject the null will decrease it further, making any further research even less cost-effective. For instance, suppose the a priori probability is .01. Then your entropy is .08 bits. If the probability gets reduced to .001, then your entropy is now .01. Thus, continuing to collect data is often not cost effective. One reason why it would be cost effective would be that knowing is so important that even the remaining .01 bits of entropy is worth reducing. Another reason would be if the a priori probability was really high. If your a priori probability was more than 50%, then failing to reject the null increases your entropy, making it more cost effective to continue collecting data. An example would be when you're nearly certain that there is an effect, but don't know in which direction. For instance, if you're a counterintelligence agent and you're sure that a department has a mole, and have narrowed it down to two suspects, and are doing some statistical analysis to decide which one, then a statistically insignificant result would justify collecting more data.
