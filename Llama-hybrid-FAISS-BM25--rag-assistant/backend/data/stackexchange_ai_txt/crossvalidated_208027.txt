LOS is actually very difficult to work with due to its highly nontrivial tail structure. You will encounter many problems, including over dispersion and poor predictability for very long tails. The typical issue is that you will have patients with insanely long LOS who will severely affect your estimate predictions, and these should not be thrown out as outliers because they contain information about rare situations, as opposed to the average healthy patient. There have been many papers written on LOS prediction. To list a few: Comparison of Regression Methods for Modeling Intensive Care Length of Stay A review of statistical estimators for risk-adjusted length of stay: analysis of the Australian and new Zealand intensive care adult patient data-base, 2008â€“2009 I would suggest trying some of the techniques mentioned in the second reference. Generally speaking a log linked GLM model for LOS will give you acceptable performance for small LOS. Negative binomials are sometimes used to compensate for overdispersion but I doubt that the significant investment in computing them will give you better performance than a simple GLM. In the second reference, you'll also find some suggestions for potentially throwing out outliers. For example, throwing out the top 0.01 percent is sometimes used. For billing purposes, some insurance companies throw out LOS longer than a year because it instantiates a new billing cycle.
