Classification of non-stationary acoustic signals

I'm currently working on a task of classification of short non-stationary audio signals with length of 1024 elements and sampled at 120 kHz. I was wondering if there are any special techniques or models for classification of such signals. As far as I know, most of solution for this kind of tasks relies on computation of FFT/MFCC or spectrograms. But due to non-stationary nature of features, I can't compute statisticaly reliable frequency based features. Also approach with CNN as described in the article Raw Waveform-based Audio Classification Using Sample-level CNN Architectures shows promising results, but still doesn't work good enough. Can anyone advice me another approaches or thoughts where to start from? Will appreciate any help!
