Predicting the probabilities of sales opportunities

I want to predict the probabilities of sales opportunities using a binary classification algorithmn. However after using logistic regression my results do not seem realistic. This could be due to the dropping of missing values (about 200 observations (rows) of 1500 observations are dropped). My questions is now which binary classifier could I use that works with missing values? Another problem of my prediction is that not many features are available. Also most of the features are categorical.
