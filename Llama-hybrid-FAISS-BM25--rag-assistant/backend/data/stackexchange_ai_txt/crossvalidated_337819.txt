Classification problem (non separable data in 2D)

I have a data that consists of spectrum value at each wavelength (from 0 to 920). There are 5 different classes and spectrum value at specific wavelength decides to which class an input belongs to. Consider this graph : As you can see, the data is not really separable, as at wavelength 200 classes have all the same spectrum level. What can I do here? Is it possible to use soft margin SVM with kernel trick that may be adds 3rd dimension?
