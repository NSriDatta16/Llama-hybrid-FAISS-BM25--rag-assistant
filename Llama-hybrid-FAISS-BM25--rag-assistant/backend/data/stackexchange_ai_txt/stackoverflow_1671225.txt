Simple self-contained SNMP Agent example? (java/c# ideal)

After not having a whole bunch of luck finding any SNMP libraries for .NET that can act as SNMP agents (that can be used in an OSS project - meaning proprietary libs are out), I am now looking at implementing a simple SNMP agent class in C#. Can anyone provide any good examples or reference implementations of an SNMP agent (ideally nice & self contained), that I can use as a porting reference? Language isnt too important - but the simpler the better. Thanks!
