Isn't boost::function (in conjunction with boost::bind ) elegant enough? This will also keep you away from nasty (yet standard-conforming) implementation details like pointers to members being larger than a void* , which was a problem in a callback library for an older Windows CE system. I'd rather use a well-known library than having to deal with these problems myself.
