Does the Frequentist approach to forecasting ignore uncertainty in the parameter's value? No! Or rather, it shouldn't (and normally doesn't), but of course an individual or some particular methodology might leave it out in some situation or other, either deliberately - e.g. because it's known to be so small as to not matter because sample size was truly huge; where bias is a much bigger concern than parameter uncertainty - or in ignorance (either of the need for including it, or of how to do so). [Off the top of my head the only time I've noticed it happen was when someone omitted parameter uncertainty with a forecast from a GLM, out of one of those forms of ignorance.] It's always important to be clear about what you're predicting. A CI for a conditional mean would consider uncertainty in the parameter value, while a PI would consider both that parameter uncertainty and observation noise. I have a couple of times seen people forget the observation noise (i.e. confusing a CI for a PI) rather than parameter uncertainty. You use a regression example, for which the prediction interval (clearly) has two terms in the variance, and it's easy to see that they account for both the observation noise and parameter uncertainty. I haven't read Lambert's book, but from the quote he appears to misrepresent the normal situation in frequentist forecasting.
