Calculating chance of certain score in golf

Im trying to calculate the probability of getting a certain scores on a given golf course when i know the average score the player gets on each hole. I also know the distribution of eagle birdie par bogey etc on each hole. How can i find the chance of scoring for exampel even par or 2 under par. There is a large number of combinations that result in each final score, so I dont even know where to begin. Can anyone help me? Exampel of the data i have: Hole 1: Eagle: 1 Birdie: 12 Par: 33 bogey: 17 double bogey: 5 I have this data for all holes. The original question a wanted to answer was if there was a bigger change of getting a -10 score with or witout an Eagle, but I ran into the above problem on the way.
