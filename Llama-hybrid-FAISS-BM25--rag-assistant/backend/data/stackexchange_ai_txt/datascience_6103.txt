AWS machine learning prediction schema problems

I've trained an AWS Machine Learning model with the training data from here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data I'm now trying to run a batch prediction with the test data from the same source but I get the following error when I try to load the data : " The schema in this data file must match the datasource used to create the ML model ml-xxxxxxxxx. Ensure that the data file you are using matches the schema structure." The schema, as far as I can see, is identical. I have tried it with and without the 'survived' column which is the value I'm trying to predict. I even tried it with the same training set which obviously has an identical schema and got the same error. What am I doing wrong?
