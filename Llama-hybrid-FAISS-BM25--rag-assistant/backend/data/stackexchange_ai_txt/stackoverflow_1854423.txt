This is a typical case of Document Classification which is studied in every class of Machine Learning. If you like statistics, mathematics and computer science, I recommend that you have a look at the unsupervised methods like kmeans++ , Bayesian methods and LDA . In particular, Bayesian methods are pretty good at what are you looking for, their only problem is being slow (but unless you run a very large site, that shouldn't bother you much). On a more practical and less theoretical approach, I recommend that you have a look a this and this other great code examples.
