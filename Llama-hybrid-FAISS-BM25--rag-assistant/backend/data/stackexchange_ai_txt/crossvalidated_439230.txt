I suggest using forward selection for variables, basing on p-values in logistic regression. That is, first we choose the first variable, that has the least p-value as a covariate in the univariate logistic regression model, where we take the presence of the species as the outcome. Then we add to the model another covariate with the least p-value, then the third covariate with the least p-value, and so on. You may use also some measure of accuracy in cross validation or with a hold-out sample, instead of p-values. Stepwise selection may also be appropriate. That is, at each step, you may remove covariates with p-values greater than some threshold. If the distribution of the outcome is not binary, we are to consider linear regression. Or quantile regression if the distribution is severely skewed or has a big atom at zero.
