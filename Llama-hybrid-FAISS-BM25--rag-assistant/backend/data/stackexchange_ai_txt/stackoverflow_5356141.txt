Table header background-image and sorting arrow images

I've been using jquery.tablesorter to sort my tables, but I'd like to give my table headers a pattern by using a background-image. If I do it that way, the .headerSortUp and .headerSortDown class on sorted cell(s) overwrite the background-image on those cells. I read CSS3 supports multiple backgrounds, but what is the best way to use both a background-image and have sort arrows/images? My thoughts were to Make images that have both the pattern and the arrows (doesn't seem very elegant) Add a div or span to each th and apply the sort class to that instead of the th Any advice would be appreciated. Actually, jqGrid is a good example of what I'm looking for. Maybe I should just buy that. Thanks.
