Not sure if there are dedicated courses but Alan Agresti 's book An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis is a good starting point. However, new developments in deep learning such as cat2vec is unlikely to be covered there Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representation of Multi-field Categorical Data . Of course R's vcd package's vignette would be helpful too : vcd Tutorial and pandas's manual on here .
