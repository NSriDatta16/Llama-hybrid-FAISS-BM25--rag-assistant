Cross-platform JS access to local filesystem via plugin?

I have a javascript photo-organizer built on the YUI JS libs which can organize photos from many sites via REST api. I want to know if I can resuse any of this code to organize photos on the local filesystem. I need a cross-browser (i.e. PC/Mac) solution to the following (in order of increasing privilege): persistent file access to read/write local XML datafile (between sessions) ability to manage large uploads of thumbnails to my server FOLDER+file access to scan JPGs in a folder tree. permission granted by user via drag-drop ability to execute local shell script to generate thumbnails I've looked at the following and found some short-comings: BrowserPlus - no way to save access to local FS between sessions GoogleGears - local access to files via dialog box, only Adobe Air - is this a possible solution??? can I reuse my javascript? Can someone tell me if this is possible in Air, or if there are any other plugin options/strategies? NOTE: I could live with a download and install solution like Adobe Air, as long as I don't have to write both PC/Mac versions. Does that make it NOT a security hole? Also, can I reuse my YUI/Javascript inside AdobeAir - or do I have to start from scratch? tia, m.
