Deep learning classification with multiple temporal data

I'm working on a project to predict the category of music segments in an audio file (represented in pianoroll format with an additional column for the corresponding class). Each row represents the state of the notes after 50ms, and the last column is the class into which this state was labelled. I've got 150 such music files that are labelled and want to train a supervised model to be able to classify new music into segments. However, I have multiple problems: the problem of temporal dependence. The commonly used algorithms work with spatial data as far as I'm concerned. So how should one capture the temporal aspect? the problem of data representation. How can I train a method on 80% of my 150 files and test on the remaining 20%? The states of one matrix are dependent on one another, but concatenating the matrices of the 150 files is a bit much. Plus 2 matrices are different in length, and have no musical connection to one another in any way. I cannot come up with a method to train one network on multiple files, nor how to capture the temporal aspect of this task. Any advice is welcome.
