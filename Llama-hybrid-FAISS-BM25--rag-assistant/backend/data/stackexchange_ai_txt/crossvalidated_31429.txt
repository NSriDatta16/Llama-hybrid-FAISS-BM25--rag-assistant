I'm pretty sure you are using wrong tools here. ML methods are created for interpolation (like predicting time series A from time series B and C); for extrapolations we have Markov chains and friends. The problem with your approach is that it is terribly easy to overfit the model in this conditions and, what's worse, it is hard to spot this (normal cross-validation will fail, so it is very hard to fit parameters the proper way, etc.). Adding explicit time to predictors is also a bad idea -- I have seen models fitted only on time and decision with 90% accuracy on cross-validation and random guessing on post-training-data tests. If you need time, it is better to include it as a series of cycle descriptors like day of week or seconds past midnight, obviously never exceeding or even going near the length of your training series.
