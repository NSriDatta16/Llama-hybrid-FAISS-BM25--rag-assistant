The DuplicateFile table doesn't support deploying to the GAC because MSI doesn't uses a different pattern to deploy to the GAC then most folders. It uses MsiPlublishAssemblies which interacts with Fusion. You have to declare 2 components ( 1 for normal and 1 for the GAC ). If size is a concern for you, WiX has a feature called smart cabbing which can create your cab and stream it into media with multiple file rows sharing the same storage.
