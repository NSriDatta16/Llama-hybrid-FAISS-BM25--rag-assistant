Erlang/OTP - Timing Applications

I am interested in bench-marking different parts of my program for speed. I having tried using info(statistics) and erlang:now() I need to know down to the microsecond what the average speed is. I don't know why I am having trouble with a script I wrote. It should be able to start anywhere and end anywhere. I ran into a problem when I tried starting it on a process that may be running up to four times in parallel. Is there anyone who already has a solution to this issue? EDIT: Willing to give a bounty if someone can provide a script to do it. It needs to spawn though multiple process'. I cannot accept a function like timer.. at least in the implementations I have seen. IT only traverses one process and even then some major editing is necessary for a full test of a full program. Hope I made it clear enough.
