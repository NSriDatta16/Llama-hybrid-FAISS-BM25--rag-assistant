What I would do here would be to embed groovy scripts within the java code as described here: http://groovy.codehaus.org/Embedding+Groovy In this way you can change your groovy code without the need to recompile. We've used this technique in our last legacy app that took 10-15 mins to recompile and install. Groovy runs within the JVM and is dynamically compiled to bytecode, so there's no need to worry about the "production-ness" of it.
