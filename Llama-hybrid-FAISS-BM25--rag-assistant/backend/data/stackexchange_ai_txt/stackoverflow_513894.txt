I'd go with the simplest model; each question is a heading, with answers in paragraph tags. Clear, logical and semantically sane, I think. The reason I wouldn't use the definition list tags mentioned is that I don't think, from a pure semantic point of view, that questions and answers fit the mould of pure terms and definitions.
