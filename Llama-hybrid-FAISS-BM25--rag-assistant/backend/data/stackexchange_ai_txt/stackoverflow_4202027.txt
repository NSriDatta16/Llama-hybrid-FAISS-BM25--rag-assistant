Adding data to Magento grid collection destroys pager

in my own Magento Extension I'm using a grid block, to display the collection of data in my db table. Everything works fine so far and the standard pagination from magento works, too. I now want to add some random data, which isn't in the db table, to the collection to show it in my grid. If I try as follow the pagination stops working: class My_own_Block_Admin_Main_Grid extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid { protected function _prepareCollection { // Load the collection $collection = getResourceModel('sales/order_grid_collection'); // Add custom data $collection->addToAll('example', 'This is a test'); // Set the collection $this->setCollection($collection); return parent::_prepareCollection(); } } The pagination is effectless now. Page 1 is the same as 2 and shows all entries. What's the right and working way to a data to the collection without breaking the pagination?
