Few theoretical questions on gaussian process with basic example

I am trying to understand Gaussian process. and I am stucked now. This above notation is what data(n by 2) looks like in my head. And These are from this lecture by Marc Deisenroth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdCXdUzLfao&t=2753s I was trying to implementing Exponentiated qurdratic function from the scratch. I am now confused what x_i and x_j are. So the distance(x_i, x_j) is like distance(x11 , x12) or distance(y1, y2) in my notation? Is f(x) same as Y ? f(w1 x11 + w2 x12) is same as y1 in my head now. However, f() is unknown from the prior. I've seen lots of gaussian process lectures on Youtube, but I really can't get it. What I know are GP try to find the distribution over functions instead of parameters(bayesian linear regression) Kernel function is the key. (optimizing hyperparameters in kernel) Kernel function should be n by n matrix. (with n obsevations) My brain is melting... Thanks for your help!
