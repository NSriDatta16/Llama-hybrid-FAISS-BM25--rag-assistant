Vanilla means standard, usual, or unmodified version of something. Vanilla gradient descent means the basic gradient descent algorithm without any bells or whistles. There are many variants on gradient descent. In usual gradient descent (also known as batch gradient descent or vanilla gradient descent), the gradient is computed as the average of the gradient of each datapoint. $$\nabla f = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \nabla \text{loss}(x_i)$$ In stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of one, we might estimate the gradient as $$\nabla f \approx \nabla \text{loss}(x^*)$$, where $x^*$ is randomly sampled from our entire dataset. It is a variant of normal gradient descent, so it wouldn't be vanilla gradient descent. However, since even stochastic gradient descent has many variants, you might call this "vanilla stochastic gradient descent", when comparing it to other fancier SGD alternatives, for example, SGD with momentum.
