Correct jquery lib for supporting drag and drop of elements?

I'm new to jquery development. I need to get drag and drop support for some elements, and I found this library provides what I need: http://jqueryui.com/ is this a good choice? I'm not sure if there are any technical pitfalls, a better library to use for this, etc. The minified js file (with all features) is pretty large ~200kb, I'll have to cut down on that by using their custom config stuff, Thanks
