A shameless plug over here. Feel free to check Magpie , a framework for multi-label text classification that builds on word2vec and neural network technologies. It should run out-of-the-box if you have a good dataset and it builds on the technologies that you mentioned (keras, TF and scikit-learn). I managed to run it for classifying texts with up to 10k labels with reasonable performance. Thanks to word2vec it should also be able to work for an arbitrary language.
