There are a few ways to think about this. If you want to use the confidence interval approach, then you should also look at the "finite population correction" (Googling for that phrase results in several hits that look promising). But your question was about the probability of all the 100 calculations being correct, whereas the confidence interval approach answers a little bit different question. Your original question is more interesting (and less standard), so I will give some advice there. One simple option is to consider the case where there is exactly 1 wrong calculation out of the 100 and you are going to check $n$ calculations out of the 100, chosen at random. This is the simplest case (when not all are correct) mathematically, but would require the biggest sample to find with high confidence. In this case if you chose 50 to check ( $n=50$ ), then there is a 50% chance of finding the incorrect calculation, with $n=70$ there would be a 70% chance of getting the single incorrect calculation, etc. So to be 99% sure you would need to check $n=99$ of the 100 calculations and find them all correct. If you believe that a larger number will be incorrect (e.g. if they are not all correct, then at least 10 will be incorrect) then the similar probabilities can be calculated using the hypergeometric distribution. For example with 10 mistakes and $n=30$ there is about a 2.3% chance that all the tested calculations will be correct. At $n=36$ that percentage goes below 1%, so with $n=36$ you can be 99% confident/sure that there are no mistakes in the 100 (under the assumption that if there are any mistakes, then there will be at least 10). An even better approach would be to use a Bayesian approach where you start with a prior on the probability of an error in each of the 100 cases, then work out the posterior probability given the number of manual checks that confirmed they were correct, then use that the estimate the probability of the remaining being correct. All of this assumes of course that your manual checking is accurate (calculations that have been confirmed have 100% chance of being correct).
