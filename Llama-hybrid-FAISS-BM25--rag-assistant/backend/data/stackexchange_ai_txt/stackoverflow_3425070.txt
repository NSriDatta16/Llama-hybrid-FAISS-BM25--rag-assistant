Magento flat product table - retrieving "Most Viewed" product names

I currently show a collection of the "Most Viewed" products as a list in my footer. I get the collection using the following code: $_viewed_productCollection = Mage::getResourceModel('reports/product_collection') ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addViewsCount() ->setOrder('views_count', 'desc') $_viewed_productCollection->load(); This works fine until I enable flat products, and then it can no longer retrieve the product names or prices. It can however still get the url, the sku etc, which really confuses me. I printed out the array of what can be returned, and it seems thereâ€™s no name data there at all, only the following: Array ( [views] => 29 [entity_id] => 18 [entity_type_id] => 10 [attribute_set_id] => 38 [type_id] => simple [sku] => sw810i [created_at] => 2007-08-23 15:47:44 [updated_at] => 2008-08-08 14:50:56 [has_options] => 0 [required_options] => 0 [is_salable] => 1 [stock_item] => Varien_Object Object ( [_data:protected] => Array ( [is_in_stock] => 1 ) [_origData:protected] => [_idFieldName:protected] => [_isDeleted:protected] => ) [gift_message_available] => 2 ) Is there anyway to get a product name using it's SKU? Something like this perhaps: getData('sku'); echo $this->htmlEscape($_product->getName($sku)) ?>
