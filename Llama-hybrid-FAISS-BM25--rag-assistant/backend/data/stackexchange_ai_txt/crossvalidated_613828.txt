Y Nehc, You have a population of {1, 2, 3, 4, >5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Which of the >following methods would give you a >better estimate of the population's >true maximum? Collect one large sample of n = 10. >Then, find max. Collect two smaller samples of n = 5. >Find max for each sample. Then, >calculate the average. One of your premises is not valid. You are saying that your ideal sample IS your population. Doesn't this premise completely negates the rest of your subsequent statements and thus the conclusion? The concept of sampling exists only when it is impractical to study the entire population. If it were practical to examine the entire population there would be no need for sampling at all. Your option 2, thus, would never exist when you are able to go for option 1. The problem here is what do we do when it is not practical to analyze the population?
