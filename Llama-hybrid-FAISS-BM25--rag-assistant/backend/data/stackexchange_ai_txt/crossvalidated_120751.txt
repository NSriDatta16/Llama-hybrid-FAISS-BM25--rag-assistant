Not sure about the interpretation of this residual plot

I'm analyzing a residual plot of the residuals vs the fitted values. I'm not quite sure how to interpret this plot since there looks like there is a pattern and the average is not actually zero. There are diagonal straight parallel lines. I'm working with several ordinal IV's. Any ideas?
