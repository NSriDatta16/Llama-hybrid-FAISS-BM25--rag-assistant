How to set the index valued M in Hierarchical model to compute Bayesian model probability?

I'm incorporating a Bayesian Model Averageing(BMA) approach in my research and strapped in trapped in the estimated of Pr(theta|D). Professor John K. Kruschke(2014) 's book in chapter 10 offers an example to compute model posterior probability using hierarchical MCMC, but I do not know how to set the index value of model(m) using this method to linear regression. Here is the code library(BMS) data(attitude) #show the model posterior probability of four combination of variable compaints and #privileges bma4c = bms(rating ~complaints + privileges , data = attitude) pmp.bma(bma4c) I want use hierarchical MCMC method to get the similar results. # The date library(rjags) dataList beta0 ~ dnorm(0 , 1.0E-12) beta1 ~ dnorm(0 , 1.0E-12) beta2 ~ dnorm(0 , 1.0E-12) m ~ dcat(mPrior[]) mPrior[1] Does anyone know how to modify this code to get the relative model probability?
