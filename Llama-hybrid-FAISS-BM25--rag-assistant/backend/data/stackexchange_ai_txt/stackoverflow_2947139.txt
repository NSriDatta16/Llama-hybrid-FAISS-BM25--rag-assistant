How to know user is dragging something when the cursor is not in my window?

We all know you can implement drag-and-drop feature for your Window so that it accepts drag and drop operation, but my question is, how to detect a drag-and-drop operation that's is in progress in other windows , for example, dragging a file in the Windows Explorer? What I want to do is that when a user is dragging a file then my hidden window shows up. Thank you!
