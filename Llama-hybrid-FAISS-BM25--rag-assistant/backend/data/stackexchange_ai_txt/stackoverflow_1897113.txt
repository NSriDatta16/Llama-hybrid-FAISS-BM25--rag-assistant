Linking two object files with a common symbol

If i have two object files both defining a symbol (function) "foobar". Is it possible to tell the linker to obey the obj file order i give in the command line call and always take the symbol from first file and never the later one? AFAIK the "weak" pragma works only on shared libraries but not on object files. Please answer for all the C/C++ compiler/linker/operating system combinations you know cause i'm flexibel and use a lot of compiles (sun studio, intel, msvc, gcc, acc).
