If you want to get the overall prevalence of psychopathy in the population (including both males and females) then you would take a weighted average of the prevalence in these two subgroups, weighted by their contribution to the population. If you are willing to assume an equal proportion of males and females in the population then the overall prevalence of psychopathy in the population would be a straight average of the two figures you give, yielding an overall prevalence of 10.85%.
