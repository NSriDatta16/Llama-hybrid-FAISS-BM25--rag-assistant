Jquery iScroll not scrolling on iPad

I cant seem to get iScroll to work on the iPad and spent a few days trying to figure it out with no luck, so hopefully someone can help me out. Below is the code: I first include the js files: iscroll.js is the iscroll source. The second is a custom js I created based off the example they give on iscroll site which contains the following code: var deviceAgent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); var agentID = deviceAgent.match(/(ipad)/); if(agentID) { var myScroll; var a = 0; function loaded() { setHeight(); // Set the wrapper height. Not strictly needed, see setHeight() function below. // Please note that the following is the only line needed by iScroll to work. Everything else here is to make this demo fancier. myScroll = new iScroll('ipad_scroller', {vScrollbar:true}); } // Change wrapper height based on device orientation. Not strictly needed by iScroll, you may also use pure CSS techniques. function setHeight() { var headerH = document.getElementById('ipad_header').offsetHeight, footerH = document.getElementById('ipad_footer').offsetHeight, wrapperH = window.innerHeight - headerH - footerH; document.getElementById('ipad_wrapper').style.height = wrapperH + 'px'; } // Check screen size on orientation change window.addEventListener('onorientationchange' in window ? 'orientationchange' : 'resize', setHeight, false); // Prevent the whole screen to scroll when dragging elements outside of the scroller (ie:header/footer). // If you want to use iScroll in a portion of the screen and still be able to use the native scrolling, do *not* preventDefault on touchmove. document.addEventListener('touchmove', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); }, false); // Load iScroll when DOM content is ready. document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', loaded, false); } Here is the css for the divs being used in the code: #ipad_header { width:100%; height:250px; } #ipad_footer { width:100%; height:48px; padding:0; border-top:1px solid #444; } #ipad_wrapper { height:100px; position: relative; overflow: auto; } #ipad_scroller { position: relative; width: 100%; z-index: 1; overflow: hidden; height: auto; } Then in the html page I have //content at the very top that I want to stay on top as it scrolls //The rest of my page content Footer content here Now I had this working at one time, but for some reason it stopped working on the ipad. The weird thing is if I turn the ipad to its side in landscaping mode it hangs for a few seconds then the iscroll stuff works just fine. Then if I move the ipad back into portrait mode it hangs again but the scroll starts to work again as well in portrait mode. Can anyone please help me out on this? I am pulling my hair out trying to find out what went wrong. I do know I recently upgraded ipad to the latest OS version but I believe this issue was happening before I did that.
