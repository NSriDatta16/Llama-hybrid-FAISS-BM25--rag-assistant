Yes, deep learning can be applied for time series predictions. In fact, it has been done many times already, for example: http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2012/BussetiOsbandWong-DeepLearningForTimeSeriesModeling.pdf http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-013-2964-2#page-1 This is not really any "special case", deep learning is mostly about preprocessing method (based on generative model), so to you have to focus on exactly same things that you focus on when you do deep learning in "traditional sense" on one hand, and same things you focus on while performing time series predictions without deep learning.
