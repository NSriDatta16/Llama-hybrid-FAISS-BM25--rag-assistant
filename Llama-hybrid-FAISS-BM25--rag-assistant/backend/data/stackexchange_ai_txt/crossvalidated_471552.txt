Binary classification: does it make a difference to use zero or minus one as class label?

I'd like to build a binary classification model and I recall reading somewhere that the choice of the labels could have an impact depending on the algorithm. So the two modeling approaches are to either: Use class labels [0, 1] as levels for the response variable. Use class labels [-1, 1] as levels for the response variable. The question is: does it make a difference for certain models e.g. SVM to use 0 instead of -1 as response variable class label or level? If so can you please also provide references where this is explained?
