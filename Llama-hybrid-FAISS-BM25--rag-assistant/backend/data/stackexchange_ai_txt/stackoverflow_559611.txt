Password storage in source control

We store all our application and db passwords in plain text in source control. We do this as our build/deploy process generates required configuration files and also does actual deploys that require these passwords (ie: running sql against a database requires you logon to the db using valid credentials). Has anyone had a similar need where you were able to implement this type of functionality while not storing the passwords in plain text?
