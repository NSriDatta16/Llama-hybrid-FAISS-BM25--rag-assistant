I think it all depends on how you want to use your DSL. It seems reasonable that one would want to perform several options on a single file in a run, so perhaps you could consider something like on 'database.yaml' do append 'windows' line 16 do indent 2.spaces end lines 3,6,7 do delete end end Meaning that first you define a scope (a file, a line, a set of lines, a block etc), and then a set of operations to perform on it. But, then again, we are programmers, perhaps "average user" would like to use something more resembling a natural language, as you have started.
