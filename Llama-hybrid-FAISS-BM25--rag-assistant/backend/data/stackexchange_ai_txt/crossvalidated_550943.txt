Notation for an entire time series vs. one time instance

In time series analysis, $x_t$ may denote an entire time series (a time-ordered set of random variables or their realizations) or a single random variable or its realization that is specific to time $t$ . What is some brief, non-clumsy notation that would allow to disambiguate between the two? I encountered this when teaching, and I want to prevent confusion among students. So far I have considered $x_t$ for a specific time period and $\{x_t\}$ for the entire series. Would that make sense? On the other hand, something like $\{x_t\}_{t=1}^T$ seems both too specific regarding the permitted time indices (why exactly $t=1$ but not $t=0$ or $t=-\infty$ , and similarly for $T$ vs. $\infty$ vs. ...) and too clumsy to me.
