Can you post your full ActiveMQ configuration ? Have you set persistent = false on the ActiveMQ broker? I think what is happening is that because you've turned off flow control, and only have allowed 20mb of memory to be used by the broker - your messages are being paged to disk in temporary storage. If persistent=false this shouldn't happen - but do enable flow control - it will help ;)
