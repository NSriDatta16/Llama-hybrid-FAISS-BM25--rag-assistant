The queries will vary significantly depending on your activities. If you have some control over your MySQL server, try turning on query logging: set global general_log = on Then you can get the SQL log to see queries. As a word or warning, Magento tends to execute dozens of queries on every page load, and hundreds to save an object. Thanks, Joe
