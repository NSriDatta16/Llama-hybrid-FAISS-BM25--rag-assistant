randomForest chooses regression instead of classification

I'm using the randomForest package in R and using the iris data, the random forest generated is a classification but when I use a dataset with around 700 features (the features are each pixel in a 28x28 pixel image) and the label column is named label , the randomForest generated is regression. I'm using the following line: rf How come regression is used instead of classification? The data is read in through read.csv() .
