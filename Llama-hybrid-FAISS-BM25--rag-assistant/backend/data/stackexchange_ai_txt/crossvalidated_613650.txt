Mixed model with 4 levels of data

I have time series data at weekly level with 4 levels. Level 0 - Time Week on week Level 1 Job type - Day,Night etc Level 2 Location - Location to which job belongs Level 3 County - County under which location falls Population data is available at location level. unemployment data is available at county level. I am trying to predict the Weekly applications (Y) based on wage rate , population in the location, and unemployment rate. There are other factors but not mentioning all . I have created below model: model = lmer((applications)~wage rate + population + unemployment_rate_+ (1+wage rate+ population +unemployment_rate |county/location/Jobtype) , REML = TRUE, data = data4) Would like to confirm if this structure of the model makes sense? . I am also confused on how we calculate the prediction at week level. Couldn't find any example where such 4 levels of time series data Analysed. Most of the examples are math oriented I am unable to follow it . Please advise.
