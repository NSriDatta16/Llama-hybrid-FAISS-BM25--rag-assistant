If you've already got memcached up and running on your side, I suggest the memorised module: http://github.com/1stvamp/memorised/ ... which is a variant of the classic Python memoize decorator -- the memorized module eschews local dict caches in favor of Memcache storage. Any “memorised” functions you define are almost as fast as memoized functions* – plus, those Memcache-backed function-call cache persists across all invocations of the Python interpreter process. I don't know thing one about the RackSpace CDN, but using memorised makes my stuff measurably faster, in like a granular and magic-free way. * : in my little bitty statistically-insignificant testing
