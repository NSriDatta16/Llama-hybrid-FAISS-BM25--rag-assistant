Git branch named origin/HEAD -> origin/master

I'm fairly new to Git, and still getting the hang of it. I just recently started working with branches and am running into some questions. I have two development systems, an Ubuntu desktop and an MacBookPro. I did a bunch of work in a new organizations branch on the Ubuntu system and performed commits and pushed to my remote repo. At this point, I had these branches: tauren@ubuntu:/projects$ git branch accounting master * organizations tauren@ubuntu:/projects$ git branch -r origin/accounting origin/master origin/organizations origin/superstar Then I switched to the MBP to pull the new branch: tauren@osx:/projects$ git branch accounting * master tauren@osx:/projects$ git branch -r origin/HEAD -> origin/master origin/accounting origin/master origin/superstar tauren@osx:/projects$ git pull 2e20a14..ef35730 accounting -> origin/accounting 271a1a5..7e947ab master -> origin/master * [new branch] organizations -> origin/organizations tauren@osx:/projects$ git branch * accounting master tauren@osx:/projects$ git branch -r origin/HEAD -> origin/master origin/accounting origin/master origin/organizations origin/superstar So my questions are these: Why does the MBP have a branch origin/HEAD -> origin/master , but the Ubuntu system doesn't? What is that branch? Does git pull automatically pull all new remote branches? I thought I had to tell it the name of new branches to pull. As you can see, it pulled the remote organizations branch on the commmand git pull .
