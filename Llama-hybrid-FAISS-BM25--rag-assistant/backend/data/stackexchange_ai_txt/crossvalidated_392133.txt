K - means, expected shape of the curve

I want to understand what happens as we increase the number of clusters using k- means, what is the expected shape of the curve showing the average distance between points and their assigned clusters? It should be concave, having its maximum value at the optimum number of clusters with all other values decreasing around it. It should be convex, having its minimum value at the optimum number of clusters with all other values increasing around it. It should decrease slowly until the optimal number of clusters is reached, then decrease sharply afterward. It should decrease sharply until the optimal number of clusters is reached, then decrease slowly afterward. Thanks in advance !!
