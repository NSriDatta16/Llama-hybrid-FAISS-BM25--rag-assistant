Dataset split in time series forecasting

I am trying to make a sales forecasting model to predict into the near future. My data is monthly and of time series type as seen below: 2013-1-1 : 2000$ 2013-2-1 : 6000$ . . . 2021-1-1 : 3000$ What I am thinking of trying first is a SARIMA model because my data have strong seasonality. My concern is: How should I split the dataset for training purposes? The split should be chronological and I am thinking of doing a train/validation split and choosing the best model hyperparameters based on the validation RMSE. However, I have been advised to use a test set too for my model evaluation which is something I am cautious of. Since I am purely choosing a model based on my validation data is a test set here really necessary? By doing this split I am using less data for training which I believe will result in a worse model. What are your thoughts on this?
