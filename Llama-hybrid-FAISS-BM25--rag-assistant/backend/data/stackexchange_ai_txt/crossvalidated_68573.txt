Weighting time series coefficients using model's likelihood

I have a question regarding to time series forecasting. In particular I've been working with a Bayesian approach, but I think the question is independent from that. I have several time series which are very stable in time, except on specific dates that they have sudden changes. The problem is that if I use a forecasting technique that looks at the past to predict the future, such as ARIMA, the days after the sudden changes have high impact on the forecast. Thus, to give a simple example, suppose I'm predicting $x_{t+1} = \sum \beta_j x_j, j Thus, a sudden change has low probability and should not contribute to the prediction. Does anyone know how to deal with these kind of problems? I'm trying to implement this in a Bayesian model, but I'm now sure how I should do it.
