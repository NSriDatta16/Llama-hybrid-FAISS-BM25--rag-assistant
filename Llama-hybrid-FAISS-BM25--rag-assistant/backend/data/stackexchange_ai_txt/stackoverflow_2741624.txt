No matter your external source, you need to be very careful attention to debiasing the output of the generator, and doing continuous tests to ensure your generator hasn't started oscillating in a periodic fashion for any number of reasons. FIPS 140 contains some guidelines. Here is an example project using reverse biased transistors. I recommend using 2n4124 parts which can be driven at about 9.6V (+5V USB, doubled, schottky diode) for optimum results.
