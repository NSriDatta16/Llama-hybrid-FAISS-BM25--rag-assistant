How to impute missing value in Test Set using a custom Imputer created on training dataset

I am working on a toy project to predict claims. One of the input features has null values on which I have applied a custom imputation technique. Under this technique, I replaced missing values with the mean value of the two categories of the target feature. The code snippet is as below: dataframe['Feature'] = dataframe['Feature'].fillna(dataframe.groupby('Target Feature')['Feature'].transform('mean')) Using this strategy I have designed classification models based on Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier. Now I have to run my models on a test set but am stuck at the pre-processing stage. The test set also has missing values in the same feature (as in the training set), now how can I update these missing values with the mean values that the models learnt from the training set.
