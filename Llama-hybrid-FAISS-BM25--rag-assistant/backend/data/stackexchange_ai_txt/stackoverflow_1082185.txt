The biggest issue that I've had with using MSSql is when using the antiquated JDBC -> ODBC Bridge drivers; these do a half-assed Java wrapper around the ODBC calls, which are flaky and fragile. If you are using JDBC ODBC Bridge, replace them with the latest native JDBC drivers from microsoft- they work a million times better.
