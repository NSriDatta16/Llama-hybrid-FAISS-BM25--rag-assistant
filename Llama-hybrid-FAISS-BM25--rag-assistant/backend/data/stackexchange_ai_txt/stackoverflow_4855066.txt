Whilst the INSERT/DELETE option would work perfectly well I'd recommend against it as: Unless you bundle the INSERT/DELETE up into a single transaction, or better yet encapsulate the INSERT/DELETE up into a stored procedure you do run the theoretical risk of accumulating duplicates. If you use a SP or a transaction you're just effectively rewriting the UPDATE statement which is obviously inefficient and moreover will give rise to a few WTF raised eyebrows later by anyone maintaining your code. Although it doesn't sound like an issue in your case you are potentially impacting referential integrity should you need that. Furthermore you are loosing the rather useful ability to easily retrieve records in creation order. Probably not a great consideration on a small application, but you are going to end up with a seriously fragmented database fairly quickly which will slow data retrieval.
