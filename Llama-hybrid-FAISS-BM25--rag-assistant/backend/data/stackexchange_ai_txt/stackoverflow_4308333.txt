I don't think you're going to get good results with a polynomial fit of any degree -- since all polynomials go to infinity for sufficiently large and small X, but a sigmoid curve will asymptotically approach some finite value in each direction. I'm not a Python programmer, so I don't know if numpy has a more general curve fitting routine. If you have to roll your own, perhaps this article on Logistic regression will give you some ideas.
