First decide on the barcode format you want to use. Then check if there is a PHP implementation out there (there will be for most - if not all - barcode formats). A basic example (using PEAR Image_Barcode ) can be found at Using barcodes in your web application . You just store the text in the DB and can generate the corresponding image using the Image_Barcode class (it supports Code 39, Code 128, EAN 13, INT 25, PostNet and UPCA). I once wrote an app creating EAN 13 barcodes, don't remember which lib I used though (I'll check at home if I can find the source).
