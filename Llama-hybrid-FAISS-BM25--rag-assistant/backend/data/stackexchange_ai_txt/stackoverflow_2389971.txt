Are you positive that memcached supports storage of complex objects? Another thing to consider is that SUDS has its own caching mechanism built-in, but I believe it is only for the WSDL/XSD data, so that it doesn't have to be recompiled every time you startup. I am not totally positive, however, and it's possible that it could also be used for storage of results.
