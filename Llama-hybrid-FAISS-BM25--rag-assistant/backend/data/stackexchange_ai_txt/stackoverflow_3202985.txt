maven-cobertura-plugion does not show the sources

When I generate a Cobertura report by running "mvn cobertura:cobertura" (or "mvn site") then a report is generated which shows the test coverage for my classes but when I click on a class then the message "Unable to locate de/ailis/foo/Bar.java. Have you specified the source directory?" is displayed. How can I fix this? I configured the plugin in the pom.xml like this: org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 2.4 So how can I specify the source directory for this plugin (And why is that needed, maven always knows where the source are and obviously they are already used because otherwise I should get an empty report).
