Embedding a XAP file into a class library

This might be a bit tricky setup but... I have this Silverlight project that builds into a XAP, which is all fine. Next we have this set of class libraries we add to an existing application which then unfolds into small "applications" inside the existing one. The problem here is... I want my XAP to be embedded into the class library as an embedded resource, but I'm looking for a solution how to do this without some half-dodgy post-build event if possible. It would be fantastic to be able to link the output of my Silverlight project to the class library and get it embedded...I guess I'm starting to ramble a bit now ;) Short version: link Silverlight project to a Class library project as an embedded resource...is it possible, if so how?
