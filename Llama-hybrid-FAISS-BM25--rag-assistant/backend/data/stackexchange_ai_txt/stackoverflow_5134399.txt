-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'

To reset the admin password of SolusVM I am executing the following command : php /usr/local/solusvm/scripts/pass.php --type=admin --comm=change --username= When doing so, the following error message is printed: -bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline' What is the reason for this problem? I am running the command as root.
