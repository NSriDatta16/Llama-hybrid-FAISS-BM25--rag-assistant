Can I run my application on another application server, like IBM WebSphere, or on a simple Servlet container, like Tomcat? At the end of the day, the Oracle ADF framework is just some JAR files that you can install on Third-Party Application Servers (with more or less support, depending on the tooling). Can I use Hibernate instead of EclipseLink? You can feed ADF with POJOs like annotated JPA entities and you could use Hibernate. Can I easily access another database, like Microsoft SQL Server? Yes, provide the appropriate JDBC driver. Would Domain-Driven Design fit in the picture? I think it's orthogonal. How much of an ADF application can be configured using a DI container like Spring? You can use Spring for the services and data access layer. See: Spring and Oracle ADF â€“ registering a POJO Spring JDBC based Business Service as Data Control Oracle ADF on the Spring forums What would I miss when I use my favorite IDE, say Eclipse, instead of JDeveloper? All the drag & drop stuff. Can I use Maven for ADF projects? It's technically doable. In other words, what are the limits of freedom within ADF-land? I'll let experts answer that with more details. Note that it still has to be an ADF application, not just a Java EE application that uses ADF Faces. Didn't get that one.
