In paragraph form field with label underneath

I'd like to have an input box in the middle of a paragraph, with the label in smaller text underneath it. Kind of like: Hello [________________], This is to inform you (Customer Name) that the [____________] you ordered is no longer (Item Name) available. I thought it would be pretty easy to do, but my brain doesn't appear to be working today. Is it possible to do this with just CSS, and in a simple enough manner that it can be adapted to different forms easily?
