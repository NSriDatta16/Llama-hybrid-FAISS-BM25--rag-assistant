Programming suggestions: Remove the asterisks from the output as this represents bad statistical practice Don’t use long-winded function calls in formulas as this messes up all the later model output I don’t worry about which reference level was chosen when a model is fitted but rather specify that when I ask for estimates. The rms package makes this easy, and gives lots of other customized output specifically for logistic regression: dd This will use High School as the reference category for getting odds ratios for x1 and use a range of 25-35 for getting an odds ratio for the continuous variable bmi . Defaults would have been to use quantiles. See RMS for more and especially note partial effect plots, which are typically better than single point estimates.
