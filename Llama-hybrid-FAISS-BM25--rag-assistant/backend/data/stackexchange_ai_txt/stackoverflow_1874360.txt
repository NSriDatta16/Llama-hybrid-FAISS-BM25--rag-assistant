A change from NOT NULL to NULL is fine because existing data need not be checked/changed. The other direction however would need all existing data to be checked; so that might be problematic. I suggest you watch out for the possibility that existing queries (written when the column was still NOT NULL) will not now be 'broken' as a result of the possibility for NULL values. The catch is that it may be tricky to confirm that the logic is still sound in all cases because you're unlikely to receive any obvious errors. Pay careful attention to aggregation functions.
