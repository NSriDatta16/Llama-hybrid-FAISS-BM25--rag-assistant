You could just ignore this problem. You can show through simulation that, with some extreme exceptions, an approximate but not exact answer to the variance covariance structure usually leads to reasonable estimation. You can safeguard this approach even more by using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. If AR1 is the right model, treat the unmeasured time series observations as missing data and impute them. If your X, Y processes are asynchronous, it could be as simple as LOCF. Otherwise, multiple imputation could be used. Alternately, you can edit the generalized least squares fitting process to account for imbalanced design and populate the variance-covariance matrix according to the observed design. Random effects models contain random intercepts or random slopes. In your example, including time as a random slope nested in subject induces a spherical-type correlation between adjacent observations. As always, fit a variogram to inspect the shape and nature of the temporal correlation.
