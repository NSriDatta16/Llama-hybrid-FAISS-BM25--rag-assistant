Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN) is a good open source library, its been optimised and used by a large community, with plenty of support and delphi bindings. Using dependencies in this area is advised if you don't fully understand what your doing, the smallest detail can have a big impact on how a neural network performs; so best spend your time on your implementation of the network, then on anything else.
