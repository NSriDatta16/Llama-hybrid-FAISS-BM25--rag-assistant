Yes, you can create custom features as part of a scikit-learn pipeline by using a custom transformer class. A transformer is a class that implements the fit() and transform() methods, and can be used to perform any custom preprocessing or feature engineering steps that you need. Here's an example of how you might create a transformer class to create custom features as part of a pipeline: from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin class CustomFeatureTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin): def __init__(self): # Initialize any parameters you need here pass def fit(self, X, y=None): # Fit the transformer to the data (e.g. compute any necessary statistics) return self def transform(self, X): # Create the custom features X['custom_feature1'] = X['feature1'] + X['feature2'] X['custom_feature2'] = X['feature3'] - X['feature4'] return X You can then include this transformer in your pipeline like any other preprocessing step: from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline # Create the pipeline pipeline = Pipeline([ ('custom_features', CustomFeatureTransformer()), # Other preprocessing steps go here ('model', MyModel()) ]) When you call fit() on the pipeline, the transformer's fit() and transform() methods will be called in sequence, allowing you to create and include the custom features in your model's training data.
