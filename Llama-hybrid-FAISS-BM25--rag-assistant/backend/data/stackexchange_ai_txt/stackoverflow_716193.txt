I had two competing needs - I had to use the keyboard notification because I needed to get the keyboard height, which appears to be only available that way, but I also needed to know which text view I was in, which meant also using the textViewDidBeginEditing delegate. After much messing around I finally resorted to getting the keyboard height in the notification method and storing it in an instance variable, which was then available to use in the delegate method (I need to scroll the view up so the bottom text view is not mostly hidden under they keyboard when they start typing). A bit inelegant, but it works. Thanks for the pointers!
