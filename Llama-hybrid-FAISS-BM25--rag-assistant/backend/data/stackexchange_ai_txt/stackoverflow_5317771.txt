What is called first - robots.txt or mod_rewrite in htaccess

I need some help. I'm not sure about the order on request for mod_rewrite and robots.txt. Some urls belong to a rewrite rule: /index.php?id=123 to /home Other urls don't have a rewrite: /index.php?id=444 I made this entry to my robots.txt: User-agent: * Disallow: /index.php?id Will the site with /home be indexed by search engines?
