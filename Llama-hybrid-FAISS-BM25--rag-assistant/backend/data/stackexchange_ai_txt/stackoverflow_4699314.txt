As far as I understand the guidelines, it is basically valid, but it's better to use HTML entities. From the HTML 4 reference : You should also escape & within attribute values since entity references are allowed within cdata attribute values. In addition, you should escape > as > to avoid problems with older user agents that incorrectly perceive this as the end of a tag when coming across this character in quoted attribute values. From the HTML 5 reference: Except where otherwise specified, attributes on HTML elements may have any string value, including the empty string. Except where explicitly stated, there is no restriction on what text can be specified in such attributes. So the best thing to do, as @tdammers already says, is to escape these characters (quoting the W3C reference) &amp; to represent the & sign. &lt; to represent the sign. &gt; to represent the > sign. &quot; to represent the " mark. and decoding them from their entity values if they are to be used as HTML.
