Vanishing scroll bar when using Autocomplete extender

I use the Autocomplete extender feature to get the list of suggestions from my database. There is no scroll bar for this control, so I have added a scroll bar in a panel (MS .net 2.0) which i attach to my autocomplete extender.Now the issue is with the srcoll bar. like this and add it to autocompete extender like this :CompletionListElementID="autocompleteDropDownPanel" When I call my page, I get the list of suggestions and the scroll bar appears. When I click on scroll bar or try to drag, everything just disappears. Am i doing something wrong? Is there any other way to add a scroll bar to my autocomplete extender control Any hints would be very helpful.
