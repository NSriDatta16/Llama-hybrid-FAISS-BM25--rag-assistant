It looks like you have done the t-test correctly. You have a significant pre-post result (although the difference is relatively small). For the regression model, you should have the post variable (WB_Avg2) as the outcome variable (left side) and the pre variable as the independent variable (right side). If the interaction is significant, then you'll want to focus your analysis here. To do this, I would make two-way interaction plots to examine how the response changes based on baseline value and BF_Conscientiousness. If the interaction is not significant then I would remove it from the model and just focus on the main effect interpretation. Example, if the BF_Conscientiousness coefficient is positive, then subjects with higher BF_Conscientiousness on average had a larger change in the response variable. The pre-treatment variable will probably be positive, this just indicates larger baseline values were associated with larger post-treatment values and vice versa. Note in your regression model the intercept term is the relevant test for whether or not the treatment had a significant effect while controlling for BF_Conscientiousness.
