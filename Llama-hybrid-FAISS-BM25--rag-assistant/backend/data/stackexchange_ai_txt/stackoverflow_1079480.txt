How to determine position of row in sql result-set?

i have a sql query: select id, name from table order by name result looks like this: 52 arnold 33 berta 34 chris 47 doris 52 emil for a given id=47 how can i determine the position in the result set? the result should be 4 because: 52 arnold 33 berta 34 chris are before (47, doris) and id=41 is on the 4th position in the result set. How to do this in SQL? How in HQL? In a pagination example, do i have to execute 2 statements or is there a solution where i can retrieve exactly that window which contains the row with id=47? postgreSQL and java
