I would suggest to store timestamp in the object you store in the localStorage var object = {value: "value", timestamp: new Date().getTime()} localStorage.setItem("key", JSON.stringify(object)); You can parse the object, get the timestamp and compare with the current Date, and if necessary, update the value of the object. var object = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("key")), dateString = object.timestamp, now = new Date().getTime().toString(); compareTime(dateString, now); //to implement Alternatively , you could use a light-weight wrapper like localstorage-slim.js which handles this for you.
