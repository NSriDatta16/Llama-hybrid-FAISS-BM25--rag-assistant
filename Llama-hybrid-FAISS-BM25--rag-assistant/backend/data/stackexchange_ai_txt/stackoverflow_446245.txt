As toolkit, I don't see Spring itself affecting the performance after initialization, but I think Hibernate will. How big this effect is, depends on a lot of details like the DB-Schema and how much relational layout differs from the OO layer and of course how DB-access is organized and how often DB-access happens etc. So I doubt, there is a rule of thumb to this. Just try out by developing significant prototypes using alternative applications servers or try a own small no-ORM-use-JDBC-version.
