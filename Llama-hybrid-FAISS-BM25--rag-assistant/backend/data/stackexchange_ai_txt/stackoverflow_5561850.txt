I finally figured out the solution. It will be great to share with you. Testing Using QTP: -->Install QTP_plugin for flex. This can be found in install directory of flex. -->Include the following libraries in the compiler arguments. -include-libraries "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flex Builder 3\sdks\3.5.0\frameworks\libs\automation.swc" "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flex Builder 3\sdks\3.5.0\frameworks\libs\automation_agent.swc" "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flex Builder 3\sdks\3.5.0\frameworks\libs\qtp.swc" "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flex Builder 3\sdks\3.5.0\frameworks\libs\automation_dmv.swc" and you are good to go. Remember those components which has ChildMouse property set to false will be shown in the testing as MacroMediaFlashPlayerActiveX object.
