The problem you are having right now is due to the fact that each user-agent (Browser) has their own default styles, which may differ from one and the other. Reset stylesheets exists in order to neutralize those styles and achieve a more constant rendering between user-agents. This will basically remove the issue with all elements. In that particular case, playing with margin , padding and line-height of #sidebox_bod ul li will fix your problem: #sidebox_bod ul { margin: 0; padding: 0 16px; line-height: 1em; } I would recommend using a Reset CSS though, as that will solve most of those problems for all elements.
