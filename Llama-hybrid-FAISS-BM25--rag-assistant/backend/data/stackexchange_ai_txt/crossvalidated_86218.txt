There's value in simplicity. Let's assume your logistic regression model trained on feature 7 had intercept $a$ and coefficient $b$ for feature 7. This means the model predicts 1 whenever feature 7 exceeds value $-a/b$ and predicts 0 otherwise. You get the best of both worlds using this model -- your model is extremely simple to describe and implement, and at the same time it has perfect cross-validation accuracy.
