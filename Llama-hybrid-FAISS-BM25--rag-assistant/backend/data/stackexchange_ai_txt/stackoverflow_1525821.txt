The answer to this is complicated. Not only does it depend on the number of tables involved, but it can also depend on what storage engine you're using. Having said that, this is what the manual says: COUNT(*) is optimized to return very quickly if the SELECT retrieves from one table, no other columns are retrieved, and there is no WHERE clause. For example: mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student; This optimization applies only to MyISAM tables only, because an exact row count is stored for this storage engine and can be accessed very quickly. For transactional storage engines such as InnoDB, storing an exact row count is more problematic because multiple transactions may be occurring, each of which may affect the count. -- MySQL Manual
