ExtJs sortable elements list

Is there any implementation of sortable list in ExtJs as JQuery UI .sortable has ? Or how could I drop element using jQuery UI sortbale from eastern panel of ExtJs layout to droppable sortable element in central panel of layout ? Now dragging element hides under layout :(
