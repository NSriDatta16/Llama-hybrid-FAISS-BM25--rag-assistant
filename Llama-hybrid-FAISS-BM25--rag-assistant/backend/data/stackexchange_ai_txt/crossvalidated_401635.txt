Very High Training Accuracy and very low Testing Accuracy CNN

I'm using 3 layer CNN with 8, 16, and 32 filters, each of size 5 X 5. I'm getting an training accuracy of 99.97%. Testing accuracy of 41.11%. Total classes: 605 Train Set: Each class has 7 samples Test Set: Each class has 1 sample. Is the ratio of train and test set causing the huge difference in the train and test accuracy?
