I don't believe that is a question we can answer for you. To give you a reasonable estimate, we'd need to know several things: What are your testing goals? (Code coverage, defects found/fixed, requirements tested, etc.) How much time have you spent testing on similar projects? What quality issues did you encounter on those projects? (Too many defects discovered, severity of defects acceptable/unacceptable) Have you done any test planning yet? How many defects did the unit testing uncover? Were there areas of greater/lesser concern? How did you address those? What kind of test analysis will you be doing? There are metrics that you could use to help give you a rough estimate for this kind of work, but the problem is that they really need to be tuned to your environment to give meaningful estimates. One measure might suggest 2 months for testing, but you might not realize that your environment requires twice that time until you commit to 2 months and find out that you really needed 4.
