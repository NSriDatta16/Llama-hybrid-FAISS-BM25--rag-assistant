Can recurrent dropout be used as a Bayesian approximation?

To express model uncertainty in LSTM, we can use dropout as a Bayesian approximation for Gaussian model according to this , (dropout is kept during inference and that will result in a distribution of prediction based on my understanding). My question, does this apply to recurrent dropout as well, proposed here ? The dashed line in the below figure illustrates the recurrent dropout I am talking about, which was proposed in the mentioned paper.
