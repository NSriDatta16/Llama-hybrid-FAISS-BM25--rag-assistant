If I understand correctly, in each month, you measure several individuals once. Then you work out the mean and standard deviation of some variable. Without knowing anything else I'd base confidence intervals on the t-distribution; the intervals would be a bit wider than those using a multiplier of 1.96, but it would take a small sample to show much difference. However, you are saying nothing about what it is that is being measured or counted, and depending on that and what its distribution is like, the quality of a t-distribution approximation might vary a bit. Also, nothing in your analysis addresses any dependence in time that might exist, but as you are averaging across individuals within months that is not necessarily an issue. You might want to consider whether there are dependencies between individuals that are biting. All that said, your situation sounds good. You've checked your procedure by simulation and your coverage is a bit more than expected. Few researchers could say as much, and if it were me, I would not go further and try to correct anything. No need to fix what is not evidently broken.
