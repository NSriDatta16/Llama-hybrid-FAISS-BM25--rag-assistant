Time Series Normalization by row or by columns?

In times series forecasting when I perform a "global training" learning from many time series simultaneously for example (SVM regression, Neural Networks and etc..). I can normalise each time series separately to mean = 0 and std = 1. If all data is matrix where each time series is a row it would call it "row wise" normalisation. Or I can normalise by column, so mean and std of each feature will have 0 and 1. $$ DATA:\\ t^1_1, t^1_2, t^1_3, t^1_4 \\ t^2_1, t^2_2, t^2_3, t^2_4 \\ t^3_1, t^3_2, t^3_3, t^3_4 $$ Just to make it more clear: upper index (new row) indicates a new time series. $\\{\mathbb{E}}(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4) = 0 \ \ \ \ {\bf VS} \ \ \ \ \ {\mathbb{E}}(t^1_1, t^2_1, t^3_1)=0$ What is a better "practice/ theory"?
