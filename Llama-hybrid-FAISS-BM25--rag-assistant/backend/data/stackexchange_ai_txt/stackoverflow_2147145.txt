I'd suggest you grab the source code to gnuplot or RRDTool (or even Flot) and examine how they approach this problem. The general case is likely to be N labels applied based on width of your plot, which some kind of 'snapping' to the nearest 'nice' number. Every time I've written such an algorithm (too many times really), I've used a table of 'preferences'... ie: based on the time range on the plot, decide if I'm using Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes etc as the main axis point. I usually included some preferred formatting, as I rarely want to see the date for each minute I plot on the graph. I'd be happy but surprised to find someone using a formula (like Heckbert does) to find 'nice', as the variation in time units between minutes, hours, days, and weeks are not that linear.
