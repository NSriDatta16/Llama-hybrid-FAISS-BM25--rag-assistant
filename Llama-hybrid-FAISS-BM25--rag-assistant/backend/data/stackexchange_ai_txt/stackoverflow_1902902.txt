Here is the error that occurs when loading the page: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; MS-RTC LM 8) Timestamp: Mon, 14 Dec 2009 19:15:40 UTC Message: 'this.iframe.contentDocument' is null or not an object Line: 16 Char: 239089 Code: 0 URI: http://docs.dojocampus.org/moin_static185/js/dojo/trunk/docs/layer.js I'm guessing this just means that their documentation just doesn't work in IE, so the framework itself may or may not work in IE. But if they can't even make their docs work in IE, that doesn't leave me very hopeful.
