It depends on the SDK version. In 3.2, use UIGestureRecognizer . Prior to 3.2 use touchesBegan and friends. This is especially true when dealing with a UIScrollView because UIGestureRecognizer will cancel touchesBegan . So if you want to be forwards and backwards compatible you have to do both with a UIScrollView. For your particular case, use UISwipeGestureRecognizer or UIPanGestureRecognizer . You will have to implement gestureRecognizer:shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer: to prevent the UIScrollView from canceling your gesture recognizers. UITableViewController -> UITableView : UIScrollView
