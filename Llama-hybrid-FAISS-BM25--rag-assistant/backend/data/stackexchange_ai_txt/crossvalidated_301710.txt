For question 1: It seems like a regression would answer your question, although I agree with the suggestion of PCA above. You would get an estimate of the effects of each variable on profit: In R, this would be something like (with your own field names): model1 You could see which values appear statistically significant, and assess whether you trust the model by testing the normal linear models assumptions (e.g. independence of residuals, equal variance of residuals etc.) If you want to, refit the model omitting factors that are not significant (but recheck before using). It is a bit more complicated if you have repeated measures, e.g. the same person measured each months. These measurements will be correlated, and you need to adjust for this or you will get poor estimation of your model's standard errors. If this is the case, you would be best looking at linear mixed model with random intercepts for clusters, such as lmer in the lme4 package in R, or maybe Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) for the overall effects of each predictor. For question 2 Use your model to predict expected profit and compare it to observed profit. The ones with the highest ratio of observed profit/expected profit would be your 'best performers.'
