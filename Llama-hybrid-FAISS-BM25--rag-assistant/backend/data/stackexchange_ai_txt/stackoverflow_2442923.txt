sqlite - Foreign keys in VS2008 Designer

I'm starting over to use strong typed datasets in VS 2008 with sqlite and running into a problem. I have some tables that have foreign keys allready defined in the database. I can see those in the Server-Explorer. Now i create a new strong typed Dataset with the designer and add only one table from that realtion to the dataset. Then i like to add the second one and i get an error message "Unexpected error ... Source: Microsoft.VSDesigner; ErrorCode:-1" No Additional Info. The error does not occure if i add both tables at the same time (say i drag them from the serverexplorer). Is there any way to add subsequent tables to an dataset that are in relation(s) to alreay added once? Many thanks _rene
