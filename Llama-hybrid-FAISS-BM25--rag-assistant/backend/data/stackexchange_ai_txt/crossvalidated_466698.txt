Normal distribution filter layer for NN

I am wondering if there is a layer in Keras (or any other way) to perform a weighted average according a normal distribution over an input array inside a model. The normal distribution parameters would be given from another model which is taking different inputs. This “layer” would be used on multiple arrays of inputs inside a larger model in which I am trying to optimize a final output (see the simplified example in the figure below). I am currently trying to do the job of that “layer” with CNN and LSTM layers but I don’t get good results. I guess my input arrays are too big (1000 time steps) for the size of my dataset (40000 time steps). Thanks!
