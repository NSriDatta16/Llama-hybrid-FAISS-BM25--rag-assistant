Not the question you asked, but... In C++/g++, you can have a class where the declared [header] methods are never actually defined in the source [.cc] files as long as those methods are never invoked. As a consequence, you can copy your current code files to a temporary directory, do a hack and slash job on them, run a [manual] binary search, and isolate the problem fairly quickly. Not elegant, but highly effective. Aside from the infamous "Static Initialization Order" issue, there are also more esoteric cases such as the one recently pointed out to me here on SO by Charles Bailey (see the comments). E.g Mixing: int p [] = { 1,2,3 }; And: extern int * p; Will produce a similar coredump problem.
