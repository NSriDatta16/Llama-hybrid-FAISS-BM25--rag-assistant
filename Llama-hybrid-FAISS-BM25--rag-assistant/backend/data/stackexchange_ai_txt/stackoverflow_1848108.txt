This is a Seattle.rb project. Somehow they have re-organized their homepage. The correct link is now http://SeattleRb.**RubyForge.**Org/UPnP/ instead of just http://SeattleRb.Org/UPnP/ You can find all the UPnP projects on the Seattle.rb homepage or on the Seattle.rb RubyForge page , near the bottom of the page, with links to their RDocs.
