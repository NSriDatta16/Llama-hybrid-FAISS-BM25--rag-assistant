Assuming a very high volume of conversion events (millions per day or more), a storage engine alone (MongoDB or anything else) won't help you. What you need is the ability to run map-reduce jobs on the data in order to calculate the analytics. You can scale-out your cluster as necessary to achieve near-real time performance. The free/open-source options that I can suggest are Hadoop (and probably HBase and Hive) or Riak. There are other options - I'm only suggesting these two because I've personal experience with them in a high scale production environment. We're currently using Hadoop to power an analytics system processing billions of events per day. If you're not into rolling your own and are able and willing to pay (a lot!) then look at GreenPlum and Vertica. I'll be happy to share more information on potential solution designs - but I'll need more data on what you're trying to achieve - scale, use cases etc.
