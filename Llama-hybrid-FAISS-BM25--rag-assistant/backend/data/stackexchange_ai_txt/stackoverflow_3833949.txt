Based on line number I'm primarily running a different version of Magento than you, but if you look at Action.php , you'll see something like this protected function _setActiveMenu($menuPath) { $this->getLayout()->getBlock('menu')->setActive($menuPath); return $this; } The call to $this->getLayout()->getBlock('menu') is supposed to return a block object, but if your system it isn't. The most likely culprit here in one of your extensions is removing the block named menu from your layout, or one of your developers fiddled with some layout and/or Core files. In your development environment remove all your modules. If the problem goes away, re-enable until it starts again and you'll know which module is causing you a problem. If the problem doesn't go away, grab a fresh copy of Magento and start diffing files.
