I would recommend to report $p$-values and if you have the space go for the test statistics and rejection region. But there is a reason behind that as in the most research journals and software you can see $p$-values. First of all, let me say that the conclusions based on $p$-values and rejection region approach is basically the same i.e. if your $p$-values is less that or equal to $\alpha$ (i.e. your significance level) then the test statistic will fall into the rejection region and vice versa. The rejection region method only provides a decision for a specific value of $\alpha$. However by providing the $p$-values, your reader not only can make his/her decision based on that particular $\alpha$ level but also he/she can see all possible values for $\alpha$ in which the null hypothesis can be rejected. As a result, the $p$-value provides more flexibility than the rejection region method. You can also have a look at the last paragraph in page 449 of "Statistical Ideas and Methods" by Jessica Utts, Robert Heckard here that addresses this property.
