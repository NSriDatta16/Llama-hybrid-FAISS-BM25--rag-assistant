Is Hibernate / JPA taking in consideration the transient modifier ( not the annotation )

I want to avoid serialisation ( in JMS / AMF ) but still persist the field with JPA/Hibernate. Is the transient modifier my friend ? Are @Transient annotation and the transient modifier related or not a all ? The java specification precise that a transient field will not be saved to a persistent storage by a system service. But is hibernate a system service ? ( i dont think so ) http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/classes.doc.html#78119 And java.io.Serialisable seams to indicate that a out.writeObject and in.readObject are called for serialisation http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html Any insight ? Maybe should i just write a quick test, but i will be more confident with a piece of spec. Thank !
