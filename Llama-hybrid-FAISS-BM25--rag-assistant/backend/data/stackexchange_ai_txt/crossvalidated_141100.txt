Principal component analysis for questionnaire data - is it allowed to combine repeated measures into one data set?

My participants evaluated 8 different situations via questionnaire items and I now want to conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) on the questionnaire items to extract the underlying factors. My problem is, that I only had 10 participants, which is far too few for a PCA. My idea would be to create a data set where I would treat each evaluation of a subject of a situation as a new "participant", i.e. I would treat the dependent evaluations of the different situations as independent as if every time a new subject would have answered the questionnaire. This results in 80 subjects, which are in reality 10 subjects evaluating 8 different situations. I could not find anything yet if this is a problem for the PCA, but my gut feeling says that only independent values should go into the PCA.
