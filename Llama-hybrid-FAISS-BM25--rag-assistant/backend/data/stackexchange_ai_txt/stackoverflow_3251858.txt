Why people always encourage single js for a website?

I read some website development materials on the Web and every time a person is asking for the organization of a website's js, css, html and php files, people suggest single js for the whole website. And the argument is the speed. I clearly understand the fewer request there is, the faster the page is responded. But I never understand the single js argument. Suppose you have 10 webpages and each webpage needs a js function to manipulate the dom objects on it. Putting 10 functions in a single js and let that js execute on every single webpage, 9 out of 10 functions are doing useless work. There is CPU time wasting on searching for non-existing dom objects. I know that CPU time on individual client machine is very trivial comparing to bandwidth on single server machine. I am not saying that you should have many js files on a single webpage. But I don't see anything go wrong if every webpage refers to 1 to 3 js files and those js files are cached in client machine. There are many good ways to do caching. For example, you can use expire date or you can include version number in your js file name. Comparing to mess the functionality in a big js file for all needs of many webpages of a website, I far more prefer split js code into smaller files. Any criticism/agreement on my argument? Am I wrong? Thank you for your suggestion.
