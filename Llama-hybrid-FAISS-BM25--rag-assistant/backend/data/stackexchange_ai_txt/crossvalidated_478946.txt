MWE of zero-sum mask in the context of machine learning

Federated Learning seems to have a lot of potential, I understand it can be done using different techniques, e.g. functional encryption, etc. The simplest seems to be zero-sum masks. For TensorFlow this is e.g. described here and here . I've tried to find an example of what this looks like, but there isn't much online, there is a short discussion on the signal-processing SE, but it wasn't very illuminating. There is maybe something on this Chegg , but paywall. Would anyone have a MWE of doing aggregation using zero-sum masks?
