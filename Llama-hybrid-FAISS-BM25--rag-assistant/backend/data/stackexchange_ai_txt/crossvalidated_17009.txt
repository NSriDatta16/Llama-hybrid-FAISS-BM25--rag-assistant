Satisfying requirement (1) is trivial: just enter the start time in a cell, enter the next time in the array below it, select the two, and drag down as far as you like. Excel will extend this to an arithmetic progression of times. Alternatively, place the start time in one cell, then in the cell below it add a small increment: =E2+Duration Requirement (2) uses a simple trick: the number of batches running at time $t$ must equal the number of batches started on or before $t$ minus the number of batches ended on or before $t$. (This trick would be the basis for an efficient implementation in any platform, not just Excel.) Count these with formulas like =COUNTIF(Start, " and =COUNTIF(End, " (where E2 is a cell containing $t$, [Start] is a named range for the "startTime" data, and [End] is a named range for the "endTime" data). Here's an example using a small part of your data. (Extending it to 15000 rows and, say, 2800 time periods will be no problem and should recalculate almost instantly. The graph should be changed to a scatterplot to accommodate that many time periods, though.)
