What is the relation between a loss function and an energy function?

A loss function is a function that measures the distance between the expected value and the actual value of a model (an example of a loss function is the cross entropy). An energy function can be defined as a function that we want to minimise or maximise and it is a function of the variables of the system. It is referred to as "energy function" because it is often related or compared to the concept of "energy" in physics. These two expression seem to refer to the same concept. Is there any difference between a loss function and an energy function (especially, in machine learning and computer vision)?
