Chaining Core Animation animations

Which is the most elegant and modular way to chain animation in a Core Animation context? I mean to do animations that starts just when other finished (for example, changing position and then opacity ).. normal approach is to directly change properties: layer.position = new_point; layer.opacity = 0.0f; but this will do them at the same time. I want to make one wait for the other. And what about chaining animations for different objects? I've read about CATransaction used like: [CATransaction begin] layer1.property = new_property; [CATransaction begin] layer2.property2 = new_property2; [CATransaction commit]; [CATransaction commit]; but it doesn't seem to work..
