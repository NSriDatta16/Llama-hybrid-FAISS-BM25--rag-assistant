How can Hinge loss be upper bound of the 0-1 loss?

I just have a question and I did not find clear explanation, hinge loss is upper bound of 0-1 loss, so does this mean upper bound regard to a single point loss such as 0 or 1 ?!. So, for example the 0-1 loss for set of points is 0 or 1, and for hinge loss we have continuous loss values from 0 to inf. So, by comparing the set of loss values for 0-1 loss and hinge loss we find the lower bound is 0 and upper bound is 1. I am right?!. This is the link: https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/learning_theory_class/lecture3.pdf . Please see the page 3, the first paragraph under the title "Conditional Î¦-risk and classification calibration". Thanks
