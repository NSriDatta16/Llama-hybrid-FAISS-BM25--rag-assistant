R package for classification and outlier detection together

I have a similar problem as this one . My training samples contain N observations and K>2 classes. I want to classify my test samples into one of the K classes, or as an outlier if it is far from any known class. Is there any R(preferred) or Python package to solve this? One method I can think of is to use some sort of Gaussian fitting. I fit my in-sample data to get K Gaussian distributions, then for new samples I check its probability w.r.t each of the K distributions. If the largest one is above some threshold, I classify it to the class with largest prob, else it's an outlier. Is there a package to do this? Or preferreably a more sophisticated approach. This approach suffers from curse of dimensionality I think. Maybe random forest? SVM? The gausspr in R package kernlab seems to provide this. But after fitting, predict(..., type = 'probabilities') only gives normalised probability (prob for K classes to sum to 1). Can I get the raw score before normalisation?
