Orange does not have over/undersampling. Our reasoning is that if you model a problem with 10% positive class, than you should not train the model with 50:50 class distribution - it will not reflect the real life. However, there's an option in Orange in LogReg and Random Forest to balance class distribution , which considers class distribution when building a model.
