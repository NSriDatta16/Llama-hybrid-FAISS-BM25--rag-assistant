Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD) is an algorithm for finding the distance between phrases. WMD is based on word embeddings (e.g., word2vec) which encode the semantic meaning of words into dense vectors. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. For example: Source: "From Word Embeddings To Document Distances" Paper The gensim package has a WMD implementation . For your problem, you would compare the Purchase Order items and the Invoice items. Find the items that have the lowest WMD.
