Perhaps you should check your port settings: new URL(hostName + "/" + serviceName); Looks like the port number ":8080" is missing. Some server expect additional information from the client in the request like a user agent or some form data. Even cookies could be expected by the application running on the server. You should also check the complete response and not only the response code. I would recommend you to use a library like httpclient that is more convenient: https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/index.html Here is simple usage example: https://github.com/apache/httpcomponents-client/blob/master/httpclient5/src/test/java/org/apache/hc/client5/http/examples/ClientWithResponseHandler.java
