WPF : GridViewColumn.Header drag (reorder) problem

In my WPF Application I have an GridViewColumn that looks like this: New items ... I am unable to drag/reorder the column if I click and drag on any of the subobjects like the path or the textblock. Only if I click on the free space I am able to drag this column. How will I make the whole column drag able again?
