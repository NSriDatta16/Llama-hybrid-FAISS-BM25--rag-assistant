a.* : select all fields from the table a, which is actually the tables '#__k2_items' having a different alias specified by the 'as' keyword. c.name and the other similar expressions: select the field 'name' from the table 'c', which is again the table #__k2_categories. c.alias as categoryalias and the other similar expressions: renaming (aliasing) the field 'alias' in c.alias to 'categoryalias'. Basically, as others already said: anything before the dot is the table name and anything after the table name is the field name. The 'as' statement as used to change the name. This is useful to have a useful name as the output of the SQL query. For example, you may be selecting two averages from two tables, one of them is PhD student average and the other is MSc student average, so you can change the name of the fields to make it easier to understand which average is from which table. Sometimes to make the syntax simpler, especially when you are selecting fields from many tables, you rename a table as you did for 'a' and 'c'.
