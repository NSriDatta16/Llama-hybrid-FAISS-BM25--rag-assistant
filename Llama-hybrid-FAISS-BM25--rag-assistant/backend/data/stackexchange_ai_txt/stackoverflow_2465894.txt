John's rule: always try to avoid writing your own security software. It's too easy to make mistakes like encrypting instead of hashing, not using salts, etc. You won't find many security experts to review your code, but you can expect that quite a few have looked at the more popular open source systems. Firstly, can you use OpenID or Shibboleth to avoid giving people yet another system that they need a password on -- I'd thank you if I could use an existing account! If the answer is no, then for password storage, try a free LDAP server such as OpenDS or Apache Directory Server . Use Spring Security or similar to manage the logins, and the remember-me. (There's a nice video that introduces spring security.) You will need to use SSL (https) as mentioned in other answers if you want your system to communicate passwords from client to server.
