You should have a look at Jolokia , a full featured JSON/HTTP adapter for JMX. It supports and has been tested on JBoss as well as on many other platforms. Jolokia is an agent, which is deployed as a normal Java EE war, so you simply drop it into your deploy directory within you JBoss installation. Also, there a some client libraries available, e.g. jmx4perl which allows for programatic access to the agent. There is much more to discover and it is actively developed.
