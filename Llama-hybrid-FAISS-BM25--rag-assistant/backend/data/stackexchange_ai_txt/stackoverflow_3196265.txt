For the record, the Telerik Upload control for ASP.NET now includes three "modes:" Standards: Uses normal HTML file upload (single file at a time, requires postback) Silverlight: Automatically renders Telerik Silverlight upload control Flash: Automatically renders Flash upload control You only need to configure the single ASP.NET upload, and if the plug-ins are available, you can offer your users a "premium" experience (multifile upload, drag-and-drop to upload, and even multiple files in a single post .) This is great from a progressive enhancement (or graceful degradation) design perspective, too, since it allows you to easily address users with and without rich browser plug-ins. For a simple async upload, I've also used jQuery in the past. Specifically, " Ajax Upload " by Andrew Valums. It uses the IFRAME-hack to simulate async file uploads, but it's easy to setup and use. Hope these options help.
