If you really want to understand how this works, read the tutorials for any of the GUI tool kits. You write code that uses a library to build a GUI. For a great example install python and the wxPython and its demo. The demo provides runnable sample programs for every GUI widget in a great format - one tab shows the UI and the other shows the code. The GUI is created from the code, unlike some environment where you drag controls and the code is created for you. There are of course NxM ways to do this, where N is the number of toolkits and M is the number of languages. I just pointed out that the wxPython combination has great examples. I've also done a little GTK with Pyhon and the online docs are good too. Examples can be found in other languages of course.
