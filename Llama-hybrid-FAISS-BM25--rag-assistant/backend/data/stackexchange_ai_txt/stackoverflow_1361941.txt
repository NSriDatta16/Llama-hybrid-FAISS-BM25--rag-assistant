Does anyone know what this is and why this works? It’s a “bug” in the compiler: for reasons of syntactical consistency with the declaration, references to an array x may also be written as x() ; thus, it is possible to write the following code: Dim x() As Integer x() = SomeFunctionReturningAnArray() Well, some programmers think this is more consistent than writing x = … . (I thought so, too, for a time.) That you can use it in front of dereferencing the array is simply a hole in the syntax validation, though.
