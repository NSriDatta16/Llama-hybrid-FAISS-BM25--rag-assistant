What is the role of the bias in neural networks?

I'm aware of the gradient descent and the back-propagation algorithm. What I don't get is: when is using a bias important and how do you use it? For example, when mapping the AND function, when I use two inputs and one output, it does not give the correct weights. However, when I use three inputs (one of which is a bias), it gives the correct weights.
