Back propagation neural network data input advice

I am currently doing a project which involves pothole detection and neural networks. So far, I have an Android phone that reads Accelerometer readings and writes the X,Y,Z Axis aswell as the Amplitude and current timestamp into a CSV file. The data is then normalized using min-max normalization and uses the Y axis readings from the CSV file. The problem I am facing for the neural network to learn a pothole is the fact that what data should I feed to the Back Propagation Neural Network? Shall I set a threshold and when the Y axis reaches this point, get the 5 previous points and 5 points after and then feed the network with 11 inputs? I don't want to overtrain the network nor feed it with data in different positions each time. Training - I am also starting to gather the data collected and create a training dataset - should I put things such as readings for normal/bumpy roads/speed bumps as well as potholes? How large should a training set be? or is 'the more data the better it is' actually true? This is what the pothole data looks like. This is how the speedbump data looks like.
