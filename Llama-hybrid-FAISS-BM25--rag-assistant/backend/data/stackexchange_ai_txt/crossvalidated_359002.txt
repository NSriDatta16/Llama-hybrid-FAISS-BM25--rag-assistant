Can I ask what your sample size is? Are you planning on running all those tests? Is there no other way of reorganizing your data? If not, why not use the following multinomial model: DV = IV1 + IV2 + IV3 + IV4 + IV5 + IV6 + IV7 where each of your nominal categories are dummy variables (1,0) and your IV 8 is your baseline?
