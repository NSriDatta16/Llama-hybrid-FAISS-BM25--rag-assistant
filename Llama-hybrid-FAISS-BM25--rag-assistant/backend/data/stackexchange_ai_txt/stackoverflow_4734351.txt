I would strongly recommend getting hold of an MVC framework and figure out how to create applications with it. Without taking time out to "study" web application development, complying with the development pattern enforced by a framework is the best best to writing maintainable web applications. I have twice (in two different companies) come across projects that started as small hacks, didn't follow much structural organisation of code and ended up being extremely messy to enhance later on.
