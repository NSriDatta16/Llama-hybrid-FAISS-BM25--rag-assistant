Refactor "using" directives over an entire codebase?

One of the things I love about Visual Studio 2008 is the ability to refactor and reorganize the "using" directives in source code files (this may have been in 2005 as well, I don't remember). Specifically, I'm talking about how you can have it both reorganize the directives to be alphabetical (though with the core FCL libraries floating to the top) and removing any directives which don't need to be there (either never used or no longer used). Is there any way to automate this refactoring (the sorting and trimming) across an entire old codebase? Either through all of the files in a solution or across multiple solution files.
