Given that you have a repeated measures design a Chi-square test is not appropriate anymore, since it assumes independence of data. There is no workaround with it, you need a different model. Given that your dependent variable is categorical a logistic regression model could work. However, because your DV is also a count variable then a logistic model would not really work so you need a Poisson model. And because there is dependence in the data you need a Poisson mixed model, where your individuals are your random effects.
