Although most of the answers so far are all around detection on the user agent (browser) itself, it sounds like from your mention of ASP.NET that you'd like to make this detection happen on the server-side. If so, you have a couple of options. First you can sniff the HTTP request headers coming from the user agent. A computer and browser with Java installed will usually include a header providing a hint of this to the server that you can pick up on. Here are some useful links on this approach: http://www.developershome.com/wap/detection/ https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Browscap The other option you have is to send down javascript to the user agent to perform the detection using one of the techniques in the other answers in this question and then use ajax callbacks to tell the server what you discovered.
