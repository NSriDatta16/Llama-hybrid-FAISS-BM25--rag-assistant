Unfortunately you can't declare two indexers with the same parameter list. The following paragraph is taken from here C# Programming Guide - Using Indexers "Remarks" section : The signature of an indexer consists of the number and types of its formal parameters. It does not include the indexer type or the names of the formal parameters. If you declare more than one indexer in the same class, they must have different signatures. You will have to declare a different set of parameters if you wish to use the second indexer.
