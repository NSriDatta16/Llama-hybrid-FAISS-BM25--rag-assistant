For one thing, paragraph names must be unique unless they are in separate sections, so sections allow for "namespacing" of paragraphs. If I recall correctly, the only reason you must use a SECTION is for DECLARATIVES . Aside from that they are optional and primarily useful for grouping paragraphs. I think it's common (relatively speaking, anyway) to require that PERFORM be used on paragraphs only when they are in the same section.
