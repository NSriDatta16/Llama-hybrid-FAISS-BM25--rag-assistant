How to make technical training session useful and successful for trainee?

Are these suggestions good to give for a successful training session? Practice time should be always given immediate after technical training? usually after receiving any technical session about any new thing we do routine work. If we don't do practice just after training, later when we do any work related to that training then we feel we need training again. So if we are getting training today and will not use it for some period of time (15 -30 -60 days) then the training is of no use, as it is at the wrong time. I.e. We will forget many things Any other suggestions which i should give? I'm trainee not trainer. What suggestion should i give to trainer/organizer?
