Your application sounds like it needs a database. If you can afford, use one. But don't use an embedded database engine like sqlite for a file over a network storage, since it may be too unstable for your purposes. If you still want to use something like it, you have to use it through your own reader/writer process with your own access protocol, stability concerns still applies if you use a text based file format like XML instead, so you will have to do same for them. I can't be certain without knowing your workload though.
