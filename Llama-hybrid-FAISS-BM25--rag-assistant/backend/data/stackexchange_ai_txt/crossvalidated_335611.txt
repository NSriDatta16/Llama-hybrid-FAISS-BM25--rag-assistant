Generally, to build a baseline, I take a look what my data is - specially the fraction of classes, how many classes there are and finally how many features. In your case, saying "Yes" to everything increases the sensitivity but I am assuming that's not what you want to do, for obvious reasons. I will share my rule of thumb for building baseline in your case (rather what I know about your case): Its a binary classification problem: First thing that clicks me is SVMs - as it has been said by others - SVMs gives you an optimal solution whereas most other approaches will give you a good enough solution. In machine learning terms SVMs have low variance. Since, your classes are way imbalanced, I would suggest using appropriate class weights - for SVMs or whatever classifiers you choose. I am assuming you have a lot of features. If you don't, ignore this step. If you do, reduce these features by random forest feature ranking or some other supervised feature reduction techniques. I would advise PCA since its unsupervised and you may end-up getting undesirable results because high class imbalance.
