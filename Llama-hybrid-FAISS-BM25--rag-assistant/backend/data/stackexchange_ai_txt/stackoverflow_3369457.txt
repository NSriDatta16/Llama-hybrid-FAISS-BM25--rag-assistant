IE float no padding bug

I am trying to create a HTML form, and I am floating the labels left, and the inputs right, now in FF it works fine and in IE8 as well, but when I go over to IE7, the line breaks seem to dissapear completely, I have NO space in between my elements, what could it be? How can I fix it? Gender: Select one Male Female Name: Now for some reason I have NO space in between the paragraphs in IE7 even though I am using breaks. Thanx in advance.
