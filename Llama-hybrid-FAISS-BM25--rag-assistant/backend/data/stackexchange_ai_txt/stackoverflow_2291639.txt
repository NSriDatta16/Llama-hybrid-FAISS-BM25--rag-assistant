Watin from TeamCity not running as a Windows Service

I'm trying to run Watin from within a TeamCity build, using nUnit. All tests run fine locally. I know you cannot run the full Watin tests (i.e. POST) from TeamCity if it is running as a Windows Service. You must start the build agent from a .bat file. But, I don't want to have to login to the server for it to start. I've tried getting a Scheduled Task (in Windows Server 2008) to fire the agent.bat file on StartUp (not Login), but with no luck. Has anyone else got Watin/TeamCity running from a Scheduled Task? Thanks, Pete
