High initial test validation score for Neural Network

From only the first epoch of training my NN with SGD (I use Xavier initialisation for weights), the accuracy shoots off to 92%, and then flattens out. The same thing happens with loss (but lower, of course). Is this a sign of overfitting, and if so: what can I do to decrease it?
