Can I get Raid disk status by using PS?

I have a HP server with Raid 5. Port 0 and 1 are used for data & OS mirroring. The software come with the Raid 5 is Intel Matrix Storage Manager and there is manager console as windows based api to view all the ports, including their status. Now they are all in Normal status. I am not sure if the OS/Windows has some APIs or .Net classes to access raid ports and get their status? If so, how can I use PS to get the information? Do I have to reference to the dlls provided by the Intel Matrix Storage Manager if not? Basically, I would like to write a PS script to get read status. In case any of port disk is not normal, a message will be sent out by growl protocol.
