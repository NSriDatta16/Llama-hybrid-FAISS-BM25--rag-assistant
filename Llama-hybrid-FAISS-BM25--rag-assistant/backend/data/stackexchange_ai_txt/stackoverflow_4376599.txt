Downgrading Magento

I'm using Magento 1.4.1.1 for my webstore. The payment processor supports only 1.4.0.0. I realized this only just now when I was dreaming up of opening the store. Duh! Poor planning. What's the way out? Will downgrading help? Wat are the implications of that? Thanks for any and all inputs.
