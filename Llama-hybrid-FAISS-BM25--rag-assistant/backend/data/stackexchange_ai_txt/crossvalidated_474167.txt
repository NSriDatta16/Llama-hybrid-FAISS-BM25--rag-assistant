Parameters identifiability / estimation in Bayesian linear state-space models

Is it possible to tell if the parameters can be uniquely estimated in a Bayesian state-space models from the system equations (beyond redundant parameterisations). If so, how? For example, should it be possible to estimate the parameters in the following model? \begin{align} x_t &= N(r\times x_{t-1}, \sigma _x)\\ y_t &= Po(\exp(\mu + p\times x_t)) \end{align} where $x$ is the state variable and $y$ the observations. This parameterisation is taken from this paper -- and my previous question . If interested, I am motivated by trying to fit the univariate state-space model with a Gaussian state and Poisson distributed observations below but different chains converge to different values which I think indicates an issue with the parameterisation. Issues remain if I restrict the parameters $p$ and $\mu$ to be positive. library(rjags) mod The data set.seed(1); r = 0.8; sx = 2 mu = 5; p = 0.5; tm = 20 x = y = rep(0,tm); x[1] = rnorm(1, 0, sx) ; y[1] = rpois(1, exp(mu + p*x[1])) for(i in 2:tm){ x[i] = rnorm(1, r*x[i-1], sx) y[i] = rpois(1, exp(mu + p*x[i])) }
