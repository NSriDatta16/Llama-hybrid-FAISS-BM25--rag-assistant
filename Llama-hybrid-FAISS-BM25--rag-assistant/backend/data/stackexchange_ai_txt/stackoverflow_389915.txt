You sure you'll be storing that much data in your session storage? Typical use of a session for a single user is a few hundred bytes! As for serializing and de serializing, with that kinda small size is negilable. Of course you'll be expecting more users than that, but still. If your storing large amounts data in your session, then IMO, your doing it wrong.
