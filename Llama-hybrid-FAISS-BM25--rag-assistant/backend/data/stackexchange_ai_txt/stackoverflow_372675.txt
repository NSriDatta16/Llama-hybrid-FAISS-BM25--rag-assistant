Labview is great for controlling hardware. I have written several Labview apps for collecting data (analog voltage from various sensors) and control hardware (mostly piezoelectric motors). Labview makes it fairly easy to perform several tasks in parallel. Now to answer your question. What do I find frustrating about Labview. Time spent organizing block diagram moving wires around organizing nodes Perhaps, since I am self taught I spend too much time trying to clean up wires and trying to follow them in an attempt to deciphers what data they are carrying and where it is going. Point and clicking through the toolbox thing looking for the node/function that I want to place in the block diagram or front panel. I should just be able to type the name of the function/method I need with the parameters and get going instead of... "hmmm... I need the calculate RMS vi now where would that be? now I need an AND operation. OK back up to top level, to logical functions, which one of these is AND oh right it's that one. Drop on diagram wire it up and test! Well that only took 15 minutes!." But there probably is a more efficient way to work with Labview, I just don't know it!
