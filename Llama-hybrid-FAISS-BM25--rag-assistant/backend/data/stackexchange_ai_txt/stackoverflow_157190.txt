You can't checkout a working copy, a working copy is the term used for code that has already been checked out. If you are asking multiple developers to work with the same set of working files at the same time, then you are seriously undermining one of the main uses of having a version control system, which is to allow your developers to make changes independently of one another without breaking things for anyone else. That said, if you really want to do this you can. With a Linux server, the way to go is to have each of your users running a different ssh user agent (for windows machines we use Pagent ) with a different ssh identity for each user. Then have the svn server recognize the ssh-tunnels from different identities as being from different users. Unfortunately, I don't know how to set that up in Windows.
