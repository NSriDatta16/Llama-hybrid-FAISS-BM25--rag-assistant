If you don't mind reformatting before diffing, you could reformat each paragraph into one very long line, and then use a diff tool that shows intra-line differences (in addition to line differences, which in your case would represent paragraph differences). Alternately, with more clever reformatting, you could reformat each paragraph such that there is one sentence per line.
