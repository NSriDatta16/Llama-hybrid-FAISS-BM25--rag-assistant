Now, highlight the entire new section you've just created, and drag it down to the bottom of your data area. Highlight the whole block of new data, hit Ctrl-C, and then right click somwhere and choose "Paste Special". In the dialog that appears, choose "Values", and hit "OK". Now you can move this new block anywhere you want without regard to other cells. Finally, you will need to delete every other row of your newly pasted data, beginning with the second row.
