These lines seem to have a Bufferoverflow frag->seq = malloc (5 * sizeof (char)); strcpy (frag->seq, "55555"); Because the string 55555 will also include a terminating zero character that is also written into memory outside the allocated 5 bytes. Instead you could use strdup() which allocates and copies a string frag->seq = strdup("55555");
