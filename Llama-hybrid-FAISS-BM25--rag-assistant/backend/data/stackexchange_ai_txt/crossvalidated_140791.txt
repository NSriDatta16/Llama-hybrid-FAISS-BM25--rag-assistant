How to destandardize PCA scores in R

I ran PCA in R using the principal() function in the "psych" package. Suppose my dataset is called "data" (118 rows and 8 columns). The 8 variables are answers from a questionnaire, with a scale that ranges from 1 to 7. From the PCA, 2 principal components are extracted. Next, I ran again the principal function in order to apply the varimax orthogonal rotation. pc_rotated The scores could be extracted by: scores My question is: how do I destandardize the scores I get? I need the two components in the original scale (1 to 7). Edit: Further question, how this function ( principal() ) calculates the loadings? I calculate the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix but these are different from the loadings proposed by the function.
