What would be an example of a really simple model with an intractable likelihood?

Approximate Bayesian computation is a really cool technique for fitting basically any stochastic model, intended for models where the likelihood is intractable (say, you can sample from the model if you fix the parameters but you cannot numerically, algorithmically or analytically calculate the likelihood). When introducing approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to an audience it is nice to use some example model that is really simple but still somewhat interesting and that has an intractable likelihood. What would be a good example of a really simple model that still has an intractable likelihood?
