Convert non-binary value into binary value?

I'm kind of a newbie in ML I have a dataset like: 282,4,1,1,0,0,1,1,41,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,8,4 282,5,1,1,0,1,1,2,41,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,0,12,4 161,5,2,1,0,0,1,1,41,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,4,0,3,5 282,4,2,1,0,32,1,3,41,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,1 0,3,1,1,0,32,1,1,32,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,8,4 0,4,2,5,0,0,1,1,32,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,5 .... With output is the last column, it has 6 outputs {A,B,C,D,E,F} reference to {0,1,2,3,4,5} . I'm using NN and SVM(C-SVC, NuSVC) for training this dataset, but the accuracy still low (>60%). I want to try something else to improve the performance of current results so I plan to train 6 binary models like {A, not_A} , {B, not_B} ... Should I only change the output into binary and keep all features for training? Or I need to change all features into binary too? If yes, can you give a short explanation for me? Thanks for all your help!
