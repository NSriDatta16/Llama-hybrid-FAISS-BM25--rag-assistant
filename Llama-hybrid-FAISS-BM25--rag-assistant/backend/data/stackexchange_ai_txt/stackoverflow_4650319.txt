css or html5 for first and last elements

Users can enter descriptions which may include paragraphs or lists. Or they may just enter text without any enclosing or elements. What I need to do is remove most of the padding and margin above the first element and below the last element so that the user entered content has a nice tight border around it . So I could do one of the following: Use a css rule I was unaware of to target only the first and last elements Use css3 or html5 (I assume there's something within these to easily do what I want) and hope everyone upgrades their browsers asap while the older browsers just get a slightly uglier version of the page Find the first and last elements with Javascript and modify accordingly Modify the html to add a class like Ideally the 1st solution exists, does it? I'm ok with the 2nd solution though if not, does it exist? The last 2 I don't care for... UPDATE : don't care about IE6. But I do need to deal with the situation that if there's just text to begin with, without any or or other elements, then actually nothing special needs to be done for the top margin/padding.
