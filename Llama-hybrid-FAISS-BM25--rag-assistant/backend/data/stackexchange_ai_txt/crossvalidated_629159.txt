Meta-analysis of three glm models with coefficient estimate

I have ran three simple logistic regression models: glm(factor(response) ~ factor(sex) + age + gene expression, data = data_2, family = binomial) Now I have for all three models the Coefficient Estimate , Std. Error , z value and p-value obtained via summary(model) . Now I would like to combine all three studies via a meta-analysis, preferably using these results I obtained. Could you guide me on how to do this.. Is it possible and if so, how could I do this?
