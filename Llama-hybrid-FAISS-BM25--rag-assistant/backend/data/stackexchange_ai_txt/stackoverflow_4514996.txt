jQuery Mobile select menu not closing with HTML5 video

http://sandbox.solutionsbydesign.com/montage/ipad/ On the iPad for some reason the select dialog box wont disappear. Previous to inserting the video I had no issue with the select dialog box but after inserting HTML5 video the dialog box didn't want to close after opening. Is this a bug with jQuery mobile or with HTML5 video embedding?
