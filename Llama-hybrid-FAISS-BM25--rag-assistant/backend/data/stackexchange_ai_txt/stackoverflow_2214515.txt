If you need something more flexible, it is possible to use WPF RoutedEvents. Or implement similar approach manually: organize objects into tree and write an event manager that can route events upwards from tree node. If tree hierarchy fits your needs, it will be more convenient and predictable than forwarding every individual event in handler.
