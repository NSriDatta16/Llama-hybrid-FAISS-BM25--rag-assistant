PCA ? after the transformed data, are they still same with original data, (if maintain same dimensional)

after the step of pca, I try to plot them (see pic) example in the original (A) 2 features => pca 2 features if I do not reduce any dimensional data, are they still have the same meaning of these data? (the picture look a bit different from them) it is a circle example for classification data. any seem similar example after the step of pca.
