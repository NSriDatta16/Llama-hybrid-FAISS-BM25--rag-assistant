Maybe use the laplace distribution, which has density $$ \frac{1}{2s} {\rm exp} \left( -\frac{|x-\mu|}{s} \right ) $$ where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}, s > 0$ are parameters. As Wolfgang pointed out, your distribution appears to be symmetric but has higher kurtosis than the normal distribution; the laplace distribution has these properties and the QQ plot looks pretty similar to what you're observed from your data: library(VGAM) x=rlaplace(1000) qqnorm(x) qqline(x) (you will need to download the package VGAM). The logistic distribution could also work but the QQ plots don't agree with what you've observed as well.
