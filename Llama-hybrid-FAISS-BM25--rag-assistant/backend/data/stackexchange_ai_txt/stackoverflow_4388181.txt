How do you want to save it? As a file? If you can open via file_get_contents() , then URL opening for fopen() wrappers is on. Then you can just do... $url = 'http://maps.google.com/maps/nav?q=from:9500 wil to:3000 bern'; $content = file_get_contents($url); file_put_contents('google-map-json.txt', $content); You can get that into a usable object in PHP with json_decode() . You may want to do that if you want to save it to your database. If you don't want to overwrite the file each time, you could generate a random hash of the response for the filename, or something similar. Update sorry my bad. i know how to save file. but the json is not even echoed through file_get_contents. You may not have URL fopen() wrappers enabled. You can find out by running this... var_dump(ini_get('allow_url_fopen')); If it is disabled, and you can't or don't want to turn it on, you can use cURL (if you have that library installed). Update When I tried to access the page via file_get_contents() , I got... HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request You may need to use cURL, and mimic a browser (user agent etc). Or you can set ini_set('user_agent', 'Mozilla or something'); And then use file_get_contents() . Update I tried with cURL too, and it didn't work :( I think the next step is to examine all the headers your browser sends (when it works), and then send the equivalent via cURL. Update I noticed the Markdown editor wasn't liking the URL ( see my OP's edit ), and it dawned me - urlencode() the GET params!
