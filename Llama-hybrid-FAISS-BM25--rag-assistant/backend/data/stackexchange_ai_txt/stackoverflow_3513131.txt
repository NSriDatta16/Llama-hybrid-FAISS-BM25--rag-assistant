How many records per id will you have? Itzik Ben Gan did a comparison of various approaches to tackling running totals in SQL Server 2008. The conclusions he came up with in his test were that up until 15 records per partition the triangular Join was best. At that point the SQL CLR approach became better. The triangular join continued to outperform a bog standard TSQL cursor until the partition size reached 500. Obviously your mileage may vary but I think these are useful numbers to know.
