Predict satisfaction score given a shift of Service Level Agreement

I would like to make predictions for Overall Satisfaction based on a shift of Service Level Agreement (SLA). I have number of days taken to complete a single service, and a satisfaction score (n=4000) num_days score 1 5 1 4 2 5 2 3 10 1 The observed data is given SLA = 10 days. For those that are unaware of Service Level Agreements: this means that contractually a supplier promises to deliver a service/product within 10 days. Please see the plot for illustrative purpose. The orange line is the average satsifaction per day and it has confidence bounds. How can I predict the Overall Satisfaction for the whole data given that we would move the SLA to 9 days? Some assumptions: The observed frequencies will "move" towards the left (but how to model it?) I expect the average satisfaction will get lower (or equal) for x=1 given SLA=9 compared to x=1 given SLA=10, since we are relatively slower How can we estimate the shift of frequencies? I thought maybe I can use a poisson distribution but it is not a good fit. I also thought perhaps to fit a log/exp curve, but I am looking for someone who has knowledge how to theoretically do this. In the end: what would we expect the total average satisfaction to be when we shift the SLA from 10 to 9? EDIT: Maybe another useful image is to show the frequencies (x=num_days, y=frequency density)
