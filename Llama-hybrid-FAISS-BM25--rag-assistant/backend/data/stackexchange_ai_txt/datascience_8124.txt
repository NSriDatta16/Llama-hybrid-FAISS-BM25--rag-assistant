Clustering large number of strings based on tags

I have string representations of text written by users in the form of parts of speech tags like so: $NNDN,OVDANPN,PNVRV,^^V,^^!$^OV and ^,G,#,!,N,R,$ etc. They are separated into two classes (0 or 1). I want to be able to cluster these such that I will be able to predict (or try to) what class the user in from their tags using the damerau levenshtein distance. The problem is that even a few hundred strings is a huge calculation for any basic clustering that I am aware of (but I am very new to this). I've tried using the counts of each tag to form a vector but applying SVM, knn classifier and Naive Bayes yielded poor results, even when using a KS test to get the best features. My gut feeling is that this seems like a problem that could be solved in the same way that scientists would compare and cluster genes. Should I be looking at different machine learning methods? Is there another way of representing the strings that would be more appropriate? Is there another way of looking at the problem? I'm using the scikit-learn library for Python.
