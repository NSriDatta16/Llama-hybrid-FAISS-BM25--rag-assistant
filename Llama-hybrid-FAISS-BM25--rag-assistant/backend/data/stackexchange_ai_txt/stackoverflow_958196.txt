How would you improve our Unhandled Exception Handler error message?

We are three internal developers with a user count of about twenty. We've implemented unhandled exception handling in our Winforms app. It generates a ticket with the stack trace in our FogBugz (renamed internally to DevTracker) bug tracking system. The goal is to encourage the user to enter an informative bug rather than simply moving on. When they click the first button we do the work to put them on our project site with a new case started. They simply have to fill in the comment box. I'm debating whether or not the "What are we doing?" section should exist. What's your opinion? http://thegollys.smugmug.com/photos/555553239_LxEPK-S.jpg Take two A little more background... The users are well versed in using FogBugz (Dev Tracker) as it's how they request feature and bug fixes currently. In addition to unhandled error handling, we've added log4net into the mix for the next release. It pushes the stack trace to a log on the users local machine (in case of a down network), an internal database, and a FogBugz case. After reading Andrew's answer it pushed me towards what I was already thinking... simpler is always better. I've removed the "What we're doing" section all together and paired down the verbiage. http://www.thegollys.com/photos/555771972_VUTxK-S.jpg Take three Thanks for all the feedback. This is what we're implementing. http://thegollys.smugmug.com/photos/558265081_5sPG2-O.jpg
