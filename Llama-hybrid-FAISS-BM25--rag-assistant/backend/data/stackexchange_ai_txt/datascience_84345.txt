I agree with German C M, there is some structure in your data even though it's not fully structured. So the first task is to transform the data into features that can be exploited by ML. This is typical feature engineering: the idea is to try to organize the different types of elements in the data in a way susceptible to provide useful indications to the algorithm. Many learning algorithms can deal with missing values, so the absence of a particular type of information is not necessarily an issue. Of course it's difficult to give precise advice since this stage requires expert knowledge. Note that technically there are methods which take as input such variable length sequences, but it's highly unlikely that it would work well if the algorithm has to guess everything by itself.
