ActionScript 3: maintaining textarea UIscrollbar position on loss of focus in flash embed

I'm using Flash CS4. Everything functions as it should when CS4 previews the swf after compiling it. However, after embedding the flash item in a webpage, if the textArea loses focus within the flash piece, the textarea's built-in UIscrollbar resets to the very top. Here's the kicker: if I add a FOCUS_OUT event listener to the textArea to store the current scrollbar value, I find that the scrollbar value has been reset to minimum even before the FOCUS_OUT event is triggered! WTF? I think this is occurring because the textArea's htmlText propery is dynamically populated. Adobe AIR has advanced methods for handing HTML, but not simple AS3, oh no. How obnoxious. What can be done?
