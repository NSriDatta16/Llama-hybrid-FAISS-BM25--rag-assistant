The chi-square test is a statistical test of independence to determine the dependency of two variables. It shares similarities with coefficient of determination, R². However, chi-square test is only applicable to categorical or nominal data while R² is only applicable to numeric data. From the definition, of chi-square we can easily deduce the application of chi-square technique in feature selection. Suppose you have a target variable (i.e., the class label) and some other features (feature variables) that describes each sample of the data. Now, we calculate chi-square statistics between every feature variable and the target variable and observe the existence of a relationship between the variables and the target. If the target variable is independent of the feature variable, we can discard that feature variable. If they are dependent, the feature variable is very important. Mathematical details are described here: http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/feature-selectionchi2-feature-selection-1.html For continuous variables, chi-square can be applied after "Binning" the variables.
