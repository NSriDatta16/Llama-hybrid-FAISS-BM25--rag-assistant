I have implemented most of the approaches you mention. The answer may depend on a variety of factors. What client role(s) will be making the changes to the business rules (e.g. business analyst, developer, power user, etc.)? Meaningful support for business analysts may require a rules engine with externalized rules in a db and a useable UI. Meaningful support for developers might be as simple as leveraging something like MEF ( http://www.codeplex.com/MEF ). You might also factor in how often will the business rules need to be changed and what sorts of associated operational requirements may apply (e.g. host process must remain running, app domain unloading ok, etc.). A good selection may require some careful thought about likely vs. unlikely future needs.
