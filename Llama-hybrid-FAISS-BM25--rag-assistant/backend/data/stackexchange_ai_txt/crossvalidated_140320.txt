With respect to your first question, it depends on your computer. With respect to the second, there is no single best answer. Neural networks are themselves often used for feature selection. This is the paradigm leading to deep learning. In that case it is unlikely you'd want to do any feature selection (except maybe whitening of the data). If you're fitting a shallow network via backprop and are worried about overfitting, doing the (unprincipled but often effective) PCA and dropping less important components might help you out.
