I would answer that your analysis is correct. To provide a few more insights, I would mention matching priors. Matching priors are typically priors designed to build Bayesian models with a frequentist property. In particular, they are defined so that the obtained hpd intervals satisfy the frequentist coverage of confidence interval (so 95% of the 95% hpd contain the true values on the long run). Notice that, in 1d, there are analytical solutions: the Jeffreys priors are matching priors. In higher dimension, this is not necessary the case (to my knownledge, there is no result proving that this is never the case). In practice, this matching principle is sometimes also applied to tune the value of some parameters of a model: ground truth data are used to optimize these parameters in the sense that their values maximise the frequentist coverage of the resulting credible intervals for the parameter of interest. From my own experimence, this may be a very subtle task.
