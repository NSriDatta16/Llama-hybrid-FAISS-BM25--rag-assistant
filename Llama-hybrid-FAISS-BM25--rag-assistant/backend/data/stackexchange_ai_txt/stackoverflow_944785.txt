You have two problems. The first is that you should be using the Pane widget directly rather than creating another Frame inside it. The other problem appears to be with using the place geometry manager inside a Pane widget. Try using pack instead. $buttons->{$box} = $parent->Button(-text => $box)->pack(-pady => 10); With that out of the way, please learn about using the strict and warnings pragmas. They're invaluable in helping you to write good code. As Sinan pointed out, don't use the &foo() notation for invoking subroutines. That's the (very) old syntax. It isn't necessary and is potentially harmful. Finally, I'd recommend using pack or grid rather than place for Perl/Tk. It's generally easier to get the behavior you want. Only use place when you need absolute positioning. You can even mix-and-match geometry managers as long as they're managing different frames.
