How to simplify big numeric input from user? [Objective C]

I've building a very basic iphone app where the user will be able to enter or select a very large numeric cash value (usually in the thousands or millions). At the moment I am using a simple text box entry with number pad selected. I am going to use the example of a Football transfer fee as an analogy. A transfer fee can be in many millions and I really do not want the user to be mis-typing zero's, or getting frustrated with the number of zero's they have to enter. In addition, as the text box/numeric cash value is not displayed with any currency formatting it makes it very unintuitive to know just how much you are entering. In this thread I have a way of displaying big numbers on the screen; you'll also notice the numbers are formatted in chunks (ie: 2.25m, 2m, 7.25m, etc) -- it makes the process more streamlined and is more visually intuitive. But what I am unsure about is how to make it easy for the user to enter big numbers without typing stupidly long zeros every time. Possible solution 1 -- Use a UIPickerView with 3+ segments for each of the units. Problem -- it won't handle smaller numbers properly, also you may get weird looking numbers like 1.15k which although correct is not what I want to display. Possible solution 2 -- Use a +/- button to allow a user to simply increase/decrease the number by a factor of 250 or 500. This is the simplest answer, but its not as elegant as a UIPickerView If there is another way to do this, a way to simplify the input of big numeric numbers from a user, I'd be interested.
