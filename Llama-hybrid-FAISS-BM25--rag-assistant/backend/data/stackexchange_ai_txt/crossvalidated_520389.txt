Is the emmeans R package performing causal inference G-computation?

So I am trying to get an understanding of causal inference and how it differs from the usual contrasts. I regularly use the emmeans package in R, and I am wondering when the function emmeans() mentions it has averaged over the covariates is this essentially performing G-computation? At least for regular OLS or identity link GLM models it seems like that One possible difference I see is that G-computation takes place on the response scale, so I wonder if you use the transform argument in emmeans when working with GLMs with a non-identity link, then would it be performing the G-computation? It seems like it does the delta method to convert the SEs to the response scale from the link scale. And then if I modeled the treatment probability, inverted it, and used it as a covariate in a model, and then used emmeans -- would this be doubly robust estimation? As my reference I am using the book here https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/ pages 163-167. Edit 09/07/22: Anyone wondering about the connection --it is written about here https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/gformula.html . The marginaleffects package can do this
