JNLPAppletLauncher can't find subApplet class name since Java update 21

Since JRE version 1.6.0_21-b07 org.jdesktop.applet.util.JNLPAppletLauncher can't find the class contained in the parameter subapplet.classname anymore. In https://applet-launcher.dev.java.net/source/browse/applet-launcher/trunk/src/org/jdesktop/applet/util/JNLPAppletLauncher.java?rev=41&view=log your name appears in revision 41 for improved class loading of the subapplet. If this is really you can you have a look at it? Kind regards, Henri Manson
