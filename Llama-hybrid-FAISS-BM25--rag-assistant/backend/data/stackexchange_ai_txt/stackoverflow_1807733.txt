If you're building an image cropper, you're going to put some kind of overlay on the image, probably a relatively or absolutely positioned div, inside of which you will "draw" a rectangle when the user clicks, holds and drags. This will make it impossible for the user to drag the image itself, so no fix for that is needed. Even if you do not use an overlay, you are still going to hook the mousedown event - there is no other way to implement a JS cropper as far as I know. Hooking that event will by itself be enough to prevent the browser from initiating a drag and drop action.
