Using Tensorflow model for prediction

I am new to tensorflow. I have manged to train and validate a CNN, saved the session through the Saver object into a CPKT file and loaded it back. Now I'd like to use the trained model in order to check how it performs against a photo I took myself. I can't figure out how to do it.
