Yes, version control is essential to keeping the coding portion straight. SVN is good but there are definitely other options as well. I would also suggest setting up a wiki that the team can organize, post designs, display schedules, etc. This will definitely help on information/idea sharing. Lastly, making sure everyone is able to instant message each other is very handy for team members in different locations.
