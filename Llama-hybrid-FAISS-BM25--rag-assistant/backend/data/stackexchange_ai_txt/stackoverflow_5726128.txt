How to put my published properties into the specified category of Object Inspector?

I have my own visual component. It has many published properties and events. I want them to be shown in the specified standard categories of Object Inspector at design-time ( Visual , Layout , Drag Drop / Docking , Linkage etc). Now all my properties are in the Miscellaneous category.
