How can I auto-fill a paragraph in Eclipse?

I would like to auto-fill a paragraph to 80 characters (or some other fixed width) in Eclipse. Is this possible via a keyboard command like in Emacs? Or is there maybe a plugin (I did not find anything on google)? Edit: I am not sure if this is relevant, but I need this for docstrings in Python code (using the PyDev plugin).
