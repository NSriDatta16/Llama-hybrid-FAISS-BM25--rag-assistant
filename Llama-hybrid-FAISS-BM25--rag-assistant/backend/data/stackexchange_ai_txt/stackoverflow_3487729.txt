Mono does not extend BCL APIs, at least not in the System namespace. Therefore, you can be quite certain that an application using only types from the System namespace will be portable without recompilation from Mono to .NET. Of course, you won't find anything in the Mono namespace once you're in .NET world. From the Mono FAQ : Do you plan to Embrace and Extend .NET? Embracing a good technology is good. Extending technologies in incompatible ways is bad for the users, so we do not plan on making incompatible changes to the technologies. If you have innovative ideas, and want to create new classes, we encourage you to make those classes operate correctly well in both Mono and .NET. Today Mono ships with a number of extra libraries that were developed either by members of the Mono community, or other groups. In some cases, we have found the bits from Microsoft to be incomplete, but we avoid breaking the API, instead we expose the missing functionality in new assemblies (see Mono.Security)
