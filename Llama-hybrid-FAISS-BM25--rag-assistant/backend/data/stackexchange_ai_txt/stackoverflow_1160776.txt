You can enable raw HTML support by setting $wgRawHtml = true; in your LocalSettings.php : http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgRawHtml However, as noted above this is rather insecure for a public site. (If locked down to registered usage only by known folks it's ok -- but you need to trust your users.) There are some links on that manual page to extensions organized around letting you put specific known bits of HTML/JS in your output code as well, which may or may not fit your needs better.
