There have been presentation architectures designed especially for agent-based systems, such as Presentation-Abstraction-Control. The hard part in designing such a system is that you ultimately end up hardwiring sequences of collaborations between the agents. You can do this, but don't use OO inheritance to model the message passing hierarchy. You will regret it. If you think about it, you are really not interested in using the OO inheritance relationship, since the interfaces defined are really just a "Record of functions" that the object can respond to. In that case, you are better off formally modeling your communication protocol. If you have questions, please ask -- this is not an obvious solution and easy to get wrong.
