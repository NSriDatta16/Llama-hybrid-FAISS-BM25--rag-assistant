As @HaoYe's comment points out, your recursion via divide-and-conquer is not quite right: it is not the case that $$P(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3\cup A_4) = P( A_1 \cup A_2) + P( A_3 \cup A_4) - P( A_1 \cup A_2) * P( A_3 \cup A_4)$$ but rather that $$P(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3\cup A_4) = P( A_1 \cup A_2) + P( A_3 \cup A_4) - P\left(( A_1 \cup A_2) \cap ( A_3 \cup A_4)\right).$$ In any case, the principle of inclusion/exclusion gives a very pretty formula that rarely can be used in practice because the probabilities of all those various intersections are not easy to determine. One case where the probabilities can be calculated is when the $n$ events are mutually independent , but in this special case, the general formula should not be used at all! For $n$ mutually independent events $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$, use DeMorgan's theorem to write $$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = 1 - P\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i^c\right) = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^n P(A_i^c)= 1 - \prod_{i=1}^n \left[1 - P(A_i)\right] \tag{1}$$ and calculate $P(A_1\cup A_2\cup\cdots\cup A_n)$ using $n-1$ multiplications and $n+1$ subtractions. In other words, for Heaven's sake, resist the temptation to multiply out those terms in square brackets on the right because you will end up with the inclusion/exclusion formula which you should try to avoid at all costs.
