Self-modify the classpath within a Scala script?

I'm trying to replace a bunch of Linux shell scripts with Scala scripts. One of the remaining challenges is how to scan an entire directory of JARs and place them into the classpath. Currently this is done in the shell script prior to invoking the scala JVM. I'd like to eliminate the shell script completely. Is there an elegant scala idiom for this? I have found this other question but in Java it seems hardly worthwhile to mess with it: How do you change the CLASSPATH within Java?
