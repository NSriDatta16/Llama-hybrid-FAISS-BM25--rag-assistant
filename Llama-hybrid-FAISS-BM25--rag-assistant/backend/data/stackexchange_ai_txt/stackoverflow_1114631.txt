Guessing that you mean to add a default namespace to an element its first important to understand that this is not strictly possible. The namespace that an element's name belongs to forms it fully qualified name hence "adding" a default namespace is tantamount to renaming the element. There is no mechanism built into the DOM to rename elements. The strictest approach would be to process the XML as an input to a transform (either in code or via XSLT) that generates the corrected XML output. However a pragmatic solution would be to use some string processing like RegEx to find the element and inject the xmlns attribute. Personally I prefer the former.
