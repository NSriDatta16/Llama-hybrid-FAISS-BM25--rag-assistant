JTable has a default Action for the down arrow key. If you want to change this behaviour then you need to create a custom Action. You can do this easily by using the Wrapping Actions concept to leverage the default code. You can also look at Table Tabbing for a working example of wrapping an Action. You code for the Action would be much simpler and would be something like: if (last row is selected) add a new row to the table invoke the default down arrow action
