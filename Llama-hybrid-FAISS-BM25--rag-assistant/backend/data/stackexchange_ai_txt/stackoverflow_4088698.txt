simple drag pictures onto browser plugin?

Looking for something like this: http://min.us - where user can easily drag'n'drop images onto the page, and there is a listener that takes them, does something with them (uploads to server). Does there exist an easy jquery plugin for that? Or is this way complicated?? Thanks! Maybe HTML5 has a drag'n'drop listening mechanism??
