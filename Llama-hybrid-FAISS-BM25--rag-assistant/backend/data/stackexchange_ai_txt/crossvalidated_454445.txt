While the Markov chain $(X_t)$ is producing values such that $p(x_t)=0$ it has clearly not "reached" stationarity, so it should keep moving over the state space. Any way to move around until the support of $p$ is reached is valid, including (1) of course. However, solution (2) is clearly wrong since, if $p(x)=0$ , the chain will never move away from its current value. Note also that $$p(x)q(x,y)=0$$ implies $$p(x)=0\qquad \text{a.s.}$$ when $y$ is a realisation from the density $q(x,\cdot)$ .
