In cluster analysis, the Silhouette coefficient (SC; or Average Silhouette Width) is a distance-based statistic that measures the quality of a clustering, i.e., to what extent the objects are closer to other objects in the same class than to the closest class to which they don't belong. This can also be computed for situations as yours in which there is a given grouping; for these data probably the Euclidean distance makes sense. One qualification is that clusterings found by a cluster analysis method (for with the Silhouette was originally meant) tend to be better separated than data from underlying groupings that have a fairly large variation. Therefore I'd recommend to contrast the SC obtained for your categories (which may look disappointingly low for people who know typical values in cluster analysis) with a permutation test approach, i.e., simulate 1000 (say) data sets where you randomly reshuffle the group labels, compute the SC for all of these, and have a look to what extent (measured in terms of standard deviations of the permutation results, say) the SC in your data is "significantly" larger. The webpage also mentions a Simplified Silhouette that comes with less computational effort. Sleeping over this, I realised that I should also mention another classical cluster validity index, the Calinski-Harabasz index (CH) , In R here . It can once more be calibrated (or a statistical test be run) using the permutation principle. More than the SC, this is based on the standard statistics characterising the Gaussian distribution, namely mean vector and sums of squares, so will be appropriate for within-group distributions that are not too far from the Gaussian. It is based on (multivariate) Analysis of Variance logic. In fact, as @Stephan Kolassa correctly noted, both the SC and the CH will reward classes with large within-class homogeneity, whereas (potentially nonlinear) classes with larger within-class variation may not be assessed as good.
