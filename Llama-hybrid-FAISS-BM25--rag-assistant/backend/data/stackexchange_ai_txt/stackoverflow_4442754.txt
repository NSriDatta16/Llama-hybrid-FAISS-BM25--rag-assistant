Browsers will not re-populate a form for you, especially when doing a POST. Since you're not building the form with fields filled out with value="" chunks, browsers will just render empty fields for you. A very basic form handling script would look something like this: "> " /> " /> etc... ?> Notice the use of htmlspecialchars() in the last bit, where form fields are being output. Consider the case where someone enters an html meta-character ( " , , > ) into the field. If for whatever reason the form has to be displayed, these characters will be output into the html and "break" the form. And every browser will "break" differently. Some won't care, some (*cough*IE*cough*) will barf bits all over the floor. By using htmlspecialchars() , those metacharacters will be "escaped" so that they'll be displayed properly and not break the form. As well, if you're going to be outputting large chunks of HTML, and possibly embedding PHP variables in them, you'd do well to read up on HEREDOC s. They're a special construct that act as a multi-line double-quoted string, but free you from having to do any quote escaping. They make for far more readable code, and you don't have to worry about choosing the right kind of quotes, or the right number of quotes, as you hop in/out of "string mode" to output variables.
