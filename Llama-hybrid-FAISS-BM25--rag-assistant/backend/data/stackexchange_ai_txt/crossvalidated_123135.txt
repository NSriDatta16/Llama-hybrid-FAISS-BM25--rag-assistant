Calculate PCoA scores for dataframe "x", based on the distance matrix of dataframe "y"

I'm trying to use multivariate techniques to compare two datasets (same structure) that were collected using different sampling techniques. I'd like to compute a PCoA for the first dataset (D1), and then see how the data from dataset 2 (D2) compares, relative to the distance matrix computed for D1. Essentially, I want to calculate PCoA scores for D2, based on the distance matrix of D1. I'm using the "vegan" package in R. Thanks in advance. #calculate distance matrix and PCoA for "D2" serb.d2
