Another point is that researchers sometimes use Poisson regression with an offset of log(population size) even when modelling "rate" or probability (and not total number). For outcomes with low probabilities , the results will be very similar (the link functions [logit and log], as well as the variance functions [ $np(1-p)$ and $\mu$ ], are very similar when the probability is close to 0). Logistic regression still makes more sense as a model of the system (Poisson regression in principle would allow for rates > 1). I don't honestly know whether Poisson regression is preferred in some fields because it has (or used to have) computational advantages, or because it might have slightly better finite-sample properties (the latter is complete speculation).
