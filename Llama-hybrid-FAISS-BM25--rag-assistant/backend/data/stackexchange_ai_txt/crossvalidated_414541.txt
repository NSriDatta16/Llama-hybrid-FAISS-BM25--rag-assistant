In the context of a MCMC: how to create/interpret a trace for a matrix?

In a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, I'm drawing a matrix from a proposal. The accepted matrices should constitute draws from a posterior. If it were just a parameter, I would know how to interpret its trace. However, now I have a matrix. I'm thinking of just evaluating the accepted draws using a density from a matrix distribution, and then see how the plot varies. However, what should I be looking for?
