I don't think Outlook will let you open a file dialog! An ugly but quick and functional workaround that I have used is to temporarily open an instance of Excel and use its GetSaveAsFilename method. Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.application") xlApp.Visible = False strSaveAsFilename = xlApp.GetSaveAsFilename xlApp.Quit Set xlApp = Nothing Then you can say MyAttachment.SaveAsFile(strSaveAsFilename) . If Excel is not necessarily installed, then you can do a similar trick using Word and the FileDialog method (Word doesn't have GetSaveAsFilename). See VBA help on FileDialog for an example. There is probably a more elegant solution out there, but the above will work...
