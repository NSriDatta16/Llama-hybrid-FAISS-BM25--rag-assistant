Database/NoSQL - Lowest latency way to retrieve the following data

I have a real estate application and a "house" contains the following information: house: - house_id - address - city - state - zip - price - sqft - bedrooms - bathrooms - geo_latitude - geo_longitude I need to perform an EXTREMELY fast (low latency) retrieval of all homes within a geo-coordinate box . Something like the SQL below (if I were to use a database): SELECT * from houses WHERE latitude IS BETWEEN xxx AND yyy AND longitude IS BETWEEN www AND zzz Question: What would be the quickest way for me to store this information so that I can perform the fastest retrieval of data based on latitude & longitude? (e.g. database, NoSQL, memcache, etc)?
