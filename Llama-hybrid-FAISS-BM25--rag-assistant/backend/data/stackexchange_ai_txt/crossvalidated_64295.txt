How to analyze category responses

In a survey questionnaire I asked participants to give a priority ranking to the question "What factor motivates a lot for wringing out loyalty, and productivity?", with the following choices: "Good Salary, Promotions, Respect & Recognition, Reward & Appreciation, Organization's Reputation, Medical & Family care, Good Leadership, Challenging work & Targets, National & International Trainings opportunities, Job Security etc etc (total 15 variables)" Respondents gave different priority number to different variables, for example someone gave 1 to Money, 2 to Medical Care, similarly someone gave 1 to Medical Care and 2 to Reward, 3 to Job Security... and so on. Every respondent gave different reasons & priority numbers. Now how can I analyse such data in SPSS because my coding of 1 priority is 5 or 6 of respondent's priority. Edit : I wanna to find out that How much or What percent of respondents gave to PRIORITY 1, then 2, 3 because there were 261 respondents. What i want to say is for example i question that "What factors motivates you to Resign from my factory and someone reply MONEY as priority 1 and Job security as Priority 3, similarly someone reply Money as priority 5 and Respect is priority 1... so on". How i can analyse them and get result of that How much gave priority 1 to ?, 2 to ? and so on, their percentage? More clearly for example i want to know that in my factory 80% employee will resign because of ? 75% will resign because of ? and so on. I need to know how SPSS can perform this (Please note that i can not give priority to any variable because it is not me but my employees are responsible to give me their "preference list" priority wise which indicates serial 15 reasons to resign on priority / importance basis?
