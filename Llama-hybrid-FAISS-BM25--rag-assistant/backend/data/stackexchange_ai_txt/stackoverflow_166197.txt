Many languages nowadays have assert statements. Can they be leveraged to validate your generated assertion? They're easy to write and easy to find. The issue is that an assertion failure means your program stops. If you want to provide a warning or a log entry that an assertion has failed at run-time, you could try an if-statement. For this kind of code generation, people often use simple template tools to generate the appropriate source that can be inserted into the application. You could look at Java's Velocity or Python's Mako to generate source for your assertion condition.
