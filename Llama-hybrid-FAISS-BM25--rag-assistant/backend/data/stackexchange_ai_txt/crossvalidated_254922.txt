Multinomial Logistic Regression - Independent Regressions

Given the standard multinomial logistic regression model with reference class K: $P(Y=j|X^{(i)}) = \frac{\exp(\theta_j^TX^{(i)})}{1+ \sum_{m=1}^{K-1}\exp(\theta_m^T X^{(i)})}$ Would I run into any problems if I estimate K-1 binary regressions independently (R: glm(,family = "binomial") vs. nnet::multinom()) on filtered data sets where the outcomes are K and j ? This implies there will be different sets of predictors and possibly different transformations (e.g. floors, caps, splines, etc.).
