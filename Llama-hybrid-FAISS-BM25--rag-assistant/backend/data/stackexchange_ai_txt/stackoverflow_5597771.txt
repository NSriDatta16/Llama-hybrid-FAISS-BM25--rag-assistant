You're not submitting the name of the submit button which is clicked; I suspect the code at the other end is checking for the presence of that variable in the request to see if the form has been submitted or not. As PacoRG points out, the submit button is an image; as such, submitting by clicking that button in a browser would submit fields named "login.x" and "login.y", along with "login". A good way to avoid problems like this is to use WWW::Mechanize to do a lot of the work for you, for instance: my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new; $mech->get('http://www.example.com/login.html'); $mech-submit_form( with_fields => { profid => $username, password => $password, }, ); The above would request the login page, find the appropriate form, and submit it. Also, as others have said, if requests from your script are handled differently to requests from your browser, the best way to debug is to grab the full HTTP request that both send, and look for pertinent differences. For the browser, you can use an extension like Firefox's LiveHTTPHeaders or Tamper Data plugins, or use something like Wireshark to capture the request as it's sent. For the script, you can easily have it output the request being sent. For instance, for a script using LWP::UserAgent or WWW::Mechanize (which subclasses LWP::UserAgent), you can add: $mech->add_handler("request_send", sub { shift->dump; return }); $mech->add_handler("response_done", sub { shift->dump; return }); This will dump the raw request sent, along with the raw response from the server. (Change $mech to whatever var your LWP::UserAgent / WWW::Mechanize object is in - $browser in your example.)
