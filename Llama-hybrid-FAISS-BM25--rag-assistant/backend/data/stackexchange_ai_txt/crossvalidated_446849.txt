It depends on a lot of different thing. How much data and what kind of data do you have? If you have a bunch of data points of the form (income, age, spending) then I suspect that a straightforward multiple linear regression should work. If you believe there are interaction terms, you can try adding some additional explanatory variables by transforming the data; e.g. map each (income, age, spending) to (income, age, income * age, spending) , or even (income, age, income / age, spending) . If you have a sufficiently large dataset, for the best accuracy, I would recommend using a neural network as these tend to learn the optimal representations of data. If these perform poorly, try random forest models. At the end of the day, the only way to see which model works best is to split the data into training and testing sets, and then see which model has the best test performance.
