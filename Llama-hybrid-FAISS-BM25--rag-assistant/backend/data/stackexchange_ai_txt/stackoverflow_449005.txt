Read the W3C spec . (this is CSS 2.1; find the appropriate version for your assumption of browsers) relevant paragraph: In CSS, identifiers (including element names, classes, and IDs in selectors) can contain only the characters [a-z0-9] and ISO 10646 characters U+00A1 and higher, plus the hyphen (-) and the underscore (_); they cannot start with a digit, or a hyphen followed by a digit. Identifiers can also contain escaped characters and any ISO 10646 character as a numeric code (see next item). For instance, the identifier "B&W?" may be written as "B&W?" or "B\26 W\3F". As @mipadi points out in Kenan Banks's answer , there's this caveat , also in the same webpage: In CSS, identifiers may begin with '-' (dash) or '_' (underscore). Keywords and property names beginning with '-' or '_' are reserved for vendor-specific extensions. Such vendor-specific extensions should have one of the following formats: '-' + vendor identifier + '-' + meaningful name '_' + vendor identifier + '-' + meaningful name Example(s): For example, if XYZ organization added a property to describe the color of the border on the East side of the display, they might call it -xyz-border-east-color. Other known examples: -moz-box-sizing -moz-border-radius -wap-accesskey An initial dash or underscore is guaranteed never to be used in a property or keyword by any current or future level of CSS. Thus typical CSS implementations may not recognize such properties and may ignore them according to the rules for handling parsing errors. However, because the initial dash or underscore is part of the grammar, CSS 2.1 implementers should always be able to use a CSS-conforming parser, whether or not they support any vendor-specific extensions. Authors should avoid vendor-specific extensions
