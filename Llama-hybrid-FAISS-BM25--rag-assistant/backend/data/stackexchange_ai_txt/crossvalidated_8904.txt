How to calculate Newey West t-statistic in SAS 9.2?

I need to run Newey West t statistics in SAS 9.2. I already run regression, White's test, Breusch Godfrey test and Jarque-Bera normality test. Regression is simple. Number of observations = 522 Depended variable name: rtest 1 Independent variable name: rtest 2 Data are time series data. I found somewhere that i should start with: PROC model; PARMS B0 B1; rtest1=B0+B1*rtest2; I do not understand this part: FIT rtest1/GMM Kernel=(BART,1,0.605); RUN; How to get numbers in parenthesis. What is meaning of those numbers? What does command FIT do to data? Do I need to add more commands?
