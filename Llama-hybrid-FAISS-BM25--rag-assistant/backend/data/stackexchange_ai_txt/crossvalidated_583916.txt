How to interpret the standard deviation of the slope random effect in a multilevel model

How do you interpret the standard deviation of the slope random effect in multilevel models? Suppose I want to show how Urbanization percentage changed across time in Western and Eastern Europe, so it is a multilevel model with random slopes. Suppose the software shows that the mean of the standard deviation of the slope random effect is 0.05 (5%). How would the formal interpretation of it look like? I know that its interpretation is often not of a primary interest, but suppose that for some reasons I have to make it. How would it sound? UPDATE: Lachlan below has already provided an awesome answer to the main question asked. In this update I want to elaborate a bit on my model so as to further clarify my question. I have fitted my model with INLA (Bayesian method), and it has only one fixed effect - fixed intercept, which is going to be the same for both regions (Western/Eastern Europe). So the question now is whether this fixed intercept plays a role of an overall average rate of change from which individual countries’ rates of changes deviate? As a full example, we can consider a textbook model, at https://becarioprecario.bitbucket.io/inla-gitbook/ch-multilevel.html#multilevel-models-for-longitudinal-data The model here has the same specification as mine. IV here is also time (days of sleep deprivation) and DV is also a metric variable. There are 18 groups (subjects), so 18 random slopes, and only one fixed effect – intercept. Variability is presented as precision, but it can be converted to Standard deviation. Below I have attached a picture from the book with my short notes. Suppose, in this model we have converted "Precision for Subject" into Standard deviation. Does its mean show the amount of deviation of subjects’ individual rates of reaction times from the overall average rate of change, which in this model turns out to be a fixed intercept?
