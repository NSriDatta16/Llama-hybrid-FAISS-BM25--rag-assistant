Magento: Several custom blocks all outputting the same code!

I have a custom module, which has several blocks. If I include these blocks in a CMS page after each other, they work as expected. If I include them through the layout XML files, they all display the source code of the last one called in the XML. A minimum test case (that for me is exhibiting this behavior) follows, along with expected and actual results. Code /app/etc/modules/Test_Tester.xml true local /app/code/local/Test/Tester/etc/config.xml 0.1.0 Test_Tester_Block /app/code/local/Test/Tester/Block/One.php /app/code/local/Test/Tester/Block/Two.php /app/design/frontend/INTERFACE/TEMPLATE/layout/page.xml (under .. .. /app/design/frontend/INTERFACE/TEMPLATE/layout/cms.xml (under /app/design/frontend/INTERFACE/TEMPLATE/template/page/home_template.phtml getChildHtml('testa'); ?> getChildHtml('testb'); ?> /app/design/frontend/INTERFACE/TEMPLATE/tester/one.phtml one.phtml /app/design/frontend/INTERFACE/TEMPLATE/tester/two.phtml two.phtml Expected This should print out (on the homepage, where the blocks are being included): One.php one.phtml Two.php two.phtml Actual Output If I include the blocks within the Homepage CMS page, like so: {{block type="test_tester/one" template="tester/one.phtml"}} {{block type="test_tester/two" template="tester/two.phtml"}} ...I get the expected output. However, using the layout as above in the code sample, I get: Two.php two.phtml Two.php two.phtml I think I've gone insane - I can't see the bit I'm mucking up.
