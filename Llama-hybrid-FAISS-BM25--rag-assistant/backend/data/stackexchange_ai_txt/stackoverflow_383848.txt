F# open source projects

I'm looking for some open source F# projects to learn from. Something not snippets but full projects that are good representatives of F# features (i.e. pattern matching, discriminated unions, etc). My objective are mainly to see how all the features fit together, how the project is organized and how the problems are tackled from a functional perspective.
