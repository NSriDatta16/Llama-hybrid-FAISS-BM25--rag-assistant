Conflict in confidence intervals for mean difference and confidence interval for Cohen'd effect size

I run an experiment to compare the performance of two algorithms. The design of my experiment is paired comparisons. I'm reporting my results in this way: There were no outliers in mean differences data as assessed by inspection of boxplot. The assumption of normality was not violated as assessed by skewness of 0.2276 (SE = 0.4405) and kurtosis of -0.2766 (SE = 0.8583). The performance was higher in algorithm A (M = 0.3876, SD = 0.3138) than in algorithm B (M = 0.2241, SD = 0.3476), a statically significant mean increase of 0.1635, 95% CI [0.0393, 0.2877], t(27) = 2.7007, p = 0.0118, d = 0.4938, 95% CI for d [-0.0501, 1.0378]. Note that the 95% confidence interval for mean difference does not include zero but the 95% confidence interval for Cohen'd includes zero . I was about to conclude that algorithm A has better performance than algorithm B with statistical significance and medium effect size, but I got confused about how to interpret the confidence interval for Cohen's d. What can I say about the effect size with this data? Below is my data and how I compute the values using R.
