Please forgive the original edit, it appears i was mistaken. From the W3C linked below: Single ampersands. Although HTML user agents have tended to turn a blind eye, you should never have a single ampersand (&) in your document. You should pay particular attention to URIs that include parameters. For example, your document should contain http://example.org/my-script.php?class=guest&amp;name=user , rather than http://example.org/my-script.php?class=guest&name=user . http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-escapes#use
