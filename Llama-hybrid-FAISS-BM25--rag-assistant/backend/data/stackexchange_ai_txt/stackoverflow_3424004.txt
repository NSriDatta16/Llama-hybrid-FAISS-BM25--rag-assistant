What is the difference (if any at all) between these two method for one a uniqueidentifier is 16 bytes while an int is 4 bytes. IF you have a URL like http://bla.com?UserID=1 you can easily guess what someone else's userid is so you can try 2 or 4 etc etc when you have this as UserID C7478034-BB60-4F5A-BE51-72AAE5A96640 it is not as easily and also uniqueidentifiers are supposed to be unique accross all computers if they use NEWID() instead of NEWSEQUENTIALID() then they will get fragmentation and page splits, take a look at Best Practice: Do not cluster on UniqueIdentifier when you use NewId
