I think the first thing you need to set right is learning rate, which is very important. Usually, Adam or SGD optimzers should work. Also, you may need to make 3 partitions of data. Train data, on which you train the model. Validation data on which you try to fine tune the model, and finally the test data on which you finally evaluate the model. If you don't have L2 or Dropout, you can consider "Early Stopping". Early stopping is also a method of regularization. There are lots of concepts to understand. It's better you go through proper tutorials. Particularly, I find Lecture by Stanford on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition very good. I assure you, once you go through all the tutorial, you'll be much better equipped. Here is the link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv For neural network architecture search, there are three things you can consider - Random Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Search or Model based search. I suggest you go for random search of hyperparameters. All the best.
