That the values are numeric suggests to me that you'll eventually find a need to perform some sort of mathematical function against them such as an average or standard deviation. As such you'd be better off storing them in such a way that you can use SQL to manipulate them as opposed to pulling it back into a programming language. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to use another table. But it's certainly the easiest, standardized way of doing so. But if you really want to store it away with your other data in one table (i.e. the workout table), use XML. I say XML because most database engines offer non standard SQL for querying those values out. SQL Server, Oracle and MySQL all have ways of doing so. Serialization binds you to whatever programming language you're working with (e.g. Java). JSON doesn't have SQL support AFAIK so you still need to pull it back into a programming language to manipulate in a meaningful fashion.
