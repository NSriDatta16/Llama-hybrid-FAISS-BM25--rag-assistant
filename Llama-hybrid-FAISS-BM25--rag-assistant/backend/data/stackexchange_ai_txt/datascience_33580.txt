Too much inputs = overfitting?

First question : can I mix different sorts of inputs types for example, height and age (of course my inputs are normalized)? in general, can we mix different types of inputs in a neural network ? Second question : can too much different inputs cause overfitting ? I am using 120 inputs neurons and 20,000 train data and I am overfitting at 53% accuracy (bad)... Thank you.
