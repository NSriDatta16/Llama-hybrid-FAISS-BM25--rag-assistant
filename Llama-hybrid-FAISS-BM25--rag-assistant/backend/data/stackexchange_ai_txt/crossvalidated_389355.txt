I would recommend using the multivariate Hotelling's paired $T^2$ -statistic since you have three measurements at each wavelength for each method. Essentially, what you are doing with this method is testing, simultaneously (and thereby controlling the error rate) if the measurements in total (i.e. 54 wavelengths) from Method A are equivalent to Method B. This is the multivariate equivalent to the paired-sample T-test. There is a good description of this method listed here at Penn State's Multivariate Statistics Course . If you are using R, you'll want to check out the Hotelling package . If you are using SAS for your analysis, you can carry out this test using proc glm along with the MANOVA statement. Please pay careful attention to the assumptions listed before using this method. You must meet the assumptions for this test to be valid. An excellent textbook reference is the classic multivariate statistics introductory text by Johnson and Wichern, Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis 6th ed . (page 273-279).
