I didn't realize I could just cut and paste the Apache LogFormat directive (with an = sign) and it would work, I thought I was forced to use awstats. awstats will use the LogFormat directive from your httpd.conf file and replace it with the awstats identifiers. I cut and pasted this into my awstats.whatever.conf file directly from my Apache2 httpd.conf (and then added the = sign after LogFormat): LogFormat="\"%{Host}i\" %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\""
