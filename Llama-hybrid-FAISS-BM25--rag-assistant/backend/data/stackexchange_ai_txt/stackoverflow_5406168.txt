How to override the way a combobox finds the selecteditem in its itemssource

Given the following XAML fragment: It would seem that if the ViewModel assigns it's CurrentItem property to an instance of one of the ListOfItems then the ComboBox will display the correct values. However if the ViewModel assigns CurrentItem to a "clone" of an instance in ListOfItems the ComboBox isn't able to find the SelectedItem in it's ItemsSource and so no selected Item is displayed. How do I override the way ComboBox finds it's selectedItem in its ListOfItems, such that it operates by value, and not by reference.
