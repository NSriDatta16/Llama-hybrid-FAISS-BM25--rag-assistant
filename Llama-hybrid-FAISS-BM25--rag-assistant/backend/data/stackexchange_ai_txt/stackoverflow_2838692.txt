Productivity features in VS, how to display documentation

I used to program quite a lot in Java, recently I've began to work with C#. I think that most of advantages of C# (comparing to Java) are corrupted by VS. Now what really makes me crazy is intelisence. It offers only list of classes of that are already in "using". I would like to see suggestions of all classes from all libraries. Then, when I finally remember the name of class I want to use and type it manually I have to confirm "using"(by clicking pop-up(!)). This is cost me some time and makes me nervous. Most important of all then I'm choosing between methods or classes, filling parameters of methods etc. I need to see documentation of those classes, methods etc. VS displays just a small tool tip that is contains only summary what is completely unsatisfactory. It does not even contain methods return type(!) and parameters. Resharper does not solve any of these. Its suggestions are also mostly useless(it suggest actions I don't want to do). As well I'd like to see Resharper's sugestion not only when I'm on the line in task. Can somebody suggest a solution ? Maybe some addon, how to change it in settings or alike? Other productivity features or a way how to "generally" set shortcuts to be the same as in Java would be also appreciated. Edit: This is what happens if I press Ctrl+Space or Ctrl+Space+Shift (Reshaper?) inside just after "(" of some method: alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/ceaeae7c92.png What I want it to do is to have list of methods(ideally with parameters types and return type) like the on on top of the picture that I can switch between using arrows but also a full documentation(in another popup, docked window...) that would look like this: alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/109ca8417c.png
