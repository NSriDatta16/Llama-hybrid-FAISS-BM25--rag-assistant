Correlation between weather condition and event

I have car accidents data and related weather information. To keep it simple data looks like that: accident_datetime | accident_zip | weather_condition (sun|rain|fog|snow) I want to visualize correlation between number of accidents and weather condition. I would go with average number, let's say when it snows there are twice more accidents then when it sunny, but in this case I will need weather condition data that is not linked to accident. Do I have any options? Thanks.
