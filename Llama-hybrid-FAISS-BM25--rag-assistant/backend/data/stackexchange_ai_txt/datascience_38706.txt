Is there a site like fast.ai or deeplearning.ai but for machine learning instead of deep learning?

I'm looking for a summary of the pros and cons of different machine learning models in practise. Something that includes: - How the model works - What kinds of outliers will be misrepresented by the model - Effect of different parameters in each model on speed/performance
