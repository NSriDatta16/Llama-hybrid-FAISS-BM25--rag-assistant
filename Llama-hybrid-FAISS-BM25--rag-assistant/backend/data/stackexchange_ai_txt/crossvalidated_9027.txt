Is there an easy way to combine two glm models in R?

I have two logistic regression models in R made with glm() . They both use the same variables, but were made using different subsets of a matrix. Is there an easy way to get an average model which gives the means of the coefficients and then use this with the predict() function? [ sorry if this type of question should be posted on a programming site let me know and I'll post it there ] Thanks
