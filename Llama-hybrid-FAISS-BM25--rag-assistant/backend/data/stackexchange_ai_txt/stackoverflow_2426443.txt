Flex HDividedBox Divider backgroundColor

Is there an easy way to set the backgroundColor of a HDividedBox's (or VDividedBox's) BoxDivider object(s)? A BoxDivider is the "divider" that has the drag handle on it. By default, the BoxDivider is transparent with the little handle image on it. There is a dividerSkin style that defaults to mx.skin.BoxDividerSkin which is a reference to a symbol in the Assets.swf file. Any ideas? Do I have to make an alternate skin? Is that my only option? Googling this led me to many solutions that were weird and hacky and frankly didn't seem to work. Thanks.
