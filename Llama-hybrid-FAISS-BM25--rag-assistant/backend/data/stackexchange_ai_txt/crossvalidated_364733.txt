Others have already answered about the wrong idea of hypothesis testing. Regarding your question : yes it is possible. Take for example this time series. It is the price series of a stock of the S&P 500 (therefore, real data) in a time span of more than 10 years. As you can see the series presents what seems to be a structural change. The ADF, with constant and constant plus trend, gives a p-value respectively of 0.003629 and 0.01257, therefore we can reject the null hypothesis of a unit root (if we assume a level of significance of 5%). Since we suspect the presence of a break, I run also a unit root test with an unknown breakpoint, which computed p-value is equal to 0.0239, once again we can reject the null of a unit root. The second figure shows an OLS-based CUSUM test with alternative boundaries and alfa equals to 0.05 plotted with the R package " strucchange ", which shows you the contemporaneous precence of a break.
