Validate iPhone application in in XCode 3.2.3

I have built my application using "Build and Archive" and the version shows up in XCode Organizer. However; when I click the application and then "Validate Application..." nothing happens. When I check the console, the following entry is logged every time i click "Validate Application..." Has anyone succeeded with this or experienced the same problem?
