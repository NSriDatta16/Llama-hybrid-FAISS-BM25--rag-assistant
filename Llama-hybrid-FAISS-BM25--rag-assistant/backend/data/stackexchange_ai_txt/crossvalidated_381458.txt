What is the purpose of doing a logistic regression when the predictor is dichotomous?

I would like to expand on this question . Knowing that it is possible to do a logistic regression when the IV is dichotomous, and that I've seen it done in studies: what is the purpose of doing so, and what would be the advantages over using the usual Pearson X-square or (if a non-categorical version of the predictor is available) a simple t-test?
