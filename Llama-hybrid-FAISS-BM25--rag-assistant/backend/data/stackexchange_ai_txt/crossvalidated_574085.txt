Universal approximation of Gaussians

Can gaussian kernels reproduce non continuous L2 integrable functions? ( Do non continuous L2 integrable functions lie in the RKHS constructed by a Gaussian Kernel?) Edit: I think my question is being misconceived. I do not intend to say that the RKHS is constructed using this argument. My question is that due to the reproducing property, every function that belongs to a Hilbert space must satisfy the reproducing property give the kernel is a reproducing kernel. Would a constant function over a compact support satisfy this for gaussian kernels?
