If you are familiar with a software package you can start by producing a histogram of the data and request the software to produce sample estimates of the percentiles. You can then investigate the calculations of percentile estimates by hand to better understand the methodology and compare your work to the software's results. In the example you provided if you have a sample of $10$ ordered values and are interested in estimating the $95^{th}$ percentile of the population, one approach would be to take the average of the $9^{th}$ and $10^{th}$ ordered values in your sample.
