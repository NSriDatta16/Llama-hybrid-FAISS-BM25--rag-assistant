You can try this link: Typemock and Code coverage tools . I haven't had any luck with the PartCover gui so I will try the command line. update: I got the GUI working. step 1. enable typemock with partcover via linking them. do this through typemock configuration step 2. under 'run target settings' in Partcover Browser, exe file should be test runner, in my case, the path to mstest.exe step 3. working dir is most likely where your test .dll lives w/ it's dependencies, let's say c:\myproject\unittests\bin\Debug step 4. working args : these are for mstest , /testcontainer:foo.test.dll step 5. put at least 1 rule in: +[MyNamespace.MyAssemblyName]* , the rules section after that runs, you can see your code coverage, and typemock test loader will automatically load, if you linked it correctly. don't forget in partcover browser to go to 'Views->View coverage details' to see the source code.
