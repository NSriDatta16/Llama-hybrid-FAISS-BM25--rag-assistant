How to find joint confidence interval for a bunch of normal distributed samples

Suppose there are two samples A and B. A has average $u_{1}$ and standard deviation $s_{1}$, B has average $u_{2}$ and standard deviation $s_{2}$. We know they come from two independent normally distributed population. How do we find the joint confidence interval ($\alpha$) for both of the population mean? I just don't see how the Working-Hotelling Procedure or Bonferroni Procedure apply without linear regression context.
