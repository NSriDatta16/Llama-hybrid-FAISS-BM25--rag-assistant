You should be able to do it directly in the selector after the url. See "Loading page fragments" here: http://api.jquery.com/load/ $(document).ready(function() { $("#table").load("weather_url table:last"); }); You should also know that it is bad for performance if you load a complete page and only use a small part of it. Then it would be better to separate the last table to its own page, and include (preferably server side) that in the original page.
