Is Glove a prediction-based model?

I read " Improving Distributional Similarity with Lessons Learned from Word Embeddings " and authors mentioned that Glove is a prediction-based model while it is clearly factorizing co-occorrence matrix which brings it close to SVD or LDA . Also in Glove paper they said: Unlike the matrix factorization methods, the shallow window-based methods suffer from the disadvantage that they do not operate directly on the co-occurrence statistics of the corpus. Instead, these models scan context windows across the entire corpus, which fails to take advantage of the vast amount of repetition in the data. It's not clearly mentioned which category Glove belongs to. Can anybody explain which category Glove goes into?
