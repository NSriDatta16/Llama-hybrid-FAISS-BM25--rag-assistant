It's recommended that if the variable you are trying to predict is not 50% for class 1 and 50% for class 2 (like most of the cases), you adjust the cutoff parameter to represents the real OOB in summary. For example, randomForest(data=my_data, formula, ntree = 501, cutoff=c(.96,.04)) In this case, probability of having a value of one class 1 is .96 while having a value of class 2 is .04 . Otherwise random forests use a threshold of 0.5 .
