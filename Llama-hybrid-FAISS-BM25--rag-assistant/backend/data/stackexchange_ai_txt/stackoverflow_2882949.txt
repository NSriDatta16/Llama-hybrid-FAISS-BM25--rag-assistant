Alright, I guess the answer is a bit obvious, but I was looking for a specific method. There's no setter for the vertical position, but you can easily just use a combination of writer.GetVerticalPosition() and paragraph.SpacingBefore to achieve this result. My solution: cb.MoveTo(0f, 225f); cb.SetLineDash(8, 4, 0); cb.LineTo(doc.PageSize.Width, 225f); cb.Stroke(); var pos = writer.GetVerticalPosition(false); var p = new Paragraph("test", _myFont) { SpacingBefore = pos - 225f }; doc.add(p);
