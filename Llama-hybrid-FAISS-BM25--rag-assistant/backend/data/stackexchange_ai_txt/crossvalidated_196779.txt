You are right. The equation for the shared variance-covariance matrix comes from Pooled Variance The shared covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is taken as a weighted average of individual covariance matrices, weigted by $n_i-1$ So $\Sigma = \frac{(n_1-1) * \Sigma_1 + (n_2-1) * \Sigma_2 + .... + (n_k-1) * \Sigma_k}{(n_1-1)+(n_2-1)+...+(n_k-1)}$
