If the parameters you are estimating do not vary over time, you may split the observed time series $y_{1:T}$ in two series, $y_{1:k}$ and $y_{k+1:T}$. Then you would apply MCMC on $y_{1:k}$ in order to sample from the posterior distribution of your parameters. After that, you could fix your parameters at some estimate taken from the posterior, e.g. the posterior mean or maximum, and evaluate the predictions on $y_{k+1:T}$.
