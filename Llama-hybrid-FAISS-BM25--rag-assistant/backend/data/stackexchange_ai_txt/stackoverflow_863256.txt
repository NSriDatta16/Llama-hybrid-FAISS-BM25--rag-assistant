Firstly, hearing that the background-images alone are 700kb astounds me. In addition to the content ON screen...that is a pretty heavy site. For starters, I would try to use image compression tools. Two tools come to mind Imagemagick and PNGCrush. PNGCrush is excellent in reducing all the extraneous metadata attached to photos, without compromising photo quality. I only recommend this as compressing the images will assist you in enabling the user to download a smaller quantity of content, which means quicker load times, which...at the end of the day...is what users want. I would also cache the images, such that when a user re-visits the site, the image is already cached on their end. This minimises the HTTP requests that are made each time a user visits your site. An example of where this technique is used on a commercial site is www.reactive.com. If you look the /js/headerImages.js file, they make use of image caching. Funnily enough, you will find the same src code at: http://javascript.internet.com/miscellaneous/random-image.html Considering that you have mentioned that images are randomly loaded, I am assuming you are using a Javascript library such as jQuery to create the effect. If you are, you can minimize page load times by using a CDN as opposed to referencing to a local copy of the jQuery lib which is stored on your server. I have performed performance testing on a site I made for a client, and over an average of 20 hits, saved 1.6 seconds through this technique! Hope that helps for now :)
