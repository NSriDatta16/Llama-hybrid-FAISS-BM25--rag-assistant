Negative Count Variables in Data --- modeling migration

I'm trying to explain migration rates in Europe with my regression using pca/pcr in glm. Of course some of the count data has to be negative in regions people move out of. This presents a problem for my regression, since I wanted to use the Poisson distribution (tip from my supervisor), which I obviously can't with the negative values in my data. How can I work around this? Which other models could be used? One thing i already did too, but not sure if I CAN do it: I just used the regions with positive migration ratios. But I'm sure this somehow skews my results even tho I get many significant regressors.
