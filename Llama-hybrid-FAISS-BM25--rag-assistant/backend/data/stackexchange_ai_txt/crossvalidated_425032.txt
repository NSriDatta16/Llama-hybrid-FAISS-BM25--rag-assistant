Non interventional studies and statistical testing

I have been part of an observational study which we also call a Non Interventional Study (NIS) which looks at a pool of subjects for whom we have 12 months data prior to starting a treatment and 12 months data after they started the treatment. The purpose is to compare the change in average value of an outcome before and after treatment. The sample of patients is approximately 200. The analysis plan is being prepared and someone in the team is trying to insist that "since this is NIS, we will not be able to pre-specify any tests in the analysis plan". To me this doesn't make any sense because I'm sure the analysis plan can specify something like depending on whether the data on change before and after treatment is normally distributed we can do a paired sample t-test. Do you agree with the statement that if a study is observational/NIS, it dictates whether or not you can plan any tests on it?? If yes, please can you also provide some references I can look at to understand why one cannot do a t-test on observational data? Thank you!
