Algorithm for how many students in a class did better than a student given this information

I want to make a simple application that will take in: number of students class average (score/100) median grade (score/100) class standard deviation the current grade of a student (score/100) The output would be how many students did better than that student. I'm interested in the best estimate possible with this information. I'm just not sure how to go about calculating this. The grades in my data set have the same average as the median, so please, simply explain how to do it this way.
