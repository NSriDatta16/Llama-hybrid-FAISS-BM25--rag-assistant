You can only prove the presence of a bug using tests/coverage, but you can never prove that the code is bug-free using tests/coverage. This fact indicates the boundaries of testing/coverage. This is the same in mathematics, you can disprove a theorem by finding a counter example, but you can never prove a theorem by not finding a counter example. So testing and coverage are only a substitute for correctness proofs, which are so difficult to do that they are almost never used. Testing and coverage can improve quality of the code, but there is no guarantee. It remains a craft an not a science.
