Can I use jQuery to locate a string of text within the HTML?

I'm just starting to learn about jQuery and am becoming familiar with how jQuery allows me to use selectors to search for particular IDs and classes. But is it also possible to identify strings of plain old text inside a paragraph? For example, say I wanted to find "gasoline" within these paragraph tags and convert it into a link: His veins burned gasoline. It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean.
