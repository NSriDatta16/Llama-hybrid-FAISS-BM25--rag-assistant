I understand that this is the way methods are identified in ri. Which came first? Yes, this is where it came from. When you use # , it automatically hyperlinks your methods, so references to other methods in documentation began being prefixed by the # sign. See here : Names of classes, source files, and any method names containing an underscore or preceded by a hash character are automatically hyperlinked from comment text to their description. You can't actually invoke a method this way, however. But that shouldn't be surprising; after all, is an invalid statement in C# despite being a valid documentation tag.
