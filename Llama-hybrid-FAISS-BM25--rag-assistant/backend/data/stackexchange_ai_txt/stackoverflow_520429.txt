Organizing classes into namespace in the App_Code folder not working as expected

I have a couple of classes that I have created for my web project and I am going to store them in the App_Code folder. I don't want to store all the classes in the top level (no namespace) but want to organize them into namespaces. So far this does not seem possible because when I use the "using XXXX;" namespace statement it still can't find the right class in my code behind files. What could I be doing incorrectly? EDIT: So for example I have namespace foo { public class bar { } } Then in my code behind page for default.aspx I have . . . using foo public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page { protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { bar NewBar = new bar(); } } The above DOES NOT work for me I have to use foo.bar NewBar = new foo.bar(); Does anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong? EDIT: Okay, so I have installed Visual Studio 2005 SP 1 and tried to convert it to a Web application and not a web site. STILL no luck.
