use utf8; simply indicates that your source code (including string literals) is in UTF-8. You also need to set the encoding of your input & output streams. You probably want to set the PERL_UNICODE variable in your environment. I set it to SAL , which breaks down like this: S STDIN / STDOUT / STDERR are UTF-8 A @ARGV is UTF-8 L but only in a UTF-8 locale See PERL_UNICODE and the -C option in perlrun . You can also use the open pragma to set a default encoding. If you're doing this in a module that you're distributing to others, you probably want use open ':locale'; so it won't unexpectedly turn on UTF-8 for people who don't use a UTF-8 locale.
