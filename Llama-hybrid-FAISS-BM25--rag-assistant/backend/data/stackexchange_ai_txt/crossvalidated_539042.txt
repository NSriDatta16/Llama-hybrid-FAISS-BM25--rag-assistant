Matrix representation of the OLS of an AR(1) process,

Is there any precise way to express the OLS estimator of the centred error terms $\{u_t\} _{t=1}^{n}$ that follows an AR(1) process? In other words, for \begin{equation} u_t=\rho u_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t,\quad \varepsilon_t\sim N(0,\sigma^2) \end{equation} is there a matrix representation for \begin{equation} \hat{\rho}=\frac{(1/n)\sum\limits_{t=1}^{n}u_tu_{t-1}}{(1/n)\sum\limits_{t=1}^{n}u_{t-1}^2} \end{equation} ? I suspect there should be. However, I seem to fail to find it in Hamilton or other sources or derive an elegant expression myself. Much appreciated in advance
