Each of your build agents should be using their own working directory. I have multiple build agents on a build server and when set up so, I don't have any issues with regards to workspaces. The default working directory for a build agent is something like: $(SystemDrive)\Builds\$(BuildAgentId)\$(BuildDefinitionPath) So there should be different folders based on $(BuildAgentId) .
