CSS - Force overflowing elements to disappear if partially hidden

Let's say we have a box with some short paragraphs: Some text Some text Some text Some text The height of the box is variable, so sometimes one of the paragraphs' text is partially hidden. Is there a CSS property that would force the paragraph to either display fully or not at all, or would this need to be calculated using javascript?
