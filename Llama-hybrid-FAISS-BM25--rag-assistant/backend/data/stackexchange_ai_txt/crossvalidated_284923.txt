Limiting the total number of visits to a particular state in Markov chain

I have a initial two state transition probability matrix, say A = [0.5 0.5; 0.7 0.3]. I want to create a Markov chain with 10 steps. In which I want that the chain should not have more than 40 % of state 1 and the remaining 60% to be in state 2. For example: I want a Markov chain like this: 1 1 2 2 1 1. As state 1 has occurred 40% of the time so now it should not occur in the chain and the remaining chain should be like 2 2 2 2. That is, the final chain should, for this simulation, looks like 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2. Any solution even near to imposing the global limitations is also acceptable. Thanks in Advance
