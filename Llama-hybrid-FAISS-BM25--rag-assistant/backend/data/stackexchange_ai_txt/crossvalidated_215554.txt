Code: AAA as 0 AAB,AAC,ABA,ACA,BAA,CAA as 1000...1101 12 triplets with 1 letter "A" as 1110000...1111011 8 triplets without "A" as 11111000...11111111 Each triplet takes on average 0.512*1+0.384*4+0.096*7+0.008*8=2.784 bits, or 0.928 bits per character. With coding 4-character, 5-character etc. groups, you can further decrease the number of bits per character. With long groups of characters and optimal coding, you can make the number of bits per character as close to the entropy as you want, but not less than the entropy.
