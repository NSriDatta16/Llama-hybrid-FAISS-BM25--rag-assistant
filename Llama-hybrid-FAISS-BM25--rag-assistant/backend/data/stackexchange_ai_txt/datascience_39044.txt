A Recursive Neural Network (RNN) is best suited to solve your problem. And if you want to take a step further try Recursive Neural Tensor Network . You can generate compositions for entire sentences using RNN both for your content and context data. This will help you map your sentences to a higher dimensional space and as an output you will get numerical values (or embeddings) both for your content and context. Feeding these values into a simple logistic classifier will do your task. For a brief overview on RNNs take a look at this lecture by Richard Socher.
