Percona/XtraDB storage volumes

One of Percona Server with XtraDB's main benefits is enhanced scalability over regular MySQL. Does anyone know how the data stored on disk for a given table compares between Percona/XtraDB and MySQL, i.e. is the same table stored in each system bigger, smaller or the same in Percona/XtraDB? I have a feeling it's the same, but would like to know for certain and haven't been able to find any relevant info. I've only started looking at Percona/XtraDB, so trying to gather some info on it, thanks.
