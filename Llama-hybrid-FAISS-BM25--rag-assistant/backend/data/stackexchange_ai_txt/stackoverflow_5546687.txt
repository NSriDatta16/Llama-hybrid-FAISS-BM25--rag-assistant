As Robert Harvey said, this looks like JSON. I would "pre-process" the files to make it JSON and take it from there. Basically, just run a bunch of search/replace to make it JSON -- like remove the $ with some variable name (not sure if that's legal in JSON) and surround the variables with "". The easiest would be to do this with grep in linux or some program in windows that has a good search/replace function (like notepad++ or textpad)
