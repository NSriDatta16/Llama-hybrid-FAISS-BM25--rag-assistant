Understanding estimates of qualitative supplementary variables by dimdesc() of FactoMineR package

FactoMineR package is helpful when doing PCA and much more. Coming across the output using dimdesc() function and looking at the estimates of supplementary qualitative variables I didn't grasp the idea of how these estimates were calculated. After peeking into the code of the function, these estimates seem to be those of ANOVA test. FactoMineR dimdesc() FactoMineR::dimdesc FactoMineR::condes I found the relevant code in condes() function which was called from inside dimdesc() function. ... res.aov MWE: Decathlon dataset library(FactoMineR) data(decathlon) res.pca Output of PCA by dimdesc() function dimdesc(res.pca, proba = 0.2) The estimates according to FactoMineR Link between the variable and the categorical variable (1-way anova) ============================================= R2 p.value Competition 0.0511 0.1553 Link between variable abd the categories of the categorical variables ================================================================ Estimate p.value Competition=OlympicG 0.4394 0.1553 Competition=Decastar -0.4394 0.1553 So as you can see, the qualitative variable (Competition) was a supplementary one, it doesn't contribute to constructing the very principal components of the PCA, they are just fed for descriptive and illustrative purposes. My trial to verify the estimates manually decathlon $PC1 ind$coord[, 1] # attaching PC1 or Dim1 to the dataset We use ANOVA test now: resAOV Output: > summary.lm(resAOV) Call: aov(formula = PC1 ~ Competition, data = decathlon, na.action = na.exclude) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.379 -0.961 -0.009 0.957 4.341 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -0.600 0.501 -1.20 0.24 CompetitionOlympicG 0.879 0.606 1.45 0.16 Residual standard error: 1.81 on 39 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.0511, Adjusted R-squared: 0.0268 F-statistic: 2.1 on 1 and 39 DF, p-value: 0.155 As you can see the p-value agrees with the dimdesc() output (0.155), however the estimate for OlympicG is (0.879) which is two times more than what dimdesc() function reported, why is that? Is there a statistical explanation to this or is it a bug in the function? Below is an excerpt from the book about FactoMineR using the same dataset on these estimates with some explanation: Book excerpt on FactoMineR On page 40 of "Exploratory Multivariate Analysis by Example Using R" by Fran√ßois Husson, we read the following: Note FactoMineR version:2.6 R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) -- "Funny-Looking Kid"
