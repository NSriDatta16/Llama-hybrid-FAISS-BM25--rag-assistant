Is there a way to use Plotly as an annotation tool, for labelling time-series for instance?

I have been tasked to create a tool aimed at labelling sections and/or precise data points of a biomedical time-series. Our main framework is written in Python. I would like to know whether it is possible to do it with Plotly, and if so, would someone mind sharing their experience? Kind regards, Bertrand
