Assuming single files are always using register_globals being on or off, you could create a list of all form element names which are submitted to a script and then check this script if it's using $fieldname without containing $_REQUEST['fieldname'] (or the $_POST , $_GET arrays). Your "check for notices" method would be ok if you can guarantee a very high code coverage while doing those checks (to ensure you didn't miss anything - the uncovered parts then have to be checked manually).
