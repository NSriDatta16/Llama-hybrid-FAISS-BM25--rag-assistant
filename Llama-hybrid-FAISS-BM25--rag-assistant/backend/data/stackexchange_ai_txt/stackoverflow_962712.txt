Various Latex questions

I had to learn Latex in a hurry and am now trying to fix a report. Most of the things works fine, but I have some problems. The abstract has very much padding. This makes the abstract break and end up in two pages. How do I make it fit on one page, by removing padding, not making the text smaller? I have a long table, which I use longtable for. But the table is wide so I use p{Xmm} to make it fit the page. That works fine. But then all text in the columns will use the whole column width, which I don't want. I use \setlength{\parskip}{Xmm} to get some spacing between paragraphs. That works fine. But then the sections will get lots of spacing. Is there any way to only set the bottom spacing? Then I have another question about Latex. Why are the standards so terrible? I mean. Do you ever want a table not to break automatically if the contents it too wide? And do you ever want there to be 0 spacing between paragraphs? I don't get it... Thanks!
