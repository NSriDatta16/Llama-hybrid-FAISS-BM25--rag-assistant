As one of two programmers of the Threewave Capture the Flag mod for Quake 3, I can attest to working on (and shipping) a mod as being an incredibly rewarding introduction to gaming. Working on a mod situates you next to production code, with all of its conventions and warts. It also introduces you to an already-working codebase that is, at a minimum, a few hundred thousand lines of code. This teaches you to be able to search and read code and primes you for working on a team. You also get to work with quality art assets and ship a product that garners attention for you and your small group. Working with XNA or downloading libraries and hanging out in forums is alright, but neither of them give you the starting point of a defined product, already commercially successful. These days, Half-Life 2 seems like a great starting point. Lots of C++ code, community support and a history of Valve and other studios hiring top talent from their own community. Best of luck!
