WCF (net.tcp) service: Works on all but one system

I've written created a WCF service inside a Windows service, and for some reason I can't figure out, I deployed the service on a bunch of systems (all nearly identical in OS and configuration), and it works on all but one server. The configuration for all deployments is identical except for the service's base address. When the service is started, I get no exception when I open the ServiceHost , and when using netstat -anp I can see the socket has been opened by the service's process. I've set up Windows firewall logging for dropped packets, but the log file remains empty. If I try accessing the WCF service from WCF Test Client, I get the following message: Error: Cannot obtain Metadata from net.tcp://myhostname:9001/SysMonitorAgent If this is a Windows (R) Communication Foundation service to which you have access, please check that you have enabled metadata publishing at the specified address. For help enabling metadata publishing, please refer to the MSDN documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=65455. WS-Metadata Exchange Error URI: net.tcp://myhostname:9001/SysMonitorAgent Metadata contains a reference that cannot be resolved: 'net.tcp://myhostname:9001/SysMonitorAgent'. There was no endpoint listening at net.tcp://myhostname:9001/SysMonitorAgent that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details. I've tried WCF logging, but the log file does not even get created. The config for the service is as follows: I'm kinda lost, because there is NO indication whatsoever as to why it's not working. Any help would be appreciated.
