For "why", I think it's just a new transformer that maybe didn't get thoroughly thought-out. The default of "half the features" in particular seems very odd to me. A middle ground, that I think is more useful, is to select features until there is no (or little) further improvement. That's being implemented in PR20145 . If they would also expose the scores in an attribute, you could post-process with this PR by setting tol=-np.inf (so that all the features would eventually get added) and then selecting the best exposed score. I don't see an Issue suggesting storing scores (as in RFECV.cv_results_ ), but the ranking has been suggested in Issue19583 .
