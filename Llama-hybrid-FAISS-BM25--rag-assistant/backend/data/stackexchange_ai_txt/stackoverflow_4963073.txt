Remove element from XML file using php when i need only certain ones

I know the title might seem a little strange and I apologize in advance, but i want to be able to do this: the xml file looks like this: 12345 Name of Event 2 Tacoma Washington 98421 now there are a ton of these with different category ID's (lets say 1-5) I want to be able to just save the ones with category 2 and delete the rest. any ideas? I have been on here and saw a couple of different examples but couldn't get them to work. like this one: $searchString = '1'; $doc = new DOMDocument; $doc->formatOutput = TRUE; $doc->preserveWhiteSpace = FALSE; $doc->load($path.'name.xml'); $xPath = new DOMXPath($doc); $query = sprintf('//data/row[./PCatID[text()="%s"]]', $searchString); } $doc->saveXML(); please help me. thanks in advance.
