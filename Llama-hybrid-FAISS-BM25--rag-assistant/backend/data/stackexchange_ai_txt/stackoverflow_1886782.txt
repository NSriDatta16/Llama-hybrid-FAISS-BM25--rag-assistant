you should also check whether POST was really sent: if (!empty($_POST)) { // ... your code here } next thing: you don't need closing tag ?> if your *.php file consist only PHP code - end of file is also correct end of PHP block of code - it's "good-to-have" habit, because in some cases it helps you to avoid error: "Cannot add/modify header information - headers already sent by..." next problem - wrong way of inserting variables into string: $sql = 'INSERT INTO Members (ID, FName, LName, Phone, EmailAddress, Month, Day, Year, Username, Password) VALUES' . '(\'\', \'$FName\', \'$LName\', \'$Phone\', \'$EmailAddress\', \'$Month\', \'$Day\', \'$Year\', \'$Username\', \'$Password\')'; correct way: $sql = "INSERT INTO Members (ID, FName, LName, Phone, EmailAddress, Month, Day, Year, Username, Password) VALUES (null, '$FName', '$LName', '$Phone', '$EmailAddress', '$Month', '$Day', '$Year', '$Username', '$Password')"; more info here next - as Deniss said, instead of: $FName = $_POST["FName"]; should be: $FName = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST["FName"]); actually you should fist check weather magic quotes gpc are on or off: if (get_magic_quotes_gpc()) { if (!empty($_POST)) { array_walk_recursive($_POST, 'stripslashes_value'); } } function stripslashes_value(&$value) { $value = stripslashes($value); } without this you could have problem with double \\ inserted into db (it depends on your server configuration) and last but not least: as Robert said you miss one more important thing: mysql_query($sql);
