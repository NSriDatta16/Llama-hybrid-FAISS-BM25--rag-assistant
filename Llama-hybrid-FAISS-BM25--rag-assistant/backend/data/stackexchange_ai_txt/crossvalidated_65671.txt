How can I calculate prediction error rate in logistic regression?

Can anybody lead me with a small simulation? Should I calculate prediction error rate from a classification table while splitting the data into two parts then fitting on the training data and predicting on the test data and see the misclassification (i.e. how many 1 predicted as 0 and 0 as 1, calculating the rate of misclassification). I tried the following R code: # prediction error rate for logit and probit for different sample sizes and sigma: mu cut.point.latent,1,0) # cut point for y*(latent) to be y(observed) x1 = cut.point.prob,1,0) pred.res.probit = cut.point.prob,1,0) logit.obs.pred
