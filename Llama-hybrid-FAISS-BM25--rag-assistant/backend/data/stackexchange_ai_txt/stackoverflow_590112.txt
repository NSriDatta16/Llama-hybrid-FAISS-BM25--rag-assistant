You can't do that with the native tools (SQL Server Management Studio) but there's a workaround: create a new empty database with those 15 tables - just the schema, not the data. Then when you're writing T-SQL code, you can quickly drag and drop elements out of those tables into your code. The downside is that changes made in the real database won't be reflected in your working database, but you can automate that with a script to pull out the objects you need and recreate them in your working database. You can run that as often as you like (like every X hours, or as a SQL Agent job that runs when your local dev server starts up) without losing data, since you won't be modifying the structure in your "favorites" database.
