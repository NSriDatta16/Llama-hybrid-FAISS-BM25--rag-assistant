The Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap will not return Zend_Mail but Zend_Mail_Message . So, you'll have to look here for the functions: http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.10/Zend_Mail/Zend_Mail_Message.html . As you can see it extends Zend_Mail_Part which has the getContent() method. The way to get the body part is (in one line): $content = $storage->getMessage($i)->getContent();
