Team activity/game for illustrating design in a SCRUM environment

I'm looking for a team building / training activity for some of my scrum teams. I want something that really illustrates the flexibility that the team has when implementing stories to define the scope and complexity of the feature themselves. Most of the teams have long-term waterfall experience and are used to having a well-defined specification. I'm looking for something that illustrates the need for the team to vary the scope of what they are building themselves, dependent on the time and resources available. I couldn't find anything at tastycupcakes.com and Google wasn't much help. Maybe someone has prepared something themselves they would care to share? Edit (in response to request for example in comments) Suppose the team has committed to building a story for displaying data to a user in a paged list for analysis purposes. The acceptance criteria can be fulfilled easily but a differnet implementation might provide added functionality e.g. wrapping a third party control which has built-in sorting and grouping functionality. The point is, because the scrum time window is absolutely fixed the scope of the implementation may be pushed if the team feels they are ahead of schedule, especially if some technical designs proved less problematic than thought. Conversely, if some tasks have taken longer than anticipated, the team can short-cut the user story while still making sure what they delivers satisfies the acceptance criteria. The thing I am trying to get away from is the current mindset that the feature has a specification set in stone, and that's what will be built, whatever the circumstances.
