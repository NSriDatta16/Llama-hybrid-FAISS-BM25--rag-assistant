If it's just the one ArrayList and you don't have any complex ordering to your datastore, I would just save it out internal storage in binary format. That will save you a lot of overhead trying to encode and decode the file in a text format such as XML or JSON. A link to check out is Data Storage . Edit: I put together a quick and dirty github repo to give an example. It's not something I would just copy and paste into a project, but it should show you the basic mechanics. Edit 2: Note that all the Objects inside the ArrayList need to implement Serializable or be primitive types for this to work.
