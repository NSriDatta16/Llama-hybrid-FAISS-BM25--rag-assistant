I will go through your question one by one: How to use time series for this data You can train an RNN multivariate regressor, by feeding time series of your variables. Your first layer would be recurrent (LSTM or GRU), and provided with the following input_shape : ( batch size , input size , Number of variables ) I have to only two dimension bike types and area, they may increase later(like their color and their condition) how to handle this If you need to add a new variable that didn't exist before, I'm afraid you'll have to re-train your model. A different architecture = different set of weights to be trained. Is the LSTM is the only way? No, you can use recurrent layers with GRU cells. GRUs are different from LSTM: they have less parameters (i.e. less powerful) but are faster to train. There is no right or wrong choice, I think it's worth to test both architectures and see which performs better on the current task. Are my data columns (data types and area) dimensions or features Please rephrase this question, it's not clear what you mean. What do you mean with " are [data types and area] dimensions or features "? All the variables displayed above can be used as input variables, if you pre-process them accordingly. For example, datetime information could be turned into more numerical variable to capture seasonality trends (this is just an example). Bike type and Area could be one-hot encoded, or other related information could be joined based on their values... there's plenty of choice.
