How to perform power analysis on repeated measures ANOVA? G*Power 3 is free software that provides a user-friendly GUI interface for performing power calculations. It supports power calculations for repeated measures ANOVA. What is the appropriate analysis for your design? Here are a range of points related to what you have mentioned: More time points will give a clearer indication of how the effect, if any, of your intervention operates over time. Thus, if the improvements decay over time or get greater, more time points will give a clearer sense of these patterns, both on average, and at an individual-level. If you have 12 time points or more, I'd look at multilevel modelling, particularly if you are expecting any missing observations. You are unlikely to be interested in whether there is an effect of time. Rather you are likely to be interested in various specific effects (e.g., changes pre and post intervention; perhaps a linear or quadratic improvement effect post-intervention). You could also look at using planned contrasts on top of repeated measures ANOVA. Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis: Modeling Change and Event Occurrence is a good starting point to learn about multilevel modelling of repeated measures data. The number of time points over and above pre- and post- wont do much to increase your power to detect the effect of your intervention. More time points will increase your reliability of measurement, and it might ensure that you capture the time period where the effect applies, but probably the bigger issue will be the sample size in the two conditions. Assuming you are truly randomly allocating cases to conditions, the populations are by definition equal on the dependent variable, and one could argue that a significance test of baseline differences is meaningless. That said, researchers often still do it, and I suppose it does provide some evidence that random allocation has actually occurred. There is a fair amount of debate about the best way to test the effect of an intervention in a pre-post-intervention-control design. A few options include: (a) the condition * time interaction; (b) the effect of condition but just at post intervention; (c) an ANCOVA looking at the effect of condition, controlling for pre, with post as the DV.
