Continued presence of AjaxControlToolkit requests months after removing from site

we removed all traces of the AjaxControlToolkit from our busy site probably about 6 months ago, yet we are still seeing a considerable amount of errors in our logs for: "Could not load file or assembly 'AjaxControlToolkit' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified." The request is of the format: http://www.mysite.com/WebResource.axd?d=pPyiEUtn0pvBAnLkfcFmsCBZpn10hZQ-g7SR3D8ta3UkzGvlLexhSxaX6eQlLiY6ouSNL9_ncb0xOjJNL_XOJg2&t=634159218460000000 User agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;) Anyone got any ideas? Bot? Proxies? Anything to do with temp ASP.Net files hanging about on the server? A web.config line needing removal? We're stumped... Thanks, Monty
