You need to supply more information. You were asked for an algorithm, but supplied code. Did you comment the code? How much? (I'd like to see the question and your answer, but perhaps that's requesting too much). So I'll answer based on my own experience. If I'm asking for an algorithm, then I want something that explains, in decent english, how to solve the problem and/or meet the requirements of the question. Diagrams are also good (sometimes better). Paragraph, point form, whatever - it just needs to be clear, concise and correct. If you supply me with code that does the above, then full marks. However, if you supply code that is pure "language" and rather cryptic, then marks will be lost - more or less depending on how cryptic the code actually is. Even with code, I'd like to see a diagram as well, just to show complete understanding of the concepts. One of the hardest things I face when teaching programming is in getting students to write MORE, not less. Sometimes I have had to remind them that an assignment (or exam) is not an entry in the "most obfuscated code contest". ;-) Cheers, -R
