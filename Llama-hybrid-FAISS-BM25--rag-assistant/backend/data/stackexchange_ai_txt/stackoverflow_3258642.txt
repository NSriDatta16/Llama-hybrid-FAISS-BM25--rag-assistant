I usually recommend a design called Closure Table . See example in my answer to What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree? I also designed this presentation: Models for Hierarchical Data with SQL and PHP . I developed a PHP app that render a tree in 0.3 seconds, from a collection of hierarchical data with 490k nodes. I blogged about Closure Table here: Rendering Trees with Closure Table . I wrote a chapter about different strategies for hierarchical data in my book, SQL Antipatterns Volume 1: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming .
