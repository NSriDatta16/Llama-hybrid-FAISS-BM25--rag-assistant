(source: clear-code.com ) I am using UxU, which is a reworked version of MozUnit . Though I was initially intimidated by the fact that its documentation is half in Japanese, I've used it for few hours and I already feel like recommending it! Besides allowing you to test your javascript code within the same environment wherein it will run, it also provides a number of convenient helpers methods to remote-control the browser and automating functionalities such loading URLs, opening Tabs, modifying preferences, accessing files and local storage.. Definitively worth of a try!
