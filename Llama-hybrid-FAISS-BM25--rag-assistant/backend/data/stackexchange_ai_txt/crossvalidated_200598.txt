Forecasting methodology and k-fold cross validation for a vector autoregression

This is a follow up question the question that can be found here , and is a result of me having implemented (after as careful evaluation as I'm capable of) the alterations and changes suggested. Below is my method and should be replicable. My question relates to the implementation of k-fold cross validation and whether the code produces a mean average error value that is reliable and whether there are some aspects of k-fold cross validation I may have neglected, thus skewing any results. Otherwise any comments, both as to the method as it stands or the logic behind their inclusion (see above link) is welcome. library(plyr) library(forecast) library(vars) #Read Data da=read.table("VARdata.txt", header=T) dac Edit based on answer below: As per the answer below I have changed the code for the cross validation to this (full test code included for ease): library(forecast) library(vars) library(plyr) x Would this be a better application of cross validation? I realize that it is no longer k-fold, but is based on the link provided in the answer.
