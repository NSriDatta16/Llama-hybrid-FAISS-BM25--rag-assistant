Disable specific warnings in GCC

On Microsoft compilers, specific warnings can be disabled with a #pragma, without disabling other warnings. This is an extremely useful feature if the compiler warns over something that "has to be done". Does GCC at this point have a similar feature? It seems like an obvious enough feature that it’s unimaginable that it wouldn't have this feature yet, but older information on the web suggests this feature doesn't exist. What is one to use in GCC? Specifically, I like to use multi-character constants, like 'abc'. These evaluate effectively as a base 256 number - a very handy feature, but it triggers a warning. It’s very handy for switching on four character strings in a case statement.
