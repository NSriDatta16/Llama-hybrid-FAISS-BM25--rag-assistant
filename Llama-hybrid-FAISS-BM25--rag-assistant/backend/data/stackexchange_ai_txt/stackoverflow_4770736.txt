Big sessions eat ressources (I suppose Django makes no exception to this). Make it a JSON list, then use the user's browser local storage : http://jstorage.info , a jQuery plugin, cross-browser. You'll need a way to tell if the data is outdated (checksum? did not find the solution yet) to get back to the server and ask for a new JSON var in the template.
