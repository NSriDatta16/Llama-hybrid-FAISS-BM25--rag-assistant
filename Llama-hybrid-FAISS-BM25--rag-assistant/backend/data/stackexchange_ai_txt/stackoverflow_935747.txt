Core Data defines the interface for interacting with the database, not the storage itself. You can use XML, Binary, or SQLite as the storage file. If you want a quick-and-dirty solution, you could use a basic SQLite application such as Menial's Bases to create a database. You can then add this to your XCode project for use by the iPhone. If you intend for the desktop client to be used by your iPhone customers, you can can use much of the same Core Data code from your iPhone project.
