Multiple Surveys and Confidence Interval

Hello and i please need some assistance. Every week I send out a survey request to 1,000 customers rating service from 1-10. Each week only 20% respond. Each week I report on the average. Because this is a sample, shouldn't I also report the margin of error? Follow up. Instead of reporting weekly, i sum all of the surveys for every week and report the results. This would change the margin of error calculation. Does that violate any principals? That feels incorrect as I am running weekly surveys.
