The new-style-for-loop ("foreach") works on arrays, and things that implement the Iterable interface. It's also more analogous to Iterator than to Iterable , so it wouldn't make sense for Enumeration to work with foreach unless Iterator did too (and it doesn't). Enumeration is also discouraged in favor of Iterator .
