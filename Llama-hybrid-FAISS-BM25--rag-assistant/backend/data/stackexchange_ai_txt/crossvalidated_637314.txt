The quoted statement in your question seems to me preposterously broad. Both internet and paper questionnaires vary hugely in reliability and validity. Some of the issues are the same in both formats. E.g badly written questions, badly written answers (if it's multiple choice), inadequate coverage of a topic, sensitive questions, etc. In addition, internet based questionnaires have some additional problems. As J-J-J pointed out in a comment, some (including the one you linked to) can be filled out multiple times by the same person. The random sampling problem is huge in both internet and paper (as well as phone and other) methods of administration. And it can be huge. However, if you mail or phone a survey, you have at least a little knowledge of who filled it out. It's probably someone at the address or phone number you gave. For sensitive questions, there are additional problems, some of which may be easier to address over the internet. E.g. you can implement random choice or list selection more easily via computer. I haven't looked at the research in a long time, but, at one point, there was data showing that different ethnic groups (in the US) reacted differently, with some answering more honestly over the net and some more honestly in person. OTOH, methods such as ACASI and ACATI would be hard over the internet (although maybe there is now technology to do that, like I said, it's been a while since I looked at the research). You can do a good survey online or in person or by mail. And you can do bad ones all three ways, as well. All of them take more effort to do well than most people think. Internet ones may take even more care than paper.
