It depends both on the complexity of the model (the number of effective parameters) and the signal/noise ratio in the data. The higher the former and the lower the latter, the more data is necessary for convergence. Therefore, all those rules of thumb can't help being tied to a particular domain where some typical models are used and some average signal/noise ratio is assumed.
