Extremely slow CNN

I am trying to train a CNN with keras in R. I have a time series that is 3-dimensional, so every sample has dimensions 95 x 365 and has 80 features, which I feed in as channels. The output is only 1 value. The problem is that the net is extremely slow. Training the net for only 1 epoch with 400 samples takes 33 minutes. The architecture is very simple (I actually had a deeper net but since it was so slow I simplified it to see if that helps): model % layer_conv_2d(filters = 32, kernel_size = c(9, 9), activation = "relu", input_shape = c(95, 365, 80)) %>% layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = 2) %>% layer_flatten() %>% layer_dense(units = 50, activation = "relu") %>% layer_dense(units=1) model %>% compile( loss = 'mse', optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop() ) model %>% fit( x_train, y_train, batch_size = 32, epochs = 1, verbose = 0 ) I really do not know what the issue is. I trained simpler networks such as MLPs and the computational time was in a "normal" range, like a few minutes for e.g. 100 epochs. So I guess the problem is not in the hardware I use.
