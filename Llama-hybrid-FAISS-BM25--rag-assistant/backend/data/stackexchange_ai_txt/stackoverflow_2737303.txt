WebLogic supports security policies managed by security administrators. The Oracle WebLogic Server Security Model includes: application business logic separated from security code complete scope of security coverage for all JavaEE and non-JavaEE components Oracle BI Publisher: Oracle Business Intelligence Publisher (BI Publisher, formerly XML Publisher) is an enterprise reporting solution to author, manage, and deliver all types of highly formatted documents eliminating the need for costly point solutions. Built on open standards, IT staff and developers can create data models against practically any data source and use BI Publisher APIs to build custom applications leveraging existing data sources and infrastructure. End users can easily design report layouts using familiar desktop tools, dramatically reducing the time and cost needed to develop and maintain reports. Extremely efficient and highly scalable, BI Publisher can generate tens of thousands of documents per hour with minimal impact to transactional systems. Reports can be viewed online or scheduled for delivery to a wide range of destinations.
