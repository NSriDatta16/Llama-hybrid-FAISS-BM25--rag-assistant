Suppose you are about to do a public opinion poll about Candidate A's popularity compared with one other candidate for the same office. The two candidates are affiliated with opposing political parties. In the past such elections have often been close to 50-50. There have already been a few polls of unknown credibility showing Candidate A slightly ahead. In these circumstances you might use the prior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(150, 130).$ It has mean about 0.536, median about the same, and it shows probability a little over $1/4$ that the election will be very close: $P(0.48 where $p_A$ Candidate A's current favorability. qbeta(.5, 150, 130) [1] 0.5357994 diff(pbeta(c(.48, .52), 150, 130)) [1] 0.26742 This prior is very roughly equivalent to having a small impartially administered poll of 280 subjects of whom 150 favored Candidate A. Of course, especially if you had no prior information at all, you might use an uninformative prior distribution such as the Jeffreys prior $\mathsf{Beta}(0.5, 0.5)$ or a uniform prior as you suggest in your Question $\mathsf{Beta}(1,1).$ But one advantage of a Bayesian approach is the opportunity to begin with whatever information or opinion you feel comfortable using. If a poll of 900 randomly chosen subjects shows 500 for Candidate A, then your mildly informative prior gives the posterior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(650, 530)$ and a 95% posterior probability interval (credible interval) of $(0.522, 0.579)$ for $p_A.$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 650, 530) [1] 0.5224025 0.5791291 The Jeffreys prior would give the credible interval (also, often used as a frequentist confidence interval) of $(0.523, 0.587).$ It is not a lot different from the credible interval above, using our mildly informative prior. qbeta(c(.025,.975), 500.5, 400.5) [1] 0.5229567 0.5877977 Note: As a campaign progresses, the popularity of any one candidate can rise or fall very quickly. So, a prudently managed campaign will use a number of polls over time.
