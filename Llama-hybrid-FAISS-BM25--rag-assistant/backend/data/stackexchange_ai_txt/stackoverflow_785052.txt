I generally don't write lots of code until i have the time to do it. The reason is that for me to get effective takes focus and that takes a bit of time to be correctly focused. That said those 30min slots are great for Writing more tests: nothing like trying to get to 100% code coverage, and it's not a big waste since you are investing Research: I spend lots of time reading blogs, looking for frameworks I can use or tools. Spending 30min finding a framework that does 80% of a feature you need is much better than spending hours trying to code it. The other factor to this is that if you implement the framework and you find it is a bad fit you are better educated in the needs which means your development will be smoother.
