UitextField resignFirstResponder does not work in scroll view

I have 2 functions to resignFirstResponder but neither of them works when the textfields are in scrollview my functions: -(BOOL)textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField *)theTextField { if (theTextField == textField1) { [textField1 resignFirstResponder]; } if (theTextField == textField2) { [textField2 resignFirstResponder]; } if (theTextField == textField3) { [textField3 resignFirstResponder]; } return YES; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; [textField1 resignFirstResponder]; [textField2 resignFirstResponder]; [textField3 resignFirstResponder]; } I have linked the scroll view in IB, I can not find out why it does not works there only when I click outside of scrollview.so it only responds to view, but why?I thougth that [[event allTouches] anyObject] respond to ALLtouches at ANYObjects Thanks for help
