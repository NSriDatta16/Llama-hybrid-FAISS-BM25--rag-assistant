What should I do in order to be able to work with maven + eclipse + wicket + hibernate + spring in Mac OS?

I want to create a web app that will use wicket, hibernate and spring frameworks. My IDE of choice is Eclipse, I am using maven for the .war generation and I am running Mac OS. What steps should I follow to correctly install and configure all the tools so as to have a project running that relies on these 3 frameworks. I was able to successfully set up wicket but I am having trouble for setting up hibernate and spring. I went through multiple tutorials but I still couldn't find the solution. Thanks! I will now try to explain a bit what is the problem I can't solve. I first began with a clean project: mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=test.framework -DartifactId=microForum Moved on to the project folder and mvn eclipse:eclipse Imported the project from eclipse Looked into the apache wicket homepage where there are multiple examples, so I read through the page and that was enough to learn what to add to the pom and had wicket and everything up and running nicely My next step was trying to use hibernate and/or spring. I thought that "adding" hibernate and spring in the same way I added the wicket necessary configurations and dependencies to the pom (by hand) might not be that easy. So I tried using the maven archetype: appfuse-basic-spring. So: mvn archetype:generate -> launchs the wizard that lets you choose among different archetypes After choosing the archetype number 2 ( Hibernate + Spring + Spring MVC) it fails After googling a bit I found out why it fails (something like I should add a -archetype after appfuse-basic-spring. So, instead of using the wizard, I put: mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.appfuse.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=appfuse-basic-spring*-archetype* -DarchetypeVersion=2.1.0-M1 -DgroupId=test.framework -DartifactId=microForum2 This created my project (after multiple warnings). I paste a screenshot (Image 1) because some of the information might have some important meaning : http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/6687/screenshot20100323at112.png - Image 1 I then did mvn eclipse:eclipse and it started downloading millions of things, which seemed very odd so I Control+C it. Following schmimd04 answer I tried to use the eclipse maven plugin but I couldn't create a maven project: Unable to create project from archetype [org.appfuse.archetypes:appfuse-basic-spring:RELEASE] The defined artifact is not an archetype Thanks! p.d: My Mac OS already had maven installed (version 2.2.0), I tried downloading the last one and repeating the same steps but I still had the same trouble.
