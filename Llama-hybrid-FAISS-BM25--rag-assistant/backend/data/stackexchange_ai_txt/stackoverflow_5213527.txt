This likely has nothing to do with that action. You said, "nothing displays and the app immediately quits", which means that the action was never sent. Need your message from the Console, but check Did you use initWithNibName? If so, did you get the name exactly right? Are you doing anything with Outlets in init? You should not -- and do it in viewDidLoad. Knowing the message in your console will help us give you the real answer though. Edit: based on your console message Double-click .xib file to go to IB Click on File's Owner Go to Connections Inspector The view outlet is not set (right?) -- drag the circle to the view icon in the Document Window. (I am sorry, but I don't have IB in front of me -- this is from memory -- look around for the view outlet in connection inspectors if I am wrong about the exact location)
