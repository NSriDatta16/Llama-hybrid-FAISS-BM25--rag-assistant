Magento guest checkout option not showing up regardless of allow guest checkout setting

I’m having a strange problem with my fresh magento installation. There is no option for guest checkout even though I have Disable Onepage Checkout: NO, and Allow Guest Checkout: YES. I’ve looked at the core_config_data in the db and can’t find anything that would instigate this behavior. I have no template customizations and have disabled cache… I installed the latest magento via command line ssh and included the sample data pack. I installed another copy of magento on my local machine (without the test data) and it is working fine. Perhaps it has something to do with the sample data?? I’m at a loss here… Ideas anyone??
