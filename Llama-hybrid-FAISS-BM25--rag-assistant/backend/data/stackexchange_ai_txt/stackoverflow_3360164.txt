jQuery how to find the class of the Droppable Div?

I have two divs: one draggable and one droppable When I release the draggable div I want to find the class of it's parent to take an action if it is dropped on a droppable div, otherwise cancel the dragging. I want to put a condition in the stop function of the draggable that if it's dropped on a div with class "drop" then it's ok, otherwise cancel the drag operation What can be the function that performs this ? thanks.
