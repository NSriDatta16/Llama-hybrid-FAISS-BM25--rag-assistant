Logistic regression not converging

I run a multivariable logistic regression in SAS using the main effect/independent variable as continuous and categorical. As a continuous variable the confidence intervals of the odds ratios were extremely wide, i.e. >0.001 to I run the same predictor variable with two different continuous outcome and I get the fit diagnostics below: [ Fit diagnostics ] 1 [ Fit diagnostics 2 ] 2 Parameter Estimate for 2nd image: -342.57, 95%CIs -1033.52, 340.37 - similar results for the first image as well. Thanks.
