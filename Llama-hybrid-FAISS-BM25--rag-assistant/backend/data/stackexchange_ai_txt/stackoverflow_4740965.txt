It should be possible, you need to change lucene ranking function (solr is using lucene internally). You can replace the default implementation. I do not know how much time you need to make it running but -- if you really need a boolean retrieval engine -- you can do it. You should start your investigations from this document . I am not sure what for you need such a functionality, but I suppose that maybe you want to use Solr as a key value store. In such a case, you need to change your indexing configuration - your analyzer should not tokenize input text. If so, the text will be placed in the index without modification (the same analyzer is used for processing queries). Thus if you provide in the query a key ("1234" for a field "MY_KEY"), you will get a corresponding document for this key.
