Why doesn't a specific CSS rule override a general one?

Author's edit: sorry for the confusion on this. I changed the path to another folder and was reading from the old files! My fault. Thanks for all the help. My understanding is that if you place a specific rule underneath a general rule in CSS, the specific one should override the general one. For example, on this page which is in development, I have the following code: The body id is as follows: Test Blog Entry published September 13, 2010 This is a test of the American Broadcasting System to see if my entry shows up properly on the website. Summary information goes here. Sentence two. Sentence three. Here is the generic styling for this content: body#inside #content p { margin: 0; padding: 0 0 20px 20px; color: #000; font: 14px/22px "Myriad Pro", Arial, sans-serif; } I need to modify the padding on the paragraph and style the date information so beneath this I placed the following: body#inside.blog #content p { padding: 0 20px 10px 20px; } body#inside.blog #content p.entry-date { font-size: 11px; color: #4d6b53; font-style: italic; margin: -3px 0 0 20px; padding: 0; } I would appreciate some help getting this worked out. Thanks!
