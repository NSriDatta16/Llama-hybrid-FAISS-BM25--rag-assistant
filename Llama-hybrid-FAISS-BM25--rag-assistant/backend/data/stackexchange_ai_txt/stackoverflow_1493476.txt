I'd suggest to use a disk-persistent cache like Ehcache . Just configure it to keep as many fragments of your matrix in memory as you like and it will take care of the serialization. All you have to do is decide on the way of fragmentation. Another approach that comes to my mind is using Terracotta (which recently bought Ehache by the way). It's great to get a large network-attached heap that can easily manage your 10^10 double values without caring about it in code at all.
