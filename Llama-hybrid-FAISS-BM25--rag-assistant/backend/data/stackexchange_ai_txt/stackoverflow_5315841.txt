The error is exactly what it says it is: the indices must be integers or logicals. When you try to index using img1 , it's likely that it contains non-integers, which throws the error. Here's what you should do: E=[img1; img2; img3];%#combine the images E1=E(1:512,:,:); E2=E(513:1024,:,:); E3=E(1025:end,:,:); You can also do it more elegantly as imgDim=size(img1,1);%# since they're all equal dimensions, we'll need just one. imgCell=mat2cell(E,[imgDim,imgDim,imgDim],imgDim,3);%# create a cell [E1, E2, E3]=deal(imgCell{:});%#distribute contents of cell
