I would start by giving each Twitter user a unique ID - this will become the index of your dataset. Then for each unique ID (twitter user), do feature engineering and brainstorm different features that you think would be useful. I would highly recommend reading 'Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow' if you don't have much experience with machine learning and neural networks for an implementation based approach. I'd also recommend researching and reading papers about Twitter user trends and the different category of users if you haven't already. Knowing the subject matter of what you are trying to model is very important. Keep in mind, that you don't need to be very selective with the features you add. As long as you can come up with a reasonable suspicion, go ahead and add the data. Keep in mind, this will add to the amount of time you spend cleaning the data. Some features I can think of: Parse their tweets and use a 'bag of words' model to assign a tone, negative or positive. Some category of users may have more positive or negative tone. For example, political tweets on Twitter. Twitter API may disclose what country the user is from, or even the city they are from. Some cities have a bigger population of certain people. For example, there are more farmers in Idaho than in NYC. Number of retweets and likes per unique ID. Number of tweets per user (as another commenter mentioned) Another thought: a problem like this is ripe for a network analysis and graph based network model. Here is an example .
