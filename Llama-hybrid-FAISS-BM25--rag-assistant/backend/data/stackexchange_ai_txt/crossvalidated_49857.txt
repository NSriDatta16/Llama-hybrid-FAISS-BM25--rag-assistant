Using Duan Smear factor on a two-part model

I'm running a two-part model on a health insurance claims dataset where I predict the probability of nonzero health care costs using a logistic regression (1st part), then predict the magnitude of the log health care costs using an OLS regression (2nd part). Question: When calculating the expected health care costs = (prob. nonzero claim)x(expected claim amount)x(Duan Smear factor) what is the value for the expected claim amount for the zero $ claims? For example in the following table: member observed cost prob. of nonzero cost expected cost predicted cost 1 0 .3 ? (.3) x (?) x (ds factor) 2 0 .2 ? (.2) x (?) x (ds factor) 3 1,000 .6 900 (.6) x (900) x (ds factor) 4 5,000 .7 7,000 (.7) x (7,000) x (ds factor) what is entered into the expected cost column for members 1 and 2 if the OLS regression is only applied to the nonzero cost data? Do we score the zero cost claims using the OLS regression parameters to calculate expected cost?
