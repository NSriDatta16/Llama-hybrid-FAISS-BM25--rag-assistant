I know that when we standardize a predictor, "one unit change" becomes one standard deviation in the predictor, but what if we only center the data on the mean (i.e. only subtract all values by the mean) ? If you don't standardize then one unit change will relate to whatever the units are that are used to measure the predictor variable. For instance if the predictor is temperature measured in Kelvin, then on unit change means an increase by one Kelvin. In your example you have 'sensory experience ratings' as predictor and one-unit change will relate to whatever the scale is used to obtain those ratings. Possibly your sensory experience rating is the one from Juhasz, B.J., Yap, M.J. Sensory experience ratings for over 5,000 mono- and disyllabic words. Behav Res 45, 160â€“168 (2013). https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-012-0242-9 Please rate each word on a 1 to 7 scale, with 1 meaning the word evokes no sensory experience for you, 4 meaning the word evokes a moderate sensory experience, and 7 meaning the word evokes a strong sensory experience. In that case the ratings are based on averages of questionnaires with a 7 point scale. The meaning of one-unit is the change of the score on that questionnaire by one.
