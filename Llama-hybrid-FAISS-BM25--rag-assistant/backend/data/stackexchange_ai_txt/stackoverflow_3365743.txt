From your description it sounds more like your application (as a single app) would be logically organized like this: usa.com usa.com/utah usa.com/utah/andy usa.com/indiana ... You could use separate domains for the states through some URL rewriting to achieve what you want. Your application would handle the search logic. -OR- The alternative is to setup each site as it's own application. The usa site would just be configured to search each of the state sites (via a query string maybe) and aggregate the results. I know there are other ways to setup what you are looking for but I think these are probably the two major alternatives.
