A measure of randomness or predictability for a time series is the MSE or R-Sq from a reasonable model. Comparison of these measures across customer could facilitate groupings and exceptionally different customers. In order to build a good model for daily/hourly data which I am involved with all the time is to incorporate both memory (ARIMA) and deterministic structure (X's) (like days-of-the-week etc. ) for each hour. Please review Forecasting technique for daily data with monthly and day of week seasonality for some pointers on what factors (hidden layers) can be extracted that are statistically significant. I have posted and you can search for "user:3382 daily data" to obtain other words and examples . If you wish to actually post daily data for two of your customers i will try to take the time to present you with examples of "useful models" Another thought is to actually compute out-of-sample error measures (MAPE for example) and use that metric to summarize a customer.
