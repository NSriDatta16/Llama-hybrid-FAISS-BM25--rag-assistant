c++ or java for robotics

I know embedded C is used for micro-controllers along with other languages. but what if the control was from a PC, well I had two possible candidates (java and c++) Java is simple and easy also Developer friendly when it comes to threading or GUI, but of course C++ is so much better performance (I know computers getting faster, and performance depend on good Algorithms ) but the compilation makefiles, shared-library and cross compiling wastes lots of time caring about technicalities when I should be working on other Important issues. But still I've faced something like Const references which java doesn't support and force you to use clone() or copying and when that came to arrays it was a giant mess, NOTE: I'm going to use reverse kinematics and maybe Neural network for pattern recognition. which requires tons of Calculations. but as I said I care also about the whole life cycle of the project (speed of development, performance , user friendliness and quick deployment) I'm swinging between languages and i'm planning for long term learning process so I don't want to waste that in the wrong language or let's say (without asking) so please help and I hope this question won't be considered subjective but a reference. cheers
