Sort NSFetchRequest by a predicate

I have a SQLite-backed core data storage and would like to fetch a list of managed objects using NSFetchRequest . I want said list to be sorted by a boolean value that can be easily calculated at the database level. I know this because it’s possible to formulate the same conditions using an NSPredicate , which would look as follows: [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"uid = %@", currentUID] Sadly, there seems to be no way to formulate a condition like this using an NSSortDescriptor . How do I best go about this? Do I fetch two lists, one with [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"uid = %@", currentUID] and one with [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"uid != %@", currentUID] and combine them later on? Can I then still elegantly use a NSFetchedResultsController ? Or should I fetch all items and sort them later in code? Or is there anything I’ve missed.
