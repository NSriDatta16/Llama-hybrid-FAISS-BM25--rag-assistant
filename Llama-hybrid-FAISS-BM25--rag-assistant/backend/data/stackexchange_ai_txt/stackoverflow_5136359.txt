You should be using drop database not deleting the files. There may be metadata stored elsewhere. I'd prefer to stay away from commands and rather know exactly where these tables were stored so that I could find them and delete them. This is naive way of thinking. Use the public interface (SQL) not the filesystem. What will you do if the storage mechnism changes? There are many storage engines in mysql and they all don't work the same way.
