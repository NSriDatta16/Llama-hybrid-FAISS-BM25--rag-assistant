Yes, hard-to-say, quite a bit, perhaps you should use a database The conventional wisdom is "use a database" , but using the filesystem is a reasonable plan for larger objects like images. Some filesystems have limits on the number of directory entries. Some filesystems do not have any sort of data structure for filename lookups, but just do a linear scan of the directory. Optimizations like you are discussing are restricted to specific environmental profiles. Do you even know right now what future hardware your application will run on? Might it be a good idea to not stress the filesystem and make a nice, hierarchical directory structure? If you do that it will run well on any filesystem or storage server.
