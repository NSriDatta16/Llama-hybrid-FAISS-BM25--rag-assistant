If you're using carrier-wave 0.5.2, you have to look in the docs within the gem. They are different than what you see on github. Specifically, check out this file in the gem: lib/carrierwave/storage/s3.rb Also set store to :s3...not :fog. You'll see this section: # CarrierWave.configure do |config| # config.s3_access_key_id = "xxxxxx" # config.s3_secret_access_key = "xxxxxx" # config.s3_bucket = "my_bucket_name" # end #
