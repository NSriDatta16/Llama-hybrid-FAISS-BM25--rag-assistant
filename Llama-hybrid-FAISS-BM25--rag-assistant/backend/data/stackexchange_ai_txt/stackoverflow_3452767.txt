If you want to keep your current synchronous HTTP request then make these changes: -(IBAction)submit:(id)sender{ [myTitle resignFirstResponder]; [self performSelector:@selector(delayedSubmit:) withObject:sender afterDelay:0]; } -(void)delayedSubmit:(id)sender { ...some ASIHTTP setup... [request startSynchronous]; //return; } I commented out return; as it is not needed in methods that don't return anything like void and IBAction (which is really void but lets IB know to pay attention to it).
