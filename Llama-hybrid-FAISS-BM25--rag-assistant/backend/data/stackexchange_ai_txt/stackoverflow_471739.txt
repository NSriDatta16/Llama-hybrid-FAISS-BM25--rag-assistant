IDE You got IntelliJ. Believe me its the best. I used it for two years, then had to switch to some free thingy. I tried Eclipse, it was a pain, no offense just telling you my experience. Now, working with Netbeans, and I am quite happy, but still miss IntelliJ once in a day. TDD Yes, you are very much right about JUnit. After enough understanding, its good to look at other specialize libraries like HtmlUnit, DBUnit. Further, a code coverage tool like Cobertura, or Emma. As you must go with IntelliJ, you will probably like to check out Emma, as its having a good integration with the IDEA. Transition I don't think you will have a hard time in the transition. IMO, reading the docs and the specs will get you going. May be you can go for some books down the road, but as far as core Java is concern, reading API docs and specs will be a good start. You can make use of a SO to ask question. I have seen many questions like "C# equivalent in Java ..".
