Gaussian Kernel =?= linear combination of infinite number of Gaussian distributions?

From the literature we know a Gaussian Kernel/RBF has a corresponding Hilbert space with infinite number of dimensions. Now my question is, specially in the context of a Gaussian Process, can I consider a Gaussian kernel as a linear combination of infinite number of Gaussian distributions? I'm almost certain that's the case, but I can't find the right reference for it.
