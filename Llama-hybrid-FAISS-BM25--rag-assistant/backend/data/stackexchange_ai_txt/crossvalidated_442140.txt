Hi: The classical KF ( non-bayesian one ) update minimizes the mean square error of the estimate of the state WHEN both the observational noise and state noise are gaussian AND the transition equations ( F in the observation equation and the G in the state ) are linear. Now, under the same assumptions, the bayesian filter ends up being identical to the classical so it's optimal in the MSE sense also. But, if the noise terms aren't gaussian, then the bayesian framework will give you a posterior ( possibly, if it's tractable ) but what you want to do with that posterior as far as obtaining an estimate of the state is up to you because it depends on your optimality criteria. Maybe you want to minimize MSE or minimize absolute error or minimize something else. So, in the bayesian framework, you have a choice in terms of what you want to do with the posterior. I think the confusion in the bayesian case stems from the fact that, because the gaussian is conjugate, then, with the distributional assumptions imposed ( both noise terms gaussian ), if you want to minimize MSE, then you obtain the same update in the bayesian case as you do in the non-bayesian case. In the case, where you don't have linearity ( but still have gassian noises ), then you have to use the EKF and I would imagine that the optimality criteria must depend on how well the linearization approximates the non-linearity ? I'm not familiar enough with EKF to say anything useful about that case. Still, I hope that helps. I only glanced but below looks like a decent explanation. https://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/talks/filtering.pdf
