Why Cross-Validation score is less than the Test Score?

I have a data set 1035 x 16, implemented random forest regressor algorithm after all the possible feature processing techniques, test/ train split is 20/80, for cross validation I used 5 K-Folds and following are the results: Test Score : 72.82762577833321 Training Score: 97.38484784016136 Validation score : [0.63171505, 0.64145713, 0.67557705, 0.66368883, 0.6085836 ] Validation score avg : 64.42043307160208 I know model is over-fitting but how I can interpret, the Cross Validation score is less than Test score . when the Cross Validation score is less than Test score ? when the Cross Validation score is greater than Test score ? which is better ?
