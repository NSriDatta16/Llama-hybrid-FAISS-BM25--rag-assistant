I don't know why but creating the bucket with the option "Place this bucket in Europe" is causing this error, it seems. When I create a new bucket without that option it works fine now. I am using S3 Firefox Organiser plugin/addon to add the buckets, by the way. Hope this helps with people with same issue too. Cheers.
