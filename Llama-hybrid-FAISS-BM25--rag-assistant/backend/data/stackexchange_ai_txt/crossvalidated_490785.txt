Drop unused parameters from model?

I have trained a model using caret's train function in R (LASSO logistic regression with glmnet, repeatedcv). The goal is both feature selection and getting the model. With the preferred lambda, LASSO penalized many variables to zero, as expected. I then tried to use the model to predict outcomes with the predict function, that data only includes variables that were not penalized to 0 in the model training. Surprisingly, the predict function returns an error and expects all variables, including those that were non-predictive in feature selection. How can I completely drop these variables from the model to use it for predictions? Am I missing an obvious point here?
