How Do You Create A Panel in WPF that Can Be Dragged Outside the Main Window?

Trying to replicate the docking controls in Visual Studio 2008. My application replays the RADAR environment for the FAA and I want the ability for dual monitor users to drag the control panels to the other monotor to leave the main canvas clear. This functionality is similar to the way the different panels in VS can be dragged outside of the main window. Thanks, Dave
