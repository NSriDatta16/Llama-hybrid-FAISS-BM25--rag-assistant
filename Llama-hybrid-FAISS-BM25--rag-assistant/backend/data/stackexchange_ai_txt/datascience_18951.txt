What I found - sharing notebooks for data scientists is a not a desirable format for communication. Many of them prefer IDE like Spider/RStudio or just a text editors (I know a few data scientists who use vi ). You might just share code by your source control and data by cloud storages. It will increase flexibility. I've recently open sourced a tool which combines code, data, and the dependencies between data and code to a single environment and makes your data science project reproducible: DVC or dataversioncontrol.com (there is a tutorial). With DVC tool you can just share your project by Git, sync data to S3 by a single DVC command. If some of your data scientists decide to change the code at any stage of your project then the final result could be easily reproduced by a single command dvc repro data/target_metrics.txt .
