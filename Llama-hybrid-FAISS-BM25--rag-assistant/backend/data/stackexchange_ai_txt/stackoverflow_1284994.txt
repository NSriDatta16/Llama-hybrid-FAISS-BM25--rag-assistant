IIS7 & X.509 certificates: connecting from asp.net to a web service - where to store certs?

I have to make a connection to an XMLRPC site from a web application, which uses an X.509 certificate for authentication. Here on my development machine (Vista), I have the keys installed under my User and it's in my Personal certificates storage; if I run my code, it works well (loading the key from a file): X509Certificate clientcert = new X509Certificate(this.certFile, this.password); request.ClientCertificates.Add(clientcert); But I need to install this application on a Windows 2008 Web Server, and I failed to find out how to make it to use this certificate file. I thought I need to import all corresponding "parent" keys, so I did. I tried importing all of them to the Trusted Root certificates store, but no luck: it still says it's not OK. Should I use an impersonated account, and have it all the certificates? Should IIS7 be configured anyhow to work with this user/cert store?
