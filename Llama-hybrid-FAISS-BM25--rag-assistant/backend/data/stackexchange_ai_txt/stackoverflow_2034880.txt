The file input button is extremely difficult to style and manipulate, mainly for security reasons. If you really need to customize your upload button, I recommend a Flash based uploader like SWFUpload or Uploadify that enables you to use a custom image as button, display a progress bar, and other things. However, its basic philosophy differs from just embedding a control into a form. The uploading process takes place separately. Make sure you check out first whether this works for you.
