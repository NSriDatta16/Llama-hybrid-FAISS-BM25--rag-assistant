I will assume you are using winforms and will walk you through a simple example: In Solution Explorer, Right Click your project and select Add | New Item... Select the type About Box and you will see a new AboutBox1.cs get generated. Select View | Toolbox to get the Toolbox to appear. On your main form, drag a Button from the ToolBox | Common Controls onto the form. Double click the newly created button to create the Clicked Event. the clicked event type the following code: AboutBox1 aboutBox = new AboutBox1(); aboutBox.ShowDialog(); This code will declare a variable aboutBox of type AboutBox1 and then instantiate it ( construct it ). Then you call the ShowDialog() method to get it to appear.
