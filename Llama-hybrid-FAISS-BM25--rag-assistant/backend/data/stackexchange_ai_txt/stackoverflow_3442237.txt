Nokogiri html parsing question

I'm having trouble figuring out why I can't get keywords to parse properly through nokogiri. In the following example, I have the a href link text functionality working properly but cannot figure out how to pull the keywords. This is the code I have thus far: ..... doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open("http://www.cnn.com")) doc.xpath('//a/@href').each do |node| #doc.xpath("//meta[@name='Keywords']").each do |node| puts node.text .... This successfully renders all of the a href text in the page, but when I try to use it for keywords it doesn't show anything. I've tried several variations of this with no luck. I assume that the the ".text" callout after node is wrong, but I'm not sure. My apologies for how rough this code is, I'm doing my best to learn here.
