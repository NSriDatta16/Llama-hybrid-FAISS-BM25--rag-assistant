Difference-in-Sargan test in R

How can I calculate the Difference-in-Sargan statistic (or C-statistic) in R? In Stata, I would do something like this to get this statistic for pred2 (and see if it is exogenous, assuming that all instruments inst1-3 are exogenous): ivreg2 y (pred1 = inst1 inst2 inst3) pred2, orthog(pred2) What would the corresponding code in R be (ideally using the "ivreg" package in R)?
