Jquery Draggable UI overrides normal browser behavior for HTML elements inside draggable-enabled div

I have a jquery ui draggable div, and the HTML contents do not behave normally because of the draggable. This text is not selectable. When I try to select it, the popup div is dragged. Lots of text here, vertical scrollbar appears. But clicking the scrollbars don't work (doesn't scroll the content). Each click (mousedown-mouseup) is considered "dragging". How do I prevent the draggable ui to override the normal browser behavior for HTML elements?
