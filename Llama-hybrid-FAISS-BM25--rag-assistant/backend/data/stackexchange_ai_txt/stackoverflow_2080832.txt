It's not an elegant solution, but you can do this over straight http, by not setting the content-length field on the http response, and never closing the output stream. Just keep sending data. You could also set a very large content-length and send data back from the server in real time until the server has sent that amount, then the client can choose to make a new request or not. Unfortunately i couldn't find any useful links for these ideas, but i trust you get the ideas. The real plus side of these ideas is that they're over http, which gets by the firewall issue, and you can implement your app as a webapp with a servlet. Just my 2 cents ;)
