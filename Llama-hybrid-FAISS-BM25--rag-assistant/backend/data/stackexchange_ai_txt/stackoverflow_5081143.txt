Reader Writer Lock supporting low priority writers

I am trying to find (or implement) a Reader/Writer Lock which supports low-priority writers, but have been unsuccessful in researching any existing solutions. What I mean by low-priority writer is: "will yield its place in line" to incoming readers or normal writers. Certainly will lead to starvation if there is a constant stream of readers, but this could be solved either with a timed lock variant ("try timed low priority writer lock" and then switching to a normal lock on timeout) or by changing the way readers are issued (perhaps periodically halting reads for a short window). If there is any literature describing something along these lines, I have not found it. If there is a known (correct!) solution leveraging regular locks, I would would appreciate a description.
