First, I'm heavily using sphinx for one of my project but I'm not using ThinkingSphinx since the config file we use is quite complex, I'm using a customized act_as_sphinx plugin. To answer your question from pure sphinx point of view : there is an a BuildExcerpts api in sphinx to get excerpt of a content with matching underlined see http://www.sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html#api-func-buildexcerpts . Thinking Sphinx should provide this functionnality to match botulism as botulinum you should compile sphinx with stemmer, maybe the porter algorithm may answer your question : see http://www.sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html#conf-morphology Hope this helps and I highly encourage you to look at the sphinx documentation to fully use this very efficient indexer Manfred
