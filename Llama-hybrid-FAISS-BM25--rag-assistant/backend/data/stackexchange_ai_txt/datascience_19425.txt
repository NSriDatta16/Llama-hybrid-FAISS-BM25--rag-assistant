Neural Networks for time series

I have an understanding problem. I am a beginner in machine learning and have also a little experience in modelling NNs but not for time series. But I cannot imagine how to use Neiural Networks for time series. So if I want to train a Multilayer NN what is the input? I read several papers about such ANN to predict time series. But they did not explain how actually. Can I imagine it as follows: Is every input node a specific time stamp? If I want to predict the value for time t+1, and I use 15 input neurons, so I use the values at each time stamp from t-15 upt to t? How do I train such a NN? I am a little confused.
