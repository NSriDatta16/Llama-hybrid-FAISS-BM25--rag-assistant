Possible reason for failing to build a support vector machine

I was trying to build a classifier for a set of documents using a support vector machine. I choose to build the feature space using term occurrence. While experimenting, I found the following scenario: When removing stop words, the svm-based classifier was successfully built; otherwise, when keeping stop words, the SVM just could not be built and I got an error message “no support vector can be found”. I am very confused about this scenario. What might be the possible reason for this scenario?
