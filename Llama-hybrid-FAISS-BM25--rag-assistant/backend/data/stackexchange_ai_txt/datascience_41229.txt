How can I get the original pixels that lead to the decision in CNN?

I work on medical images and I want to locate the most relevant regions of the image based on deep learning spatially CNN. So I feed my data into VGG16 architecture and get the features maps. Now I want to figure how can I go back from the feature maps in the original image to recover the positions of areas? How can it be done? Most of what I found is related to a detection object, like RCNN, but that is not what I'm searching for. I need to recover all the areas that CNN pay attention to, not only that depends on one class.
