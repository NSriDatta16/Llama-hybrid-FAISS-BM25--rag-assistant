learning Curve Sklearn

Why learning curve of scikit-learn (example here) is different from the one which was taught by andrew NG in his machine learning course at Coursera as per Andrew NG, Training Error should start from zero & increases with training size as it generalizes the Data. The Validation error decreases with training size. But as per scikit-learn it gives us opposite plot i.e., training error decreases and validation error increases. Please Explain?
