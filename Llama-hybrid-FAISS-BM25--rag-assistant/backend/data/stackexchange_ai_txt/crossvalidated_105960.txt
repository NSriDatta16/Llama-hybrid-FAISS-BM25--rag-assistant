What you suggest -- now -- is an absolute baseline date. You could also use a base date that repeats on a regular basis. For example, if you're looking at US shopping patterns, the number of days before Christmas would be useful. Or if you were looking at international soccer, perhaps the number of days before or after the World Cup. You could also use a base date that is based on a particular event in each time series. For example, a person's age (number of days since birth), or the number of years a person has had a driver's license, or how long since they were diagnosed with a particular illness (or started treatment). This kind of date handling allows you to line up the various time series in a more meaningful way. The important thing is not turning a date into a computable object but turning it into a meaningful measurement -- that is a feature.
