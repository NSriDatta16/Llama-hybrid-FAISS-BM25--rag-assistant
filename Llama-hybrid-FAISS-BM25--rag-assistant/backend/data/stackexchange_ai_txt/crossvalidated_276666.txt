Any implementation of the options framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning?

Does anyone know of an existing implementation of the options framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning as described in Sutton, Precup, & Singh (1999) Between MDPs and semi-MDPs: A framework for temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning. Artificial Intelligence 112 : 181â€“211 ? The ideal implementation would be in Python, although anything would be useful.
