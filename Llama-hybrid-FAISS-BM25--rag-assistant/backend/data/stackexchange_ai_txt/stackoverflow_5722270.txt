Pay attention to and test performance under load . Oracle does some things fundamentally differently than other database vendors. Tom Kyte's excellent book Expert Oracle Database Architecture points out several differences. A couple of highlights: Oracle never locks data just to read it. Many other databases do. A writer of data in Oracle never blocks a reader. A reader of data never blocks a writer. Again, many other vendors do. Not paying attention to things like this can cause big headaches after a conversion when locking issues surface. This is not to imply a superiority of one product over another, rather it just means that what works well with one vendor's product may fail miserably in another, and custom approaches depending on the database may be required.
