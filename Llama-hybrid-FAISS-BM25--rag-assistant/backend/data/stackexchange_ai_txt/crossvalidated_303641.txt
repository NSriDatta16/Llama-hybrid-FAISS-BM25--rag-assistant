This can happen rather easily. Just fit a model that fits lines for each of two or more groups. In any group where there are just two points, both points will have leverage 1.0: dat Output is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.7 0.3 0.3 0.7 1.0 1.0 Either of points 5 or 6 totally determines its own predicted value, which is the same as its observed value. It is not so very strange! Incidentally, the numbers that are given when noting points with leverage 1.0 are row numbers, not the row labels that by default are used to identify the most extreme points in diagnostic plots. (If a data frame where the row labels are row numbers is subsetted, the existing row labels are transferred across, and in general are no longer the row numbers in the subsetted dataset.)
