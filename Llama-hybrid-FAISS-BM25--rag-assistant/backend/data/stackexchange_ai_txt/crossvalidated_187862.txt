Testing two logistic regression models with same coefficients on different time samples

I run the two logistic regressions on different time windows (let say 1/2015 and 3/2015) and get two sets of parameters estimates. They differ a little. Is it possible to use any statistical test to find out whether the difference between every respective two parameters (from the first model and the second model) is significant?
