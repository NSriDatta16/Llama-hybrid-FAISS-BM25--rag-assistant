There are several methods to use in Android to storage data. Store data in internal memory (files in internal memory). Store data in external memory (files in the sdcard). Store data as preferences (SharedPreferences). Store data in a SQLLite database. In my case, I use one method or another depending on the type of data. I only use SharedPreferences for application settings although that is only my rule. To save information in a SQLLite database you only have to insert records, like using any other database. This records will keep saved after your application finish. You can find more information here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html
