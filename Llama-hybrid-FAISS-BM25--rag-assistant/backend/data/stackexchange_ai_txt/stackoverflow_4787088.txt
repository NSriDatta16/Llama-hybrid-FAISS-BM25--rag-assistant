I have similar problem. Eventually I found a work-around that "works for me", although it may not be the most elegant way to solve this issue. Within my function, before 'Sweave' is executed, I put a statement to globally store the local environment: temp Using your code example it would look something like: testFoo Then in the LaTeX file to be 'Sweaved' in the beginning of the first chunk I restore the necessary variables, but you can also use 'temp$foo' to access the 'foo' variable that was created within the function. This way I avoid globally storing multiple variables. % \documentclass[a4paper]{article} \usepackage[OT1]{fontenc} \usepackage{Sweave} \begin{document} \title{Test Sweave Document} \author{Paul Hurley} \maketitle >= if(exists("foo", envir=temp)) { print(temp$foo) } ls() Sys.time() @ \end{document} Like I wrote above - this works, but is not very elegant.
