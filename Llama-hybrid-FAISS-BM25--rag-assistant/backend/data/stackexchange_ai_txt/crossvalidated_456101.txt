Design Bayesian Decision Rule

A person randomly chooses a coin with probability 0.5: Find which coin he chose according to the outcome of 3 tosses: Tossing coin 1 yields a head with a probability P(X1 = H) = .3 (and tail with P(X1 = T) = .7). Tossing coin 2 yields a head with a probability P(X2 = H) = .6 (and tail with P(X2 = T) = .4). You earn $1 if you correctly guessed the coin and $ 0 otherwise. Design the optimum decision rule and estimate your average earning. Hello folks, I have this problem in hand and I want to understand the following : Are P(X1)=P(X2)=0.5? P(H|X1)=0.3 , P(H|X2)=0.7? How does the Decision Table look like in this problem? How to find the average earning?
