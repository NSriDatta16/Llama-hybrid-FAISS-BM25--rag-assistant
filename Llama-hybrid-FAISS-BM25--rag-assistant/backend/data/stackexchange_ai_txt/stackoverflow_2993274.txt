Why not just use a CLOB column instead? I read your other link, and I don't understand why your DBA's don't like these types of columns. I mean, CLOB is an important feature of Oracle just for this exact purpose. And your company paid good money for that feature when buying Oracle, so why not leverage Oracle to it's fullest capabilities instead of trying to come up with hacks to do something that the DB is not really designed to do? Maybe instead of spending time trying to devise hacks to overcome limitations created by your DBAs, you should spend some time educating your DBA's on why CLOB s are the right feature to solve your problem. I would never be satisfied with a bad design when the DB has the feature I need to make a good design. If the DBA's are the problem, then they need to change their viewpoint or you should go to senior level management in my opinion.
