It is possible to run MSTests without installing Visual Studio. See how-do-i-use-mstest-without-visual-studio . I did this so that I could run my tests as part of my CI process. (I am using CC.NET for my CI solution). I am in a similar situation as you, in that I want to use TestDriven.NET to get code coverage stats. But, I am running into problems. My first problem is that I am using AssemblyInitialize attributes to initialize a database connection. This isn't supported by NUnit so about half of my tests fail whereas they run fine under MSTest. So, it seems that translating tests from one test framework to another has pitfalls. If you are aware of that, then go forth, but it might be better to try and keep consistent on one test framework.
