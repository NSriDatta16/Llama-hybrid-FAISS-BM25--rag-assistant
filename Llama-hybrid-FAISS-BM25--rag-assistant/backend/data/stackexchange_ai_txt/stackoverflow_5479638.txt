On iOS devices you have various options for storing data. Here are a few you might consider: Core Data and either a SQL data repository or an XML repository. This is basically Apple's device database framework library available for all apps to use. It is not the easiest of options but it will allow you to store fairly large amounts of diverse data that will be available throughout your app code. In addition, the data is retained between app launches as long as you save it to the persistent data store before app shut down. Property lists. Property lists are more lightweight than Core Data and you might find them easier to use. They allow storage and retrieval of basic key-value pairs into a persistent property list file. So, you also get the advantage of data retention between app launches as long as you store your data to the property list file before app shut down. Store data to text files. I'm not sure if this has any advantage over property lists. User Defaults. I'm not sure that you can so easily add new types of data during app usage. This is used more for providing a collection of default app settings and then allowing the user to personalize them during app usage. In-memory singleton objects. This could be an option but, of course, once the app shuts down, all data goes away unless it's persisted into permanent data storage somehow. I'm sure there are other options in addition to these. I will be interested to read about them. I hope this helps.
