How should I test for multivariate ARCH effects in R?

I want to test for conditional heteroskedasticity in the form of ARCH effects in a multivariate time series. In the univariate setting, an ARCH-LM test can be used. A natural extension for the multivariate setting would be a multivariate ARCH-LM test. Question: Is there a multivariate ARCH-LM test in R? (Except for arch.test in package "vars" that requires an estimated VAR object of class varest as an input.)
