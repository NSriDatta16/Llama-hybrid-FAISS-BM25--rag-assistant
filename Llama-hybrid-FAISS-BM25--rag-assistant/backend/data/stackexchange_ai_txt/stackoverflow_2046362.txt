So recently I wanted to check my friends to see if any of them had their birthday for the current day. Using FQL this is super easy and I encourage you to explore FQL more because it will yield a more efficient solution than, say, what Pierre kindly offered. Here is a small snippet of the code: $friends = $facebook->api_client->friends_get(); $uids = ""; foreach($friends as $f) { $uids .= "uid=$f OR "; } $query_uids = substr($uids,0,strlen($query_uids)-4); date_default_timezone_set('UTC'); $current_date = date("m/d"); echo " Searching for birthdays for the given month/day: $current_date "; $data = $facebook->api_client->fql_query( "SELECT name, uid FROM user WHERE ( ($query_uids) AND strpos(birthday_date,'$current_date') >= 0 )" ); if(count($data) > 0) { foreach($data as $d) { print_r($d); } } else { echo " No Birthdays Today "; }
