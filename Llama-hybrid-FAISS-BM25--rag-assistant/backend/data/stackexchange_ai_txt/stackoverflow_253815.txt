If you practice "tell, don't ask" then an exception is just the way a program says "I can't do that". It is "exceptional" in that you say "do X" and it cannot do X. A simple error-handling situation. In some languages it is quite common to work this way, in Java and C++ people have other opinions because exceptions become quite costly. General: exception just means "I can't" Pragmatic: ... if you can afford to work that way in your language. Citizenship: ... and your team allows it.
