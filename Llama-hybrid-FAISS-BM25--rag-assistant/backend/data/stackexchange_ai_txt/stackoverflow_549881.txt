I've been down this road a few times with custom controls and I've come to one truth Custom Controls must render without crashing if necessary properties are not set. There are just far too many cases where you will get into this situation. The primary example is the WinForm designer. As soon as you drag your control onto a host, WinForms will create an instance of it and render it in the VS process. By default it will pass no variables to the constructor and hence the initial render will happen without any of your properties set. You'll save a lot of time if you have your control render in some lesser state when the property is not set. This is how many of the standard controls work. Usually I have the control render a message to the effect of "Lacking Property X" or simply display nothing.
