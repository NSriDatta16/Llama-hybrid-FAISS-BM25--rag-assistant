pad out with zeros 2^n is a requirement of the FFT algorithm. Maybe a test of a known time series (e.g., simple sine or cosine of a single frequency). When you FFT that, you should get a single frequency (Dirac delta function). Anything else is an error. Do it with an integer power of two, padded with zeroes, etc.
