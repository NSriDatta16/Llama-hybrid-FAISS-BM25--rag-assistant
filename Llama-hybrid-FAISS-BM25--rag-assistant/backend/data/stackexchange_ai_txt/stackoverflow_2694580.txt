IMHO Not a good idea. Apart from the 2 cons that you mentioned, how about the vast amount of effort required to build an acceptance test framework that will deal all kinds of web/UI/glue scenarios that you might have? Your point "Simplicity (no additional frameworks required)" is incorrect as your organization would have to invest on building a more elaborate framework on top of JUnit. It may be more than JUnit.
