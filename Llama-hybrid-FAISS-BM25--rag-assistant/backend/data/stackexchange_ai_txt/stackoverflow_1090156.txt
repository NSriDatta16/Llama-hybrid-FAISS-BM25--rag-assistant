John points out a crucial first step. Nothing good can happen until your code base is internally stable. But even after you split your app into reusable components with well-defined interfaces, you will likely still have to maintain multiple versions ("forks") of many/all those components and develop their releases in parallel. That's where branching comes in. I highly recommend reading the new TFS Branching Guidance papers cover-to-cover. I was quite critical of earlier revisions, but the documentation team has really improved their offering here. (thanks in part to additional feedback as TFS finds broader adoption...but in equal part to finally paying attention to established SDLC norms that far predate Microsoft's entry to the marketplace)
