You need to include all competitions for a simple reason: you'll not have enough data if you do not. (Keep in mind that ML models generelly need large datasets while you only have a couple of matches for a given team in a given year in a given competition if it is not the national league) In their paper Learning to predict soccer results from relational data with gradient boosted trees the authors found that even when predicting national football leagues (that is, there's no overlap in terms of teams across leagues) it worked better to train their models on the whole dataset instead of training a model per league. Even though this is task and dataset specific, it showcases that in your case restricting the model to a single competition is likely to perform worse. However, it is then important to include information on the competitions in the dataset because teams might perform differently depending on the type of competition. The trivial approach being to simply include a feature indicating the type of competition but I recommend to provide your model with better engineered features. For example, you could use competition specific win rates per team, average goals scored per competition or manually assigned importance ratings of each competition. This goes back to the analysis of match importance which has been discussed in football match prediction across different papers. In the paper I linked above you'll find more details on it and different approaches to tackle it. (See section 4.5) Model-wise the best performance I've seen across a range papers was usually with gradient boosted trees or, in some cases, neural nets. Therefore, I'd suggest to start with boosting (for example use XGBoost) since it's more robust, easier to tune and off-the-shelf solutions are more easily available than in the case of neural nets. Keep in mind to benchmark your model against a range of baseline models incl. predicting the home team as a winner and predictions based on odds (the latter will be very hard to beat).
