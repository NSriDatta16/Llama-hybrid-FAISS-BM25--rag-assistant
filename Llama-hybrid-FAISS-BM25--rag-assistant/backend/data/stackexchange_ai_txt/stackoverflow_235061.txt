Readability is the FIRST target. In the 1970's the army tested some of the then "new" techniques of software development (top down design, structured programming, chief programmer teams, to name a few) to determine which of these made a statistically significant difference. THe ONLY technique that made a statistically significant difference in development was... ADDING BLANK LINES to program code. The improvement in readability in those pre-structured, pre-object oriented code was the only technique in these studies that improved productivity. ============== Optimization should only be addressed when the entire project is unit tested and ready for instrumentation. You never know WHERE you need to optimize the code. In their landmark books Kernigan and Plauger in the late 1970's SOFTWARE TOOLS (1976) and SOFTWARE TOOLS IN PASCAL (1981) showed ways to create structured programs using top down design. They created text processing programs: editors, search tools, code pre-processors. When the completed text formating function was INSTRUMENTED they discovered that most of the processing time was spent in three routines that performed text input and output ( In the original book, the i-o functions took 89% of the time. In the pascal book, these functions consumed 55%!) They were able to optimize these THREE routines and produced the results of increased performance with reasonable, manageable development time and cost.
