Quasi Experiment with Diff-in-diff but very uneven # of treatment and control sample

Let's say my app has 1M users and I launched a new feature in the app. As a result of this launch 10K users (1%) adopted this new feature. I want to understand the impact of this new feature on average session time. My question is how we can deal with the unbalanced treatment vs. control here since the ratio is 1:99. Can I first do a 1:99 propensity score matching and then DID? What if the ratio is more extreme like 1:999?
