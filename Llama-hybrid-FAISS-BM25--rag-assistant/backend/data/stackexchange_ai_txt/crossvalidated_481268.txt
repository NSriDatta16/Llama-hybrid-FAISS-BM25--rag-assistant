What does i.i.d. mean for multivariate case?

When we say a random variable is i.i.d., it's often used to describe the dependency between the observations of that random variable, which I call the row dimension, indexed by time if it's a time series. What does i.i.d. mean when applied to multiple random variables at once? Does it mean that each separate r.v.'s observations are again i.i.d. observation-to-observation? or does it imply that all observations from r.v. 1 are i.i.d. from all the observations from r.v. 2, etc, etc? In other words, does the univariate definition of observation-to-observation change to one of distribution-to-distribution (individual distributions being independent from one another)?
