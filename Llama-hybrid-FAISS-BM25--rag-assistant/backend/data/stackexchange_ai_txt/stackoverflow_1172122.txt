SharePoint out of the box has a lot of great features you will not be able to duplicate as easily. For instance the Office integration. With SharePoint your client can share documents ( word, excel, etc ) and have them kept under revision control. You can easily setup individual portals for their clients where they can have discussions, share documents, communicate, etc. SharePoint is also a content management system. Your client can add/edit/remove content as they wish. With MOSS they get the benefit of publishing workflows as well as being able to roll back their changes/deletes. The publishing workflows could spawn an approval process for the changes. Built in SharePoint's workflow support is a one of the top benefits. You can create them with SharePoint Designer. SharePoint Designer is free from MS. InfoPath forms + workflows provides some obscene opportunities you will not develop as easily on your own. SharePoint Designer provides an avenue to develop more advanced solutions than the web interface as well as site branding ( look & feel ). Best thing is, if you create 1 solution, you can bundle it and deploy it. For instance if you setup 1 client portal, you can bundle it and "copy" it to new client portals. MOSS is a set of additional functionality that you pay for. It can be expensive. You have to leverage the cost of licensing against the cost for you to duplicate what is already available. Depending on what your client wants you might not even need Visual Studio. A lot of the work can be done by building solutions with whats already there, which is a lot.
