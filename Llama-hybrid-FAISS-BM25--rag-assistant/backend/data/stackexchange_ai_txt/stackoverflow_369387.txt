Sparsh is still in my bookmarks from the last time I was investigating multitouch java solutions. While not as straight forward as the typical mouse listener or click listener, it still provides a reasonable interface. You need your listening class to implement sparshui.client.Client , which requires the processEvent method definition. public void processEvent(int groupID, Event event) { if(event instanceof TouchEvent) { TouchEvent e = (TouchEvent)event; if(e.getState() == TouchState.BIRTH) { //do initial touch stuff } else if(e.getState() == TouchState.MOVE) { //do dragging stuff } } else if(event instanceof DragEvent) { DragEvent e = (DragEvent)event; //do DragEvent specific stuff } else if(event instanceof RotateEvent) { RotateEvent e = (RotateEvent)event; //do RotateEvent specific stuff } else if(event instanceof ZoomEvent) { ZoomEvent e = (ZoomEvent)event; //do ZoomEvent specific stuff } //several other gesture types.... } After that, you need to start up the gesture recognition server, passing in your component new ServerConnection("localhost", objectImplementingClientInterface); Looking at the code examples on the site should give you a pretty good idea of the framework.
