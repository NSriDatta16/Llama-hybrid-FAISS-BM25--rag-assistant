Since you are dealing with employees and divisions, I guessing that you are not bulk loading lots of rows of this data all the time. Based on that assumption, retrieval is what is important. Since there are several ways to store this data, you need to consider what types of queries you will need to retrieve this data. What types of searches, reports, or data loads will you have to implement. Based on that, you should look at each way to store the data and how the performance and ease of writing the needed queries will be. How can you add indexes, etc. The coolest way to store the data may end up being a major pain to query back the way you need to.
