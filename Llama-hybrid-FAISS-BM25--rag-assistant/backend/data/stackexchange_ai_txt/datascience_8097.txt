If I remember it correctly, classical theory says it is ideal, when the data are gaussians with an identity-covariance matrix. Then it behaves as the Bayesian( Gaussian ) Classifier which is optimal with respect to the 0 - 1 Loss-function. Which still doesn't say anything about the behaviour with a real dataset without infinite data like suggested before. The practical answer could be, to try it as a first guess. When it doesn't work apply PCA to your data ( to decorrelate your features ) and try it again. If it still doesn't work, try other stuff.
