How do you determine whether a time series is stationary with reasonable confidence?

There are many time series which are obviously not stationary (I mean, by definition), some of them are even determinstic, yet the unity root tests like ADF/PP test, etc., happily reject the existence of an unity root in these processes. So my question is what kind of methods you used to determine whether a process is a truly stationly stochastic process with reasonable confidence?
