It had to happen at some point! This site was set up as a reaction to the fact that people find all their information online these days, instead of reading books. And now fnush is asking for some new way of getting information, where it's organised into a kind of easy-to-digest, ordered sequence so a beginner can start at the beginning and grow their knowledge of the subject without having to know what to search for next. Maybe books are going to make a comeback after all! :)
