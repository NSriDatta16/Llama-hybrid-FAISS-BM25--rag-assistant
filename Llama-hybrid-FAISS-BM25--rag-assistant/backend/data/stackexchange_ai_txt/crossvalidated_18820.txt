I have done a lot of work with hourly data and have concluded that a two prong approach seems to deliver useful models. First of all we model the daily totals taking into account any day-of-the-week effects , any fixed-day of the month effects that can be identified along with any holiday effects. Each holiday can have it's own lead, contemporaneous and lag structure and there may be accompanying Friday before a Monday Holiday or Monday after a Friday Holiday effect. This model may also include local time trends , level shifts and of course one-time only events (pulses) and a possible need for either or both variance changes or parameter changes over time. Now with this model in place we can make daily forecasts for the future periods. The second step is to to construct 24 individual hourly models reflecting the incorporation of the daily total series. The reason for the 24 separate hourly models is the fact that consumption patterns during the day (intra) are often quite different across(inter) days. Each of the hourly models could have ARIMA structure reflecting historical usage for that hour and of course Level Shifts , Local Trends and Pulse effects. Individual hourly demand may or may not reflect daily total demand thus one needs to pay attention to that possibility. Since forecasts exist for the daily totals this can then be used to predict the hourly values.
