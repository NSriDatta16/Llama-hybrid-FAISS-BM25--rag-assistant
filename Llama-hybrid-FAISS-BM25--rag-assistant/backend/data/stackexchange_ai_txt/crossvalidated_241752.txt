recurrent neural networks for sentence similarity

I have two sentences and I want to use RNNs to check whether the second sentence expresses a positive or a negative sentiment towards the first sentence. The two sentences can have different length. What type of RNN should I use? one-to-many RNN architecture with the word vectors for the two sentences separated by a delimiter? (i.e. w1_s1 w2_s1 ... wn_s1 :: w1_s2 ... wm_s2). Is it possible to have a delimiter as input in RNNs ("::" in the example)? siamese RNNs with an RNN for each sentence? Given that I don't want to test the similarity between sentences, can siamese RNNs be used in my case? A different RNN architecture that I have not listed here?
