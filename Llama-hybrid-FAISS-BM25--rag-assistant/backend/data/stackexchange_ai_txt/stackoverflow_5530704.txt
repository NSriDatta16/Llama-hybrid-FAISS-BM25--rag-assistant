What you want to do is called clustering. If the data you've shown is typical, a gready approach, such as neighbor joining , should be sufficient. So the procedure is: 1) Apply neighbor joining 2) Apply an (empirically identified) threshold to define the clusters 3) Calculate average of each cluster Using a package that already has clustering algorithms, such as R, would probably be the easiest course, though neighbor joining is not a particularly hard algorithm.
