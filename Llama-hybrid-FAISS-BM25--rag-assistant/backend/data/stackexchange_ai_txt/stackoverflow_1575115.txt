MVC is more of a "best practices" package .. i have seen people writing the code app in controllers without any views .. so yeah everything goes with some. however what you are looking for is a way to divide your layers .. i wouldnt go the smarty route .. u will have to learn a whole new language .. i would encourage you to spend a little time learning any light weight MVC .. i really like Code Igniter .. i have used it a couple of times, gets you started pretty fast. there maybe several other options out there. For your specific case you can have a main template , which lets say has 2 includes ... one runs when $_SESSION[userID] is present and other runs when it isnt. Several ways to go about it .. that is just an idea. As others i would recommend , u spend a day and learn a basic MVC framework .. it would help in the long term.
