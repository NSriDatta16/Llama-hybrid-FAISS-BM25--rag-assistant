If your subjects are representative of the population and independent of each other then this is just the binomial test. You can get the information from you statement by just doing the tests with different inputs, here is an example using R: > binom.test(8,10, alt='g', p=0.7) Exact binomial test data: 8 and 10 number of successes = 8, number of trials = 10, p-value = 0.3828 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.7 95 percent confidence interval: 0.4930987 1.0000000 sample estimates: probability of success 0.8 So 8 out of 10 only gives a lower limit of 49% in the 95% confidence interval. However, you need to expand beyond just these simple statements. With 10 subjects you would need 10 out of 10 successes to say (with 95% confidence) that at least 70% can perform the task. But how likely are you to see 10 out of 10? that depends on the true proportion and you should really do a "what if" analysis with different "true" proportions to see how likely you are to see success. If you are that limited on how many tests you can do then you may want to look to see if there is any other information available as an estimate that could be used as a prior in a Bayesian analysis.
