Naive Bayesian Algorithm in R/SAS for categorical input variables?

Could anyone please let me know how to implement Naive Bayesian Algorithm in R or SAS?I have got a training dataset with all the categorical predictors and target variable(3 levels).I got to build a model and apply it on a different test dataset along with the probable target and its predicted probability. To be more clear,my first dataset 'A' contact 4 categorical input variables a,b,c,d and a target class 'T' of 3 levels.I need to train the model for this dataset initially.Then,I have got one more dataset 'B' with input categorical variables w,x,y,z and I need to predict the probable target class 'S' along with its probability here based on my previous built model.I want the entire thing to be done in R or SAS but couldn't find much resources.Sorry,if the question has been repeated.
