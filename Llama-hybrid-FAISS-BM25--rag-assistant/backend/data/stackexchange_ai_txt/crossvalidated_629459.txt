regression model for zero-inflated pseudo-continuous outcomes with negative values and practical solution in R?

I am looking high and low for how to model data where the outcome is pseudo-continuous (change in questionnaire scores) that can be negative and has a lot of "true" zeroes. I see talk about models for zero-inflated count data, i.e. positive integer outcomes like zero-inflated poisson/ZIP, zero-inflated negative binomial/ZINB, and hurdle models, but nothing for non-count outcomes with negative values. I would also be interested in practical solutions for frequentist and Bayesian modeling in R. Documentation for the R GAMLSS package for additive models refers to continuous distributions, but the link to the documentation on that is dead. Thanks in advance for any pointers, gj
