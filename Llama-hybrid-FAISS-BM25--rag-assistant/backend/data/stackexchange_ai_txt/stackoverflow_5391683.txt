This happened to me as well. I have multiple XAPs loaded in one page and IE (sometimes Safari) just don't do anything. Nothing gets loaded. By using the Javascript API, it waits till the document is ready before embedding the tags. This way IE can take its time processing JS, CSS, HTML, MetaTags, etc, and then silverlight loads when everything is processed.
