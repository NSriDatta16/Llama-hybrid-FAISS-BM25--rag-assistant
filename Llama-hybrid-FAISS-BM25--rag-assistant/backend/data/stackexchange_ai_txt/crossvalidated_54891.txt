If the time series is indeed stationary, you may take the sample variance. However, since your time series is auto-correlated, you may be more interested in the variance of the residuals. Stationary means that the joint distribution of the time series is unaffected by time shifts. Thus, you can define a meaningful marginal distribution for a single point. However, since your time series is auto-correlated, the conditional distribution of a particular value given the preceding values may be quite different from that marginal distribution. The difference between the expected mean at time t, given the time series prior to t, and the actual value is called the innovation. Measuring the variance of the innovation will give you a better idea of how "noisy" the process is. For instance, suppose your time series is given by $X_t = 0.999 X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$, with $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. The variance of $X$ would be $1000$, but, depending on what you're looking at, the variance of $\epsilon$: $1$, might be a better metric.
