This can probably not be answered based entirely on theory. It will depend on your time series, the length of history, even your error measure. I would recommend that you fit both the bottom-up and the top-down procedure to your data with a holdout sample (say, the last three observations), forecast into the holdout sample and see which approach works best. That said, grouping 5000 items in a top-down approach looks dubious to me. The fastest moving items will completely dominate the slower ones. Perhaps you could introduce a more fine-grained hierarchy? SES (Single Exponential Smoothing) is certainly a good first candidate. You could also look at the other Exponential Smoothing methods. See, e.g., this free online textbook on forecasting .
