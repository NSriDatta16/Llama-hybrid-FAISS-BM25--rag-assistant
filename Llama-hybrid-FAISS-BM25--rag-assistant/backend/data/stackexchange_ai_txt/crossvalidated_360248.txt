STL decompose your historical time series. This will give you a Seasonal, a Trend and a Remainder component. Forecast the Seasonal component. By construction, this is a periodic series, so the only useful forecast is the Seasonal Naive one; that is, take the Seasonal component entry corresponding to the period you want to forecast. Forecast the Trend component. This is a series with a nonconstant trend. You will need to pick a method for forecasting it. A good choice is trended exponential smoothing . Model the Remainder component, by feeding it into your CART, along with any time-varying explanatory variables. Forecast the Remainder component from your CART model, by feeding in the future values of the explanatory variables. Add up the three forecasts.
