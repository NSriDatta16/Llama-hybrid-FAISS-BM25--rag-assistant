Machine Learning: Repetitive Pattern recognition regardless of amplitude and frequency

I am trying to scope out an approach to learn to identify repetitive human body activity based on collected motion data and would like some advice on some challenges I identified. I determined a set of data, the approach, and a set of potential challenges using cosine waveforms as an analogy before I start on the actual work. Data: Self generate the data by creating a long series of cosine waves of varying frequencies and amplitudes. Machine Learning approach: Sequence input with X dimensions LSTM with Y hidden units Z fully connected layer Softmax Classification Output with cross entropy Challenge: One particular challenge I will face is that the network is likely to only learn to classify cosine waveforms based on the frequencies and amplitudes that appears in the training set. How should I modify my approach to make it less sensitive to the frequency and amplitude and more on the signature cosine waveform that we see?
