Upcasting can be necessary when you have overloaded methods and do not want to call the specialized one, like aioobe wrote. (You could have assigned to a new variable of type A instead there.) Another example where an upcast was necessary involved the ?: operator, but I don't remember it now. And sometimes you need upcasts in the case of varargs-methods: public void doSomething(Object... bla) {} If we want to pass an Object[] array as a single parameter (not its objects as individual ones), we must write either doSomething((Object)array); or doSomething(new Object[]{array});
