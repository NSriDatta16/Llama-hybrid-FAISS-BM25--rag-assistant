Testing if certain points affect the time-series

I have a time series that describes the popularity of a product. I want to test if, when someone popular ( on social media ) publishes about the product ( positively or negatively ) it causes a "changepoint" in the time series ( high growth or severe drop ). in red, the timestamps where a popular influencer published the product. I'm trying to use a change point algorithm detection, and check the similarity between the indexes, get a certain % to validate my hypothesis. Am I on the right path? is there any other methods, libraries... Thanks in advance.
