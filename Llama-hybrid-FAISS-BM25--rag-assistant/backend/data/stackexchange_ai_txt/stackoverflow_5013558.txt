How do I handle recurring/subscription billing in a Rails App?

I can't use Chargify, Recurly, Spreedly or any of those apps because I am not based in the US. I am in Jamaica, actually...so many of these companies don't support Jamaica. But I am trying to roll a custom subscription management solution - but given that this is my first web app - I think it might be too big a task for me to take on. Are there any gems that can handle this? These are the requirements: All users registered automatically get on a free plan for X days Towards the end of X days, they should be prompted to upgrade If they don't upgrade, at the end of X days their account gets locked/disabled If their account is disabled, they can upgrade and be taken to a checkout page (powered by 2checkout, because that is who I have to use for now). Then once they upgrade, and have selected a plan, the system should automatically increase their allocations (# of clients, # of projects, storage space, etc.) So I don't need the system to actually handle the processing of the credit cards, etc. It's more the logic of the subscription, restrictions on the models, upgrading and downgrading that I need. The perfect solution would be a well supported Rails gem that I can include in my Gemfile. If you don't have that, just send any/all possible solutions and I can take it from there. Thanks.
