Why can't we calculate p(e|f) directly from corpus?

In SMT , a document is translated according to the probability distribution $p(e|f)$ that a string $e$ in the target language (for example, English) is the translation of a string $f$ in the source language (for example, French). According to the Baye's Theorem based modeling of the the probability distribution $p(e|f)$ , $$ p(e|f) \propto p(f|e) p(e) $$ where the translation model $p(f|e)$ is the probability that the source string is the translation of the target string, and the language model $p(e)$ is the probability of seeing that target language string. $$ $$ Finding the best translation $\tilde {e}$ is done by picking up the one that gives the highest probability: $\tilde{e} = arg \max_{e \in e^*} p(e|f) = arg \max_{e\in e^*}p(f|e) p(e)$ . ( $e^*$ denotes all the strings in the target language) Now, I have two questions. How is $p(f|e)$ calculated? If it is calculated from the parallel corpus, why can't we also calculate $p(e|f)$ directly from the corpus?
