Population mean and hypothesis testing

The national average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is 3.71 dollars. Linda would like to assess if the average gas price in her city is significantly higher than the national average. She samples gas prices at 20 local gas stations and records the price of a gallon of regular gasoline. Assume her sample of prices can be considered a random sample (representative of the larger population of all such prices). What additional condition is required to be able to perform the one-sample t-test? I know one condition is that the sample is random, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what the second should be. Should the distribution be normal? If so, can I just construct a Q-Q plot to test for this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
