iPhone detecting touches on a map image

I have a static map image with a bunch of circles and squares on it that depict cities. I have loaded the image into an imageView that is sub-classed under a scrollView so that I can capture user touches and zoom/scroll across the map. My challenge is that I want to pop-up a label whenever a user touches one of these circles/squares for a city to tell them which city it is and possibly load a detail view for the city. I figured I could pre-load all the relative CGPoints for the cities based on the imageView map into a dictionary so I can reference them during a "touchesBegan" event, but I'm quickly getting in over my head and possibly going about this the wrong way. So far everything is working and I can capture the CGPoint x and y coordinates of touches. The biggest issue I have is determining the proximity of the user touches to a discrete point I may have in the dictionary. In other words if the dictionary has "Boston = NSPoint: {235, 118};" how can I tell when a user is close to that point without making them repeat the touch until it is exact? Is there an easy way to determine if a user touch is "close" to a pre-existing point? Am I going about this the right way? Any advice or slaps in the back of the head are welcome. Thanks, Mike
