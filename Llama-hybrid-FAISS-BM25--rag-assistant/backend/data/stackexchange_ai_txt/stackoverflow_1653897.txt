If pickling was interrupted, will unpickling necessarily always fail? - Python

Suppose my attempt to write a pickle object out to disk is incomplete due to a crash. Will an attempt to unpickle the object always lead to an exception or is it possible that the fragment that was written out may be interpreted as valid pickle and the error go unnoticed?
