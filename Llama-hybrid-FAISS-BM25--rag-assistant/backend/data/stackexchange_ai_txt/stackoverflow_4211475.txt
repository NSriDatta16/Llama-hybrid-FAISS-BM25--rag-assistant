How to inherit shell's running ssh-agent with net::ss::perl::agent

Is there a way to use the already running ssh-agent in a bash session with net::ss::perl::agent ultimately so I don't have to setup keys again with net::ss::perl? I don't see any examples anywhere. I keep seeing a way to create a new agent but not a way to connect it to the shell? Thanks Edit: I should explain that I can't use Net::OpenSSH since i have to work with commercial SSH servers and the openssh client doesn't work properly with it(I've tested this).
