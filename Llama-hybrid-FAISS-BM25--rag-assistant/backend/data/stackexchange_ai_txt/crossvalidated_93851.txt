Also why data must be scaled? duo to some numerical issues? -s type : set type of solver (default 1) for multi-class classification 0 -- L2-regularized logistic regression (primal) 1 -- L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (dual) 2 -- L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (primal) 3 -- L2-regularized L1-loss support vector classification (dual) 4 -- support vector classification by Crammer and Singer 5 -- L1-regularized L2-loss support vector classification 6 -- L1-regularized logistic regression 7 -- L2-regularized logistic regression (dual)
