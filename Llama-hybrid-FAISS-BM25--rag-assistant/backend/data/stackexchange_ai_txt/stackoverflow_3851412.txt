How do I code a GUI Selection Box?

I want to build into my app a way to select multiple objects on the screen (this is an HTML page with a bunch of absolutely positioned HTML divs). You know, like when you click down with the mouse and drag a transparent/translucent box and anything within that box gets selected upon mouse release? I don't know how to go about coding that. How would you? Or pointers to solutions is acceptable as well.
