Lloyd's kmeans also minimizes the sum of squares (it does not minimize Euclidean distances). So no difference here. But the standard algorithm is pretty dumb. It recomputed all the distances in each iteration. Hartigan's also pays attention to a very important fact: of you add a point to a cluster, the mean will change. This will increase the distance of the other points to the mean. So reassigning a point from one cluster to another to slightly reduce the points distance can reduce the quality of all the other points in the cluster to the point where this was not a smart change to perform.
