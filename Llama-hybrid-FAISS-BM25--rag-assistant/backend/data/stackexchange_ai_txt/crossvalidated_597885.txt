Do the encoder and decoder architectures of VAE need to be exactly reverse of each other in terms of size of data at each layer?

For example if we have the encoder architecture as follows: (number of channels@ h_size x w_size) 1@28x28 | 32@14x14 | 64@7x7 | 128@4x4 | 256@2x2 | 512@1x1 Should the decoder architecture be such that we get the following: 512@1x1 | 256@2x2 | 128@4x4 | 64@7x7 | 32@14x14 | 1@28x28 Or, is it okay if it is like the following: 512@1x1 | 256@2x2 | 128@4x4 | 64@8x8 | 32@16x16 | 32@32x32 | 1@28x28 Will having layers as in the bold version cause any problem? Thanks!
