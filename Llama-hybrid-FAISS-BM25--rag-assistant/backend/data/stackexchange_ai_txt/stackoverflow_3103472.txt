How to mimic Picasa's rendering of reduced quality image to speed up drawing

I have an owner-drawn control where performance is an issue during quick repaints such as object drags, resizing and painting the selector square. i have noticed that several other apps, including Picasa , will temporarily draw a reduced-quality image during fast repaint scenarios and then update the image with a higher-quality version when the UI "settles down." How should I (can I?) produce a lower-quality image to paint when many quick redraws are taking place? Are there other strategies similar to this i can employ to increase performance (or fake increased performance.) Extra Info: This is a forms-designer-like application that makes heavy use of owner drawing. It works well but begins to bog down when more than three or four images need to be painted into rectangles in the client area. (End users are allowed to create different types of elements of which images take the heaviest toll on drawing.) I am using the DrawImageUnscaled GDI+ method to draw images which is supposed to be much more efficient than DrawImage but performance profiling shows that DrawImageUnscaled is still the bottleneck. I think my only recourse is to come up with clever ways to draw less. P.S. A previous question related to this issue earned me a Tumbleweed badge so i'm taking another approach: How to increase performance over GDI's DrawImage(Unscaled)?
