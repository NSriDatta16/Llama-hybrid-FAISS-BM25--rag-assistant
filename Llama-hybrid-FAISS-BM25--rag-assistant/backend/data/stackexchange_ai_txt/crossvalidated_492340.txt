An initial value is given to each sample before the first tree is fit. How those values are determined differs a bit by implementation: sklearn 's GBMs have an init parameter, which can be constant 0 or some other sklearn estimator. xgboost has the parameter base_score , defaulting to 0.5 (?) R 's gbm is based on C++ 's gbm , and has an initial value that depends on the loss function. See section 4 of the vignette . After that, the loss is set and the gradient makes sense and the first tree being built is no different from any other.
