Wikipedia says the MLE estimators for $\pi$ (your pstr0 ) and $\lambda$ are given by: $${\displaystyle {\hat {\pi }}_{ml}=1-{\frac {m}{{\hat {\lambda }}_{ml}}}}$$ and $${\displaystyle m(1-e^{-{\hat {\lambda }}_{ml}})={\hat {\lambda }}_{ml}\left(1-{\frac {n_{0}}{n}}\right)}$$ And the solution of that 2nd equation is: $${\displaystyle {\hat {\lambda }}_{ml}=W_{0}(-se^{-s})+s}$$ Where $m$ is the sample mean, $\frac{n_0}{n}$ is the observed proportion of zeros, $s$ is ${\displaystyle {\frac {m}{1-{\frac {n_{0}}{n}}}}}$ , and $W_0$ is Lambert's W-function. The question Overfitting of Zero-inflated Poisson has an example of R code that uses the pscl package to estimate these parameters.
