To add up to Armen Aghajanyan answer, I guess it is difficult to check if you get the global minimum unless you know theoretical properties of your clustering problem. As he suggested, you might be limited to compare the 10 solutions between each others. An empirical way to quantify the similarity between clusterings might be using the squared L2 distance indeed. If you have cluster labels you can also compute the similarity between clusterings by the consensus index . This is just an average similarity between all clustering pairs. For example you might want to use the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) in Matlab ( here or here ) as similarity measure between two clusterings $U$ and $V$. Then the consensus index (CI) between $n$ clusterings is defined as: $$ \mbox{CI} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i here for reference. If you use an adjusted similarity measure for clustering comparisons the CI is equal to 0 if there the clusterings are random and independent and is equal to 1 when they are identical.
