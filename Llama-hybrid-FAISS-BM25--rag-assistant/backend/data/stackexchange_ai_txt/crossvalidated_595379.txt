Its better to write your own likelihood and check. Due to couple of observations, 611.092749788117 and 3072.60557504056 the optimizer would really struggle. I would reparametrize with exp() of your parameters in likelihood and leverage unconstrained optimizer. I'm able to match your Python output. To answer your question: the discrepancies between R s fitdistrplus::fitdist and Python is due to data with extreme observations and parameterization/optimizer. ## Burr Density (shape = {c,k}, location = mu, scale = sigma) dBURR
