Embedding a font to HTML

I'm trying to embed the font "Andale Mono" to my html pages, I have the font in the following extensions: .eot, .svg, .ttf and .woff Is there anyway that I can get it to work on all browsers?? I was able to get it work fine on Firefox, Chrome and Safari, but it's not working on IE. Here is what I last found: @font-face { font-family: 'Andale Mono'; src: url('AndaleMono-webfont.eot?') format('eot'), url('AndaleMono-webfont.woff') format('woff'), url('AndaleMono-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'); } Thanks in advance.
