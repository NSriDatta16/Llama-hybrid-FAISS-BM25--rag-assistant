Existing Server Storage Management Software Solutions?

I am in the process of trying to graphically represent all of our server racks. So when we receive a new server we can decide where this should be put and where a specific servers currently resides. Are there any existing software packages that stores this kind of data already? I'd prefer open source ones if there are any but anything would be helpful.
