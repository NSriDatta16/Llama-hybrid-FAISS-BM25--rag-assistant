It is true that everything can be scattered in different places if you are not forced to organize code in certain ways, like Java forces you. It's completly up to you as a developer to organize code in logical units so it could be easier to find them and keep in mind that With great power comes great responsibility . The more you work in functional style, you'll find better ways to organize your code, the key is that you are not afraid of refactoring. Besides M-. in Emacs/Slime will bring you to the definition of symbol wherever you are. I suppose other Clojure IDE plugins have a similar feature.
