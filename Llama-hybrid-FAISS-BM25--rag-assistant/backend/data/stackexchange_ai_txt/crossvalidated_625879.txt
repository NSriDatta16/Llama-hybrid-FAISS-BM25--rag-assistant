The relationship between the Wilcoxon test and the ROCAUC of a machine learning "classification" model is that AUC is related to a Wilcoxon test of the group of predictions for one group and the group of predictions for the other group. Consequently, when you make your claim about an AUC, you are acting as if the measurements are the predictions of some machine learning model, and there is minimal linear separation between the two groups. It would be reasonable to see this as evidence that a simple logistic regression (just an intercept and a coefficient on this one feature) will have minimal ability to discriminate between the two categories, sure, as the predictions from that logistic regression would just be a monotonic transformation of the input values, and ROC curves are unaffected by monotonic transformations, as they are based on ranks. It is possible that a more complex model would be a very good discriminator, however, and the Wilcoxon test does not comment on this. For instance, it could be that one group has values that tend to be very low or very high, while the other group has values that are in the middle. A Wilcoxon test of these two groups would show minimal differences. However, running a logistic regression on this feature and its square would give much stronger ability to discriminate between the two groups. That is discussed in more detail here , and I ask for clarification about an expansion of that discussion here .
