Yes, Windows (and most modern OS's) keep recently read file data in otherwise unused RAM so that if that file data is requested again in the near future it will already be available in RAM and disk access can be avoided. As far as making disk access faster, you could try defragmenting your drive, but I wouldn't expect it to help too much. Drive access is just slow compared to RAM access, which is why RAM caching provides such a nice speedup.
