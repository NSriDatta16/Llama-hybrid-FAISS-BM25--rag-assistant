Can we use SSIS to parse data from application before we store in db...?

Exploring the feasibility of something here... We have a UI page in the mvc3 web-application that the admin will use to upload a 'csv' file. Is it possible to have an SSIS package that will be called by the application..that will validate/transform all these data and store into db if its all valid or throw back error details to application if there are invalid data? Just trying to leverage the capabilities of SSIS to do the parsing of file and transformation of data. If this is not possible, is there a better way? Please provide your thought..much appreciated! update: yes, need to execute ssis on the fly.. and give back a message on the UI page ..telling the 'uploader' if his upload failed or not based on message that SSIS would give back to the application.
