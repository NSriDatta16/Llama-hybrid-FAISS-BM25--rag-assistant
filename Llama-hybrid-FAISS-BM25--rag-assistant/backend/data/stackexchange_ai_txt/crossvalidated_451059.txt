Image Compression Approaches for CNN

I have a set of images, which are quite large in size and as such do not easily fit into memory for feeding a CNN. (1000x1000). I'd like to compress and encode these images, such that little information is lost. What is the best approach to handle this issue for CNNs without resorting to downscaling the image and losing a great deal of information?
