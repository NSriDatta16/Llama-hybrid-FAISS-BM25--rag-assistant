where would you put raw queries. is it ok to put row queries in view.py files? Queries are most commonly seen in the view.py; yes it's ok there. My personal opinion is to put them only in models.py files. If you're using the same query a lot then create a "manager" for the model. You'll put the very commonly used querys there. "Only" in there would be making life hard for yourself. where can you query db? Usually in views.py; not uncommonly in models.py. can you call query methods in ... templates? Technically it is possible but, logically, very strongly discouraged. I think they should be in models.py or views.py but not in templates I agree.
