Finding the browser with php

Which is the right way to detect the browser with which the user views the page with php? I tried with get_browser, it gave something like: Array ( [browser_name_regex] => ยง^.*$ยง [browser_name_pattern] => * [browser] => Default Browser [version] => 0 [majorver] => 0 [minorver] => 0 [platform] => unknown [alpha] => [beta] => [win16] => [win32] => [win64] => [frames] => 1 [iframes] => [tables] => 1 [cookies] => [backgroundsounds] => [cdf] => [vbscript] => [javaapplets] => [javascript] => [activexcontrols] => [isbanned] => [ismobiledevice] => [issyndicationreader] => [crawler] => [cssversion] => 0 [supportscss] => [aol] => [aolversion] => 0 ) this is what i got for IE7,chrome and mozilla firefox. I tried $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and it gave me Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.237 Safari/534.10 I am able to get some info here. So please tell me if there was a better way to do this, and is this a good solution to display HTML contents with different CSS for different browsers?
