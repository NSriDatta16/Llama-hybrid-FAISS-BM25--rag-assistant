Calculating Area Under The Precision Recall Curve with multiclass

I'm trying to calculate AUPR and when I was doing it on Datasets which were binary in terms of their classes, I used average_precision_score from sklearn and this has approximately solved my problem. However, when I tried to calculate average precision score on a multiclass dataset then its not supported according to sklearn . Assuming I have to do this manually instead of using some sklearn metric, I'm trying to understand how can I calculate this and I would love some help. Thanks!
