Storage location of yellow-blue shield icon

Where, in Windows, is this icon stored? I need to use it in a TaskDialog emulation for XP and am having a hard time tracking it down. It's not in shell32.dll, explorer.exe, ieframe.dll or wmploc.dll (as these contain a lot of icons commonly used in Windows). Edit: For clarification, I am emulating a certain type of dialog in XP. The icon is (most likely) not present there. So I want to extract it from the library that holds it in Windows 7. I am extending an existing implementation of this emulation and want to provide a full feature set.
