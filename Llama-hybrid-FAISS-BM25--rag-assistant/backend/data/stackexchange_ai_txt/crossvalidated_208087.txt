What is the difference between correlation, causation and prediction?

Suppose we have a set of events $\Omega$, containing events $A$ and $B$. My econometrics professor tried to distinguish the following three terms today. Causation --- $A$ causes $B$ if the occurrence of $A$ always leads to another specific outcome $B$. For example, clapping my hands causes a sound to be emitted. Prediction --- $A$ predicts $B$ if on average, $B$ is the expected outcome from $A$ occurring. In other words, whereas causality is deterministic, prediction is probabilistic. For example, studying for a test would predict doing well on the exam. But there's no guarantee. Correlation --- $A$ and $B$ are correlated if when one occurs the other does too. But there may be some hidden variable causing both. Are these distinctions meaningful? Or did he make these terms up? My Questions What is the difference between causation and correlation? Are "causes" always deterministic?
