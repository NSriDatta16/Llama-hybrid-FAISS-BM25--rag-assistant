Why does scrum use the average instead of the median when calculating velocity?

Could somebody please explain this to me. It seems to me that the number of story points actually delivered at the 50th percentile would be more valuable than a theoretical number that is far more likely to get affected by outliers, especially in the early days of an organization adopting scrum.
