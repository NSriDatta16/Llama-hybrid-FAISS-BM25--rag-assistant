iPhone Cache Manifest setup

I've been trying to setup a cache manifest for an iPhone WEB Application. I have included: However, something isn't working. I have configured easyPhp to deliver manifest with the mime.types file and also added AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest to the httpd.conf to try this also. It unfortunately doesn't work. I am using this: var appCache = window.applicationCache; appCache.ondownloading = downloadingFunction(); appCache.onerror = errorFunction(); Both of these functions get called. Inside the errorFunction , I alert the event.type which is "load". I don't know why this would be... I think everything is right since I have managed this with other projects in the past. Any help on working out where the problem lies would be appreciated. I think there's probably still a problem in my easyPhp because the rest of the code is the same as in my other projects but I can't be 100%.
