UILabel is a subclass of UIView , which is itself a subclass of UIResponder ; therefore, it’s definitely possible to make a label that responds to touches. Just make a new subclass of UILabel and implement the following method(s): – touchesBegan:withEvent: – touchesMoved:withEvent: – touchesEnded:withEvent: – touchesCancelled:withEvent: So, if you wanted something to happen when touches started, you’d do it in -touchesBegan:withEvent: . If creating a new subclass is too heavy-handed for you, then I’d suggest doing as @JustSid suggests and using a UIButton for the task.
