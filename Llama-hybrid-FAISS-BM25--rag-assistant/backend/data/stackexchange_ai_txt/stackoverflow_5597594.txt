I would recommend Heroku/S3. As long as you are dealing with "not a lot" disc space and nothing CPU intensive (like video en/decoding), you should stick to the easiest solution and go the pragmatic way. This is most probably Heroku/S3. I am running my app (similar to your usecase, just some images per user) on Heroku/S3 and my monthly bills are way below a McDonald's menu for every week. ;)
