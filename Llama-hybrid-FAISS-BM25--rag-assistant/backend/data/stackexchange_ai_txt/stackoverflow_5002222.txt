Dragging anchors with jQuery : IE not updating cursor

Ever noticed that if you make an anchor () draggable using jQuery and you set to have a certain cursor to be displayed, IE keeps the pointer displayed regardless of your selection. See the sample code below: $("a, div").draggable({ helper: "clone", cursor: "move" }); It seems like IE keeps the cursor style as at the time of the 'mousedown', until the button is released. All other browsers honor the cursor style. Anybody have an idea how to ensure the cursor style while dragging anchors?
