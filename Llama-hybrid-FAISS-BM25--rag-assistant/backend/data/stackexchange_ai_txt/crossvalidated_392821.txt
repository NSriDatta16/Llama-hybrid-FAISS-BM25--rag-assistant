multiple logistic regressions with binary predictors vs single logistic regression with categorical predictors

I would like to know which is statistically more advisable and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. My data frame data has Y , the outcome, and A and B , the predictor variables. A and B are categorical with multiple levels each (the levels are A0 , A1 , A2 , and A3 for A ; and B0 , B1 , B2 , and B3 for B ). I want to explore the interaction A * B and calculate some epidemiological measures whose formulas are more manageable when A and B are binary each. It is possible to keep a meaningful interpretation in my results if I split the data frame into several chunks and fit a logistic regression with binary predictors for each chunk of data. This has the advantage that I can easily calculate the epidemiological measures that are of interest for my analysis. However, this approach might compromise the sample size and there might be other disadvantages that I am not aware of. Alternatively, I could use the full data frame and fit a single logistic regression with categorical predictors and do the same pairwise comparisons as above - more difficult but possible. This has the advantage of keeping a good sample size and probably other good properties that I am not aware of. But there might be some disadvantages that I might not be aware of and would like to know. Thanks in advance for any help.
