Not-quite-binomial mixed effects

I have a language learning study with a few different dependent variables. For the majority of the tasks, responses to each item are either right (1) or wrong (0), and thus the data has been analysed with a mixed effects logistic regression. However, I have one task that has allowed for partial scoring - so participants can score 0, 0.5, or 1. Is there any way to analyse this in a consistent way to the other tasks? I wondered about multinomial regressions but (a) these seem complicated (no lme4 option?), and (b) I'm not sure whether it's appropriate given that the categories are related? There are also very few 0.5 scores. Any pointers would be much appreciated, many thanks in advance.
