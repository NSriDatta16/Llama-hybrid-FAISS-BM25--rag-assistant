MVVM pattern in wpf - one data model , multiple view models

I am currently designing simple editor as part of learning process. Its basicaly hierarchical tree structure of polygons-lines-points, that is implemented in data model. I need to display these data in two views First view: hierarchical data in tree view item Second view: rendered geometry on screen Following the MVVM pattern i have implemented model view classes around data model ( point model view, line model view, etc.. ) . In tree view I am using hierarchical data templates to properly display specific data. On second view I need to render current state of geometry, currently its just one model-view wrapper around polygon data class, that travels all children and render them in onRender method. In this case I am using multiple view models over the same data, both for quite different purpose. There is a problem when I make some modification in tree view model (adding points for example) , resulting in change of underlying data model. However second view model does not directly observe data in model view, it updates render view only if I make modification trough its modelview clas. Is there some elegant solution to update both view models concurently ?
