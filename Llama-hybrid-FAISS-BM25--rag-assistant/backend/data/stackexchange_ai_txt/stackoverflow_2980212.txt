Standard email (on a Unix system) is either an mbox file (containing several messages) or a maildir setup where each mail is a file in a directory. Either way, it's ascii text. That is how a MUA (mail-user agents -- your mail reader) is orthogonal to your MTA (mail-transport agent -- mail server software like exim, qmail, postfix, ...). The MTA may use a network protocol like POP3 or IMAP to serve the mail files to the client in which case the client (which may be Gmail or Thunderbird) no longer sees the underlying files. So you may need to learn how to export your mail from whichever backend you employ and then read it. This has nothing to do with R or programming so far --- unless you now feel you must extend R with POP3 or IMAP facilities to connect to a (remote) mail server.
