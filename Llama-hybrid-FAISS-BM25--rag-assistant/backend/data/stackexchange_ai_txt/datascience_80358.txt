Estimating average daily consumption with samples randomly scattered in time

I want to estimate my daily water consumption. I have taken pictures of the water meters (total m3 used since last reset) every now and then, but without any regularity. There can be a difference of a few days to several weeks between samples. What would be the best way to estimate this? I have thought of the following approaches: Create a double-entry table with the sample dates in the column and in the row headers. Each cell is the average consumption per day between the corresponding two dates. Finally, average all the cells in the table. Calculate the daily consumption between every two consecutive samples. Finally, average all of them. It seems to me that the first one would give a better estimation given the higher number of samples compared, but I am not sure if this is valid.
