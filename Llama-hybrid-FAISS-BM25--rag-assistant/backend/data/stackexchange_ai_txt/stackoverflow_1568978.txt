I'm going to assume this is a Java project in Eclipse; if it's not, please provide more information. When using classes from within different packages, you need to import them. This is done with one or more import statements at the top of the class file, like so: import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; This tells the compiler, "when I refer to List, I want to use the one that's in the java.util package". In Eclipse, a convenient way to try and automatically add those import statements is to right-click in the source editor and select "Organize Imports" under "Source". Eclipse will look around all the code and libraries it knows about related to that project and try and resolve any missing imports. If it can't work something out, it'll either prompt you or ignore it. If it finds multiple possibilities, it will usually prompt you to select which one you meant. For a much more thorough explanation of packages and dividing source code up, please see the Packages lesson in the Java Tutorials.
