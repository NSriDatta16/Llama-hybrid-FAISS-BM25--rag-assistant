It's not working because it's invalid to have an unordered list inside a paragraph. You should change the paragraph to a div or another element that makes sense semantically. Then the ViewHelper will put the unordered list of errors right after the input, at the end of the div. You won't have to write any extra code, and the html will be valid. Just change 'p' to 'div' in your HtmlTag decorator. array('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'div', 'class' => 'element-form')) First Name: required field!
