I'm using Entourage, so this may not match up exactly with the behavior you're seeing, but I hope it helps. Using the iCalendar from your reply, Entourage wouldn't even import the data. Using a known-good file, I got it to import, then successfully update. Comparing the two files, the only structural differences are as follows: My known-good doesn't have a VERSION element My known-good doesn't have a PRODID element My known-good doesn't have a STATUS element My known-good doesn't have a SEQUENCE element Since Microsoft's support for open standards tends to lag, I'd suggest trying without the VERSION info.
