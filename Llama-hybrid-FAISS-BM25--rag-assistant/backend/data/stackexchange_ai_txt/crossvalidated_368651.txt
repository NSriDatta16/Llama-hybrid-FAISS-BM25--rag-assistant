Is there any theory on the order of Autoregression model for periodic time series?

Say M periodic signals, then one can safely say using AR-M model can achieve the perfect prediction. But how about further, in a more general sense, is there any publications on this? Update: Here is my arXiv paper on this problem https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05198
