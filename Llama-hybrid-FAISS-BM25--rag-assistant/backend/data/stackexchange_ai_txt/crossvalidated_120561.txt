Regression models condition on the right-hand-side (predictor) variables and make some sort of distribution assumption for the response variable conditional on all the $X$s. What matters for $X$ is the shape of its effect on $Y$, hence the popularity of regression splines. The only time I worry about the marginal distribution of an $X$ is when it is extremely skewed, because on the average such $X$s predict $Y$ better if they are "straightened out" a bit. I often fit a restricted cubic spline in the cube root of such an $X$. So the short answer is that transforming the $X$s for the reasons you provided is not correct. And be sure to worry a bit more about the Poisson distributional assumption.
