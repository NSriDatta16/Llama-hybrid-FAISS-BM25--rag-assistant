Question About Using Weka, the machine learning tool

I'm using the explorer feature of Weka for classification. So I have my .arff file, with 2 features of NUMERIC value, and my class is a binary 0 or 1 (eg {0,1}). Sample: @RELATION summary @ATTRIBUTE feature1 NUMERIC @ATTRIBUTE feature2 NUMERIC @ATTRIBUTE class {1,0} @DATA 23,11,0 20,100,1 2,36,0 98,8,1 ..... I load this .arff file, use 10-fold cross validation (no test file), and choose NaiveBayes, then I classify the data, and it gives me: 5 incorrectly labeled, 100 correctly labeled. So far so good. Now, I significantly change my .arff file (give completely random values for my feature attributes). And repeat the above, and I get the EXACT same statistics when classifying. I tried this with more changes to my .arff file, different classification algorithms. Still, EXACT same statistic (within the same algorithm) no matter what values I give to my .arff file. Am I doing something wrong here?
