You can , using the HTTP User-Agent header, but I'd strongly advise not doing that if possible. The User-Agent header is very very difficult to parse accurately, and tends towards false positives with simple string matching — even ignoring the issue of browsers that pretend to be other browsers. For example Jeremy's “MSIE 6.” string will match IE Mobile, which is so very different from IE6 that you generally don't want to conflate them. Plus when you send different HTML to different browsers, you have to use the ‘Vary’ header (which makes caches less effective) to avoid that caches send the wrong pages to different browsers. So if you can find another place to do the browser differentiation that's definitely best. Ólafur's approach with conditional comments is usually the simplest approach for changing JavaScript and HTML markup/CSS links.
