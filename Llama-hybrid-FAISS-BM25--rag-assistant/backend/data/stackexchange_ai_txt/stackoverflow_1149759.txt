what does "class libraries on the classpath" mean?

could anyone please clarify the meaning of class libraries on the classpath in the case of Tomcat in the following line: Actually all classes used by the web-app(unless they're part of the class libraries on the classpath ) must follow the same rules as servlet classes-inside WEB-INF/classes, in a directory structure matching the package (or in the appropriate package directories within a JAR inside WEB-INF/lib). What do they mean with class libraries and classpath in the above paragraph?
