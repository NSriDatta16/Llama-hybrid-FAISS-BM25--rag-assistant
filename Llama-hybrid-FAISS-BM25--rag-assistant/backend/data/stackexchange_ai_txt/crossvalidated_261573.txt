Using gradient ascent instead of gradient descent for logistic regression

I know this question has been asked previously but the answers didn't satisfy my query. Why choose gradient ascent instead of gradient descent when our aim is to minimize the cost function when we know that gradient ascent will maximize the cost function. Andrew Ng himself used gradient descent for logistic regression in his ML tutorial in Coursera. Please help me clear my doubt.
