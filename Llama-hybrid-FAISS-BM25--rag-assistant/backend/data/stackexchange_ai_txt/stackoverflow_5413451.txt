How to scale an image in Python?

def scaleImage(image): """ A function that takes an image and makes each pixel grayscale: the red, blue, green components are the average of the respective components in each original pixel. """ pix = image.getPixels() # How can I condense the following loop? newimage = Image() for pixel in pix: newpixel = ((int(pixel[0]) + int(pixel[1]) + int(pixel[2]))/3, (int(pixel[0]) + int(pixel[1]) + int(pixel[2]))/3, (int(pixel[0]) + int(pixel[1]) + int(pixel[2]))/3, int(pixel[3])) newimage.setPixels(newpixel) return newimage My task is to write a function showScale() that asks the user for an image filename, then displays both that image and its grayscale version in a window. def showScale(): filename = raw_input("The name of the image file? ") picture = Image.open(filename) newpicture = Image.open(scaleImage(picture)) newpicture.show() Question1. Should I use cs1graphics module to make it work? Question2. How should I change my code to answer my task?
