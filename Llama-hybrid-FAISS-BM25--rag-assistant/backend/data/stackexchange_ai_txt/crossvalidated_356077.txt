Is it possible to compute residual variances of Laplacian Eigenmaps, Diffusion Map and t-SNE to have a scree plots as in PCA?

I will like to do comparative analysis of PCA vs. Laplacian Eigenmaps , Diffusion Map , and t-SNE . For this, I can create scree plot (with residual variance) for PCA and check the elbow of the curve . Is it possible to do the same for Laplacian Eigenmap, Diffusion Map, and t-SNE? If yes, what is the mathematical formulation for that? Is it the same as for PCA? I know it is not possible for LLE as here residual variance does not make any sense. Is there any MATLAB/Python code available for it?
