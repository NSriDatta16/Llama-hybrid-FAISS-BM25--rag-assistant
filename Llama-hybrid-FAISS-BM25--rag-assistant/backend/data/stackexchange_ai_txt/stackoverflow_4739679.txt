Jquery Droppable Center Image in Div After Drop Event

Hey there,i'm creating a simple inventory using jQuery droppable. For now, it's like : $(document).ready(function() { $( ".weapon, .helmet" ).draggable({ revert: "invalid", cursor: "move" }); $( "#weapon_spot" ).droppable({accept: ".weapon"}); $( "#helmet_spot" ).droppable({accept: ".helmet"}); // make inventory slots droppable as well $( ".inv_slot" ).droppable({accept: ".weapon"}); }); I'm kinda new to JQuery and have some trouble setting an image to be aligned inside a certain div. Everything(.weapon, .helmet etc) is a div. Inside them, there can be images. The divs are 70x70 and the images are of that size as well. The css is like : .inv_slot, #weapon_spot, #helmet_spot { width: 70px; padding: 10px; height: 70px; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; float: left; text-align: center; } and the image inside a div is like : My problem is that when i drop an image to another div, it's not aligned in the center of the div, it's not locked and it can be moved inside it. It seems that i can use Drag.Move somehow to do that, but i can't find some good resource explaining that. Could you please help ? :) EDIT : I have created a demo at http://jsfiddle.net/kzuRn/2/
