Binary Logistic Regression using Non-Dichotomous Independent Variables; SPSS

I'm using SPSS for binary logistic regression but one of my independent variables is non-dichotomous and categorical (genotype - there are 5 gene combinations possible). I'm trying to see if a particular genotype is associated with the presence of anxiety as well as if there is a sex-specific effect (i.e. males with a particular genotype are more likely to have anxiety). Independent variables: Sex (male/female), Genotype (5 combinations) Dependent variable: presence of anxiety (yes/no) I coded male=0 and female=1, and no=0 and yes=1, but I don't know how to code the genotypes for this analysis? I would greatly appreciate any help!
