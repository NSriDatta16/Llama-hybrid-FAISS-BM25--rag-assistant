The general idea that you have is correct, though normally a HTML form will perform a POST back to the server rather than a GET. See this question for example code for a web request in C# that supplies arguments. Pay special attention to the comment telling you to add request.Method = "POST"; since that will change the request from a GET. (You can tell is a form is a GET or POST by looking at the method in it's opening tag. This: is a POST form. No declared method means that it is a GET) The more complex problem is parsing the HTML to find the elements. This is a tricky issue since the looseness of the HTML standard means that you can't simply treat it as an XML document and parse it that way, instead you have to come up with a more forgiving method. There are a few questions on how to do this on this site ( this for example ) and it is a common problem, so Google will no doubt give you some leads. If I was approching this problem I'd get the web request working with a known form first (so you can skip the parsing) and worry about that part once you are comfortable with sending and retrieving data from the server.
