Linq To Sql - DataContext.SubmitChanges() problem

I have a code like this. DBContext is Datacontext instance. try { TBLORGANISM org = new TBLORGANISM(); org.OrganismDesc = p.Subject; DBContext.TBLORGANISMs.InsertOnSubmit(org); DBContext.SubmitChanges(); } catch (Exception) { } At this point, I want to IGNORE the error and want to be skipped. Not to be retried. But when I try another insert like TBLACTION act = new TBLACTION(); act.ActionDesc = p.ActionName; DBContext.TBLACTIONs.InsertOnSubmit(act); DBContext.SubmitChanges(); SubmitChanges firstly retries previous attempt. How can I tell "skip errors, don't try again"?
