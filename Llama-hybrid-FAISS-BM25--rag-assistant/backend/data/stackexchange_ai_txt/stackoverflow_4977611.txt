Jquery draggable stops after IE AJAX refresh

I have a web page where I create images from text by clicking a button and add the image to a draggable div in a parent div element. The div is in an update panel. The divs are draggable after this event. I have another button which saves the html temporarily and recreates the divs with their positions when i add another image->text. However after this event all the old divs lose thier drag property, the last div which has been added still retains the draggable property. $(".inner").live('mousedown', function() { $(this).draggable({ containment: "# ", cursor: "move", stop: function(event, ui) { var position = $(this).position(); $(this).css("top", position.top + 'px'); $(this).css("left",position.left + 'px'); } }); }); This is my current function. Please suggest ! This works perfectly in Firefox and chrome. Issue is only in IE.
