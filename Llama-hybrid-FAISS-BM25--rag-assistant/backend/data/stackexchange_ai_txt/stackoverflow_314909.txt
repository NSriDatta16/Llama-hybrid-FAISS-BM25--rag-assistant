Heap fragmentation in 64 bit land

In the past, when I've worked on long-running C++ daemons I've had to deal with heap fragmentation issues. Tricks like keeping a pool of my large allocations were necessary to keep from running out of contiguous heap space. Is this still an issue with a 64 bit address space? Perf is not a concern for me, so I would prefer to simplify my code and not deal with things like buffer pools anymore. Does anyone have any experience or stories about this issue? I'm using Linux, but I imagine many of the same issues apply to Windows.
