Generally speaking, Pearson correlation measures linear relationship, so naturally nonlinear relationships may not be captured by it. However, having a nonlinear looking time series doesn't mean that you can't calculate Pearson correlation. For example, the two series can be exact multiples of each other, however nonlinear they may look when plotted with respect to time. If you plot the corresponding points of the blue curve and the red curve in to x-y plane, you'll have a much better idea of how they're related, and can calculate the Pearson correlation as well. In addition, the two series might have been correlated by a lag. In your case, it doesn't seem to be, i.e. lag is $0$ , but generally you calculate the cross-correlation function for that.
