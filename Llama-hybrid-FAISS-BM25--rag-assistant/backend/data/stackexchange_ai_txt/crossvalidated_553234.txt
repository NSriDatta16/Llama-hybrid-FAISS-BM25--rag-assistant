The appropriateness of logistic regression does not depend on how the independent variable is coded. As long as the outcome is binary, it can be used. If your goal is simply to test the association between a binary and a continuous variable, you could also just use a t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. If you want to build a more complicated model, logistic regression is a good choice.
