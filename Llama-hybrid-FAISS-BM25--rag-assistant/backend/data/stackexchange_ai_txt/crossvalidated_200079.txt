SanilB's terminology isn't precise, but the drift of the question seems clear enough for anyone with a background in educational data analysis, I think. By "mapping," are you referring to recovering the hierarchical relationships that exist within classrooms and schools between students and teachers? Or are you referring to identifying and somehow optimizing an assignment of students to teacher "types" in order to maximize student performance? The former assumes a structure with a single student-teacher relationship, the kind of organization typically seen in US elementary schools. Otherwise and as is true for most middle and high schools where a single student will have multiple teachers across multiple subjects, it becomes much more difficult to disentangle separate and distinct influences. These are the kinds of challenges that VAT or value-added teaching models attempt to decompose. The latter objective of maximizing student performance is a much, much more difficult, almost impossible challenge. One unarticulated implication of it is the assumption of a kind of experimental design (random assignment of students and teachers based on their "profiles") that is almost impossible to enforce beyond small pilot studies. Not to mention that the cluster profiles are, at best, only weakly predictive.
