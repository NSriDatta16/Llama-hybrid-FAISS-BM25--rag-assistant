Where is this height coming from?

I've got an embedded widget from The Weather Channel and everything is working fine except that they've got a with a 1px height image that is expanding to a height equal to the other rows. It's shifting the rest of the content down. Because it's just an embed, there is only so much of the styling I can control. But I figured it must be inheriting something from my stylesheet since it had inherited some line-height that I had to correct. If you visit http://www.scwd.com and scroll to the bottom you'll see the weather widget. The row with the grey td below @weather.com is the issue. It should only be 1px in height. I've used multiple debuggers to see if I could find the inherit and I cannot. Any help would be great. -- UPDATE -- Not the most elegant solution considering variable within the widget and out of my control may change in the future. But as David suggested, I solved it with the following. var x = $("img[src$='blank.gif']"); $(x).closest('tr').css('display', 'none');
