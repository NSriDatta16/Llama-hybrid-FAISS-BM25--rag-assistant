LinqToSql Best Practices

I just started creating my data-access layer using LinqToSql. Everybody is talking about the cool syntax and I really like Linq in general. But when I saw how your classes get generated if you drag some tables on the LinqContext I was amazed: So much code which nobody would need?! So I looked how other people used LinqToSql, for example Rob Connery at his StoreFront Demo. As I don't like the way that all this code is generated I created my domain layer by hand and used the generated classes as reference. With that solution I'm fine, as I can use the features provided by Linq (dereferred execution, lazy loading, ...) and my domain layer is quite easy to understand. How are you using LinqToSql?
