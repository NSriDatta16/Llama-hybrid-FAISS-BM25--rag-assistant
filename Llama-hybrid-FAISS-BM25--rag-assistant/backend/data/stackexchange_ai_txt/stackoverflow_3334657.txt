Parameters for webservice call from ASP.NET MVC/jQuery best practice

I need to call a webservice which takes as parameters things like the database name, schema name, login credentials etc. I'd ideally like to call the webservice directly from jQuery, but I feel that these parameters belong in the web config so perhaps I should be calling the webservice indirectly through an ajaxed MVC controller method. What are peoples opinions on this? Is there an elegant solution? Edit: It's just occured to me that I'll be exposing the server credentials to the client if I make the call from jQuery, so I guess that isn't an option unless there's a clever trick I don't know about.
