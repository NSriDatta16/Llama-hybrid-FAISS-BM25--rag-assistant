How to build a c++ project on a remote computer in Eclipse?

I have a Windows pc with Eclipse Ganymede installed, and a Linux pc where my C++ project files are located. I use Eclipse to edit the files through SMB, and would like to build the project using Eclipse as well. Currently I connect using putty to my linux machine, and run ./make from the appropriate directory. How would I run the same command within Eclipse and see the results in it? I have installed the RSE plugin, but still can't grasp how to do so. Just to made myself clear - I can use VNC to work on Eclipse that is installed on my linux machine, but I prefer not do so. Eclipse through VNC is slow and not as responsive as the Eclipse installed on my windows machine. Thanks, Rouli
