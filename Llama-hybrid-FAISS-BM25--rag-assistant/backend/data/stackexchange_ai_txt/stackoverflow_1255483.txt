Which version of JSP (WTP) are you using? (what version of eclipse are you using as well?) Is the error message one like this: org.eclipse.jst.jsp.core.internal.parser.JSPSourceParser: input could not be parsed correctly at position 1 java.lang.StackOverflowError (as reported in this thread ?) The bug 265380 reports a fix for WTP 3.0.5 and as such would impact an eclipse Ganymede SR2 (i.e. 3.4.2). WTP3.1 has also this bug fixed, and is for eclipse Galileo (3.5)
