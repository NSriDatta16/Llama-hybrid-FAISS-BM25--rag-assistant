Certainly loading a dictionary for every ASP request is definitely a bad idea and will be hurting not only your performance but also fragmenting your Virtual Memory. Using an array instead still has much the same problem, each request would need to allocate all the memory needed to hold it and it still needs populating on each request. The simple answer would be yes use the application object as the dictionary. This will cost you much less in memory and CPU. The downside is does it collide with existing application object usage? You may need to prefix your keys in order to avoid this problem.
