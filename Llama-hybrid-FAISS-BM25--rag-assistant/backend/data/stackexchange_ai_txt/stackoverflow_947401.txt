Anything wrong with releasing software in debug mode?

We all know that "Debug Mode" should be used for development because compiler produces more debugging information and "Release Mode" should be used for production releases because the compiler produces optimized code. However, lets say if you are making a software that is only used internally within the organization and code performance is not a huge issue because the software need to do a lot of file I/O and database queries. I will be very tempted to just release the software in "Debug Mode" in this scenario because those extra debugging information makes future maintenance a bit easier. Are there still any compelling reason for releasing software in release mode in this case?
