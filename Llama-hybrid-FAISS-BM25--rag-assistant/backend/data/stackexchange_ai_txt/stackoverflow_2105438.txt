Since application is very well architected you may not want to retire it and loose all investment you have made to date. Here are my suggestions: Have a junior developer join this current developer. Dump most of future updates on junior developer (with assistance from sr. developer) Ask junior developer to do the documentation of his work Ask Sr. developer to review documentation Over period of time, you have another person who can support this application and it will be documented as well. Now you won't need to kill your own very well architected application with your own hands. . Extending this solution with Jefferey suggestion below("Sometimes rewriting is a good investment.") If you still want to drop current application and re-write it, you still need to document existing system and create requirements for new system based off it. Using documentation of current and proposed system, you may want to see if you can incrementally module by module upgrade (re-write) components. This is possible if application is very well architected. As per your (Geo) comments Geo's organization has custom third-party (with one and only one contract developer) CMS application that implements below business requirements and is paying licensing fee for support and use of his code. Business requirements for CMS Websites Proposal Creator Marketing Campaign Tracker Here are my suggestions Create module by module detailed use case document for this project. Your developer can do this or would be ideal to have a seperate business analyst for same. Hire a Sr. Developer to evaluate if open source CMS can handle all or most of your requirements (e.g. Joomla, Drupal, etc.). Most important thing here would be ability to migrate your existing data to new system. You may need help from your existing contract developer to do this. You may have to update business process or workflow to use new system. Modules that cannot be implemented using open source CMS may be required to be implemented using custom website. Much of it also depends on your business relation with existing contract developer and license agreement. What you are facing is a vendor lock in scenario. You may want to further research on solutions to eliminate this vendor lock in situation.
