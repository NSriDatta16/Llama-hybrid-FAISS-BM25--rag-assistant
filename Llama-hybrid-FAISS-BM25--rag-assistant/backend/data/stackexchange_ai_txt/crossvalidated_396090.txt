What is the number of filter when using CNN for sentence classification

I am new to machine learning and NLP. During reading convolutional neural networks for sentence classification I'm having trouble understanding it. In the paper it says that a feature map c has features. where n is the total length and h is the number features in it. But the figure given with it makes me confused. For the Red filter, I thought that n would be 9 and h would be 2, making a featuremap of 8 features. but the figure shows a filtermap of 7 features. For the Yellow filter I thought 9-3+1=7 features should be right but the picture indicates 6 features. What am I missing? This is my first time postiing a question. So, if anythings inappropriate please tell me.
