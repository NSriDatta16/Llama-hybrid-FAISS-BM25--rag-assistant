The question, which seems to be mostly ignored here: does programming Python functionally really help with concurrency? No. The value FP brings to concurrency is in eliminating state in computation, which is ultimately responsible for the hard-to-grasp nastiness of unintended errors in concurrent computation. But it depends on the concurrent programming idioms not themselves being stateful, something that doesn't apply to Twisted. If there are concurrency idioms for Python that leverage stateless programming, I don't know of them.
