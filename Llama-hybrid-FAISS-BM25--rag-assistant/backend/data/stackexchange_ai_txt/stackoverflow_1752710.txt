Drag and Drop, Orderable List in ActionScript 3

I am trying to create a set of drag-and-drop, orderable lists with ActionScript. I know this is possible in Flex. The behavior I am going for can be seen here: Two-way drag-and drop support (you'll have to scroll down) Here is the source code Does something like this already exist in AS? Can I use the Flex component in Flash?
