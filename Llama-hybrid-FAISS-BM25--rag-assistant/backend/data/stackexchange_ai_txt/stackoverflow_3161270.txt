As pointed out in other answers: The public static List s are bad practice Since the addObject method is the same for every data structure, it should be implemented as a data structure accessor. To this end, I moved the instantiation of the data structures into Foo and moved the addObject method from Foo to a new class called StorageLibrary that more accurately represents the data structure architecture. private class StorageLibrary { private List storedObjects = new List (); public void addObject(obj inspectionObject) { storedObjects.Add(inspectionObject); //And a lot more code } } public class Foo : StorageLibrary { //Declaration of libraries public static StorageLibrary storage1 = new StorageLibrary(); public static StorageLibrary storage2 = new StorageLibrary(); ... private void ObjectFeed(/* PARAMATERS */) { //generate objects if (objectType == Type.Type1) { storage1.addObject(inspectionObject); } if (objectType == Type.Type2) { storage2.addObject(inspectionObject); } ... } }
