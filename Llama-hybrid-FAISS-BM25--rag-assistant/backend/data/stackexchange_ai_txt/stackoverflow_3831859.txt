You are missing a critical piece of information in the presentation of the problem: What information is represented by the CSV files you are collecting? As a general principle, if the CSV files are simply different ways of presenting the same kind of information (that is, some people send you more or fewer detail fields about the same "things") then, if you're collecting this information in relational database, I would say that you definitely want to have one common table (or a small group of common tables to correctly represent the data). You would have a separate import program for each format of CSV file that you might need to convert into your "thing", but the storage would be the same no matter what kind of CSV file the "thing" came in. On the other hand, if each CSV file represents different "things" and you're really building a general-purpose CSV reporting tool of some kind, then I question whether a relational database is even the correct storage mechanism for the project although I would want to know more details about what you're actually doing before making any kind of categorical statement.
