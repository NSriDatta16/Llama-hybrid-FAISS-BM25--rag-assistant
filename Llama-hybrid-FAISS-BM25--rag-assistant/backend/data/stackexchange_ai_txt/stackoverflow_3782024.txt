"Referenced Libraries"-collapsable gone when checking out Eclipse project from SVN

I have created an Eclipse project with a number of referenced jar files. I use a variable to specify the local folder of the jar files. However when I check out this project to another machine Eclipse does not organize the referenced files under a "Referenced Libraries" pin. Instead it just lists all of the files. Any ideas why this happens and how to correct it? Screenshot here: https://i.stack.imgur.com/clsj0.png
