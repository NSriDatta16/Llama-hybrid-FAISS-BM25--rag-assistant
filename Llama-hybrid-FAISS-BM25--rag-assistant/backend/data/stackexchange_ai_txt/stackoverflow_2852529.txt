SQL Server 2008 - Conditional Range

I have a database that has two tables. These two tables are defined as: Movie ----- ID (int) Title (nvchar) MovieReview ----------- ID (int) MovieID (int) StoryRating (decimal) HumorRating (decimal) ActingRating (decimal) I have a stored procedure that allows the user to query movies based on other user's reviews. Currently, I have a temporary table that is populated with the following query: SELECT m.*, (SELECT COUNT(ID) FROM MovieReivew r WHERE r.MovieID=m.ID) as 'TotalReviews', (SELECT AVG((r.StoryRating + r.HumorRating + r.ActingRating) / 3) FROM MovieReview r WHERE r.MovieID=m.ID) as 'AverageRating' FROM Movie m In a later query in my procedure, I basically want to say: SELECT * FROM MyTempTable t WHERE t.AverageRating >= @lowestRating AND t.AverageRating My problem is, sometimes AverageRating is zero. Because of this, I'm not sure what to do. How do I handle this scenario in SQL?
