OK, I got an answer from Alec Pojidaev , who's quite the InfoPath expert. He says: You have couple problems I was able to pinpoint. The first is you checked checkbox "Update this value when result of the formula is recalculated" on YearlyCost field. Its one time operation so you dont want to recalculate it. The second problem is formula itself. The result of your formula ../../../my:TotalCost - sum(.) is absolutely the same as ../../../my:TotalCost - . sum() function have no sense in that context. If I understand your intention correct the right formula should be: ../../../my:TotalCost - sum(../../my:FY/my:YearlyCost) After I made these changes, the form worked as desired. The sum(.) in the formula was automatically generated. I built the formula thru point-and-click rather than writing the XPath expression. When I added the sum() function and selected the YearlyCost field, the formula editor replaced YearlyCost with a . I figured it knew what it was doing, so I left it alone. I see I need to pay close attention to what underlying XPath is being generated.
