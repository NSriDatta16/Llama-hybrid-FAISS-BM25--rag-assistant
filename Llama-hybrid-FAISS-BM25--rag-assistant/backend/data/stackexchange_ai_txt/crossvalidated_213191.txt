Steady State Calculation in Markov Chain in R

I am using the package markovchain in R. My transition matrix looks like this > transition_matrix Arriving Playing.on.Phone Paying.Attention Writing.Notes Listening Kicked.Out [1,] 0 0.5 0.50 0.0 0 0.00 [2,] 0 0.0 0.99 0.0 0 0.01 [3,] 0 0.8 0.00 0.2 0 0.00 [4,] 0 0.0 0.00 0.0 1 0.00 [5,] 0 0.0 0.00 1.0 0 0.00 [6,] 0 0.0 0.00 0.0 0 1.00 Now I am building a markov chain object mcstates Setting initial value as init After 10 steps > init * (mcstates ^ 10) Arriving Playing.on.Phone Paying.Attention Writing.Notes Listening Kicked.Out [1,] 0 0.1573841 0.1947628 0.3309517 0.2886897 0.02821181 After 100 steps > init * (mcstates ^ 100) Arriving Playing.on.Phone Paying.Attention Writing.Notes Listening Kicked.Out [1,] 0 4.361078e-06 5.396834e-06 0.4807651 0.4759563 0.04326881 After 1000 steps > init * (mcstates ^ 1000) Arriving Playing.on.Phone Paying.Attention Writing.Notes Listening Kicked.Out [1,] 0 1.163927e-51 1.440359e-51 0.4807692 0.4759615 0.04326923 Showing that there is no change in distribution However when I try to calculate the steadystate > steadyStates(mcstates) Arriving Playing.on.Phone Paying.Attention Writing.Notes Listening Kicked.Out [1,] 0 8.211848e-16 1.055809e-15 0.5170262 0.5170262 -0.03405231 [2,] 0 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0.0000000 0.0000000 1.00000000 I have two questions How is the steady state different from the stationary distribution I am hitting when I keep on multiplying with the transition matrix Why is there a negative probability in the steady state solution Any insight on this will be greatly appreciated
