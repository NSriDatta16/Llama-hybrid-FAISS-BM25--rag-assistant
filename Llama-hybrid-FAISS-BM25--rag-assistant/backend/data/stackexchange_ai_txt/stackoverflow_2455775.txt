Can you authenticate into SSAS with AD LDS (ADAM) accounts?

I'm very new to AD LDS and experienced but not qualified with SSAS, so my apologies for my ignorances with these. We have a couple implementations where we expose SSAS via an HTTPS proxy (msmdpump.dll) and currently we have a temporary domain setup handling this (where our end-users have a second account+creds to manage because of this = non-ideal). I want to move us towards a more permanent solution which I'm thinking of moving all authentication to AD LDS for our web apps, SSAS, and others. However, SSAS is where I'm concerned about this. I know SSAS requires Windows Authentication and to play nicely, and that this ultimately means Active Directory will be involved. Is there a way to get this done with AD LDS instead of having to use a full AD DS implementation? If so, how?
