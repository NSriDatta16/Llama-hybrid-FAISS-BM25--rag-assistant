What does the limit of xgboost max_depth=1 represent?

In my mind, this means that each tree just takes one feature, and produces a step function based upon it. In the limit of n_estimators being very large and max_depth=1, does xgboost become a linear model? On my dataset, a gridsearch found max_depth to be 1, so I'm wondering if I should be building a linear model instead.
