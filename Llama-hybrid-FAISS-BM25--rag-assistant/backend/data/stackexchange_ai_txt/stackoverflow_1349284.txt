What is the source of your text? Is it coming from a dataset? If so, Add a paragraph id in it, set your table to group on the paragraph id and show only the group header. In the group, add a bottom padding value of say 5. The table will handle the paragraph breaks for you, and if it grows more the a page it will handle it for you. Make sure that keep together is set to false. The paragraph id will be used to sort the dataset by id ascending. sorry I didn't notice your comment at the end. The only other thing that i can think of is to shift your list up closer to the header and eliminate all empty space at the end. Also, make sure the KeepTogether option in the list is set to false. This way it will break up your list rather than move it to the next page. you can put both the letterhead and the list inside a rectangle so they are always grouped together. Reporting services also tries to keep the relative spaces you have in the designer, so if you list is aligned to the bottom of the page and there is a space form the header; it will keep the space on top and align everything to the bottom of the page.
