Magento: how do you change the number of product columns based upon page layout?

I know that in catalog.xml this line effects all layouts: 5 But I want to change the number of columns based upon specific page layouts, i.e.: 2columns with left bar, 3 columns, etc. This is what someone said to do but I am not sure I was adding the update tag in the right spot because it didn't seem to work. Also if you read the comments they say once you turn caching back on it breaks it: http://www.lotusseedsdesign.com/blog/change-grid-view-column-4-product-listing So does anyone know how to use the addColumnCountLayoutDepend method or any other way to change the number of columns on the product grid specific to the page layout?
