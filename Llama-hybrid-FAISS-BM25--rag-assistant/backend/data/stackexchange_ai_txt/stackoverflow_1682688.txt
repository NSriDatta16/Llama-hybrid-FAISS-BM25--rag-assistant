My experiment shows that rendering order affects performance a lot in TBR architecture, why?

TBR chips perform HSR (hidden surface removal) before fragment processing, so only the visible pixels are rendered. This feature results in no necessary sorting opaque objects from front to back. But I have done a experiment on my iPhone 3GS. By comparing the frame time, rendering opaque objects from front to back is much faster than back to front. Why does it show this result? The performance should be very close when objects are rendered in whichever order.
