I don't perfectly understand the supervised part of the question but it might be useful to note that: the unsupervised classification of documents seems to correspond to the NLP task of topic modeling , a task for which there are good methods and tools available. in the proposed example about football, the polysemy of the target word calls for word sense discrimination . The two tasks and the methods to solve them are quite similar.
