One method of classification of stochastic processes is based on the nature of the time parameter ( discrete or continuous ) and state space ( discrete or continuous ). This leads to four categories of stochastic processes. If the state space of stochastic process is discrete , whether the time parameter is discrete or continuous , the process is usually called a chain . If a stochastic process possesses Markov property , irrespective of the nature of the time parameter(discrete or continuous) and state space(discrete or continuous) , then it is called a Markov process . Hence, we will have four categories of Markov processes. A continuous time parameter , discrete state space stochastic process possessing Markov property is called a continuous parameter Markov chain ( CTMC ) . A discrete time parameter , discrete state space stochastic process possessing Markov property is called a discrete parameter Markov chain( DTMC ) . Similarly, we can have other two Markov processes. Update 2017-03-09: Every independent increment process is a Markov process. Poisson process having the independent increment property is a Markov process with time parameter continuous and state space discrete. Brownian motion process having the independent increment property is a Markov process with continuous time parameter and continuous state space process.
