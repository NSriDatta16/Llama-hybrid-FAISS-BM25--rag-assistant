Your goal is admirable, and I wish you all the best on your trip! Now onto the math... Given your data, you are stuck making month-level prediction. You cannot predict which precise days of the month will have bad weather based on monthly averages, for a number of reasons (e.g. months do not represent fixed seasonal boundaries; averages do not convey day-to-day conditional information). From the monthly averages alone, you can only estimate which months will have bad weather. If you want to determine which month is best to leave during, summation offers a fine quick and dirty solution. Unless you are a lizard, steer clear of Zion in July and August. Any time between November and January should be fine. If you want to get technical, and scale your coefficients so each month is perfectly comparable, you need to determine the conditional probability for each pair of of events (e.g. the probability that it will rain given that it is hot) and then multiply the set of conditional probabilities. You cannot derive the conditional probabilities from the averages, and will need to go back to the raw data. If you are hardcore, you can also compute the conditional probabilities for monthly minimums and maximums to get a sense of how much you can trust your average-based estimates for each month.
