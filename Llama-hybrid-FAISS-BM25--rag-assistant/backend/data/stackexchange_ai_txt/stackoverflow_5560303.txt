Build NuGet package for multiple framework targets from Visual Studio 2010 project file

Internally within my organisation we maintain a code library, some of our applications are built on .NET 4 while older applications are still built on .NET 3.5. We have build configurations that target either the .NET 4 or .NET 3.5 framework and this works as expected. We hit a problem when we want to build NuGet packages that include the output from each build configuration into a single nupkg file (since a NuGet package can support multiple framework targets). Has anybody come up with a solution to automate this scenario?
