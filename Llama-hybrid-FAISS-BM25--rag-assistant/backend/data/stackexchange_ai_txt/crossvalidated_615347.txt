Murtaugh (2007) makes the point that if you have a nested (all samples within a group share the same predictor variables), balanced (all groups are sampled at the same intensity) design and a linear (responses treated as Gaussian) model, then you will get exactly the same inferences at the population level (i.e. about differences between treatment) if you average the samples each group as if you fit a multi-level model (see example below). In this case he recommends averaging because you're less likely to make a mistake in the analysis. However , it is best not to pool if your situation deviates from this case. If your responses are pooled but not balanced you may be able to use weights to fit the aggregated data If your design is not pooled (e.g. a randomized complete block design) but you only have two levels of the treatment you may be able to use a paired $t$ -test to analyze within-block differences (this test is a special case of a LMM estimated via REML) If your responses are non-Gaussian (and you want to handle that by using a GLM rather than by transforming) you should almost certainly be using the multi-level/mixed GLMM If you're interested in quantifying the variability at different levels (between-pond vs. within-pond) then you need the multilevel model For example (the simulation here fits the assumptions of the Gaussian LMM perfectly because that was easiest to do, but Murtaugh's point about the equivalence of pooled vs multilevel linear models holds regardless of the conditional distribution of the data as long as the design is nested and balanced): library(lmerTest) ## simulate data dd $treat pond) |t|) (Intercept) 0.899 0.330 8.000 2.72 0.0262 * treatT 2.260 0.467 8.000 4.84 0.0013 ** --- printCoefmat(coef(summary(mod2)), digits = 3) Estimate Std.
