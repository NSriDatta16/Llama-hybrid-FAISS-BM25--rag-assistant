Defining a 1 to many relationship in Entity Framework

I'm trying to create a 1:m relationship using Entity Framework (.net 4.0) and am getting the following error: App_Code.Model.msl(36,6) : error 3007: Problem in mapping fragments starting at lines 6, 36:Column(s) [ProductId] are being mapped in both fragments to different conceptual side properties. What i have is a Products table, and a Features table. The idea is that Products have many Features. Products each have a ProductId, and the Features have a ProductId foreign key. Now the catch is that the foreign key doesn't exist in sql server, and i don't want it to. If it did, then it all automagically works nicely. In the EDMX designer, i created an association from the product to the feature entity, then edited the mapping details of the ProductFeature association to be based on the Features table, which i think would make it work. Any ideas? Thanks very much.
