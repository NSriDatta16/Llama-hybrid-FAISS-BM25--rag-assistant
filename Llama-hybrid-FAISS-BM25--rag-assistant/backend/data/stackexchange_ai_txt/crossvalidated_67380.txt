What is the initial partition for k-means in R?

My question is probably elementary, and I apologize for that. I am reading Kogan's "Introduction to Clustering Large and High-Dimensional Data"; I am interested in understanding batch K-means and K-means and use it in $\operatorname{R}$. In the textbook it is stated that both algorithms need an initial choice of the number of clusters $K$ An initial partition of the given dataset Using such entries, the algorithms can perform the learning exercise. Kogan states that the initial partition is usually found using a Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning (PDDP) algorithm. Looking at the K-means function kmeans in $\operatorname{R}$ I have noticed the absence of the initial partition as argument of the function itself. One can specify the number of clusters or a set of initial centers. Moreover, the default K-mean algorithm used by kmeans is the one by Hartigan and Wong (1979). Unfortunately I have no access to the original paper, and I could not run through the original code, searching for the initial partition. My questions are: is there an initial partition choice hidden somewhere in kmeans ? If yes, how is it chosen? In absence of initial partition choice, how does kmeans begins to run (a high level overview would be great!)? I thank you all.
