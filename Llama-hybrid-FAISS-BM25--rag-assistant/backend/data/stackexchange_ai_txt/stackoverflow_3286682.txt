Remove periods from the end of markdown paragraphs

I have a bunch of posts written in markdown and I need to remove the periods from the end of every paragraph in each of them The end of a paragraph in markdown is delimited by: 2 or more \n s or The end of the string However, there are these edge cases Ellipses Acroynms (e.g., I don't want to drop the final period in "Notorious B.I.G." when it falls at the end of a paragraph). I think you can deal with this case by saying "don't remove the final period if it's preceded by a capital letter which is itself preceded by another period" Special cases: e.g. , i.e. , etc. Here's a regular expression that matches posts that have offending periods, but it doesn't account for (2) and (3) above: /[^.]\.(\n{2,}|\z)/
