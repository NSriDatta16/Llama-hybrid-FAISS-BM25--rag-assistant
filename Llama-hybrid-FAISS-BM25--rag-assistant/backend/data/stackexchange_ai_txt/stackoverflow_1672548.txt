What about the controller? How can I break this thousand line monster into more organized code. Have a look at CakePHP framework and how it solves the problem of large models, controllers, and numerous views. I find it quite elegant. Complex models can have behaviours . Large controllers can be broken into components . And numerous views are grouped with layouts , while having common bits separated into elements . It might sound complicated and scary at first, but once you try to use it, it really falls into place.
