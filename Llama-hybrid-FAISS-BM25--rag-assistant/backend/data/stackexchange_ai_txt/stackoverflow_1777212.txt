Terrarium-like agent interaction framework

I'm looking for a framework for agent interaction simulation, where I can deploy some agents and let them interact and watch their evolution. Until now I found Terrarium 2.0 ( http://terrarium2.codeplex.com/ ). In principle this is what I need: the ability to create some creature/agent and deploy it into a simulation framework where it will interact with other agents. But it seems that Terrarium is no longer under development. Do you know of any similar frameworks which are worth considering? Thanks.
