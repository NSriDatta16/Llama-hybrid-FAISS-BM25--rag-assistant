How do I find Schwartz criterion (or Bayesian Information Criterion) for these three models?

I have to find the schwarz criterion for each of the models in this maths question using RStudio but I don't know where to start. I know I need to find the free parameters but don't know how to find them or the maximised log likelihoods.Thank you! Question: Sequence are independent. Three models are to be considered. M1. No constraints on p_A, p_C, p_G and p_T other than p_A + p_C + p_G + p_T = 1. M2. Matched C and G, ie p_C = p_G = p (say), p_A and p_T unconstrained, except by 2p + p_A + p_T = 1. M3. Matched C and G and matched A and T, ie p_C = p_G = p and p_A = p_T = q (say), with 2p+ 2q = 1. Estimate p and q and give the Schwarz criterion for each of the three models.
