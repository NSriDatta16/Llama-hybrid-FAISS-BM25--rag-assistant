How does one determine what ARL0 should be used on CPM package to test for Structural Change

I'm trying to find multiple break points by using processStream from CPM package on R. Can someone enlighten me on what is ARL0 how does one determine what ARL0 should be used for? processStream(ret.fin.chn,"Kolmogorov-Smirnov",ARL0=500,lambda=NA) $changePoints [1] 59 75 250 286 443 448 663 1037 1042 1261 1576 1842 1853 2013 2035 2621 2633 $detectionTimes [1] 73 89 285 334 447 503 670 1040 1145 1428 1639 1951 1874 2030 2078 2632 2644 while processStream(ret.fin.chn,"Kolmogorov-Smirnov",ARL0=2000,lambda=NA) $changePoints [1] 59 75 663 1037 1261 1559 1842 2013 2035 2621 2633 $detectionTimes [1] 75 90 691 1041 1480 1688 2026 2032 2266 2633 2646 and processStream(ret.fin.chn,"Kolmogorov-Smirnov",ARL0=3000,lambda=NA) $changePoints [1] 59 75 663 1037 1261 1559 1842 2013 2149 $detectionTimes [1] 75 92 692 1041 1490 1690 2026 2032 2284 Tt seems that different ARL0 will give fewer break point detection, is that a good thing? Note : the time series ret.fin.chn contains 2749 rows. Below are excerpts from R help: ARL0 Determines the ARL_0 which the CPM should have, which corresponds to the average number of observations before a false positive occurs, assuming that the sequence does not undergo a chang. Because the thresholds of the CPM are computationally expensive to estimate, the package contains pre-computed values of the thresholds corresponding to several common values of the ARL_0 . This means that only certain values for the ARL_0 are allowed. Specifically, the ARL_0 must have one of the following values: 370, 500, 600, 700, ..., 1000, 2000, 3000, ..., 10000, 20000, ..., 50000
