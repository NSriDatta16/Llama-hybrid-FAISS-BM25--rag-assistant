fit a logistic regression first calculate the probability of zeroes, and then I could remove all the zeroes, and then fit a regular regression using my choice of distribution (poisson e.g.) You're absolutely right. This is one way to fit a zero-inflated model (or as Achim Zeileis points out in the comments, this is strictly a "hurdle model", which one could view as a special case of a zero-inflated model). The difference between the procedure you described and an "all-in-one" zero-inflated model is error propagation. Like all other two-step procedures in statistics, the overall uncertainty of your predictions in step 2 won't take into account the uncertainty as to whether the prediction should be 0 or not. Sometimes this is a necessary evil. Fortunately, it's not necessary in this case. In R, you can use pscl::hurdle() or fitdistrplus::fitdist() .
