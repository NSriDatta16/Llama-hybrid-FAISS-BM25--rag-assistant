Here's an example that I think some may find surprising: In logistic regression, for any finite sample size with non-deterministic outcomes (i.e. $0 This is because for any finite sample size, there is a positive probability (albeit very small if the number of samples is large compared with the number of regression parameters) of getting perfect separation of outcomes. When this happens, estimated regression coefficients will be either $-\infty$ or $\infty$. Having positive probability of being either $-\infty$ or $\infty$ implies the expected value is undefined. For more on this particular issue, see the Hauck-Donner-effect .
