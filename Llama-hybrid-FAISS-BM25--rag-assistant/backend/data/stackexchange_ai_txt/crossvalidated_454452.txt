This can be discussed without getting technical using a simple example. Let's say we have an estimator to estimate the maximum value of a population. (This estimator is biased but consistent, but let's not even get into the technical discussion of bias vs. consistency.). Now, consider the following case: You have a population of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Which of the following methods would give you a better estimate of the population's true maximum? Collect one large sample of n = 10. Then, find max. Collect two smaller samples of n = 5. Find max for each sample. Then, calculate the average. Method #1 would give you a sample of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and an estimated max of 10. Method #2 would give you different estimates depending on the observations you have for each sample. One example might be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Your estimate would then be (5 + 10) / 2 = 7.5. Sure, this example is oversimplified in some sense. But it clearly demonstrates the potential difference between one large sample vs. multiple small samples when you have a biased but consistent estimator.
