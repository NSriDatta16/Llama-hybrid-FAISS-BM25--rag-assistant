This is the part of your post that concerns me: I don't want to add a custom route to every single controller subclass which uses this action. The rails community is rightly getting more and more careful about not over-defining needless routes. It's getting more common to see things like this: map.resources :comments, :only => [:new, :create] In the above example, only the new and create routes are generated. It's better security, and cleaner routing. While I'm not directly answering your question of how to make a new route available to every resource, I'm saying that rails best practices would discourage it. Add the custom route only to the resources that will actually use it.
