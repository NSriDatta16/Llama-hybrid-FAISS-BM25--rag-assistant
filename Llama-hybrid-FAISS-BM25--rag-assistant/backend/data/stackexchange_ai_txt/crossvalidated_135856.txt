Perceptrons and Decision Boundaries

I am currently studying neural networks and have been trying to reason about this for a while to no avail. I understand that given a perceptron(such as above) with f as a step function, any decision boundaries learnt must be a hyperplane. However, I'm having some difficulty seeing why this should hold true when f is something else like a sigmoid or logistic function such as below: Can someone show me how to mathematically reach this conclusion?
