Magento ECG gave me a good solution in the Magento forums: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/226496/ Quoting them: One of the solutions to set and get debug flag in your module is to add it to config.xml in your moduleâ€™s etc directory. You can add it to section . So your section will look like: 1 And from the code you can get this: $debugFlag = Mage::getStoreConfig('your_module/debug'); And what I'm going to do is put the same XML block in my local.xml file. That way it only kicks in on my development machine and does not get published with my Magento extension (as does the extension's own config.xml)
