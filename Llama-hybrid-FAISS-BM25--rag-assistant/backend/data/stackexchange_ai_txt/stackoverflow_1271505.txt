First thought is a sub-query grabbing the record immediately previous: SELECT timestamp - (select top 1 timestamp from Table T1 where T1.Id Then you can take the average of that: SELECT AVG(delta) from (SELECT timestamp - (select top 1 timestamp from Table T1 where T1.Id There will probably need to be some handling of the null that results for the first row, but I haven't tested to be sure.
