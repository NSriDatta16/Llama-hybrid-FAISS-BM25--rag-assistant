When you push a view controller onto a navigation controller, the navigation controller retains the view controller. And when that view controller is popped, the navigation controller releases it. UISearchDisplayController appears to be trying to see if your view controllers responds to a selector, and since it's calling from _destroyManagedTableView, I'm guessing the selector is searchDisplayController:willUnloadSearchResultsTableView: (your view controller is the search display controller's delegate, correct?). @robert - that example must be wrong, because pushViewController does retain its argument. All the other examples on the page either autorelease immediately after init, or release after pushing.
