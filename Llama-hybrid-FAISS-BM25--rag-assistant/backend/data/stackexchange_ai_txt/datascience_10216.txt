Doc2Vec - How to label the paragraphs (gensim)

I am wondering how to label (tag) sentences / paragraphs / documents with doc2vec in gensim - from a practical standpoint. Do you need to have each sentence / paragraph / document with its own unique label (e.g. "Sent_123")? This seems useful if you want to say "what words or sentences are most similar to a single specific sentence labeled "Sent_123". Can you have the labels be repeated based on content? For example if each sentence / paragraph / document is about a certain product item (and there are multiple sentence / paragraph / document for a given product item) can you label the sentences based on the item and then compute the similarity between a word or a sentence and this label (which I guess would be like an average of all those sentences that had to do with the product item)?
