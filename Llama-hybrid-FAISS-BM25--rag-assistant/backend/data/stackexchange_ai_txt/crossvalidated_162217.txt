They're still called "zero-inflated" models when modifying continuous distributions; there's zero-inflated gamma , zero-inflated lognormal, and so on. For continuous proportions such as you describe, a zero-inflated beta model might be used (though it's not the only possibility, it's probably the most common by some distance). If 100% coverage in that predefined part is possible, you might instead use 0-1 inflated beta models (sometimes called 0-and-1 inflated beta models; the search above finds some links for these as well), or if some other density between 0 and 1 is more suitable, some other form of 0-1-inflated continuous model.
