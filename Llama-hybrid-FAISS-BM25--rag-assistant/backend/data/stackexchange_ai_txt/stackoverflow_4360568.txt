Allow users to upload a pic for their profile

Oddly enough, I can't find any info on this topic: user profile pictures. Is there a PHP solution for the following? Allows users to upload a pic from their hard drive for storage on our server Shrinks the image if it's too big; expands it if it's too small (height/width) Is this easy to build yourself? Or is there already a library for it?
