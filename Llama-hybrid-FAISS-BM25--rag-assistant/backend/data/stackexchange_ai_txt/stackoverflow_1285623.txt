Manhattan layout algorithm

I am looking for any of the following (in order of preference): A Manhattan layout EdgeRenderer for prefuse . A Manhattan layout for prefuse. An algorithm to produce Manhattan layouts for hierarchical, directed acyclic graphs. An organizational chart implementation. Sample implementations include: NodeLinkTreeLayout (for prefuse) is close, but edge style is not orthogonal. Easy Graph for Perl Graphical JavaScript Tree Do you know where to find something along those lines?
