@Katie: Does your code even compile? Your calcAverage(avg); function call is different from how you have defined it. Did you forget to add code for an overloaded function with the (same name) signature calcAverage(double )??? BTW, remove the semicolon after the while() and it might run fine. Try this after you check my question above.
