As a convention you could maintain a document detailing all the filesystem directories and corresponding URLs that are created. This will ansewr quetsions of file>URL and URL->file mappings, and is also useful for planning, resource management and security reviews. What follows is food for thought rather than any serious proposal. My "proper" answer is to use good documentation. However... An automated approach might be possible. Thinking freely (not necessarily practically!) you could find/create an Apache module/jetty extension to add a small virtual file to each web directory as it is served from the filesystem. The contents of that virtual file would contain the location of the directory on the server the files are served from as well as maybe internal server name, IP or other details to help bridge the gap from what you see on the web side and where it is in your intranet. Mapping files to URLs is tricky. You might be able to automate it by scanning the http access logs, which is configured with a custom logger that logs an entry when a file is served. By scanning the URL accessed and corresponding file served, you can map files back to URLs. (You also get the URL->file mapping, in case you don't want to manually browse the URL as I outlined in the paragraph above.)
