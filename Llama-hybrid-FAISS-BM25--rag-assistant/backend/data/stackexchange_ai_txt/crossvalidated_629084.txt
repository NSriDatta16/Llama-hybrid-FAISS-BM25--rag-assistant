Predicting a variable from categorical time series input that is unevenly spaced and of unequal length

I would like to predict the value of some variable $x$ at time $t$ based on the evolution of the state of the system in the time interval $(t-T,t]$ . The system can be in any number of states in the interval $(t-T,t]$ and the time spent in each state is variable. Consider the following simple example. A machine can be in the following states: producing, idle or being cleaned. The quality of products is denoted by $x$ . We are interested in the quality of the product finished at time $t$ . Let's fix $T = 10$ minutes. The machine has been producing from $(t-10,t-5]$ , idle from $(t-5,t-2.21]$ , being cleaned from $(t-2.21, t-1]$ and finally producing from $t-1$ onwards. I'm not sure where to start with creating a prediction model that can handle such strange time series as input. Should I instead created a fixed-length time series where I sample the state every second? Does anyone have references that I could look into?
