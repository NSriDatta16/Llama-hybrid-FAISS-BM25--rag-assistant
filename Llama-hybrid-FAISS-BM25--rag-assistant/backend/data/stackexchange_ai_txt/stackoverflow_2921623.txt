Subversion being centralized, you can organize your projects within one repo as you want. Since branchbes are emulated as directory with SVN, you end up mixing: history isolation (which is the main purpose of a branch : you isolate the versions of a set of files from other versions from the same set of files) "component" isolation (a component or module being a group of files each in their own directory) But with a DVCS , each repository is its own component (or module). I.e. you don't want to put all your projects within one repo. Rather you are using submodules (Git) or subrepos (Hg) . That leaves you with the branch as a pure history isolation: Whe you branch, the history of the all repo creates a new branch ready to record (reference) any new commit you will make. The is no "cheap copy", just a new pointer made. Note: Mercurial has a more complex branching model which can involve cloning a repo to create a new branch, but the general principle behind branching stands.
