Yes, you can do this; this is called an ARMA model (Autoregressive moving average). However, you should make sure to use a good package for time series modeling that includes ARMA models (like R's forecast package), rather than just trying to do this yourself by hand. Otherwise, there's a good chance that any statistics you calculate (like standard errors or confidence intervals) will be incorrect.
