I did something very similar for an open-source disaster software package. In this case, lets assume I selected "Fire" in my dropdown menu and this triggers addFire(). The listener on the markers will delete the point on a click or allow you to drag it. The map can only have one listener at a time, but each marker can still have its own listener at the same time. Here is the code that worked on Chrome, Firefox and IE8: //This function sets up the map for adding a fire icon function addFire() { //Kill old listener if(listening) google.maps.event.removeListener(listenerhandle); //Start new listener listenerhandle = google.maps.event.addListener(disasterMap, 'click', addFirePoint); listening = true; }//end addFire //This function adds new fire points to the map and controls dragging and clicking function addFirePoint(event) { //Create the marker var fireMarker = new google.maps.Marker({ icon: "./mapimgs/fire.png", position: event.latLng, map: disasterMap, draggable: true }); newFireMarkers.push(fireMarker); fireMarker.setTitle("Fire"); //Listen for clicks on the new marker google.maps.event.addListener(fireMarker, 'click', function() { fireMarker.setMap(null); //remove the marker from the array for(i=0;i
