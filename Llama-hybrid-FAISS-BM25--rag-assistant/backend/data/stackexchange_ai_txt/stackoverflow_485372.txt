I have just had a look at doctest, it is indeed brilliant. So is the ease of use approach of the Python language. For C++ however, you probably won't find such a tool. If one of the tests fails you might want to debug what happens. It wouldn't be that easy having the source of the test case been generated from comments. Instead, in the existing unit test frameworks for C++ you have the source of the tests with a special syntax, which is compiled and is easy to debug. Also, the generation of the source from comments would be another extra (pre-)compilation step, which would just make life harder. You should accept that coding in C++ is not as a quick job as it is in Python, so the unit testing is similarly somewhat more difficult. On the other hand you have more tools, you can put static assertions for type relationships, for example, which is impossible in Python. So briefly I think the analogue of the Python doctest for C++ would have so many drawbacks compared to the existing tools, that nobody began to implement it. If you really believe that it can be better than the existing tools, please provide some examples. I hardly believe that there are real life cases where it can be more usable.
