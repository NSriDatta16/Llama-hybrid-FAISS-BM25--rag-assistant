Robert Cain (www.arcanecode.com) presented a great session at SQL Saturday #25 in Gainesville, GA this past Saturday. His presentation link: Full Text Searching [Robert, I if you see this, I hope you don't mind the re-post, but you've got the clearest explanation of how full text searching works that I've seen.] Anyway, my understanding from listening to Robert speak this weekend is that the Full Text Index will only update when the server has some resources to spare. In short, it's a lower-priority process than you might be expecting if your server is getting hit hard.
