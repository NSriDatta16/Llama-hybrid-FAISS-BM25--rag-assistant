prove that SVM chooses the bisecting line of nearest support vectors?

I have trouble solving the problem 3.18 from "pattern recognition" by "Sergios Theodoridis, â€ŽKonstantinos Koutroumbas" the problem is : Show that for the case of two linearly separable classes the hyperplane obtained as the SVM solution is the same as that bisecting the segment joining two closest points between the convex hulls of the classes. thank you all
