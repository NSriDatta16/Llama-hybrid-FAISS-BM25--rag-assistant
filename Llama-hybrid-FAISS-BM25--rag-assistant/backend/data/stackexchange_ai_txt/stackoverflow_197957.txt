Forms and no Cookies - elegant way to submit forms

Hoi! I have a form I wish to submit, but I need to add the PHPSESSID, because some clients allow no cookies. There are several javascript functions on my page which displays a list of users (search, sort, open details), the page is generated by PHP. Now I am looking for an elegant way to have the PHPSESSID included in every submit of my form - this needs to be done on several pages, so I hope for an easy solution. Adding the PHPSESSID to the action or into a hidden field does not work properly. Or is this problem located elsewhere? It could be the client is behind a too restrictive firewall or something. Any ideas (especially with solutions ;-) ) in that direction are also welcome! Example code (extremely simplified): [...some formfields and stuff..] //one example function, there are several on my page function next_page() { //set some hidden field to get the next page document.forms[0].submit(); } Thanks in advance! Bye, Basty [EDIT] session.use_trans_sid is set to true
