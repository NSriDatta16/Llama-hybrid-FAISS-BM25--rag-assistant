I'm performing necromancy here and the answer is already accepted, but maybe somebody will benefit from it... Use one of these merge fields on your Visualforce page / S-Control: {!$Api.Enterprise_Server_URL_180}, {!$Api.Partner_Server_URL_180}, {!$Api.Session_ID} You can easily parse out organization ID out of them. In Apex code: UserInfo.getOrganisationId()
