Entity Framework 4: Is it possible to set up Table-per-hierarchy inheritence from scratch?

I've just started playing with EF4, having used NHibernate since about v0.6. I'm trying out the model-first approach. I've got an abstract base class with two subclasses that I want to persist with the TPH strategy, but this doesn't seem to be possible through the designer as there doesn't seem to be a way to set up the storage model and mappings in the way I think it should be. I seem to have the following options: Edit the storage model in the .edmx by hand. Let it generate the schema using TPT, fix that and then update the model and fix up the mappings. Am I missing something obvious, or should I just revert to db-first and/or hope that the Code-first stuff gets a proper release soon.
