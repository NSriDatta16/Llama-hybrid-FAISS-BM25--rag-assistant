You should try Gems like Hpricot ( wiki ) or Nokogiri . Hpricot example: require 'open-uri' require 'rubygems' require 'hpricot' html = Hpricot(open(an_url).read) # This would search for any images inside a paragraph (XPath) html.search('/html/body//p//img') # This would search for any images with the class "test" (CSS selector) html.search('img.test') Nokogiri example: require 'open-uri' require 'rubygems' require 'hpricot' html = Nokogiri::HTML(open(an_url).read) # This would search for any images inside a paragraph (XPath) html.xpath('/html/body//p//img') # This would search for any images with the class "test" (CSS selector) html.css('img.test') Nokogiri is generally faster. Both libraries feature a lot of functionality.
