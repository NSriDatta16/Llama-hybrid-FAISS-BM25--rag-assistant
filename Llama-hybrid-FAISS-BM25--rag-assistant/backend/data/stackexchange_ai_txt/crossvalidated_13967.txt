NLTK is free and reasonably easy to use, though it does require installing Python. It comes with a wide range of text data sets. There's an O'Reilly book for it, which is a help for students. WEKA is general machine learning software with a nice interface. There's some text classification datasets for it, though not the range of text mining datasets there is for NLTK. There's a book for WEKA too.
