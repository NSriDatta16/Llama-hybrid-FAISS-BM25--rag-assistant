I suspect that it is working but that you are "zoomed in" over the ocean - hence the blue screen. Unfortunately the MapsDemo doesn't have the zoom widget enabled by default so this is hard to see. Try add the zoom widget, as follows, and then zoom out to a higher altitude. NB the widget only appears when you pan the map (ie drag on the map to make the widget appear, after adding this code). Give the mapview and ID so you can access it in code - ie in res/layout/mapview.xml: Enable the zoom widget in code - ie in src/com.example.android.apis/view/MapViewDemo.java: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.mapview); MapView mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapview); mapView.setBuiltInZoomControls(true); }
