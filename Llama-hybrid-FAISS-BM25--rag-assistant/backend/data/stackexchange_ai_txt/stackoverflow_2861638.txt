I agree with the other answers. For completeness sake, sometimes I find a way to generalize the class name a bit more. I understand your example was just an example, but one way to do it would be: public class Person { // Stuff here } public class OtherClass { private Person ProjectManager { get; set; } } This helps make it a bit more readable. But it is perfectly acceptable (and even encouraged) to have identical class name and property.
