Time series LOESS prediction performs better on aggregate data?

I'm using the stl function in R ( https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/stl.html ) that uses loess to decompose time series and make predictions. When the time unit is one month, the error is about 30%. However when I sum over 12 months, (and compare to the actual sum of the variable I'm trying to predict), the error drops to 4%. My question is: is this a realistic result? My knowledge of variance, and variance of a sum seems to suggest that the error should be higher when tested on the sum over 12 months.
