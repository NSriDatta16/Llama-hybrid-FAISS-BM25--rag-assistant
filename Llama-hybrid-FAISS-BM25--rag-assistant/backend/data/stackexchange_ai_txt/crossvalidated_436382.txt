From your comment... I mean how can I find out these variables first change significantly between pre and post treatment Because you measure them before and after, you can take the difference between the $p_i$ in the pre and post measurements and then build a model. If the $p$ are continuous then a linear regression might be fine. You will want to look at the intercept of this model to see the average change in the $p$ conditioned on the covariates. and second if I can associate then with the survival. If I am not mistaken, you don't know the post $p$ before you know if they survive, right?
