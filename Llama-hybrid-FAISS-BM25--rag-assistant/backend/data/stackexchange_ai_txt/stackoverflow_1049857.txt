If you're dealing with NULL values there are some functions that specialize in them which are worth knowing. ISNULL() COALESCE() NULLIF() NULLIF() might be the one you're looking for. It basically takes two params. It returns the first param unless it is NULL, otherwise it returns the second. Here's what I approximate your code would be: select records.id, contacts.name + ISNULL(' (' + contacts.organization + ')', '') as contact, from records left join contacts on records.contact = contacts.contactid Most NULL-related functions can be replaced by a larger CASE statement. CASE is your more general tool. But using specific functions will make your code cleaner, or at least more terse.
