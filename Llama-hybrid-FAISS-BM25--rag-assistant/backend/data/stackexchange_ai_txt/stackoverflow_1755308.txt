If you forego any validity checking you could do it with something as simple as: file_put_contents($theCounterFile, file_get_contents($theCounterFile)+1); Addition: There's talk about concurrency in this thread and it should be noted that it is a good idea to use a database and transactions to deal with concurrency, I'd highly recommend against writing a bunch of plumbing code to do this in a file. If you've ever had, or think you might ever have two requests for the resource in the same second you should look into PDO with mysql , or PDO with SQLite instead of a file, use transactions (and InnoDB or better if you're going for mysql). But really, even if you get two requests in the same microsecond (highly unlikely), chances of locking the file are slim as it will not be kept open and the two requests will probably not be handled parallel enough to lock anyway. Reality check: how many hits on the same resource do you get on average in the same minute?...
