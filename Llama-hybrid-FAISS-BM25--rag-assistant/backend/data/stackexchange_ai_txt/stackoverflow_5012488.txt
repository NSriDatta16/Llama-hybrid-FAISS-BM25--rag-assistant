How to calculate "Friday before" in Java or Groovy?

I need to be able to calculate the "Friday before" today in Java or Groovy. For example, if today is Monday, February 21, the "Friday before" would be Friday, February 18. And if today was Tuesday, February 1, the "Friday before" would be Friday, January 28. What would be the best way to do this? What existing classes can I most effectively leverage?
