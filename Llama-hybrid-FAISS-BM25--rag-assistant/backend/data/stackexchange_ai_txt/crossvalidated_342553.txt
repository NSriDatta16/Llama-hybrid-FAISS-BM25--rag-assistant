Image normalization for object detection

I am training object detector using CNN. I have read lot of articles, that images should be normalized using (img-img.mean)/img.standardDeviation However, is this really neccesserry? Using this the images become really confusing and its hard to see objects i am trying do detect. Also is it recommended to just normalize data and traing net on these datas, or add normal data to this normalized data?
