Problem seems to have been caused by some of the extra library jars i was loading along with the main application jar (allthough all were signed the same). What i forgot to mention in the original question is that the jars were being served each by a php script, not directly from an url to their location on the server. I is still not clear why the issue occured (system has been working like this perfectly for months). I think some issues with security checking in the newer java webstart versions might have triggered it. Linking all the library jars directly in the jnlp and leaving only the main application jar to be served via php script (needed to restrict access to it for clients only), solved the problem. Thank you all for your replies.
