Kaplan-Meier plots as feature selection method?

Can Kaplan-Meier plots be used for feature selection when building a multivariable survival model (e.g. Cox PH)? Would a visual assessment (no separation/crossing curves) suffice or would it have to be based on something more formal like log-rank test? I'm in a situation where I have access to very large amounts of clinical data and I know that most of it has some relevance in predicting my outcome of interest. I will be using PCA to remove collinearity and reduce the number of featuresâ€”but am limited in the model I can use to an extension of the Cox proportional hazards model (my outcome is interval-censored...). Can I use the outputs of a Kaplan Meier plot to decide if a variable is worth including or not? Or is it just as misguided as when multiple regression models are built using features that give p values
