If all you need is checking if A is one of B's contacts, then Set is choice. It has contains() for that purpose. Otherwise, the most suitable might be Map, as you need efficient retrieval operation. You said currently you use same object as key and value, but I'm not sure how you get the the key in the first place. Say you'd like to get contact A from B's contacts, and you use something like 'B.contacts.get(A)', where do you get A from? If you already have A, what's for to get it from the map again? (maybe there are multiple instances of the same person?) Unless there are multiple instances of the same person, I'd say for each Person, define a ID like unique attribute, and use that as the key for the contacts map. Also, do you define equal()/hashCode() for person class? Map/Set uses hashCode() and equal() for finding the match. Depending on your usage, you might need to consider rewrite them for efficiency.
