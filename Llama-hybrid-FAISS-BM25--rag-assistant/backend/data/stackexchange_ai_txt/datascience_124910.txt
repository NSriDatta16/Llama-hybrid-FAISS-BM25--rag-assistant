Number of feature extraction layers in CNN

In a course I took about machine learning, we normally used about 2 feature extraction layers for image classification tasks, using MNIST or CIFAR datasets for example. However, when checking an example on Keras website, there are a lot more layers for feature extraction ( model visible here ): I have no idea how one can come up with such a network architecture. Question(s) How do we find such model except empirically? Do all these layers actually improve the classification or is this done only for the example of how to build the model?
