Saving to Core Data with NSMutableArray

Been having a bit of a headache with this one and was wondering if someone could offer some advice! Im implementing persistent storage with Core Data. I have two Entities Car and Driver. A car can have many drivers. In one view i am collecting the drivers and storing them to a NSMutableArray This array is getting passed to another view and at some point i will be saving it against a Car What i would like to do is save each driver from the array in a seperate row in the table of drivers (Just their name (NSString) which will be assigned to a Car. I can create an entry in the database for Car but am struggling with saving each driver in a seperate row in the driver table assigned to that car. Any suggestions or pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated! Cheers :)
