Significant interaction when only one of the two main effects is significant?

I have run a mixed effect logistic regression model, and I have obtained a significant main effect of Factor A, while no significant main effect of Factor B. However, the interaction between Factor A and Factor B is significant. Is this possible? Both of the factors have two levels; let us call them X and Y for Factor A, and W and Z for Factor B. On a descriptive level, the score (dependent variable) increases when Factor A assumes the level X rather than when it assumes the level Y. Additionally, the score increases when Factor A assumes the level Y and Factor B level W if compared to the case in which Factor A assumes the level Y and Factor B the level Z. Instead, when Factor A assumes the level X, there seem to be no difference due to the level assumed by Factor B. Does the result of the logistic regression model make sense? I also have an additional question. I have performed an Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II Wald chisquare tests) [car::Anova(model)], and Factor B here appears to be significant as a main effect. Is this possible? I am sorry for these maybe stupid questions, but I am very new to the world of statistics.
