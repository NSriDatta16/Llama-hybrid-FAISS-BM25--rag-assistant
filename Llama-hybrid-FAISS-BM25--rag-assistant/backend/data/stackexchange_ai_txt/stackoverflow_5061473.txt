javascript creating an object for my game OOP

I'm looking for some examples or sample code for properly organizing my code for my game. I have a game: var gameStructure = function () { this.playerLife = 100; } How do I create new game instances (since multiple games will be going on?) var gameInstance = new gameStructure(); And how do I format the code for game actions? var attackPlayer = function (damage) { this.playerLife = this.playerLife - damage; } gameInstance.attackPlayer(50); This is not real code, I'm sure this is all wrong and not how you're supposed to do javascript code at all. One thing I'm confused on is how to create multiple gameInstances. I don't know how to set variables as variables. I mean I need: var gameInstance1 gameInstance2 etc, based on how many games players are in. Right now I'm actually storing game instances in an array. So I have: var gameInstances = [], gameid var createNewGame = function () { gameInstances.push(gameInstanceName); gameid = gameInstances.indexOf(gameInstanceName); } and then i reference my game instance object by gameInstances[gameid]. Is there OK to do or is that inadvisable and I should use OOP with instantiation with the new keyword. Thanks and please advised!
