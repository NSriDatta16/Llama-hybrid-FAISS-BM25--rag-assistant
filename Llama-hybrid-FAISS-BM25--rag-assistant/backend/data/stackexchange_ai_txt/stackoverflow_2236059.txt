The cons of using elements to indicate line-breaks (and therefore not using elements to indicate paragraphs) is that you're limiting your scope of CSS control over the document. It's much easier to manage many elements of text, than text interspersed with s in one element via CSS. Whenever I put together am HTML document, I use to indicate a 'soft' break. (As above: rather use margins on elements to show paragraphs.) to indicate the division of two sections of the document, e.g. between the header and navigation, or navigation and content. When a browser without CSS support views the document, a clear divide is visible. I then hide the s via the CSS.
