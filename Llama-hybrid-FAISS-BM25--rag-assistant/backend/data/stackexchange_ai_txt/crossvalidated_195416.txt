One of my "favorites", meaning that it's what drives me crazy about the interpretation of many studies (and often by the authors themselves, not just the media) is that of Survivorship Bias . One way to imagine it is suppose there's some effect that is very detrimental to the subjects, so much so that it has a very good chance of killing them. If subjects are exposed to this effect before the study , then by the time study begins, the exposed subjects that are still alive have a very high probability of having being unusually resilient. Literally natural selection at work. When this happens, the study will observe that exposed subjects are unusually healthy (since all the unhealthy ones already died or made sure to stop being exposed to the effect).This is often misinterpreted as implying that exposure is actually good for the subjects. This is a result of ignoring truncation (i.e. ignoring the subjects who died and did not make it to the study). Similarly, subjects who stop being exposed to the effect during the study are often incredibly unhealthy: this is because they have realized that continued exposure will probably kill them. But the study merely observes that those who quit are very unhealthy! @Charlie's answer about the WWII bombers can be thought of as an example of this, but there's plenty of modern examples too. A recent example are the studies reporting that drinking 8+ cups of coffee a day (!!) is linked to much higher heart health in subjects over 55 years of age. Plenty of people with PhD's interpreted this as "drinking coffee is good for your heart!", including the authors of the study. I read this as you have to have an incredibly healthy heart to be still drinking 8 cups of coffee a day after 55 years of age and not have a heart attack. Even if it doesn't kill you, the moment something looks worrisome about your health, everyone that loves you (plus your doctor) will immediately encourage you to stop drinking coffee. Further studies found that drinking so much coffee had no beneficial effects in younger groups, which I believe is more evidence that we are seeing a survivorship effect, rather than a positive causal effect. Yet there's plenty of PhD's running around saying "Science says drinking 8+ cups of coffee is good for seniors!"
