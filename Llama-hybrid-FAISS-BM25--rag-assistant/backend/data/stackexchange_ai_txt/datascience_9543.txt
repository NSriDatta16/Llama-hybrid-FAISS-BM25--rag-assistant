There are several ways to make this big number trainable: Use CNNs Auto-Encoders (see Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks ) Dimensionality reduction of the input Scale the image down PCA / LDA Troll-Answer If you really meant "only a few neurons" then you might want to have a look at Spiking neural networks . Those are incredibly computationally intensive, need a lot of hand-crafting and still get worse performance than normal neural networks for most tasks ... but you only need very little of them.
