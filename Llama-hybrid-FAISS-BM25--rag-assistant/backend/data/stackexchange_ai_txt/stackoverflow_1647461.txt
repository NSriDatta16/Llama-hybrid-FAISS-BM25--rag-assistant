If such a thing existed... There would be standards based on the results. If anywhere close to 50% of shops actually used Scrum or RUP or anything , there would be an applicable standards organization pounding out the details. We'd all be told specifically what to do based on the results. Our lawyers and accountants would ask why we're using a methodology only used by 15% and not a methodology used by 28%. We'd have to contend with armchair generals quoting the results at us. There would be products for sale based on the results. "Supporting the most popular methodology." "One of the most popular methodologies." "Trouble-tickets for the fastest growing methodology." You'd see advertising that quoted the results and claiming specific quantitative benefits. "28% of organizations use our version of Scrum with improved on-time delivery." Ever see any advertising or standards based on adoption of a methodology? Anything? Such quantitative studies probably don't exist. Also, a precondition for counting is definition. Can you define Scrum in a way that it's somehow different from XP? I doubt it. I think this kind of data cannot possibly exist. It requires far more formality and standardization than are even remotely possible for something so complex as software development.
