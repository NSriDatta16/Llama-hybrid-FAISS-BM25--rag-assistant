I use a program called ImageMagick to convert my 200MB PDF files to JPG. At the end of the lengthy process it serializes all of the files in numerical order... So basically the file creation date increases in value slightly as each file is being written to the hard drive. Thus either of the following two batch file commands will write the files in the 'correct' order: dir *.jpg /ODN /B > files.txt for /f "tokens=*" %%a in ('dir *.jpg /ODN /B') do ( echo ^ %%a^ >>pages.xml.fragment ) Thus the dir *.jpg /OD command orders the directory content by ascending (creation?) date, and we can completely ignore the actual file name.
