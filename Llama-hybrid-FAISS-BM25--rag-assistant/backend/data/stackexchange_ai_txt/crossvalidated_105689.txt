Combine results with different veracity

I have 3 neural networks processing 3 different vectors of values. Each NN processes a sample of it's vector and gives binary result (y/n) that is correct with given probability. All 3 NNs give answer to the same question. The task is to combine this results into single one (y/n) and figure out probability that it is correct. What methods can you suggest for this task? Thanks in advance.
