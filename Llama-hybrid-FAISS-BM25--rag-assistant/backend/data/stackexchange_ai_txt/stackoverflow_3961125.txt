Java Android App - Simple AI for Texas Hold'em

Could anyone point me in the right direction on this. I have 20+ weeks to design and code a Texas Hold'em Poker Game in Java for an Android phone for a University Project. It should include AI opponents that play with you or just against themselves. They should be able to learn what strategies work best over a period of time, conservative, bluffing etc. I am in my final year and I don't want to make this too complex, I just need a simple, easy but effective AI system that can be played on a small device and be reasonably challenging. I have looked at a lot of theories and articles written about the possibilities that are available (including the University of Alberta), but I don't intend to have a world beating AI, just a simple one. And once that's out the way I can concentrate on the game gui quicker :). Any ideas? Thanks in advance for any feedback!
