The best business case for ReSharper has to do more with the ability for it, when coupled with StyleCop Add-In (free), to allow a small team of developers to quickly create consistent, coherent, standards-based, maintainable code. Until it was introduced in our organization we had nothing but numerous stylistic approaches, not to mention the defects, bugs and other problems ReSharper helped us identify and correct. It is quite simply the best VS Add-In I've ever encountered. As an aside, you should pick up GhostDoc (free VS Add-In) as well. It makes documenting your code much easier as well. These two tools together are invaluable.
