When Firebug says "Failed to load source" it means there is no data to display, typically during a 302 redirect. In a redirection only headers are sent and no body. This matches what you are experiencing. Secondly your URL contains admin/modulename/adminhtml_index/actionname which has four parts. In Magento there should only be three parts like "router/controller/action", which part is extra in yours? When you have the right action firing don't call $this->loadLayout()->renderLayout() because that would, um, load the layout. To output any other content use: $this->getResponse()->setBody($content);
