Jquery Date picker: Select one date, automatically update second field

I'm using the jQuery Date Picker plugin by Kelvin Luck ( http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/datePicker/v2/demo/ ) and need to do the following, maybe somebody can help me: On a website for travel insurance I have two date fields, one for a start date and one for an end date. There's also a third field (a select) that selects plans, each with a different coverage, in a number of days. The idea would be that if you select a plan for, for example, 15 days, and a start date of X, the second date field would be magically populated with a date of X + 15 days. Thing is, my JavaScript knowledge is not what you would call advanced. Anybody has some experience with the plugin, or could at least give me some pointers? Thanks a lot.
