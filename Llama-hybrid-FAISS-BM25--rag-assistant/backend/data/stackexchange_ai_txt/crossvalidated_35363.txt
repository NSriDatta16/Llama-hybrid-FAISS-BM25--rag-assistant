I would like to bring to your attention, Parallel Coordinates: Visual Multidimensional Geometry and Its Applications , which contains the latest breakthroughs and applications in the field. The book was praised by Stephen Hawking among others. Surfaces are described (using duality) by their normal vectors at its points. It contains applications to Air Traffic Control (Automatic Collision Avoidance -- 3 USA Patents), Multivariate Data Mining (on real datasets some with hundreds of variables), Multiobjective Optimization, Process Control, Intensive Care Smart Displays, Security, Network visualization and recently Big Data.
