You can't - at least in the current form. There is no Average overload available that works on completely generic values (i.e. for all types C as you specified). Average needs lists of numbers ( int , double , float ...) or a conversion function that produces numbers. In the current form, you could call Calculator and it would make absolutely no sense to compute the average of strings. You'll just have to restrict the method to a specific numeric type (or provide overloads), but generics simply won't work.
