High performance product catalog in asp.net?

I am planning a high performance e-commerce project in asp.net and need help in selecting the optimal data retrieval model for the product catalog. Some details, products in 10-20 categories 1000-5000 products in every category products listed with name, price, brand and image, 15-40 on every page products needs to be listed without table-tags product info in 2-4 tables that will be joined together (product images not stored in db) webserver and sql database on different hardware ms sql 2005 on shared db-server (pretty bad performance to start with...) enable users to search products combining different criteria such as pricerange, brand, with/without image. My questions are, what technique shall I use to retrieve the products? what technique shall I use to present the products? what cache strategy do you recomend? how do I solve filtering, sortering, pageing in the most efficient way? do you have any recomendations for more reading on this subject? Thanks in advance!
