I'd recommend the classic Numerical Ecology, Legendre & Legendre; Numerical Ecology with R., Borcard et al. available for free download ; Analysis of Ecological Communities, McCune and Grace; vignettes for packages used in your specific field (eg Zhao's gap ). Considering that diversity is a community-level property, I'd encourage you to look at community ecology lit, not just population level. Once you decide on the models you want to use, there are more theme-specific texts out there, and not necessarily from ecology or genetics.
