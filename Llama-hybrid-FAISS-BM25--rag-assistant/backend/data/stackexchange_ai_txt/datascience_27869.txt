You pose an interesting question. The problem that I see is that even if you develop all the items you mentioned (and I'm not sure you need all of them) you wouldn't have the computing power needed for this. You see, most of these items are based on reinforcement learning. Which means that the models are given a relatively small set of data (roughly speaking, the rules of the game) and then are set off to play millions & millions of games. Read the whitepaper that was written by Google on beating Go. They basically admit that there whole point was to write something very, very simple that could learn on it's own and then just set it free on Google's massive power. It's nothing for them to say, "let's have this robot play 10 million games". So the level of sophistication from your initial model is pretty low, you just need to make it an exceptional learner. So you make an exceptional learner of Starcraft - then what? How are you going to have the power to make your algorithm to play millions of games?
