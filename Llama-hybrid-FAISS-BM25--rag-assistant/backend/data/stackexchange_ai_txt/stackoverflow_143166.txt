You should try Google Gears instead. Create your application, add some Gears to it, and you can greatly increase the speed (and reliability) of your application. http://gears.google.com/ Essentially Google gears gives you access to two useful things for any application: offline data storage, and native threading control (allowing updates/computations to run in the background and not slow down the users computer). The really nice thing is, you can use whatever Framework you like for your application, as long as data storage/retrieval and server side communication is handled with JavaScript. It also allows you to cache whatever files client side you want, which is especially useful when you want to avoid that 'flickering' look in the browser while some needed image is being downloaded by the browser.
