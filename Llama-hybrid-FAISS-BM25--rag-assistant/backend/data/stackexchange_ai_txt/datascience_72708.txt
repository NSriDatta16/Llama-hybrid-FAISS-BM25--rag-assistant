What about the Mean Average Precision for binary classification ? In this case, the Average Precision for a list L of size N is the mean of the precision@k for k from 1 to N where L[k] is a True Positive. Is there any (open source) reliable implementation ? In the library mentioned in the thread, I couldn't any implementation of this metric, according to my definition above.
