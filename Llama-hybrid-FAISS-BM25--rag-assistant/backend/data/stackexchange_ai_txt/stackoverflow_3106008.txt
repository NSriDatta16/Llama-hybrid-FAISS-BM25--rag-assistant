Custom VisualStudio toolbox items for rendering MVC partials/arbitrary text

Our development team has a number of semi-technical users that act as intermediaries between our developers and domain experts. One of their tasks is building forms using a very clumsy, antiquated system that makes their job much harder than it should be. I'd quite like to create toolbox controls similar to the standard HTML controls that simply render an MVC partial e.g. but presented as a friendly toolbox item with an icon. This way our developers can create reusable form elements that they can simply drag and drop around in the design view. While this may sound like anathema to most developers, they're quite excited about the possibility. Creating a custom server control does not appear to be the right approach, as it always insists upon adding a register statement to the head of the view, and it also seems to insist upon rendering controls with the prefix. How can I create a Toolbox control that just renders arbitrary markup?
