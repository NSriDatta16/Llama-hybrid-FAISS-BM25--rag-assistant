Should I use returns in multiline Scala methods?

Perhaps this is just my background in more imperative programming, but I like having return statements in my code. I understand that in Scala, returns are not necessary in many methods, because whatever the last computed value is is returned by default. I understand that this makes perfect sense for a "one-liner", e.g. def square(x) = x * x I also understand the definitive case for using explicit returns (when you have several branches your code could take, and you want to break out of the method for different branches, e.g. if an error occurs). But what about multiline functions? Wouldn't it be more readable and make more sense if there was an explicit return, e.g. def average(x: List[Int]) : Float = { var sum = 0 x.foreach(sum += _) return sum / x.length.toFloat }
