For loop with non-contiguous range

I have a loop that runs through each column and sets the value to an R1C1 sum of a few rows above it. I'm using a for loop, but I want to skip a few columns, as they contain formulae already in the cell. How can I set up a loop that only cycles through a non-contiguous set or numbers? For reference, I want it to cycle through columns 1 to 80, but skip cols 25, 36, 37, 44, 60, 63, 64, 67, 68, 73, 75 and 76. Edit: thanks guys, but I;ve already got it working as you described; I was looking for a shorter and more elegant method. Edit 2: Is that even VBA?!
