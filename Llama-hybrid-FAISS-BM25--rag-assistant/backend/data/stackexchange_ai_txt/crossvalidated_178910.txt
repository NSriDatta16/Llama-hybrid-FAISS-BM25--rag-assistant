The zero-inflated data issue is often an issue in community ecology data also. In ordinating sites by species communities, a PCA would result in just clustering of all of the sites near the origin. Thus we typically use distance-based ordinations, in which we calculate similarity/dissimilarity metrics for sites based on species compositions, and perform something like Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) or Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). If you are trying for dimensionality reduction, researchers often do use the scores along the PCoA or NMDS axes as new variables too. here's a recent paper that did this using on the 'Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Metric'. These methods are pretty straightforward to implement in R - in particular, check out the ' vegan ' package.
