Unable to connect to database using both tableadapters.fill & sql code in VB.NET

Running off my laptop: Visual Basic 2010 Express & SQL Server 2008 I've successfully been able to use the connection wizard to connect to my database in vb.net and read/write data using datasets/tableadapters/binding_source etc. Now I am trying to create an SQL connection via code to connect to my database to do some more complicated queries. I was successful in being able to connect to my database with SQL, but by doing so it produces an error when it tries to run any .Fill() methods from my TableAdapters below. The error produced is the following: "SqlException was unhandled. Cannot open user default database. Login failed. Login failed for user 'Chris-PC\Chris'". If I remove my SQL connection code, the TableAdapter.Fill() methods will work fine. How can I make both simultaneously access the database? Any suggestions? Here is the code: ` Dim connetionString As String Dim cnn As SqlConnection connetionString = "Data Source=CHRIS-PC\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=database_db;Integrated Security=SSPI;Trusted_Connection=True;" cnn = New SqlConnection(connetionString) Try cnn.Open() MsgBox("Connection Open ! ") cnn.Close() Catch ex As Exception MsgBox("Can not open connection ! ") End Try Me.JobsTableAdapter.Fill(Me.database_dbDataSet.jobs) Me.ApplicationsTableAdapter.Fill(Me.database_dbDataSet.applications) Me.ApplicantsTableAdapter.Fill(Me.database_dbDataSet.applicants) `
