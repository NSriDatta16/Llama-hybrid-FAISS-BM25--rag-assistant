Using the equation of a generalized linear mixed effects model to predict x values

Very similar to this question Find the equation from generalized linear model output , I want to derive an equation for the logistic regression that includes the estimates of a random effect. I've included the following code for reference: Trial=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) Time=c(2.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12.0, 15.0, 18.0, 21.0, 24.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 39.0) Alive=c(10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 4, 6, 1, 2, 0) Dead=c(0, 10, 6, 10, 10, 10, 7, 10, 0, 8, 1, 9, 10, 10, 5, 0, 8, 6, 10) ostrinaA.glmm Retrieving the coefficients; > ranef(ostrinaA.glmm) $Trial (Intercept) 1 0.13701996 2 -0.17639754 3 0.04042084 > coef(ostrinaA.glmm) $Trial (Intercept) Time 1 2.778796 -0.9009119 2 2.465379 -0.9009119 3 2.682197 -0.9009119 attr(,"class") [1] "coef.mer" > fixef(ostrinaA.glmm) (Intercept) Time 2.6417764 -0.9009119 > summary(ostrinaA.glmm) Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: cbind(Alive, Dead) ~ Time + (1 | Trial) Data: ostrinaA AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 69.7 72.5 -31.8 63.7 16 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.07128 -0.78873 -0.01476 0.56018 2.70666 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

How would I include the effect of trial in my equation? Ultimately, I'd like to use this equation to predict an x value (Time) where the response (Alive/Dead) is equal to 50% (LT50).
