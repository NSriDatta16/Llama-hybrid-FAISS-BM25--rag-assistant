Classpath for custom Solr Transformer

I have written a custom Transformer subclass for the Solr DataImportHandler. It is in a jar file, but I can't figure out how to get solr to find it. java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/solr/handler/dataimport/Transformer I've configured the data-config.xml file with the full path to the custom transformer: transformer="RegexTransformer,DateFormatTransformer,com.mycompany.xform.MyTransformer" I've tried my jar file in every /lib, /dist directory I could find, leading me to believe that it is a problem with a dependent file. It would be very nice if the logs indicated the actual class that can't be found, but they are pretty unhelpful. If I remove the MyTransformer specification, the dataimporthandler works just fine.
