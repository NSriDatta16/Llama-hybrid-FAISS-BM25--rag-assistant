ViewState is the closest you can have. it is a page-scope persistence storage but it will survive many subsequent requests to the same page. You can adapt it to your needs. Initialize some RequestID value in page constructor and keep it in the Session tightly coupled to the Session variable you need. When reading from session, you can simply check if the identifier points to the current request or to the one of some previous generation. It's more or less how the TempData is implemented. You can also take a look at RequestData collection. It is though kept for the duration of one request only and is not stretched to the next request.
