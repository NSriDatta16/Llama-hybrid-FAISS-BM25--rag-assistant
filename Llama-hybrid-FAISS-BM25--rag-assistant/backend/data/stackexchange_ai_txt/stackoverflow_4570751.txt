What tag set is used in OpenNLP's german maxent model?

currently I am using the OpenNLP tools to PoS-tag german sentences, with the maxent model listed on their download-site : de POS Tagger Maxent model trained on tiger corpus. de-pos-maxent.bin This works very well and I got results as: Diese, Community, bietet, Teilnehmern, der, Veranstaltungen, die, MÃ¶glichkeit ... PDAT, FM, VVFIN, NN, ART, NN, ART, NN ... With the tagged sentences I want to do some further processing where I have to know the meaning of the single tags. Unforunately searching the OpenNLP-Wiki for the tag sets isn't very helpful as it says: TODO: Add more tag sets, also for non-english languages Does anyone know where can I find the tag set used in the german maxent model?
