I just want to supplement @Placidia's great answer. You may want to check out "Richly Parameterized Linear Models: Additive, Time Series, and Spatial Models Using Random Effects" by James Hodges (2014). It discuses what we do not know about mixed models and at the same time attempts to offer a broad theory as well as practical tips for fitting complex models. An often scared modeler myself, I find Hodge's discussions of "puzzles" priceless. He explains strange cases arising from fitting mixed-effects modeling, including "A random effect competing with a fixed effect" and "Competition between Random Effects". Sounds familiar?
