I always preferred to write my Ajax calls in javascript using JQuery or Prototype. ASP.NET Ajax Toolkit does make things easier, but it never seems to do so elegantly. I personally would make a new Calendar Controller. This way you can control the AJAX (using JQuery/Prototype) calls that are being made.
