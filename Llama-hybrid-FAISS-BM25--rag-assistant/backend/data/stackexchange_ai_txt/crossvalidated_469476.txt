About Generalized Additive Models - First parametric estimations, after nonparametric estimations for the remaining components

I wonder is it possible to construct a generalized linear modelin in that way, First, I will exclude the intercept term, which is standard for GAMs. Second, I will predict my interested dependent variable(let say y1) with a parametric model using my dependent variable let say x. Third, after eliminating the effect of parametric model estimates from the dependet variable, I will have a new dependent variable y2 Then, I will predict y2 by using x by a nonparametric method. My aim is trying to capture the effect of x on y first by a parametric model. Then, capturing the remanining effects of x on y by a non parametric method, which are not captured by parametric model. Is this a valid method? I will be very glad for any help. Thanks a lot. Namely: Stage 1: B=average(y) y1=y-B Stage 2: calculate f(y1,x) where f is a parametric model(y1 is dep. and x is indep. variable) Stage 3: y2=y1-f(y1,x) calculate y_pred=g(y2,x) where g is a nonparametric procedure(y2 is dep. and x is indep. variable) Namely; y_pred=g(y1-f(y1,x),x)
