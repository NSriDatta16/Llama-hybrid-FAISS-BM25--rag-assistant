The value you enter into the fourth Entry widget is only stored after the event has finished. That is, after the call to vf(event) is complete. I have added a button which displays the contents of the Entry widgets when pressed. This will display the contents of all four widgets. Otherwise access the contents of the Entry widgets after the call to vk is complete. import Tkinter as tk def vf(event): actual = entrylist.index(root.focus_get()) print "--", len(entrylist), actual if event.char.upper() in ('V', 'F', ' '): print event.char if actual ", vf) entrylist.append(e) b = tk.Button(root, text='show', command=show) b.grid() root.mainloop() Edit Answering the question in the comment. It appears that the text is only stored in the Entry widget once the key has been released. Therefore, you can check for KeyRelease events in the fourth Entry. Then, at that point, you should be able to access the values stored in all four widgets. The following works (but I don't find it very elegant - there may be a simpler way of doing this). import Tkinter as tk def vf(event): entry_index = entries.index(root.focus_get()) if event.char.upper() in ('V', 'F', ' '): if entry_index ", vf) if i == 3: # catch KeyRelease events on the last Entry widget e.bind(" ", show) entries.append(e) root.mainloop()
