javascript canvas html5 performance questions

So Im tinkering around making an old school game for fun using the canvas. Firefox is slow, but chrome dosent have firebug, which I find almost a requirement when developing with javascript. So 1st question : how are people developing these complex games without the aid of firebug? Second question. What are some performance tips that can help the draw functions (or just javascript in general) execute faster? It seems to me that this is the area that is the bottleneck (for firefox at least). Final question. From experimenting with profiling in firebug, I can see performance gains from what some would call 'bad practices', such as : I have organized code into a list of functions that each do one thing. This runs slower than if I just dump all the code between the beginPath() and closePath(), but doing it that way leads to spaghetti code and is difficult to follow. How do you manage the balance?
