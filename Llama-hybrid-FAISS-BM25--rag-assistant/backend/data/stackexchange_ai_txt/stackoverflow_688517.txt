Dual list drag drop control

Does anyone know of a good .Net2.0+ compatible dual listbox control that either offers dragging and dropping between lists, or simple buttons to move items between lists and also sort the items in a particulr list. This is for a web based app and I would prefer some nice javascript to make this one speedy.
