Rich Image Field rendered as HTML in publishing page - SharePoint

I have used SharePoint's Rich Image Field in my page layout. When I traverse into edit mode of the publishing page and add an image in the image field, the image is rendered fine. But, once I 'Check In' my page using the publishing console and publish the page, the html markup of the image is rendered. How could this be resolved? Regards, Raghuraman.V
