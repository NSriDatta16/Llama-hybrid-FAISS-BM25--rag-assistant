Memeory Leak in Windows Page file when calling a shell command

I have an issue on our Windows 2003 x64 Build Server when invoking shell commands from a script. Each call causes a "memory leak" in the page file so it grows quite rapidly until it reaches the maximum and the machine stops working. I can reproduce the problem very nicely by running a perl script like for ($count=1; $count It is independent of the scripting language as the same happens with lua: for i=1,5000 do os.execute("echo huhu") end I found somebody describing the same issue with php at http://www.issociate.de/board/post/454835/Memory_leak_occurs_when_exec%28%29_function_is_used_on_Windows_platform.html His solution: Firewall/Virus Scanner does not apply, neither are running on the machine. We can also reproduce the issue on other Developer Machines running XP 64, but not on XP 32 Bit. I also found an article describing a leak situation in page file at http://www.programfragment.com/ The guilty guy for the allocation is C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs which runs all the basic Windows services. Does anybody know the issue and how to resolve it ?
