Creating new active directory account from an asp.net webpage

I'm 14 and I am really stuck. I wish to have an ASP.NET webpage that will enable users to create a new account in an organizational container. I have seen many pages on this but I just keep getting stuck. Also, if this is possible, once the user has signed up would it be possible to run a script to enable the user for Office Communications Server 2007, or will I have to set the script as a cron job every 2 minutes? Thanks in advance for your help.
