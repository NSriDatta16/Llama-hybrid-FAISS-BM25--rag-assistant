Any chance you would know if this approach sounds reasonable? It might work, but it would be overkill. TBATS was developed for complex seasonalities, for example daily sales data which exhibits both weekly and yearly seasonality. You have 2 years of monthly data - that's not granular enough to exhibit any complex seasonalities - at most you can detect a yearly seasonality with that level of data. An easier approach would be to use the stl() function in R . Or you can use the ETS or Auto.arima functions from the forecast library . If one or the other returns a seasonal model, then your time series is likely seasonal. Also, I would assume this model uses autocorrelation to determine if the seasonal periods are a good fit? Can someone confirm this? TBATS uses the State Space approach , which is a general approach that covers many different classes of time series models . TBATS uses Fourier analysis to model seasonality (the first 'T' stands for 'trigonomic').
