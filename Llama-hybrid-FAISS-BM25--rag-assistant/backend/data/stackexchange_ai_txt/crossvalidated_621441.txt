It looks like ViTForMaskedImageModeling adds an additional decoder layer that doesn't exist in the pretrained model provided at "google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k" . This would mean the pixel predictions are coming from a randomly initialized layer (thus why the reconstructions are just noise) This warning also appears in the code you provided that supports this: Some weights of ViTForMaskedImageModeling were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k and are newly initialized: ['embeddings.mask_token', 'decoder.0.weight', 'decoder.0.bias']
