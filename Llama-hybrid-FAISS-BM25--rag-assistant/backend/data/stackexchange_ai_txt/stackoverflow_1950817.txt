Text editor with comment wrapping

I usually use Geany or Hi-Tide under Debian (GNU/Linux) for firmware development, mainly C (but also reading old assembler). I document code using single-line comments, and it really annoys me when I retype something and have to manually re-break every following line to keep it in the 80-character margin. Is there a text editor that can re-wrap consecutive single-line comments (and do this automatically while I type)? That is, given: /// This is a really long line that should have been wrapped at "that" but was not. /// This sentence is in the same /// paragraph as the last. ...I want an editor that will re-wrap this to /// This is a really long line that /// should have been wrapped at "that" /// but was not. This sentence is in /// the same paragraph as the last. ...preferably doing this sensibly while I type. I've tried: Hi-Tide (based on Eclipse 3.3) Geany jEdit UniversalIndentGUI + a bunch of prettifiers (I couldn't find any formatters that worked, and it's not a great workflow either) GVim - next line begins //should have been ... instead of /// should have been ... Update : just to elaborate on my accepted answer - I've gone with the snapshot emacs and an extra filladapt mode was also required
