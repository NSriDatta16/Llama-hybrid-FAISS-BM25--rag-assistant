mysql tables structure - one very large table or separate tables?

I'm working on a project which is similar in nature to website visitor analysis. It will be used by 100s of websites with average of 10,000s to 100,000s page views a day each so the data amount will be very large. Should I use a single table with websiteid or a separate table for each website? Making changes to a live service with 100s of websites with separate tables for each seems like a big problem. On the other hand performance and scalability are probably going to be a problem with such large data. Any suggestions, comments or advice is most welcome.
