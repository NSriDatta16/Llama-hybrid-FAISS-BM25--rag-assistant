Embedding Ruby, calling a function from C

I'm writing an app that calls ruby code from c. I am having a little difficulty and wondered if anyone could point me in the rite direction. I currently have in my C. #include ruby.h main() { ruby_init(); rb_require("myRubyFile"); rb_funcall(rb_module_new(), rb_intern("RubyFunction"), 0, NULL); } My ruby file is in the same directory as my c file and is called myRubyFile.rb and contains a definition of the function RubyFunction(). This is a cut down of what I actually want to do, just making it more readable for others. I just require some feedback as to whether this is the correct method to call ruby code from my c file. Regards
