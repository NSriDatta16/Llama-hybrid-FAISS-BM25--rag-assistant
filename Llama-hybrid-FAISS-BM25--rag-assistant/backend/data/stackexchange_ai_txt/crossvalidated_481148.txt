If I am understanding you correctly, you want to create a confidence interval around the proportion of observations that would have resulted in $Y = 1$ given $A = a$ . Your logistic regression already provides us with $P(Y = 1 | A = a, B = b, C = c, D = d)$ . You are justified in taking the mean as a point estimate of $P(Y = 1|A = a)$ by the law of total probability. Because the proportion of observations where $Y = 1$ is logically equivalent to the probability that an observation will yield $Y = 1$ you could use the normal approximation computed on the predicted probabilities themselves to create a confidence interval. Here is some R code that would do the trick # fake data for demonstration # 20 samples drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 predicted_probs
