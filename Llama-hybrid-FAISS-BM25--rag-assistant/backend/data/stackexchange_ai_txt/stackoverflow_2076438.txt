A different strategy : define a variable of type Rectangle that holds the targets bounds in screen co-ordinates : increase the bounds as necessary according to some threshold variable you define. define MouseUp and MouseDown event handlers for the PictureBox define a boolean variable (in form scope) that is set to true when the mouse goes down (in the MouseDown Event Handler) on the PictureBox, and false in the MouseUp handler for the PictureBox. define a MouseMove Event handler for the PictureBox in which : a. if the boolean variable is true (mouse is down) use the Rectangle.IntersectsWith method to see if the current bounds of the PictureBox overlaps the target bounds rectangle. MSDN Rectangle.IntersectsWith : if it does you know you can stop. imho, using this stragety you can write greatly simplified code.
