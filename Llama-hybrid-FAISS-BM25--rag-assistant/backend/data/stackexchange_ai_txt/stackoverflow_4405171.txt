Couple years ago I had to write an unattended service in two servers, and they should be using a very complex schedule. I decided to use cron, however cron is very common in unix environments. Doing some research, I could find a blog from a guy that converted the algorithm to .Net. My service is running for 1 1/2 years with no issues (at all). Just in case you need, you can find more details in my blog: CronTab schedule parser algorithm Thanks, Roberto Lopes
