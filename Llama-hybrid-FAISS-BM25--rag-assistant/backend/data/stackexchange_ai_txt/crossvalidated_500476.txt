How should one interpret the odds ration estimate for a numeric independent variable?

I am calculating odds ratios for a logistic regression, where the first dependent variable is a dummy and the second one is numeric. If the interpretation of the first coefficient is straightforward, how should I interpret the second one? function |z| x1 0.999926731792 0.000008632814 -8.4869 0.000220 *** x2 1.002100923867 0.000556887005 3.7766 0.000159 *** ```
