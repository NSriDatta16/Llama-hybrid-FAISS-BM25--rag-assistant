I think Oracle's External Tables are actually quite elegant for this (so is SQL loader). There is a 'depends' argument for either approach. However, if your looking for a more point and click solution; Oracle has a free tool called SQL Developer available for download. It has support for importing from excel . In addition, there is an entire forum dedicated to SQL Loader and External Tables.
