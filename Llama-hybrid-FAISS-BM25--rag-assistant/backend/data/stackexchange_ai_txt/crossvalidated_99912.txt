Implementing R Machine Learning Model in Real World

I've been able to create some successful R ML models using some of the popular machine learning algorithms. However, I'm not sure how to implement the model where the end users (technically challenged) can utilize the model with a few button clicks. They prefer a web or a traditional application interface. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thank you very much in advance.
