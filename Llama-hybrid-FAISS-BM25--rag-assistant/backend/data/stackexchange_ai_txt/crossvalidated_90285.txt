Hastie et. al.'s "Elements..." is a brilliant book, but might be somewhat hard for first encounter with the subject. Check out their more introductory course http://online.stanford.edu/course/statistical-learning-winter-2014 (week 9) and accompanying book (available for free download). There are also excellent explanatory videos on SVMs in online courses "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng and "Learning from Data" by Y.Abu-Mostafa.
