This is a binary outcome: either up or down. So many models can be used to do this, ranging from logistic regressions to random forests to neural networks. Perhaps consult the classification and binary-data tags, though the former is somewhat of a misnomer because many so-called "classification" models like logistic regressions do not do classification. (Logistic regression in particular predicts on a continuum. If you want to apply a threshold to bin those continuous predictions into discrete categories, that is a second stage of a two-stage classification pipeline, with the logistic regression being the first stage.) You also have a time component to your predictions. We have multiple questions about predicting binary time series. Modern approaches to predicting binary or categorical time series data might involve recurrent neural networks and their refinements (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM)). I have my doubts that you should only predict up/down, however. Some of my argument is discussed here and here . This and this apply , too. It is not a guarantee that high accuracy in predicting direction leads to profits. For instance, you can bet the right way nine out of ten times ( $90\%$ accuracy) or $99$ out of $100$ times ( $99\%$ accuracy), yet if that one wrong bet costs you dearly, you have lost money despite the high accuracy in predicting the sign. As an example of this, Long-Term Capital Management got their predictions right almost every time (basically predicting that bond prices would get closer to each other and being correct about that almost every time). Nonetheless, when their predictions were not correct, they lost a huge amount of money and had to close. (Predicting on a continuum doesn't necessarily solve this, and I have started to think of a lot of predictions in terms of reinforcement learning where the prediction is not of interest so much as the action to take ("policy" in reinforcement learning lingo) to get the best outcome.)
