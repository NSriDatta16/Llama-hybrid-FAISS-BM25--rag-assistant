check for players undergoing the maximum/minimum change in time course data?

I have time series data of many variables (This data comes from high throughput biological experiments, which measure the amount of particular biological components such as RNA content of a cell etc., ) The time series looks like $x \to x_1, x_2, x_3 $ which is the value of $x$ at time points $1,2,3$ respectively $y \to y_1, y_2, y_3 $ etc.. Now, I would like to shortlist the set of variables which have seen the biggest jump or fall (or the ones that did not change much) in their trend. I am interested in understanding which biological players changed radically over the time course and that these may be important players driving biological mechanisms. What is the best measure to calculate this?
