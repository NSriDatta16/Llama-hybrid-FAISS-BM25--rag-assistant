Multi-adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) equation interpretation

I was curious about certain aspects of multi-adaptive regression splines (MARS or earth in R). Taking the equation of MARS from the wiki page: ozone = 5.2 + + 0.93max(0,temp - 58) - 0.64max(0,temp - 68) - 0.046max(0,234-ibt) - 0.016max(0,wind-7)max(0,200-vis) My questions are: 1) How to interpret the above equation? If I understand it correctly, for the following value of temp = 52 , ibt = 230 , wind = 8 and vis = 190 , the above equation will become: ozone = 5.2 + + 0.93max(0,52 - 58) - 0.64max(0,52- 68) - 0.046max(0,234- 230) - 0.016max(0,8-7)max(0,200-190) ozone = 5.2 + + 0.93max(0,-6) - 0.64max(0,-16) - 0.046max(0,4) - 0.016max(0,1)max(0,10) ozone = 5.2 + + 0 - 0 - 0.184 - 0.16 Is this correct? 2) Before running earth (MARS), do the predictor variables have to uncorrelated? What is the way to go about it: remove the correlated predictor variables and then run MARS or run MARS using all predictors and somehow MARS deal with the correlation 3) In R, for earth equation, how do I take out the final equation in step 1 for my model 4) Lets say I run two MARS model: first model predictor x1, x2 and x3 are retained in the final model and in second model x1 and x2 are retained in the final model. Is there any way I can combine the two MARS equation to have a single equation presumably where parameters of x1 and x2 are average of the two models and x3 on its own. EDIT To elaborate on (4), let's say I collect some data and and develop a MARS model ozone1 = 5.2 + 0.93max(0,temp - 58) - 0.64max(0,temp - 68)- 0.046max(0,234-ibt)- 0.016max(0,wind-7)max(0,200-vis) I go back and collect another set of data and develop a second model: ozone2 = 4.6 + 0.89max(0,temp - 58) - 0.033max(0,234-ibt)- 0.016max(0,wind-7)max(0,200-vis) Can I combine the two equation in a single equation something like this: ozone.fin = (5.2 + 4.6)/2 + ((0.93 + 0.89)/2)max(0,temp - 58) - 0.64max(0,temp - 68) - (0.046+0.033/2)max(0,234-ibt) - 0.016max(0,wind-7)max(0,200-vis) Thaks
