We've adopted the ethos "Code for people, not machines", based on the assumption that you spend multiple times longer in maintenance mode than on new development. For me, that rules out the argument that the compiler "knows" what type the variable is - sure, you can't write invalid code the first time because the compiler stops your code from compiling, but when the next developer is reading the code in 6 months time they need to be able to deduce what the variable is doing correctly or incorrectly and quickly identify the cause of issues. Thus, var something = SomeMethod(); is outlawed by our coding standards, but the following is encouraged in our team because it increases readability: var list = new List >(); FillList( list ); foreach( var item in list ) { DoWork( item ); }
