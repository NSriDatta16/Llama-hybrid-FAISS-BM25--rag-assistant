If I understood your question correctly, and you have two different classes as diabetic/non-diabetic, you want to preserve class-discriminatory information while reducing dimension, you should use Linear Discriminant Analysis and not PCA. Below is a copy/paste from Wikipedia: LDA is closely related to principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis in that they both look for linear combinations of variables which best explain the data.[4] LDA explicitly attempts to model the difference between the classes of data. PCA on the other hand does not take into account any difference in class, and factor analysis builds the feature combinations based on differences rather than similarities. Discriminant analysis is also different from factor analysis in that it is not an interdependence technique: a distinction between independent variables and dependent variables (also called criterion variables) must be made. LDA works when the measurements made on independent variables for each observation are continuous quantities. When dealing with categorical independent variables, the equivalent technique is discriminant correspondence analysis. [5][6]
