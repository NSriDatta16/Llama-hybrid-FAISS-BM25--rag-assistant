Multivariate logistic regression vs multinomial logistic regression?

I have 15 independent variables and 3 correlated, binary, dependent variables. It seems like for predicting correlated dependent variables the general recommendation is multivariate regression. One recommendation was to use a multivariate GLM with a log link. However, since my dependent variables are binary, it also seems like a multinomial logistic regression might fit the bill. However, I am not sure if it is as well-suited for correlated dependent variables as the multivariate approach - or, even, if the two are more or less the same thing. It's hard to determine how equivalent these two approaches are (especially since there are so many articles that say "Multivariate" when they mean "Multiple/Multivariable") Is one better than the other for correlated dependent variables, or are they essentially the same?
