ASMX Web Service slow first request

I have a bunch of .NET Webservices running in one IIS Application. These webservices are consumed by another IIS Application (frontend). The first call is pretty slow, about 5 to 10 seconds. After that it’s just milliseconds. The first call is considered a performance problem. We’ve tried an application that calls all these webservices but this obviously doesn’t solve anything. So it's not the default Application Recycle that is the problem. I've created an application that just initializes the service several times and measures the time it takes to create one instance. Before running this application I ensure that my webservice application is started / recycled, then I run the application. The first initialization takes between 2 to 4 seconds, all others is just milliseconds. Another thought is that we create a page in the Frontend application that initiates all the webservices and that we call this page before any users are in. I don’t consider this as an elegant solution, what else could I try?
