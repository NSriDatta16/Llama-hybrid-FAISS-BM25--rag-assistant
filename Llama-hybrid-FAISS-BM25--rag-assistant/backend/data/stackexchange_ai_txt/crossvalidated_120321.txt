Combining two estimates of p in a binomial estimation

I have an estimation problem for a binomial data. I got a sample and from that I can get an estimation. But I also have a kind of prior information about the p. But mind it, this prior is just a single value, not a distribution of p, so I can't use Bayesian. The prior is also an estimation for the same distribution from some other sample, but unfortunately, I dont have the full sample, I just have the value of the estimate. Does anyone has any idea how to include this information in the estimation? One solution is taking AM of the two estimates, but I can't find any theoretic support for that. Does taking simple AM really makes sense?
