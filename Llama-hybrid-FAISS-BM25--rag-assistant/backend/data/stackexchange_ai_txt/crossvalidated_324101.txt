From the short description you provided I would suggest that you look into Kalman filters. I won't bother to give you the details here since there is plenty of literature available online, e.g. the usual first go to place is Wikipedia . There are also some good books, e.g. if you work with MATLAB, I can recommend the book "Kalman Filtering, Theory and Practice Using MATLAB" by M.S. Grewal and A.P. Andrews. It might be that a Kalman filter is a bit of an overkill for your problem, simpler alternatives would be the good old low-pass filter or a moving average (or maybe a zero lag moving average if you don't process the data in real-time).
