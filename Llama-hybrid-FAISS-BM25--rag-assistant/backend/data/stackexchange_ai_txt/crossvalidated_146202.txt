How can I determine if a time-series is statistically stable?

I have time-series data that tracks the number of sydromics records my organization receives each week. The number of records had been steadily increasing as more organizations started sending us data and now I'm trying to figure out if the number of messages we see each week has begun to stabilize around a mean over the past few months. Could I simply test if the time series has become stationary? Or use a control chart? I am very stumped as to what tests/techniques to use so I would greatly appreciate some help. Thank you.
