How to explain smoothing functions in the logistic regression model

I fitted a logistic regression model with some smoothing functions, and the software made beautiful plots for them. Here is one example: My main concern is that there is no reference level in the continuous variable, so converting the estimates by an exponential function to odds ratio seems not quite right for smoothing functions. Hence, I am wondering how to explain smoothing functions appropriately? Here is a part of output of the above smoothing function: age estimate 95% CI 18 0.802419 (0.708936, 0.90305) 19 0.744268 (0.666983, 0.823497) 20 0.688122 (0.625178, 0.755262) 21 0.634746 (0.57693, 0.69252) 22 0.584887 (0.530877, 0.638431) 23 0.538855 (0.485444, 0.589725) 24 0.496467 (0.44487, 0.550205) 25 0.457521 (0.405356, 0.511471) 26 0.421809 (0.370094, 0.47534) 27 0.389193 (0.340622, 0.441149) Any suggestion will be appreciated!
