I was just able to successfully install jadclipse with Ganymede. In order to do this I: 1) Installed via the help-> software updates http://webobjects.mdimension.com/jadclipse/3.3 2) Put the Jad executable into a directory that is in the execution path of your operating system. Alternatively, you can configure the path to the Jad executable under Window > Preferences... > Java > JadClipse > Path to Decompiler. (Set the full path, e.g. C:\Program Files\Jad\jad.exe) 3)Go to Window > Preferences... > General > Editors > File Associations and make sure that the JadClipse Class File Viewer has the default file association for *.class files. 4) Restart Eclipse (eclipse -clean). It is now working perfectly for me!
