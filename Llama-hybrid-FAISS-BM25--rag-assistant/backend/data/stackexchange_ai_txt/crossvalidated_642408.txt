“Data scientist” is not a term with a clear definition. It’s also a sexy term, a job many people want or think they want, for some combination of (perceived) prestige and money. Thus, you get attention by calling a position “data scientist” instead of an analyst or an engineer. That might not really turn out to be the case, but plenty of companies sure seem to operate that way. Depending on the exact skills required for the job, linear regression might be irrelevant. A “developer” role called “data scientist” might have minimal need for statistics skills. However, if the job involves regression analysis, not being able to answer basic questions is problematic, and regression fundamentals should not be considered beneath a “mid-level” or even “senior” hire, particularly if those skills matter to the work being performed.
