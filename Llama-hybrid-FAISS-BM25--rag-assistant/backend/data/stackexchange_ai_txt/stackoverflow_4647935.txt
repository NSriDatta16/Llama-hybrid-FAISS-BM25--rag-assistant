What are Java Packages, .NET Assemblies and .NET Namespaces and is a Java package the same as a .NET Namespace?

So my question is: What are Java Packages, .NET Assemblies and .NET Namespaces and is a Java package the same as a .NET Namespace? I have used Google to get the following: Java Package: Java Packages provide a way of organizing files into different directories according to their functionality, usability and as well as category that they should belong to. An example of a package is the JDK package. .NET Assembly: A .NET assembly provides a fundamental unit to physical code grouping. .NET Namespace: A .NET namespace provides a fundamental unit of logical code grouping. I have read about them, but haven't really understood, can anyone please explain further?
