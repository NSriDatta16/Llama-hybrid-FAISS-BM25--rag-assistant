Why Decision trees performs better than logistic regression

I'm working on a machine learning project, a classification of (100 x 100) Images (every pixel contains 0 or 255), my training set contains 10000 examples (which I split into 2 parts 80% training/20% for testing). When I applied Logistic regression algorithm I had 22 % of accuracy and when I applied a decision trees algorithm I had 55 % of accuracy, but I can't understand why the second algorithm gives a better result.
