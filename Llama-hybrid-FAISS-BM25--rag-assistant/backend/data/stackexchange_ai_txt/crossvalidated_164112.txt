Is SVM still an active research area?

Recently I am learning SVM classification and regression, I found that most of the work are proposed in the 2000s, (around 2004~2007), but I don't understand why people stop developing it(do they?), does that mean it is complete enough? or they encounter some huge obstacles so they gave up working on it?
