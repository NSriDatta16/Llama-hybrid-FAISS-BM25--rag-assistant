The drupal_prepare_form function calls all hook_form_alter functions. In this function, there is no storage for any modules that implement hook_form_alter. However, there is a container ($data) there that pulls all the alter functions then is applied with drupal_alter. Getting this data would require modifying this file (ref: line 543 in /includes/form.inc in Drupal 6.19).
