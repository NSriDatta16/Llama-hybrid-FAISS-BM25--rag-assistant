Our SD Java Test Coverage Tool allows you at execution time to dump a test coverage snapshot at any time you like by calling a special method. If you have a long running application and want a daily snapshot, you could add an extra thread that waited 24 hours, dump the snapshot, go back to sleep. Each snapshots gets its own date-stamped file. You can merge as many of these together as you like, and produce an XML coverage report (and then an HTML report in the format you like).
