How to determine influence of two time series with feedback?

Say you have two time series, A & B. Each have a mutual effect on the other. To give a real-world example, say that time series A measures an artist's CD sales per month, and time series B is some measure of the artist's "Q" rating. Clearly, increase in A will drive an increase in B, but at the same time, an increase in the Q rating could drive sales higher (or vice-versa). Is there a statistical approach to tackle this problem, or is this more the realm of control systems?
