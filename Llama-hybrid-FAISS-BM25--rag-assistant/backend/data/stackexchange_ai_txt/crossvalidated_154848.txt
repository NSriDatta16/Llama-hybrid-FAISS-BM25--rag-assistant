Nature is indifferent to units of measurement. Thus there will be no untoward effects of changing the units of your explanatory variables in a regression model. If people's weight increases over years, then it will increase, on average, 1/12 as much over months. Thus, the estimated slope in the model using months will be precisely 1/12 the estimated slope in the model using years. Likewise, if people who are taller in centimeters tend to be heavier, then those same people, when measured in meters, will also tend to have the same association between their height and weight, but the estimated slope will be 100 times larger. Changes of units will not affect the goodness of fit of your model, its out of sample predictive accuracy, nor will it make you more or less likely to overfit.
