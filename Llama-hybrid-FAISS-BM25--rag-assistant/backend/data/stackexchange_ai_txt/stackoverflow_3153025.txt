Grouped bar chart with ggplot2 and already tabulated data

I fit a count model to a vector of actual data and would now like to plot the actual and the predicted as a grouped (dodged) bar chart. Since this is a count model, the data are discrete (X=x from 0 to 317). Since I am fitting a model, I only have already-tabulated data for the predicted values. Here is how my original data frame looks: actual predicted 1 3236 3570.4995 2 1968 1137.1202 3 707 641.8186 4 302 414.8763 5 185 285.1854 6 104 203.0502 I transformed the data to be plotted with ggplot2: melted.data So that my data frame now looks like this: head(melted.data) origin count realization 1 actual 3236 0 2 actual 1968 1 3 actual 707 2 4 actual 302 3 5 actual 185 4 6 actual 104 5 > tail(melted.data) origin count realization 631 predicted 1.564673e-27 312 632 predicted 1.265509e-27 313 633 predicted 1.023552e-27 314 634 predicted 8.278601e-28 315 635 predicted 6.695866e-28 316 636 predicted 5.415757e-28 317 When I try to graph it (again, I'd like to have the actual and predicted count --which is already tabulated in the data-- by discrete realization), I give this command: ggplot(melted.data, stat="identity", aes(x=realization, fill=origin)) + geom_bar(position="dodge") Yet it seems like the stat parameter is not liked by ggplot2, as I don't get the correct bar height (which would be those of the variable "count"). Any ideas? Thanks, Roberto.
