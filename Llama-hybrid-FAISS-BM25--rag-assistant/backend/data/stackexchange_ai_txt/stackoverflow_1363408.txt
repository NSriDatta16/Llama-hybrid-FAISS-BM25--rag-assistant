You should try the "MaTeLo" tool of All4Tec. www.all4tec.net "MaTeLo is a test cases generator for black box functional and system testing. Conformed to the Model Based Testing approach, MaTeLo uses Markov chains for modeling the test. This statistic addin allows products validation in a Systematic way. The efficiency is achieved by a reduction of the human resources needed, an increase of the model reuse and by the enhancement of the test strategy relevance (due to the reliability target). MaTeLo is independent and user-friendly, offers to the validation activities to pass from test scripting to real test engineering and to focus on the real added value of testing: the test plans" You can ask an evaluation licence and try by yourself. You can find some exemples here : http://www.all4tec.net/wiki/index.php?title=Tutorials
