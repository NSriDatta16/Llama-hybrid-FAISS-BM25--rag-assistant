iPhone CoreData migration of data only

I have an iPhone application that uses CoreData for storage. The persistent store (an sqlite3 database) is shipped with several of its entities populated with data. These data are used to create various menus and options in the application. Let's call these data "application data". Several other entities are used by the application to store user data. Although the schema rarely changes, I often need to update the application data to provide new options to users. I have a MacRuby script that gets the new data from a bunch of CSV files and updates the sqlite3 database on my development machine, but I am not sure what is the best way to update existing deployed apps with the new application data (remember, no schema change) without affecting the user data. Any ideas? _ Update _ After a bit of thinking, I am getting oriented towards setting the application to download a new sqlite3 file from a web server that contains the new data. Once received, my app will copy the data from the update sqlite3 file into the app's working database file, completely replacing the application data, but not touching the user data. A mechanism for determining if an update has been applied can use a text file with a single database version number which the app will download periodically. If this number is larger than the number of the previous update (which is stored locally), then the update will proceed, otherwise it will ignore it.
