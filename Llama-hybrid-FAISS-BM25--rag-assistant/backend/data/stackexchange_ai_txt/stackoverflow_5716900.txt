Regex to find pairs of strings

I have found this great gant script on http://blog.armbruster-it.de/2010/07/getting-a-list-of-all-i18n-properties-used-in-a-grails-application/ Thanks Stefan! Description: create a list of all i18n properties used in groovy code and gsp templates def properties = [] new File(".").eachFileRecurse { if (it.file) { switch (it) { case ~/.*\.groovy/: def matcher = it.text =~ /code:\s*["'](.*?)["']/ matcher.each { properties I tried to extend it in the following way. Let's say we have soem message properties like: message(code: 'product.label', default: 'Product') What we want to have as output of the script something like: product.label=Product I tried to add some condition to the regex: def matcher = it.text =~ /code=["'](.*?)["'] | default=\s*["'](.*?)["']/ and to fill it to properties. But as the regex does not find pairs of "code and default"-parts this is not going to work. Any idea how to change the regex or the whole script to do this?
