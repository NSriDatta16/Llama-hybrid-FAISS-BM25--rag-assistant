I think the intuition behind MAP can be grasped by looking at the formula of partial correlation, included in Velicer (1976) paper (equation 11), which I also write here for convenience: $$r_{ij.y} = \frac{r_{ij}-r_{iy}r_{jy}}{((1-r_{iy}^2)(1-r_{jy}^2))^{1/2}}$$ At the numerator you have the partial covariance between each pair of variables $i$ and $j$ ; this number will go down as you partial out more components, since you are removing systematic variance. You divide this number to get a normalization, pretty much like you divide covariance by the product of the standard deviations in order to have a correlation coefficient that has value between -1 and +1. This denominator contains the two correlation terms between each of the two variables and the component $y$ that you are removing. These correlation terms will go up as you keep removing components, since components will contain more and more individual variability/noise. This makes the denominator as a whole to go down. So, both the numerator and the denominator go down as you remove more components, the former because partial covariance goes down since you are removing common/systematic variability, the latter because components catch more and more individual variability. Now, it comes a point at which the denominator starts decreasing faster than the numerator, because you are removing more individual variability than systematic variability in the data. This makes the partial correlation go up. The MAP criterion computes the average of the partial correlations, and tells you to stop when the average partial correlation stops going down and starts going up, i.e. when you are starting the remove more individual variability than common variability in the data.
