Getting an Value Error from using the mean squared error loss function

I am training a feed-forward neural network that takes in the input of shape (4040 ,2) and output of shape (4040, 4, 51) . I tried using the Panda data frame for it first, however, it does not seem to work with a 3-dimensional output shape. (If there is a way to covert 3-dimensional data into Panda data frame please let me know) So for now I am using numpy array to store the inputs and outputs. But they are now the same shape, and will raise and error when going through the mean squared error loss function. Any comments, solutions and suggestions are greatly appreciated!
