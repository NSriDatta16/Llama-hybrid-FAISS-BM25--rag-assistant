Store your passwords encrypted with AES and a good strong key. Instead of embedding the decryption key in the application, give it to your users (the support consultants). Then have your application prompt them for it when they need to look up the information. Not ideal, because everyone uses the same key, but it at least offers some protection if your database ever gets compromised.
