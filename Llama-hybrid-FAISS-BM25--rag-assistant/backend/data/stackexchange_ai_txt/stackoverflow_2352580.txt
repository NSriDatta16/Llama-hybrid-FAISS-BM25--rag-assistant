I don't know much about doctests, but at my university, nose testing is taught and encouraged. Nose can be installed by following this procedure (I'm assuming you're using a PC - Windows OS): install setuptools Run DOS Command Prompt (Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt) For this step to work, you must be connected to the internet. In DOS, type: C:\Python25\Scripts\easy_install nose If you are on a different OS, check this site EDIT : It's been two years since I originally wrote this post. Now, I've learned of this programming principle called Designing by Contract . This allows a programmer to define preconditions, postconditions and invariants (called contracts) for all functions in their code. The effect is that an error is raised if any of these contracts are violated. The DbC framework that I would recommend for python is called PyContract I have successfully used it in my evolutionary programming framework
