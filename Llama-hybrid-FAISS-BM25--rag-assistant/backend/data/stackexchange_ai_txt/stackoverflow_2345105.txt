Text mining, fact extraction, semantic analysis using .Net

I'm looking for any free tools/components/libraries that allow me to take anvantage of text mining, fact extraction and semantic analysis in my .NET application. The GATE project is what I need but it is written in Java. Is there something like GATE in the .NET world? My challange is to extract certain facts out of website text content. I plan to use some NLP algorithms to achieve such functionality, but I'm not sure how do I implement them, so I'm gonna use any existing solutions if they were available. I'll appreciate if you could give me some tips. I'm new in this area, so any related info would be very usefull for me.
