Have you reviewed the projection (-pr) options for the draggerContext? Mouse co-ordinates is data across 2 dimensions, and the projection options are methods to resolve how the 3rd dimension is mapped. For rays, maybe one of the following options is relevant to your question: xAxis project to closest point on X axis yAxis project to closest point on Y axis zAxis project to closest point on Z axis Here's hoping that helps and best of luck.
