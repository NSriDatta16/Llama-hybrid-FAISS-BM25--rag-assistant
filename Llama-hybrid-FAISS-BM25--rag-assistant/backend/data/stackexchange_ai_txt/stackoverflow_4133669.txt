Is there a cleaner way to set this anonymous class property?

I am returning an anonymous class: var clients = from c in this.ClientRepository.SearchClientByTerm(term, 10) select new { id = c.Id, line1 = c.Address.Line1 ?? "Unknown Information ..." }; The problem is Address is nullable which means if it is null it explodes into a million pieces. The most elegant solution i could think of was this... line1 = c.Address != null && c.Address.Line1 != null ? c.Address.Line1 : "Unknown Information ..." Is there a better way?, i don't like losing the ability to use the null-coalescing operator and then having to check if null.
