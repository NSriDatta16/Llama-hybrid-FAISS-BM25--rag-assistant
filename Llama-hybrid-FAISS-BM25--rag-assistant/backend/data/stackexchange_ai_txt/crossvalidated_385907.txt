Converted from a comment..... The exact values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ can be found in this answer of mine to Effect of switching responses and explanatory variables in simple linear regression , and, as you suspect, $\beta$ is not the reciprocal of $\gamma$ , and averaging $\beta$ and $\gamma$ (or averaging $\beta$ and $1/\gamma$ ) is not the right way to go. A pictorial view of what $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are minimizing is given in Elvis's answer to the same question, and in the answer, he introduces a "least rectangles" regression that might be what you are looking for. The comments following Elvis's answer should not be neglected; they relate this "least rectangles" regression to other, previously studied, techniques. In particular, note that Moderator chl points out that this method is of interest when it is not clear which is the predictor variable and which the response variable.
