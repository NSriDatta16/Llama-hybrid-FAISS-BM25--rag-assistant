Are you looking for a way to draw in .NET? Here's yet another charting class library with a high degree of configurability that is also easy to use. ZedGraph is a set of classes, written in C#, for creating 2D line and bar graphs of arbitrary datasets. The classes provide a high degree of flexibility -- almost every aspect of the graph can be user-modified. At the same time, usage of the classes is kept simple by providing default values for all of the graph attributes. The classes include code for choosing appropriate scale ranges and step sizes based on the range of data values being plotted. ZedGraph also includes a UserControl interface, allowing drag and drop editing within the Visual Studio forms editor, plus access from other languages such as c++ and vb.net . ZedGraph is licensed under the LGPL . Unfortunately further development on ZedGraph was halted in 2007 by the author John Howard Champion however there was still a backup site for some time hosted for grabbing documentation and an on-going wiki existed for support.
