I have been playing with time series for anomaly detection in the last few months and I can share with you my experience. The time series I've been working with was characterized by two seasonalities (daily and weekly), no trend and many peaks during daylights. I did several experiments and then I chose a model based on LSTM neural nets because in my case it outperformed arima, but of course as everything in statistics, there's not an general solution. To predict more than one time step in the future with a neural net is pretty simple, you will need to output N values instead of one and that N output will be compared to the real N observations. From my experience I can tell you that by using a low N (say 1), the model will strictly use few time step in the past to predict the new one, without really "learning" the seasonality. On the other side, by increasing N too mutch, the seasonalities are learned but the overall accuracy decreases. For the purpose of my analysis I found N = 4 (2 hours in the future) to be a good compromise.
