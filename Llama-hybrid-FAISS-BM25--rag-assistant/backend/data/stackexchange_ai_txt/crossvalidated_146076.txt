As I understand, you want to check, whether promotion can be predicted by some continuous variable, while additionally accounting for gender for any possible differences. This sounds like a task for (multinomial) logistic regression , depending on whether your promotion variable is binary or has multiple outcomes. You can use your continuous variable and gender as your predictors, perhaps adding an interaction term.
