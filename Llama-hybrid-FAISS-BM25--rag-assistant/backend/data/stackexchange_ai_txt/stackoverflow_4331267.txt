Call task more than once in Rails 3 generator

I'm writing a Rails 3 generator that creates two different models. Here's a very simplified example of what I'm trying to do: def my_generator_task invoke "model", ["foo"] invoke "model", ["bar"] end The problem is that the Thor invoke method only invokes a task once, so the second call to the "model" task never happens and the "bar" model is never created. Does anyone know an elegant way to accomplish this, preferably in a way that doesn't break the ability to run "rails destroy" with the generator?
