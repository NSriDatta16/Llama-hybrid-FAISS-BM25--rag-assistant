ARIMA model on yearly data using R

Im new to time series forecasting, and I was trying to model the folowing time series data using ARIMA model in R, so that I can predict for the future 10 time periods. data : cereal_dataset When I try to decompose the time series using stl() I get the following error. Error in stl(cereal_ts, s.window = "per", robust = TRUE) : series is not periodic or has less than two periods Also the ACF and PACF plots didn't return anything promosing. # plot acf acf(cereal_ts) # plot pacf pacf(cereal_ts) Next I tried to fit a model using auto.arima() in R which returned ARIMA(0,0,0) . model From the graph, it looks like something that can be modelled. Or am I looking at a dead end. Im new to time series forecasting, so please suggest any alternative or better way of doing it.
