You could try the auto.arima and ets functions in R. You might also have some success with the rugarch package, but there's no existing functions for automated parameters selection. Maybe you could get parameters for the mean model from auto.arima , then pass them to rugarch and add garch(1,1) ? There's all sorts of blogs out there that claim some success doing this. Here's a system using an arima model (and later a garch model) and system using an SVM model . You'll find a lot of good info on FOSS trading , particularly if you start reading the blogs on his blogroll. Whatever model you use, be sure to cross-validate and benchmark! I'd be very surprised if you found an arima, ets, or even garch model that could consistantly beat a naive model out-of-sample. Examples of time series cross-validation can be found here and here . Keep in mind that what you REALLY want to forecast is returns, not prices.
