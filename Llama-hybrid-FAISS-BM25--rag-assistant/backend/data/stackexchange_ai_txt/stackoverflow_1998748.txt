I'd assume the answer must be something like a couple of hours in a live time. Most contributors to open source projects submit only a single patch or fix, but since there are so many of them they a) add a lot to the projects b) drag down the average Even when you only count the developers with submit privilege on the version control system, the result probably isn't much different. Just look at the thousands of projects at source forge that never result in any substantial result.
