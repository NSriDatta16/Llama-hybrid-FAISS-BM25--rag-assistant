OpenGL: Can I mask wholly transparent fragments from the depth-buffer?

Is there a way to tell OpenGL not to write the depth of wholly transparent fragments into the depth buffer? Just be be sure, the texture I want to render is never semi-transparent; its alpha values are only ever 1.0 or 0.0, and I use the GL_NEAREST filter, so it never interpolates into any value in between. I would think that it would be reasonable for OpenGL to be able to simply not write into the depth buffer when a fragment turns out to have an alpha value of 0.0 (this way I could render primitives with such textures in any order), but I cannot find a way to make OpenGL do that. Does anyone know if it is possible and, in that case, how it is done?
