Can't really tell but here are some thoughts: Don't output anything before you exec the php script as php itself handles the response header. To call the script try exec "/path/to/php-cgi \"/path/to/script/foo.php\"" Hope I could help. EDIT You might wanna have a look at this post of Stuart Herbert. Particulary the part where he writes: #!/bin/bash /usr/bin/php-cgi "$@" This script simply executes our central copy of the PHP CGI executable, passing through whatever parameters Apache has called the bash script with.
