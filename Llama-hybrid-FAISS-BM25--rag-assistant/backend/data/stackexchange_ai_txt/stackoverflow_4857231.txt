This bug has the odor of dynamic data becoming too long for its preassigned (assigned at compile time, I mean) storage array, but I think the error message "buffer overflow" is just a coincidental red herring. As a first step, I would try doubling the sizes of all of my static arrays or, even better, increasing their sizes by a big number -- like 100,000 -- and I'd rerun the program. If the program runs OK, then you can go through the code to find the offending section. If the program still blows up, well, you're facing a bug that's harder to find. HTH -- pete
