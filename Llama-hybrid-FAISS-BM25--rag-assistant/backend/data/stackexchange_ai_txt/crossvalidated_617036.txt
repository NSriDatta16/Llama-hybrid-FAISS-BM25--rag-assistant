Changing scale and rounding off Target

I am training a regression machine learning model to predict an airplane's maximum take-off weight based on some pre-project features. The airplane weights in the dataset I'm working with are registered in kilograms. The model is not expected to be highly precise; it is intended to provide a robust estimation of the weight, with an accuracy of approximately 0.1 tons. Given these requirements, would the model benefit from a target transformation that changes its scale and rounds off the target value (e.g., changing 102,341 kg to 102.3 tons)? Or should I perform this transformation after my model predicts the weight? What should this process to be called?
