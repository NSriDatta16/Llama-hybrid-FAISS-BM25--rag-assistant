how to organize javascripts using rails and jquery

i'm working in a big and rich rails web application using tons of javascript. I would like to know if anybody has a tip to organize the javascripts. Today i'm generating a new file named controller.js and adding it to my views using content_for. The problem is, some files are becoming big and sometimes, i need a function from one controller in another, so then in the end, i add a products.js to a details controller just to keep DRY. Is that solution good? Any other tip? I think the same pattern can be applied as well to css files?
