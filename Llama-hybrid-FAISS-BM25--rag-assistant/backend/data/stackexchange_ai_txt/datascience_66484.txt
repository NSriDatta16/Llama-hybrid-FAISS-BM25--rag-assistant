Predict the average temperature for next 30 years

Objective: I want to predict the average temperature for next 30 years. Q1: What type of dataset is suitable for this (what columns should it contain) Q2: What are the independent variables for average temperature? Q3: Let's say I trained the model with 30% data. Does that mean predicted 30% is for next 30 years? Or is it present data? If not how do I predict the average temperature for next 30 years with the trained model?
