java.lang.Class#cast(Object) throws a ClassCastException if Class#isInstance() returns false. From the javadoc for that method: Determines if the specified Object is assignment-compatible with the object represented by this Class. This method is the dynamic equivalent of the Java language instanceof operator... Specifically, if this Class object represents a declared class, this method returns true if the specified Object argument is an instance of the represented class (or of any of its subclasses); it returns false otherwise. Since Parent is not a subclass of child, isInstance() returns false so cast() throws the exception. This may violate the principle of least astonishment but it's working the way it's documented - cast() can only upcast, not downcast.
