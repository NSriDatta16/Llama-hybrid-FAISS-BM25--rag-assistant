Use GROUP_CONCAT() . SELECT Type, GROUP_CONCAT(Value SEPARATOR ' ') AS Value FROM MyTable GROUP BY Type; Ensuring the words are concatenated in the order you want can be tricky, however. GROUP_CONCAT() has an ORDER BY clause (see the docs) but your example doesn't include any column that can be used to determine the order. Relying on the physical storage order isn't reliable.
