Your question makes one to wonder why you need to do PCA first. Are you going to reduce the dimensionality or just rotate the axes of space? Anyway. PCA is just a particular case of orthogonal rotation of axes (your variables) in space: newdata = olddata*Q where Q is the rotation matrix, called matrix of eigenvectors in PCA, you obtain this matrix via eigen-decomposition or singular-value-decomposition in any software that has matrix capabilities. You just use the above formula with both your 500000-row data and your 1-row "query point" data (you may actually concatenate into 500001 rows table). In this way you obtain new coordinates for all the 500001 points and you may proceed with whatever you like to do next.
