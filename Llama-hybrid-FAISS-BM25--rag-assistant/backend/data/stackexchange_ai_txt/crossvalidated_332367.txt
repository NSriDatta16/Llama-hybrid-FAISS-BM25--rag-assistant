Learning a distribution when observing a OR between several classes

I have a discrete categorical variable $X$ with values in $\{1,2,....m\}$, $m$ being rather small (say 10, 100...). I want to estimate the distribution of $X$: the histogram. If my dataset was made of $n$ (say 1000,10000...) observations of $X$ things would be very easy: $$p_i=\frac{\#i}{n}$$ Each line in my dataset is actually not a class but a disjunction of classes. For example a line says "$X$ is either 1 or 5 or 6". To test the method, I'm working with a generated dataset this way: for each line: pickup a random $x$ according to the distribution pickup a random part $A$ of $\{1,2,....m\}$ add the line $x\in A$ or $x\in\overline A$ depending on which is true Do you know how to estimate the distribution of $X$ in this case? So far, I've tried basic Bayesian inference with Dirichet prior, but it leads to nearly impossible computations (I still haven't tried MCMC). Maximum likelihood is also a possibility but it's not so easy. Do you see a good idea or relate it to some known problem?
