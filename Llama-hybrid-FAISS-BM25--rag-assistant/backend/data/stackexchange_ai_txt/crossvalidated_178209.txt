You seem to have a two-part question: 1) how to determine which model has the highest AUC, and 2) how to select the best model. For 1, I would say that in practice any of the methods you suggest would be fine. Chances are you're going to end up with a few models that have AUCs that are not statistically distinguishable. That then leads to 2 - if you can't really determine with certainty which model has the best AUC, how do you choose the "best" model? In part that depends on what you are trying to do with the model. Often in the "real world", model complexity is a consideration, since you may be implementing the model in a business process or have to explain it to a client. In that case, simpler is better (it's easier to implement and explain a logistic regression than a neural net). If the costs of the outcome are really high and/or implementation costs are not a concern, then I'd choose the one with the highest AUC.
