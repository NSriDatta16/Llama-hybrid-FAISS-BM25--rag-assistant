Your p-value looks to be correct. Consider that if the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniform; when you have many of them, you're effectively checking your collection of p-values for consistency with uniformity, against the alternative that they're smaller than you'd expect from a uniform (Fisher's method measures this degree of being too small in a particular way). Your values are skewed toward the low side (e.g. consider that 7 values are below 0.25, but only 2 are above 0.75). Fisher's approach can pick up that your p-values tend to be too small. If the p-values were from a uniform, they should lie close to the red line in this plot (the F values are uniform scores; essentially the ecdf shifted down by $\frac{1}{2n}$ (equivalently the average of the ecdf before and after the point)): We can see that the large p-values tend to be too small (they lie left of the line near the top of the plot). Because of that, the Fisher p-value is quite small.
