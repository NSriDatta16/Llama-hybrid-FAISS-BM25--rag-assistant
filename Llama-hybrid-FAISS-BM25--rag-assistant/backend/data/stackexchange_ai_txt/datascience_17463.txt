Designing CNN that does one column convolution across the x-axis

I am currently working on designing a certain number of CNN for extracting features from images. The images are spectogram, and each have a shape being (276,x,3). X is here the number of column, which incidently also the length of the feature vector that should be created. So the cnn somehow has to use a kernel that has to be 276 rows and 1 column wide, but is it possible in keras to make a 2d kernel and perform 1d convolution. The most important factor is the 1d convolution and the shape of the 2d kernel, as it is being used to alter the importance of some of the entries in the spectogram.
