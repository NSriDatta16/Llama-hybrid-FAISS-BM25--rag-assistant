unittest tests reuse for family of classes

I have problem organizing my unittest based class test for family of tests. For example assume I implement a "dictionary" interface, and have 5 different implementations want to testing. I do write one test class that tests a dictionary interface. But how can I nicely reuse it to test my all classes? So far I do ugly: DictType = hashtable.HashDict In top of file and then use DictType in test class. To test another class I manually change the DictType to something else. How can do this otherwise? Can't pass arguments to unittest classes so is there a nicer way?
