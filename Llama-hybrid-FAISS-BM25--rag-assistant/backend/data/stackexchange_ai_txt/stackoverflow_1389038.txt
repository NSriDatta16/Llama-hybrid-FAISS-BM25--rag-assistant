Why does data binding break in OneWay mode?

Here's a little XAML fragment. You will see 250 when you change the textbox value, the slider updates If you change the slider value explicitly, the previous behavior breaks a.k.a. stops working. If I remove the Mode=OneWay set directive, (defaults to two-way) everything works perfectly. Why is this happening?
