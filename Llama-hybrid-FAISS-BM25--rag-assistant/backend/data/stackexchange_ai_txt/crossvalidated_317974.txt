First, your high number of lags is not uncommon. It might be an artifact of the frequency. Box & Jenkins (1970) recommend a maximum of n/4 meaningful lags and Cowpertait & Metcalfe (2009) claim that the number of meaningful lags is no more than the frequency. Second, ARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average. So a linear repression with autoregressive coefficients (I'm also not sure what that might mean, exactly) would not have a moving average term like ARIMA might. It also would not include a differencing parameter to ensure stationarity. When you say 'practical' difference, that depends on your field. Results for a pharmacological study would be interpreted different than one for psychotherapy.
