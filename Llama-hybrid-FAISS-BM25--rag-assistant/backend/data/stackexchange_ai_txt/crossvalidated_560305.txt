I personally would only consider the first option. You can take each customer and predict if they will buy the next month. This is not limited to the next month and could be all kinds of time spans and you could even predict how many products they will buy. If you think that the history of your customers regarding sales, transactions and expenses is an indicator of the future of their buying behavior you should definitely treat this as a time series task. Ignoring this would most likely lead to future leakage and invalidate your results. This would be different if you predict some rather static property of the customers, e.g. if you only know for some of your customers if they are male/female/other you could train with the known examples and try to predict the missing values applying a CV strategy for validation. When you aggregate all the data in the second option, for your training: what would be your target variable and what would be the explaining variables? Right now, I simply don't see this option. If you would like to predict if someone is a potential buyer, you could have a hard time to find the negative examples. Which time span do you want to consider? You would have to wait potentially a long time before you can be sure that someone is not a buyer. You could create a proxy and do a poll instead (ask some people, if they would consider buying your product). But again, what time span? If someone will potentially buy the product in a year, would he know now? Could your model know?
