Feature contribution interview question I can't answer

A few weeks ago, I had an interview for a data science job. Of all the questions they asked me, I was unable to solve the following one. I couldn't even attempt it because I didn't know anything about it. I have researched, but I can't find any book, paper, blog, etc. that shows the question. So here's what I remember from the question: The following table has the "feature contribution" of feature i with observation j. Additionally, each feature is divided into different categories. Category 1 has features 1, 2, and 3, Category 2 has features 4 and 5, and Category 3 has only feature 6. Observation F1/C1 F2/C 1 F3/C1 F4/C2 F5/C2 F6/C3 1 -4 4 1 2 -2 0 2 2 1 -1 0 4 2 3 1 4 5 3 3 1 4 0 2 1 1 4 -3 5 -3 -2 0 -2 2 1 If I recall correctly, they asked me to obtain the feature importance of each category. So the expected result was three numbers, one for each category. During the interview, I attempted to calculate the means and sums and then means again, but the answer was never correct. Do any of you have any references on how to solve this problem?
