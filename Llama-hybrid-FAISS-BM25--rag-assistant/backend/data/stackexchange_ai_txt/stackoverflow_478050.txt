Something like overloading in PHP?

I'd like to accomplish something like this: Call a method, say "turn", and then have "turn" applied differently to different data types, e.g., calling "turn" with a "screwdriver" object/param uses the "turnScrewdriver" method, calling "turn" with a "steeringWheel" object/param uses the "turnSteeringWheel" method, etc. -- different things are being done, but they're both called "turn." I'd like to implement this so that the calling code needn't worry about the type(s) involved. In this example, "turn" should suffice to "turn" a "screwdriver", "steeringWheel", or whatever might need to be "turned." In C++ I'd do this with overloading -- and C++ would sort things out based on the datatype/signature -- but this doesn't work in PHP. Any suggestions as to where should I begin? A switch statement is obvious, but I'm thinking there must be a (more elegant) OO solution. No? TIA
