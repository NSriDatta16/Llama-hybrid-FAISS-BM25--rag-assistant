Bitfields should be avoided - they aren't very portable between compilers even for the same platform. from the C99 standard 6.7.2.1/10 - "Structure and union specifiers" (there's similar wording in the C90 standard): An implementation may allocate any addressable storage unit large enough to hold a bitfield. If enough space remains, a bit-field that immediately follows another bit-field in a structure shall be packed into adjacent bits of the same unit. If insufficient space remains, whether a bit-field that does not fit is put into the next unit or overlaps adjacent units is implementation-defined. The order of allocation of bit-fields within a unit (high-order to low-order or low-order to high-order) is implementation-defined. The alignment of the addressable storage unit is unspecified. You cannot guarantee whether a bit field will 'span' an int boundary or not and you can't specify whether a bitfield starts at the low-end of the int or the high end of the int (this is independant of whether the processor is big-endian or little-endian). Prefer bitmasks. Use inlines (or even macros) to set, clear and test the bits.
