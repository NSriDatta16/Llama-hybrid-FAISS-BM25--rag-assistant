The draws from MCMC form a Markov chain. From Gelman, Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd ed), p. 265: Markov chain simulation (also called Markov chain Monte Carlo or MCMC) is a general method based on drawing values of $\theta$ from appropriate distributions and then correcting those draws to better approximate the target posterior distribution, $p(\theta|y)$ . The sampling is done sequentially, with the distribution of the sampled draws depending on the last value drawn; hence, the draws form a Markov chain.
