Populating Knowledge Base - Stanford DeepMind Alternatives

I am dealing with the task to extract structured information from domain-specific unstructured documents. The end goal is to obtain a reliable, queryable system, i.e. in the form of a chat-bot or Question-Answering application. During my research I formulated following solution approach: Parse doc, docx and pdf documents to raw text. Pre-process with common NLP tools. Consult with client and decide upon several categories for entities. Train customised NER model to obtain entities from texts. Obtain entity-level-relations. Populate knowledge base Migrate knowledge base data to knowledge graph and set up the queryable system. For the implementation, I was looking into Stanfords Deepdive architecture, however they stopped support in 2017 and I am not sure if it is still up to date. Alternatively, I intended to use spaCy to train my own NER model, but it is unclear to me if this allows to obtain the entity-level-relations for populating a knowledge base. Could you advise me to alternatives to Deepdive or any other resources that demonstrate how to build up such a system from scratch?
