What would be a good randomization environment for data science?

I would like to know if there are any best practices to optimize random environment. Currently I use this simple structure in my config : from numpy.random import Generator, PCG64 rng = Generator(PCG64(42)) np.random.seed(42) I use the rng generator for all general purposes (draw following a certain distribution, permutation of index, synthetic datapoints, etc.) and use the legacy np.random.seed to set the random state of scipy for the rvs method of scipy.stats generators. I read somewhere in the sklearn doc (warning section here ) that the sklearn.model_selection module uses the same global seed, that would the global seed set with np.random.seed isn't it ? If you have a better understanding of how scipy and sklearn refers to the global seed and what would be a good default randomization setup, it would be very usefull. Thanks
