You mention stock returns. In that case the first few eigenvalues/singular values of the PCA turn out to have an explicit interpretation: The first singular value is closely related to the market portfolio: the eigenvector is a linear combination of the $z_i(t)$ with positive coefficients The next couple (say 5) of eigenvalues are typically related to style or sector portfolios, such as defensive vs. cyclical stocks. These stocks often go in and out of favor as a group, which shows up in a principal component decomposition. Beyond that there is noise, so the last singular value (your question #2) will not tell you anything. As for your question #3, you can for example try out a predictive regression, as discussed in this paper by Stambaugh
