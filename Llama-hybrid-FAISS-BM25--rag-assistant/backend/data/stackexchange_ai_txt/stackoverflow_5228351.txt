That's because when you request it using PHP (without any JS support) you're getting the main page of lifehacker - which is lifehacker.com. Lifehacker switched their CMS recently so that all requests go to an initial page and then everything after the hashbang is read by a JS script in the main page to figure out which page needs to be served. You need to modify your program to take this into account EDIT Have a gander at these links http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/02/09/Hash-Blecch
