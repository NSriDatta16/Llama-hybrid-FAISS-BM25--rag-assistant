No, RMSE is not a universally best way to measure performance of a model for the purpose of selection of best predictive model even without neural networks in the mix. For example if you are forecasting the likelihood of an event such as death or loan default RMSE is usually not a good measure of performance. It can be appropriate in some situations , such as when forecasting revenue of a store. Even here you must be careful if the price of under forecasting is different from price of over forecasting. Imagine you are forecast provisions for a solo trip across the ocean, you probably want to err on side of over forecasting and get too much food rather than too little. In this case instead of RMSE you would want to use a measure that is asymmetrical to the sign of forecasting error
