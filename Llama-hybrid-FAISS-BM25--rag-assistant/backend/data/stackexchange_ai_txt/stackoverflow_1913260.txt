You can set MIME headers using the CreateHeader method of NotesMIMEEntity . I've only ever used this when constructing a complete email programmatically in an agent, so not sure where to hook that into a document created from the client. The post save event should give you a document you can convert to MIME and then add the header, but it's likely to be a little fiddly. You'll have to try it out.
