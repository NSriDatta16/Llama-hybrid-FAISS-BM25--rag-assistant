If the customer is pushing for column encryption but you don't know where the the key will actually come from, your customer is wasting his money and you are wasting his time. Even more so if you are even thinking about fixed keys. There is an exhaustive explanation on MSDN explaining the key encryption hierarchy . All the schemes have the key chain rooted either in the DPAPI for the case where the service itself must access the encrypted storage w/o any key provided by the user, either in a password explicitly provided by the user. Encryption is a measure put in place to mitigate specific security threats. Depending on what those threats are (they are nowhere specified in your post) column level encryption may be the right answer, but almost always deploying Transparent Database Encryption is a much better solution. There is no encryption scheme that can hide the content from an administrator that desires to see the content. Period. Every solution that claims the contrary is snake oil.
