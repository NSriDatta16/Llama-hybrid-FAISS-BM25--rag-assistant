if you can't alter the html output and refactor as suggested by oskar (best case), this works: e.getParent().getParent().getNext().getFirst().getFirst() - it will return you the next div but it's slow. unfortunately, tables break .getNext("div.element") as it's not a sibling. another way that works is this (if their lengths match) - it will be MUCH faster if the reference is put in element storage as a 1-off: var tooglers = $$("div.toogler"), elements = $$("div.element"); tooglers.each(function(el, i) { console.log(elements[i]); el.store("contentEl", elements[i]); }); i don't like either solution though, not maintainable / scalable enough.
