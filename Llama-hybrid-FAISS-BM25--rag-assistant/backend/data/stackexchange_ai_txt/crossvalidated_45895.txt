multiplicative treatment effects with standard errors

I simplified this a fair bit after finding a draft version of the Imbens and Rubin chapter. I am interested in estimating a constant multiplicative treatment effect from a randomized experiment. I believe the DGP for my observed data to be something like \begin{equation} y_i=y_i^C\cdot(1+\beta)^T\cdot\varepsilon_i, \end{equation} where $y_i^C$ is the potential outcome in the untreated state and $T\in \{0,1\}$. Keele et al. (2012) cite Imbens and Rubin (2008) and suggest that you can interpret \begin{equation} \Delta_M=\left(\frac{1}{N_T}\sum_{T=1} \ln y_i^T\right)-\left(\frac{1}{N_C}\sum_{T=0} \ln y_i^C \right) \end{equation} as a constant multiplicative treatment effect. Imbens and Rubin actually make the assumption that $y_i=y_i^C\cdot\exp\{\beta\}^T,$ which is similar since $\exp\{\beta\}\approx1+\beta$. In my case, I think the derivation looks like this: \begin{equation} \Gamma_M=\frac{\left(\frac{1}{N_T}\sum \ln y_i^T\right)-\left(\frac{1}{N_C}\sum \ln y_i^C \right)}{\left(\frac{1}{N_C}\sum \ln y_i^C \right)}=\frac{\left(\frac{1}{N_T}\sum \ln y_i^C \cdot(1+\beta)\right)-\left(\frac{1}{N_C}\sum \ln y_i^C \right)}{\left(\frac{1}{N_C}\sum \ln y_i^C \right)}, \end{equation} which simplifies to $\beta$ if average untreated outcome for those in the treated group (potential and unobserved) is the same as the average outcome for the control group if untreated (observed). That should be the case with decent randomization. This is different than the Rubin/Imbens equation, but somewhat more complicated, so I will use their exponential model. Here's my question. How do I get a confidence interval for $\Delta_M$? Can I just run a regression of $\ln y$ on a treatment dummy to get standard errors?
