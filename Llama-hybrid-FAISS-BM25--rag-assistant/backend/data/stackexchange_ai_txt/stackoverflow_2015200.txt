I don't think javascript supports those lookaheads. Try /(.*[a-zA-Z].*[0-9].*[!@#$%_].*|.*[a-zA-Z].*[!@#$%_].*[0-9].*|.*[0-9].*[a-zA-Z].*[!@#$%_].*|.*[!@#$%_].*[a-zA-Z].*[0-9].*|.*[0-9].*[!@#$%_].*[a-zA-Z].*|.*[!@#$%_].*[0-9].*[a-zA-Z].*)/ Not expecting any points for elegance... Edit: As bdukes pointed out, js does support lookaheads. However, this (ugly) expression does work.
