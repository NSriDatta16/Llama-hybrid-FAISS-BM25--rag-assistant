An alternative to the one provided by @Kasra is dimensionality reduction . It's another way of solving your multicollinearity problems, while avoiding deleting variables more or less arbitrarily. You can use simpler, linear techniques such as PCA , or more complex non-linear techniques such as Autoencoders . t-SNE is a non-linear technique that is typically used for visualization, I do not recommend to use it for a Training set.
