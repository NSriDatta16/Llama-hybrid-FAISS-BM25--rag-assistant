I generally hold pretty controversial, strong and loud opinions, so here's just a couple of them: "Because we're a Microsoft outfit/partner/specialist" is never a valid argument. The company I'm working in now identifies itself, first and foremost, as a Microsoft specialist. So the aforementioned argument gets thrown around quite a bit, and I've yet to see a context where it's valid. I can't see why it's a reason to promote Microsoft's technology and products in every applicable corner, overriding customer and employee satisfaction, and general pragmatics. This just a cornerstone of my deep hatred towards politics in software business. MOSS (Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server) is a piece of shit. Kinda echoes the first opinion, but I honestly think MOSS, as it is, should be shot out of the market. It costs gazillions to license and set up, pukes on web standards and makes developers generally pretty unhappy. I have yet to see a MOSS project that has an overall positive outcome. Yet time after time, a customer approaches us and asks for a MOSS solution.
