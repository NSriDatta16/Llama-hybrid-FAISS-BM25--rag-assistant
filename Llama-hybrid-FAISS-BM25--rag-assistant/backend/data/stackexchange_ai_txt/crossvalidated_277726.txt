I would start out planning the experiment in the same way I had done ("as if") the response variable was continuous (the basic principles of experimental design, replication, orthogonality, blocking, ... is the same for continuous and ordinal response variables). But then doing the analysis using an ordinal logistic model. Then the analysis of variance is replaced by "analysis of deviance". Maybe doing some simulation to check upon sample size, in the simulation you must use the ordinal logistic regression.
