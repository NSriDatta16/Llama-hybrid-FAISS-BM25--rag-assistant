I use project files all the time. For example, you might have environmental variables you set on a per project basis (locations of things), or files you want ignored in the file listing. What I do is create a folder, in each project, called _PERSONAL, and put my TextMate project file in there. This approach works very well for me. As for files not getting automatically added, there are kind of two ways to create a project: File → New Project, then drag folders into the project. Open a directory, then go to File → Save Project Approach #2 will automatically add new folders/files as they are added to the directory tree. Approach #1 is more static.
