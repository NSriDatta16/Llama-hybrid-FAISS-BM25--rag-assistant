cygwin compile error in sys/_types.h

I am trying to use cywin to get some linux code building on a win32 machine. I get the following VS.net 2003 error in ym compiler: "c:\cygwin\usr\include\sys_types.h(15): error C2144: syntax error : '__int64' should be preceded by ';' " and c:\cygwin\usr\include\sys_types.h(15): error C2501: ' extension ' : missing storage-class or type specifiers The code line is __extension__ typedef long long _off64_t; Obviously I am missing something here but I have never used cygwin before and this is killing me. I want to be able to at least compile my CPP files on my win32 machine for a few reasons. (this is just the first two errors of hundreds it looks like) thanks, tim EDIT: the simple workaround I have chosen as the answer - though I do understand that is not as complete or as desirable as using gcc to compile... This is a quick and dirty compilation so that I can use my familiar tools before trying to integrate with linux machines. (oh the joys of cross-platform development) I've voted up each of those answers so far and appreciate the help)
