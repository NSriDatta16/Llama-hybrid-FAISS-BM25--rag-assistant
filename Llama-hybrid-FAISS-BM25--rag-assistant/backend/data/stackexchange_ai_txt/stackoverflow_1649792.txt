Yes, the problem is by default, the method Request.Browser.IsMobileDevice returns true for any User Agent it doesn't know about. The trick is to add another .browsers file that identifies all the bots (this will happen with all of them, Yahoo, MSN, etc.) as NOT mobile devices. I put a ticket in about this and explain it in detail here: http://mdbf.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=3906
