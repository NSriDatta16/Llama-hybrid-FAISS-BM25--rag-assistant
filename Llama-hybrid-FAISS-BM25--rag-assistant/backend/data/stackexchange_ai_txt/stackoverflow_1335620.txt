In HTTP, Prompt to Save and XML File Rather Then Render

In a Web Application I am creating, users can backup their data locally. The backup data is an XML file. At the moment, most browsers try to display this file. What should I change in the HTTP response to suggest to a user-agent that the file should instead be saved?
