From Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd ed., p. 355: The standard noninformative prior distribution In the normal regression model, a convenient noninformative prior distribution is uniform on $(\beta, \log \sigma)$ or, equivalently, $$p(\beta,\sigma^2|X) \propto\sigma^{-2}$$ ( $X$ referring to the regressors.) The book contains useful further discussion beyond the scope of this question: When this prior is useful, when others are better suited, its posterior, and comparison to classical estimates.
