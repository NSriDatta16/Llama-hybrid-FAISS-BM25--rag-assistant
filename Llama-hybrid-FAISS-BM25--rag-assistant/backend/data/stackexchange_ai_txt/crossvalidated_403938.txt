How to compute measures of dispersion and statistical significance of the impacts of a panel Spatial Durbin model (SDM)?

I ran a panel Spatial Durbin model (SDM) and computed the summary measures of impacts (direct, indirect and total). Now, I would like to get measures of dispersion for the impacts estimates as well as the statistical significance of the impacts. How can I get such measures ? Here is a reproducible example: ########### set.seed(1234) library(plm) library(splm) data(Produc, package = "plm") data(usaww) # Create spatially lagged independent variables WX using slag() Produc2 $pcap_SL pcap), mat2listw(usaww)) Produc2 $pc_SL pc), mat2listw(usaww)) Produc2 $emp_SL emp), mat2listw(usaww)) Produc2 $unemp_SL unemp), mat2listw(usaww)) # Define formula fm $year)) N state)) library(Matrix) s.lws $spat.coef * s.lws IrWi coefficients[2] + s.lws * sdm$coefficients[6]) # direct impact dir_imp
