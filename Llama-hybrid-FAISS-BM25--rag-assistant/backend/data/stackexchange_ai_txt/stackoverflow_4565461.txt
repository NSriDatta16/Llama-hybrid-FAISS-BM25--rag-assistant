I had the same problem. I found a work around, though. You need to create the component using Flash Builder by dragging a Flash Professional Component onto your application. (You must be in Design Mode to do this.) Then, in the properties sheet, there will be a button labeled "Create In Flash Professional..." Clicking this button will create a Flash Document with all the correct frameworks and sdks and launch Flash Professional.
