You could use the UTF-7 encoding to store arbitrary Unicode strings in a 7bit encoding. The UTF-7 encoding of Unicode text happens to be perfectly legal ASCII text. Of course this would require special attention wherever you want to use the values, because they are not readable as-is (and UTF-7 is used rarely enough that you probably don't have support for it everywhere). Alternatively, you could go with a more common encoding such as BASE64, but that has the drawback that even almost-ASCII text is completely unreadable in that encoding. That means that you don't get at least something human-readable, when some part does not handle the encoding correctly.
