I don't agree that you necessarily will gain much from logistic regression, given my understanding of your research questions (To what degree do OptIns differ from NonOptIns? Do we see more than chance differences?). You've already determined using your own criteria that, for each of 3 X's, there is a statistically significant group difference but a weak one. The weakness of the difference can be expressed in the mean difference, the standardized mean difference, or the point-biserial correlation with the OptIn variable, which is the technical name for the type of correlation you've calculated. I question your need for logistic regression because you haven't said anything about wanting to see to what degree the 3 X's can jointly predict the outcome; about learning the relative importance of each when the other two are controlled; or about assigning predicted probabilities of opting in for each person. Those (among others) are the sorts of things logistic regression would give you.
