A machine learning model (simple or neural net) is agnostic of the image type or the object depicted. That is because in both cases images consist of pixels (i.e a matrix of numbers with a certain range) and a CNN model, for instance, will identify a dog or a drawing based on the image's pixels pattern (in a very high level). Therefore, both tasks can be considered similar or at least models with similar architectures can be constructed, providing correct labels are given.
