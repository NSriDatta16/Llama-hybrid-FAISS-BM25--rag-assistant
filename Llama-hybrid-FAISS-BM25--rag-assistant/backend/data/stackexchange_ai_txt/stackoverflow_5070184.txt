One thing you can try is you can use the approach that is described in the Facebook developers section dedicated to authentication . You want the section that is called "Client-side flow". In a nutshell they propose that you make an application that will redirect the page it is loaded in to a special URI with it's app_id and backurl in the query parameters. Once Facebook manages your app's permissions, it will redirect the user back to your page with a special access token in a URI fragment, e.g. http://example.com/my_app_page/#token=foobar . This way only your script on the client side can access this token and use it to make requests to the Facebook API.
