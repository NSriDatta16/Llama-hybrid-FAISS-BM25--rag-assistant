You could use a combination of UIBezierPath and CAKeyFrameAnimation. I found a very useful blog post dealing with this subject. http://oleb.net/blog/2010/12/animating-drawing-of-cgpath-with-cashapelayer/ Here's a simplified version of what I used (it just animates the drawing of a square): UIBezierPath *customPath = [UIBezierPath bezierPath]; [customPath moveToPoint:CGPointMake(100,100)]; [customPath addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(200,100)]; [customPath addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(200,200)]; [customPath addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(100,200)]; [customPath addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(100,100)]; UIImage *movingImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"foo.png"]; CALayer *movingLayer = [CALayer layer]; movingLayer.contents = (id)movingImage.CGImage; movingLayer.anchorPoint = CGPointZero; movingLayer.frame = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, movingImage.size.width, movingImage.size.height); [self.view.layer addSublayer:movingLayer]; CAKeyframeAnimation *pathAnimation = [CAKeyframeAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"position"]; pathAnimation.duration = 4.0f; pathAnimation.path = customPath.CGPath; pathAnimation.calculationMode = kCAAnimationLinear; [movingLayer addAnimation:pathAnimation forKey:@"movingAnimation"];
