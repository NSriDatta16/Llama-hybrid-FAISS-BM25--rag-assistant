HttpWebRequest does not include "Pragma: no-cache" header when doing a POST

I'm using an HttpWebRequest that has a CachePolicy of HttpRequestCacheLevel.Reload . When doing a GET the "Pragma: no-cache" header is in the request (as tracked through Fiddler). But when doing the exact same request using a POST then the "Pragma: no-cache" header is not included. Is there a reason for this? Is it a bug? And is there a workaround? Thanks. EDIT: Just to be clearer about my goal. I want to have my POST request made using HttpWebRequest to include the "Pragma: no-cache" header, regardless of whether it is required or not. I thought setting the HttpWebRequest.CachePolicy to Reload alone would accomplish this. The reason I need this is because the site I'm making the request against does some checks for this header and is expecting it.
