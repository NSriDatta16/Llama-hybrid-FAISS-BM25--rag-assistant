You write I want to know what are the objects that are showing the most significant changes between the two conditions I think "significant" is misused here. To establish significance, you need a hypothesis. If you mean "largest" then you can just look at delta. You then look at a distribution of differences of ranks (1 million ranks!) and ask about it. But that distribution could be used to test the significance of your own whole distribution against that distribution. E.g. if your ranks were more likely to be close to 0, then the average delta would be lower. But you say you don't want that. So, just use delta.
