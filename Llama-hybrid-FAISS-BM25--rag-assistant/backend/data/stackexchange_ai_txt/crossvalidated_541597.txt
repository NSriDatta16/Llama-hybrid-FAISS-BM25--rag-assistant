Machine learning: order of input values influence the output?

Suppose my training input values to a machine learning model are arranged as $X=[x_1, x_2, x_3]$ in the first place. Then, if I rearrange them into $X=[x_2, x_1, x_3]$ with the same training $Y$ , I find that the predicted result of the test set would change a little for random forest and neural network models but not for linear regression. I'm wondering is this a normal phenomenon, and does it caused by the random nature of random forest and neural network?
