Another approach is to store a GUID (if available). For example, if your database schema looks something like this... user_id (UniqueIdentifier, primary key) username (varchar) password_hash (varchar) password_salt (varchar) Then I'd store the user_id and username in IsolatedStorage . When a user returns those variables will pass into a special function in your WCF service to authenticate. And as long as the user_id is never displayed to users then this can be a secure method with no chance of compromising the password. By the way, I came up with this idea originally for a site that uses OpenID and therefore has no passwords.
