I like spider-web (radar/star) plots for multiple variables. The Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register which I work with have nice spider plots that convey multiple variables nicely: For an example on how to create them I've found the plotrix package (R), their example(radial.plot) has an example that shows how to create the plot: ion.names diamondplot() in the same package may also be an alternative. UPDATE I've looked at the dataset and I've tried to figure out how to group the variables: # I've saved the file as a csv so that it's easier to import it library(foreign) my_data remove all rows without id my_cleaned_data 0) # Check that only 1 & 2 table(my_cleaned_data$org_colour) table(my_cleaned_data$decision_colour) # Factor and label the original colours # - not really necessary step but it's always nice to know your data my_cleaned_data$org_colour = factor(my_cleaned_data$org_colour, levels=c(1, 2), labels=c("red", "blue")) my_cleaned_data$decision_colour = factor(my_cleaned_data$decision_colour, levels=c(1, 2), labels=c("red", "blue")) # Create the outcome variable my_cleaned_data$same_colour = my_cleaned_data$org_colour==my_cleaned_data$decision_colour # Aggregate by the variables that your interested in # This part gets an average for the same colour & that id # I'm a little uncertain if no_GREEN may affect the average for that subject # since it is a variable that may change within the subject and the whole point # of this part is to aggregate by the id variable t Adding more complexity shouldn't be that hard. The same_color indicates the proportion with the same colour. This gives a graph: I guess you need to ask yourself what the seeker/hider means and how their colours depend. If you want to know if they change colours depending on some base colour information it shouldn't matter that you merge the two into one variable since the don't overlap. I find it easier to calculate the change in this way.
