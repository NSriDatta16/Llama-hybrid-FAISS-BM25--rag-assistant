Pseudo code is writing out the code in form that is like code but not quite code. So for opening a file and printing printing out its lines of text if file exists(path_to_file) then : open (path_to_file) for each line in file : print the line of the file All you should do is create the sequence of steps needed for your problem and write it out like that. Since you mention python, just use use a more python like syntax in your pseudo code. I suspect that you problem will be to encourage you to consider how to make functions and classes, and writing the pseudo code first will help you do this.
