ADF is free if you use Weblogic, otherwise you need to buy a runtime license for third-party servers. I dun hv experience in running adf in other servers but it seems technically you could do that according to the above. I guess it's recommended to use Business Component instead of other ORM framework, BC has a lot of drag-and-drop and binding features. However, ADF is compatible with Spring, EJB, Hibernate. Though sometimes it's painful to use JDeveloper, It's not a good idea to use other IDE for ADF. The BC feature is tied to the IDE, declarative component feature might be the same. The task flow definition may not be visually editable in Eclipse. Not an ADF expert (so I used a lot "may","guess"), this is what I know.
