The perfect solution for this kind of thing is Picasa (from Google ofcourse) You get: 1gb of free storage space on a Google Picasaweb account that already has a web interface with embeddable slideshows and stuff A compete image browse and upoad program for the client side (namely Picasa) that's directly connected to the web albums. It's so user friendly that even your grandma can put her pictures online with that. RSS feeds and an API from google. there's a custom light-weight PHP api available Need anyting else? Note from Chris to others that may be looking for an answer: The API can be found here .
