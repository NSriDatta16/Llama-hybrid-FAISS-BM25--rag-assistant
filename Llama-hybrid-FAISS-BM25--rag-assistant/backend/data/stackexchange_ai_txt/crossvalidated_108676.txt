If two time series $X$ and $Z$ follow $0 \leq Z \leq X$, can we say that $\text{var}(Z) \leq \text{var}(X)$?

Now I see it can't hold. Thank you for the counter examples... You guys rule! Thank you very much for your comments! I added, however, some observations that were missing. Most importantly is the fact that we can assume that there exist a positive covariance between X and Y. At first, it seemed to me that it would be easy to demonstrate... but I still did not manage to solve this problem. Can you guys give me a hand? Suppose we make use of $\mathbf{i)}$ a time series $X = [x_1,...,x_N]$ containing only positive entries (i.e. $0 \leq x_i$ for all $i$), $\mathbf{ii)}$ a vector of weights of the same of length given by $Y = [y_1,...,y_N]$ where $0 \leq y_i \leq 1$ for all $i$ to build $\mathbf{iii)}$ a time series $Z = [z_1,...,z_N]$, where the $i$th term is given by $z_i = x_i y_i$, i.e., $Z = [x_1 y_1,...,x_N y_N]$. Clearly, as $Y \in [0,1]$, we have that $0 \leq Z \leq X$ for all $i$. $\mathbf{Question)}$ Can we demonstrate that $\text{var}(Z) \leq \text{var}(X)$? For example, if $X = [2, 6, 99, 12, 3, 1]$ and $Y = [0.34, 0.01, 0.2, 1, 0.3, 0.17]$, we have $ Z = [x_1 y_1,...,x_N y_N] = [0.68, 0.06, 19.8, 12, 0.9, 0.17]$ $ \widehat{\sigma}^{2}_{X} = 1494.70$ $ \widehat{\sigma}^{2}_{Z} = 69.81$ $\mathbf{Important} \text{ } \mathbf{observations}$: 1) $X$ and $Y$ are stationary, ergodic random processes 2) $X$ is not a constant time series, in a sense that $\text{var}(X) \geq 0$ 3) It can be assumed that $\text{var}(X) \geq \text{var}(Y) \geq 0$ 4) There exist a positive covariance $X$ between and $Y$ Possible implication of 4)? As $0 \leq Z \leq X$, we could define a given time series $W \geq 0$ such as $Z + W = X$. Thus, $\text{var}(X) = \text{var}(Z + W) = \text{var}(Z) + \text{var}(W) + 2\text{cov}(Z,W)$. Note that if $\text{cov}(Z,W) \geq 0$ then $\text{var}(X) \geq \text{var}(Z)$ because $\text{var}(W)$ is also greater than zero. Does the fact that $\text{cov}(X,Y) \geq 0$ infer that $\text{cov}(Z,W) \geq 0$? There is any condition that guarantees $\text{cov}(Z,W) > 0$ Why I was so convinced about $\text{var}(Z) \leq \text{var}(X)$? In the application I am interested in, I have observed that the relation $\text{var}(Z) \leq \text{var}(X)$ is attended at every time I run my algorithm. If I cannot demonstrate that $\text{var}(Z) \leq \text{var}(X)$ holds given the observations 1) to 4), I would like to know what is forcing that relation, like, for example, $\text{cov}(Z,W) \geq 0$ as mentioned above. Thanks again for the replies! Cheers
