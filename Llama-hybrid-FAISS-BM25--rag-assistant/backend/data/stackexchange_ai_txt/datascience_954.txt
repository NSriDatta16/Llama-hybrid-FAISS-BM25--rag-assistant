OpenNLP Coreference Resolution (German)

I need to do coreference resolution for German texts and I plan to use OpenNLP to perform this task. As far as I know OpenNLP coreference resolution does not support the German language. Which components/data do I need to adapt the code such that it is possible to perform coreference resolution for German texts?
