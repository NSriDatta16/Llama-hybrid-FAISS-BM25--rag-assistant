The [...] represents a character class, so this: [(\*\*)|(\r\n\r\n)] Is effectively the same as this: [*|\r\n] i.e. it matches a single "*" and the "|" isn't an alternation. Another problem is that you replace the double linefeed. Even if your match succeeded you would end up merging paragraphs. You need to either restore it or not consume it in the first place. I'd use a positive lookahead to do the latter. In Perl I'd write it this way: $string =~ s/\*\*(.*?)(?:\*\*|(?=\n\n))/ $1 /sg; Taking a wild guess, the ColdFusion probably looks like this: REreplace(out, "\*\*(.*?)(?:\*\*|(?=\r\n\r\n))", " \1 ", "all")
