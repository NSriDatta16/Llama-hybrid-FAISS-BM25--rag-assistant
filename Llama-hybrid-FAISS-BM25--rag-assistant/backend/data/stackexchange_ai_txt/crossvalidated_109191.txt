Inconsistent x-y relationship from paired t-test and linear regression

I am analyzing an experiment comparing the effect of treatment A vs. B on the matched subject. Here are the measurements on 34 subjects: A B -1.15 -1.16 -1.13 -0.94 -0.16 -1.18 -0.37 -1.20 -1.09 -1.20 -1.20 -1.20 -0.94 -1.20 -0.84 -1.16 -1.18 -1.17 -1.20 -1.11 -0.78 -0.68 -0.83 -0.73 -1.05 -1.20 -0.71 -1.20 0.07 0.12 -1.20 -0.98 -1.20 -1.20 -1.02 -1.17 -0.28 -0.84 1.33 1.47 -1.19 -1.20 -1.20 -1.17 -0.40 -1.20 0.66 -0.21 -0.63 0.21 -0.88 -1.16 -0.46 -1.20 -0.76 -1.20 -0.38 -1.20 -0.67 -0.97 -0.90 -1.20 -0.90 -1.20 -1.20 -1.15 -1.01 -0.79 The differences between the two treatment (dat[,"A"]-dat[,"B"]) looks normally distributed. I first applied a paired t-test: t.test(dat$A, dat$B, alternative = c("two.sided"), mu = 0, paired = TRUE) Paired t-test data: dat$A and dat$B t = 2.894, df = 33, p-value = 0.006692 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.05870022 0.33659390 sample estimates: mean of the differences 0.1976471 The paired t-test indicates that on average treatment A has a significantly higher measurement than treatment B. On the other hand, I applied a linear model on A~B: mod1 |t|) (Intercept) -0.03345 0.12739 -0.263 0.795 B 0.75111 0.11801 6.365 3.79e-07 *** The 95% confidence interval of the coefficient for B (0.51-0.99) does not cover 1. This result indicates that treatment A has on average a smaller measurement than treatment B, which is contradictory to the findings from the t-test. Can anyone help me to explain these contradictory findings? and to expand my question: Does a paired t-test (test mean of difference against 0) equal to a linear regression without intercept (test the coefficient against 1)? I mean in terms of testing against the null hypothesis, rather than the estimate or the meaning of the coefficient. Because both tests are testing against the null hypothesis that $B_{i}-A_{i}=\epsilon_{i}$.
