You have to choose your container according to what you're going to do with it. Relevant actions are: extending (with push ), insertion (may not be needed at all), extraction, deletion. At cplusplus.com , there is a very nice overview of the operations per container type. If the operation is push -bound, it makes sense that the vector beats all others. The good thing about deque is that it allocates fixed chunks, so will make more efficient use of fragmented memory.
