Tools for visualisation: making a video of a sliding windows moving on the time series

I have a Neural Network (an autoencoder) that gets as the input a time-window of length M from a time series of length N , ( M ), and transforms it to another same dimensional time-window. In purpose of visualization, I want to make a video that shows input of the NN in the top of the frame and the corresponding output in the bottom of the frame, runnig the NN on consecutive windows. I was wondering if you could introduce me some tools or give me some hints on this.
