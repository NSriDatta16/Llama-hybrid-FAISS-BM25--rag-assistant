As you found out, MongoDB and CouchDB have strong opinions about how you store your data. If you're looking for a storage agnostic approach, you'll want to do something like @Joshua suggests and look at Cassandra or HBase. Even these two datastores have opinions about how data should be stored (they're both based on Google's Bigtable ) and store data in column families . Riak uses protocol buffers as one method of serializing data from your application into the datastore. It might be worth checking out to see if it fits your needs. It looks like you're largely planning to do single key lookups, so Riak may be a strong contender for your solution.
