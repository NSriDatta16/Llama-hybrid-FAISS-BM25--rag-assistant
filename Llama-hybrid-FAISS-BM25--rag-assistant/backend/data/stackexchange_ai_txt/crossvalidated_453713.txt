Is this an appropriate use of bootstrapping? variability in a fleet's fuel economy

I have a data set consisting of the make and models of a diverse fleet of vehicles (e.g. 100 Honda Civics, 200 Ford F150s, 10 Tesla Model 3s). My goal is to estimate the average fuel economy of the fleet, as well as of sub-groupings like compact cars and trucks. I have no information about model years (or engine) but there's certainly a wide range of model years present. I found a government database that lists the fuel economy by model year/engine. I calculated my estimates by averaging across all engines/years (e.g. my estimate of fuel economy for Honda Civics is the average of the fuel economy of every sort of Civic sold in a given year, then averaged over the last 20 years). I'm not really satisfied with this estimate but that's another story. I'm considering randomly choosing a model year/engine for each individual car, calculating the fleet emissions, then repeating the process. My goal is to get sense of the variability in my original estimate and report an interval. Can I use this method to calculate an interval (even a very wide one) that plausibly contains the true fleet economy? Can someone point me to any refinements to this method that I can look into?
