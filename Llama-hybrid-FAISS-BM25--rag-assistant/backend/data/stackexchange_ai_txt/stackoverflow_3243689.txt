How to Deactivate "Enter Key" when using jQueryUI Dialog Confirmation

I am having some issue with the enter key within IE6 together with the jQuery UI Dialog confirmation box that has just an "Ok" button on it. $("#myBox").dialog({ autoOpen: false, closeOnEscape: false, resizable: false, modal: true, draggable: false, position: ["center", 100], buttons: { 'Ok': function() { $(this).dialog("close"); closeReq(); } } }); Basically, I only want the dialog box together with any additional function calls against the "Ok" to close/fire function, only when the user clicks on the "Ok" button. At the moment, I allow the user to press the "Enter" to fire off the retrieval of some info and then based on some validation of this data, I produce a modal jQuery UI dialog box but seems to autmatically close from the user's pressing of the "Enter Key" from the start. How can I prevent this from occuring, i.e. deactivate the "Enter" key in IE6 for this jQueryUI Dialog Message box? Thanks.
