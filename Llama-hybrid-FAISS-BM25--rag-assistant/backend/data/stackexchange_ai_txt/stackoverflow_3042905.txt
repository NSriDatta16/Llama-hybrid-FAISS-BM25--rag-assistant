Difference between two commands of fetching Shopping Cart Items in Magento

In Magento, if you need to get / fetch the Shopping Cart's Item details, you can do it in any of the two possible ways, which will provide you with all the shopped Items in an array:- $cartItems1 = $cart->getQuote()->getAllItems(); $cartItems2 = $cart->getItems()->getData(); But before using any one of the above two methods, you need to initialize the shopping cart object as:- $cart = new Mage_Checkout_Model_Cart(); $cart->init(); Can anyone please describe in details as to what the two options provide & their differences between each other, along with their possible usage. In any more such option is available in Magento, can anyone please highlight it?
