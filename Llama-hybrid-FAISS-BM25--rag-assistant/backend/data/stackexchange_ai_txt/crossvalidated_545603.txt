I have been looking for the three types of R-squared of the Fixed Effects model outputs in R as well. I was able to manually calculate and reproduce lfe 's full and proj R-squared using the model fit from the standard lm package. That said, I am quite certain that the full R-sq is straightforward, meaning R-sq of all pairs of predicted values and original values. At the same time, their proj R-squared is also identical to the so-called within R-squared (definitions from STATA ), which is the default reported R-squared in the plm package. After reading STATA manual Page 10 briefly, I think the full R-sq in lfe and overall R-sq in STATA are the same idea. I see some people said overall R-sq is a weighted average of within and between R-sq, but I did not see any supporting evidence for this statement. I only see that both overall and full R-sq are directly calculated from the pairs of predicted y and original y. Below are my own calculations for full and proj R-sq. fe_lm_mod $entity[notmiss],mean)[dataframe$ entity][notmiss] # Calculate within R2 SStot_within For between R-sq, I think the plm package with model="between" may produce between R-sq, but I am not very sure. One can try to calculate it based on the STATA manual, like what I did for full and within R-sq. Finally I made a summary for the R-sq outputs: lm R-sq: not good for Fixed Effects model, cannot reproduce lfe "full" R-sq: R-sq for all pairs predicted y and original y, may also be called as "overall" R-sq lfe "proj" R-sq: "within" R-sq: how much of the variation in the dependent variable within each entity group is captured by the model plm model="within" R-sq: same as 3. plm model="between" R-sq: "between" R-sq: how much of the variation in the dependent variable between each entity group is captured by the model plm model="pooling" R-sq: not good for Fixed Effects model. This is the standard OLS R-sq. It is not a Fixed Effects model R-sq.
