Product of independent beta distribution and gamma distribution

I'm reading Bayesian Forecasting and Dynamic Models by Mike West and Jeff Harrison. The following conclusion is about the variance discounting in dynamic linear regression model. On page 362, it says, Dynamic of precision, $\phi_t=\gamma_t\phi_{t-1}/\delta$ Filtered precision distribution, $\phi_{t-1} \sim Gamma(n_{t-1}/2,d_{t-1}/2) $ Discounting factor, $\gamma_t \sim Beta(\delta n_{t-1}/2,(1-\delta) n_{t-1}/2) $ $\delta \in (0,1]$ . Predicted precision distribution is, $$\phi_t \sim Gamma(\delta n_{t-1}/2,\delta d_{t-1}/2) $$ How to derive the predicted precision distribution? I tried to apply transformation $U=\phi_t=\gamma_t\phi_{t-1}/\delta$ and auxiliary variable $V=\gamma_t$ . $$f_{U,V}(u,v) = f_{\gamma_t,\phi_{t-1}}(\gamma_t,\phi_{t- 1})|J(u,v)|$$ $J(u,v)$ is the Jacobian w.r.t to $U$ and $V$ . But I can't integrate out $V$
