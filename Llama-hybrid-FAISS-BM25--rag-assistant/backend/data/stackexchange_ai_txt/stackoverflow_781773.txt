That's a HEAD request to a bucket: HEAD /my-s3-bucket Which will basically just tell you that a bucket exists (200 OK), or not (404 Not Found). For Example: # curl -v -X HEAD http://s3.amazonaws.com/fooXXXX * About to connect() to s3.amazonaws.com port 80 (#0) * Trying 72.21.211.144... connected * Connected to s3.amazonaws.com (72.21.211.144) port 80 (#0) > HEAD /fooXXXX HTTP/1.1 > User-Agent: curl/7.18.2 (i486-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.18.2 OpenSSL/0.9.8g zlib/1.2.3.3 libidn/1.10 > Host: s3.amazonaws.com > Accept: */* > Vs. # curl -v -X HEAD http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3hub * About to connect() to s3.amazonaws.com port 80 (#0) * Trying 72.21.207.135... connected * Connected to s3.amazonaws.com (72.21.207.135) port 80 (#0) > HEAD /s3hub HTTP/1.1 > User-Agent: curl/7.18.2 (i486-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.18.2 OpenSSL/0.9.8g zlib/1.2.3.3 libidn/1.10 > Host: s3.amazonaws.com > Accept: */* >
