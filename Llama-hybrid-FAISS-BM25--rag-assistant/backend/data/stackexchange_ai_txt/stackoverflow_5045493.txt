Magento - product options view or controller file

In the file $MAGENTO_PATHapp/design/frontend/base/default/template/catalog/product/view/options/wrapper.phtml , I see the following line of code: getChildHtml('', true, true);?> This is responsible for printing the product options on the product page. I want to understand and modify the html content that this line of code produces, but I can't seem to locate the view or controller relevant to it. For example, let's say I want to programmatically add the characters &nbsp; to the innerHTML of each option element in a drop down, which phtml, php or html file do I edit? I'm hoping an answer to this question will help me understand how to retrieve product options, which in turn will help me solve this more immediate problem: Magento - Query for Product Options
