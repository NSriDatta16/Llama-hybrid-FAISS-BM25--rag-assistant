Why estimate what you can measure? In essence, it's impossible to provide any meaningful estimate due to the fact that different types of images (in terms of their content) will compress very differently using the JPEG algorithm. (A 1024x768 pure white image will be vastly smaller than a photograph of a crowd scene for example.) As such, if you're after an accurate figure it would make sense to simply carry out the re-size. Alternatively, you could just provide an range such as "40KB to 90KB", based on an "average" set of images.
