If it's not possible to detect this from the user-agent string then there are two other options. Are any other identifying headers being sent specifically from the browser? (Probably not if you've got issues with user-agent rewriting or, presumably, proxies.) Look at a way of detecting this in the browser with javascript. For javascrpt based detection, try using one or more of: navigator.appName; navigator.appVersion; navigator.appCodeName; navigator.platform;
