The error means that form["id"] failed to find the key "id" in cgi.FieldStorage() . To test what keys are in the called URL, use cgi.test() : cgi.test() Robust test CGI script, usable as main program. Writes minimal HTTP headers and formats all information provided to the script in HTML form. EDIT: a basic test script (using the python cgi module with Linux path) is only 3 lines. Make sure you know how to run it on your system, then call it from a browser to check arguments are seen on the CGI side. You may also want to add traceback formatting with import cgitb; cgitb.enable() . #!/usr/bin/python import cgi cgi.test()
