Comment: This should get you started, if you pay attention to my notation, which may differ from yours. Make necessary adjustments, fill in any gaps, and continue. Let $B_i \sim \mathsf{Bern}(p),$ with $\mu = E(B_i) = p$ and $\sigma = SD(B_i) = \sqrt{pq}.$ Also, $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n B_i \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n,p)$ and $\bar X = \frac{1}{n}S_n,$ where $E(\bar X) = p\,,$ $Var(\bar X) = pq/n,\,$ $SD(\bar X) = \sqrt{pq/n}.$ So $$Z = \frac{\bar X - p}{\sqrt{pq/n}} = \frac{n\bar X - np}{\sqrt{npq}} = \frac{S_n - np}{\sqrt{npq}}.$$
