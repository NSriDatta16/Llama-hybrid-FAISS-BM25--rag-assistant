Elegant way to get ExternalInterface working with all browsers

I want to call a function inside a Flash movie from javascript, using the ExternalInterface class. The problem is that to get it to work with Firefox I need to use the embed element and with the rest I have to get the object element. To solve it, I gave different ids to that two elements and depending on the user agent I select one or the other: function getMovie(movieName) { alert(navigator.userAgent); if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firefox") != -1) { return document["flash_embed"]; } else { return document["flash_object"]; } } This works, but it is not very elegant and it may not work with other browsers... Do you know a better way to do this?
