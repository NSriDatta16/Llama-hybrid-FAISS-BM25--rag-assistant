The function responsible for plotting the ACF in the package is called .plot.garchfit.4 . It is not hard to modify it to produce plots for time series. acf_rugarch = function(x, ...) { T = length(x) insample = 1:T xseries = x lag.max = as.integer(10*log10(T)) acfx = acf(xseries, lag.max = lag.max, plot = FALSE) clim0 = qnorm((1 + 0.95)/2)/sqrt(acfx$n.used) ylim = range(c(-clim0, clim0, as.numeric(acfx$acf)[-1])) clx = vector(mode = "character", length = lag.max) clx[which(as.numeric(acfx$acf)[-1]>=0)] = "steelblue" clx[which(as.numeric(acfx$acf)[-1] This function is basically a wrapper for base R function acf . Here is the example: set.seed(11) #Generate simple MA(1) process z
