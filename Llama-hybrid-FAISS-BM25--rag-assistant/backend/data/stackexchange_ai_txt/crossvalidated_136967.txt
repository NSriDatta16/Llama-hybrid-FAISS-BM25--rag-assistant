How to distinguish one data set to the other using PCA

I have 5 set data, each for different observations, i.e.: o1, o2, o3, o4, o5. All those 5 set have 10 similar variables. I want to distinguish data set o1 to the other four data set but only want to use 3 variable to do so. How should I do it? Is PCA is the right tool for that? If yes, should I do the PCA for concatenation of all data set or should I do the PCA in pairs (i.e.: o1-02, o1-3, o1-o4, o1-o5)? I don't know the name of this problem, so its kind of difficult for me to search for solution on the internet.
