A simple way to envision the calculations is to convert everything to units in a population (people in this case) and work with them, for example: We have 10,000 people. Of them, 10 (on average) will get the disease; 8 will screen positive, and 2 will screen negative. 145 people (on average) out of the 10,000 will screen positive. Therefore, 9,855 people will screen negative. 2 of these 9,855 people will actually have the disease (see step 2 above.) Therefore, the probability that someone who screened negative has the disease is 2 / 9855 = 0.02%. So... your calculations were correct!
