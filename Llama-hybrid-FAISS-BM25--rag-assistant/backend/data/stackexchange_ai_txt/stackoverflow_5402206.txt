looking for a wysiwyg editor with some particular features

Not entirely sure if something like this exists or not. If it does, im at a loss as to what to search for to find it. I need an inpage/inline (jquery?) wysiwyg editor with templating, so i can load in a basic (preferably uneditable) layout, that the user then fills in. Image uploading and gallery. So a user can either upload a picture, or insert one from a selection within a gallery. Ability to convert the contents for storage and retrieval in db (if its all text/html), or even better a way to save the entirety as a flattened image. I know this is a tall order, but ive seen the individual pieces in different editors, but not all in one. Perhaps im searching for the wrong thing, but any help here would be great.
