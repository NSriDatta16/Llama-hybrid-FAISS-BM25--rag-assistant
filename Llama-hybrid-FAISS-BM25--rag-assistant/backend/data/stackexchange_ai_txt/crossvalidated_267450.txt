When I use unseen data to make a new prediction, the classifier always outputs label 6 as a prediction. Obviously that is not acceptable. This isn't obvious. Perhaps it really is most accurate to ignore the features and just predict 6 every time. This is one reason that when evaluating predictive accuracy, you should compare your substantive models to a trivial model. No, I don't see how you would have come to that conclusion from what you've presented here. I can't tell from the sparse information you've presented here. You might try adding details . You might also try using a simpler model such as logistic regression, seeing if it also constantly predicts 6, and looking at its coefficients. Your way of dividing the data sounds fine.
