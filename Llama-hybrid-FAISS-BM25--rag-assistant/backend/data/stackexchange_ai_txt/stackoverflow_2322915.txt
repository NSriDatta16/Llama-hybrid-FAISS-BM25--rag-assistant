.Net Array or IList from NumPy array in IronPython?

Imagine I have a .Net application that supports user extensions in the form of Python modules by embedding IronPython. Using Ironclad , I can allow users to make use of the NumPy and SciPy packages from within their modules. How good is the interop provided by Ironclad? My question is: can I use a NumPy array of type T provided by the user's module in the rest of my app that requires an IList ? Edit To clarify, IronPython exposes any Python enumerable of objects of type T as an IEnumerable or an IList . I'm not sure if NumPy arrays fit in this category. I would rather not have to call .tolist() on the NumPy array as the arrays may be quite large.
