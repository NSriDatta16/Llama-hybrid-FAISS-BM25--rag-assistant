Any reason to use hex notation for null pointers?

I'm currently improving the part of our COM component that logs all external calls into a file. For pointers we write something like (IInterface*)0x12345678 with the value being equal to the actual address. Currently no difference is made for null pointers - they are displayed as 0x0 which IMO is suboptimal and inelegant. Changing this behaviour is not a problem at all. But first I'd like to know - is there any real advantage in representing null pointers in hex?
