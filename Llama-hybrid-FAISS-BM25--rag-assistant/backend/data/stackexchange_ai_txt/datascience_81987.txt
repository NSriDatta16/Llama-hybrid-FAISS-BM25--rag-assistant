I know this is offtopic, but this time I have to comment the task. I am commenting the project, in case you really want to apply this for students. I think is it very dangerous to the society in general, if people that are "beginner in data science" create ML models that work on topics that are ethnical critical and highly biased, especially if ML is considered as black-box application. If people relied on this prediction, it would amplify the bias effect. So there is a big responsibilty involved in such projects. Accordingly, such critical projects need to be designed carefully and in a proper way. To accomplish that, a comprehensive knowledge into the topic is necessary! You need to understand the data, the model, how much you can rely on the model and what implications you can deduce from the model. Therefore, tackling this task simply by asking the internet "swarm intelligence" is not the right way to do. Machine learning may look like simple black-box application, but there is in fact more that needs to be understood before knowing what one can do to get reasonable and interpretable results. So the only way to approach this task in a proper way is to study the relevant fields, including linear algebra, analysis, statistics, optimization, numerical analysis.
