I don't think you are missing anything - and your plan seems sensible. After Bayesian/MCMC analysis it's common to simply summarise the posterior for the parameters or the effects of interest (i.e. the MCMC chains). The tidybayes package implements a bunch of functions to make this easy (e.g. mean_qi or mean_hdi). Jon Kruscke's book, Doing Bayesian Analysis, is helpful on this. I found it similarly disconcerting how easy it was to explore/visualise the model posterior to explain my models... but I'm now converted. I particularly like the simplicity of making predictions from a model (e.g. tidybayes::add_fitted_samples) and summarising differences between predictions at covariate values of interest.
