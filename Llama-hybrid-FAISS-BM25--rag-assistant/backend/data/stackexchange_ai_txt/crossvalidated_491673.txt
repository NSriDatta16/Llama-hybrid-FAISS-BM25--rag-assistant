This might be better answered in stackoverflow, but I'm guessing you are more concerned with answering what they mean by stratify yes? I'm guessing they want you to create age groups and then you'll have multi dimensional tables from this. One table for each group you stratify by. Here's how to create age groups in decades. Not the most elegant solution, but it will do. I just assumed you wanted age_last_visit tt $age_last_visit age_last_visit)) tt $Age_decades age_last_visit, breaks = c(seq(0, 100, by = 10), Inf)) tt $Age_decades_numeric Age_decades=="(10,20]",1, ifelse(tt $Age_decades== "(20,30]" ,2,ifelse(tt$ Age_decades=="(30,40]",3, ifelse(tt $Age_decades== "(40,50]", 4, ifelse(tt$ Age_decades== "(50,60]", 5, ifelse(tt $Age_decades=="(60,70]", 6, ifelse(tt$ Age_decades== "(70,80]", 7, ifelse(tt$Age_decades=="(80,90]",8,NA)))))))) Then stratify with this table(tt $Age_decades, tt$ cohort, tt$status) I recommend making the splits on the variable with the fewest levels/values it can take which is status in this case. If you want more elegant tables I highly recommend the table1 package in R. Very high quality html tables
