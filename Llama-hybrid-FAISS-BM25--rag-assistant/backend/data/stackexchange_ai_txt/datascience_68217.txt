One method is to use Online Learning as previous answers have suggested. You can use transfer learning to use a pre-trained model (CNN), that has been trained on a large dataset, and use it to generate feature vectors for the members of your system. When an existing user comes in you can use these feature vectors for identifying the user (member) using SVM. When a non-member (new user) comes in his feature vector will not match with any of the members. If you want him to register you can store his feature vector along with previous vectors to identify him in the future. I have used similar technique in one of my previous projects. I used the face_recognition library from ageitgey: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition . You can get it from pip as well. Note: I know it is very late to answer this question now. But I home my additions with the previous answers can help someone now or in the future as well.
