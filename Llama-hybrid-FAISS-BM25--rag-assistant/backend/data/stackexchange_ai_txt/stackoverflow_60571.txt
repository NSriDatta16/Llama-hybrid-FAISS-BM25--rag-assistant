As a web developer, I'm a big fan of the idea of OpenID. Writing Auth code is a pain in the ass. As a web user, I'm a big fan of OpenID - for non-critical uses like SO, forums, etc - because once you have the ID, it's a very simple way to join a site. I think, outside of a few exceptions - like a community for developers - at this time, you can't force OpenID only. The "average" web user (whatever that means) doesn't get it. However, promoting it in a site like this raises awareness among developers, and the idea will eventually trickle down. As OpenID appears on more and more sites, people will look in to it, realize they have one, and then start using it. In order for OpenID - which is a great idea - to catch on, there needs to be a critical mass of users and sites supporting it. Eventually, it will just be "the way it is", and we'll wonder why we ever created authentication code for every single website we made, or why we would create a unique identity everywhere we went on the Web
