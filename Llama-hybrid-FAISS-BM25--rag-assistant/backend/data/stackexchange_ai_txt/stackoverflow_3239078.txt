Database access control: Application or Database level control?

I have been developing an application in Access 2003 that uses SQL Server as the back end data store. Access is used only as a GUI and does not store any data. All the code in the application is written in VBA using ADO for data access. In recent meetings the DBA that works in my organization has become increasingly concerned over the fact that the application logic controls what data is available for viewing and for update. The way I have been developing the application up until this point is to use a single database login for all access to the database. This database login is the only user allowed access to the database and all other databases users (other than DBA types) are restricted. The DBA for this project is insisting that each user of the application have their account mapped to only those objects in the database to which they should have access. I can certainly see his concern and that is why I was hoping to ask two questions ... Is having a single application level login to the database a bad practice? I had planned to implement a role based security model where the "access" users were given was dependent upon their application role. However, the application logic determined whether certain queries/updates were allowed to proceed. Does anyone know of some resources (articles/books) that go over how to design an application where database access is controlled from within SQL Server and not through the application?
