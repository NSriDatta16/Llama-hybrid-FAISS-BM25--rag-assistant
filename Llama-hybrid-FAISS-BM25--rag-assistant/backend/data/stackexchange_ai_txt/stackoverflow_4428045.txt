You could do something like: p = re.compile("^\# *deb", re.MULTILINE) text = open("sources.list", "r").read() f = open("sources.list", "w") f.write(p.sub("deb", text)) f.close() Alternatively (imho, this is better from organizational standpoint) you could split your sources.list into pieces (one entry/one repository) and place them under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
