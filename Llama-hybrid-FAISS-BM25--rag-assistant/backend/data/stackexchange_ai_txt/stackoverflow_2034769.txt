Freeze Google Map until user clicks

I'm fairly new to Google Maps API, so spare the flame :) How do I disable the controls of a google map(i.e. scroll, drag etc.) untill a user clicks on the map itself? I want the user to be able to scroll down on a page without ending up scrolling on the map. Due to design decisions the map appears in a position often hit by a scrolling user. I don't want to use a static map, since I still want the user to be able to use the map, when he feels the need to do so. Any ideas?
