How to create a variable from a subarray

So I have a gigantic byte-array that represents a data packet. There's various parts of the packet such as a header, message body, stop bits, etc. How can I create variables of the various parts of the array such that when I reference the variable I'm editing the sub-array? I'd like to use the dot notation so that referencing ByteArrayRepresentingPacket.Header would actually reference ByteArrayRepresentingPacket[0] , ByteArrayRepresentingPacket.MessageBody would actually reference ByteArrayRepresentingPacket[1] through ByteArrayRepresentingPacket[8] , etc. A structure seems suited for this, but how would I translate the structure into a byte-array when I need to pass it?
