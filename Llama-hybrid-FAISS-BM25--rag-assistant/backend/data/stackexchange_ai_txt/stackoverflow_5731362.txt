That sounds like something that the employer would have to take care of. They can deploy Adobe AIR and AIR applications using standard desktop deployment tools like Microsoft SMS or IBM Tivoli which allow silent installations. IT administrators can do things like suppress the Adobe AIR end-user license agreement if they accept it on behalf of their organization. There are also registry settings in Windows that can prevent prevent installation of Adobe AIR apps (either signed or untrusted) and updates to Adobe AIR. On Linux, there is a configuration file located in /etc/opt/Adobe AIR/ where the changes can be made. However, if these settings allow for installation or updates, the users will still need administrative or system privileges to perform those operations which is not something you can control from within your application. That is something that is dependent on the system policies. The people who would be able to perform the installations or distribution of the software should have administrative rights anyway. Things you may want to consider in your application are native desktop operations such as clipboard manipulation, local file I/O, system notifications, and drag-and-drop support. Any restrictions in place on the operating system will apply to Adobe AIR applications as well. Also if you load content from outside the application, that content will observe the same rules as if it were loaded by a browser. Depending on your situation, you also have the option of acquiring a distribution license from Adobe though it may be best to check Adobe's runtime distribution FAQ . If you just want to distribute a desktop application, then maybe this doesn't apply. The Adobe AIR Administrator's Guide has more information on this topic. Adobe has a detailed article on their Developer Connection site about distributing AIR in the enterprise assuming that Microsoft Systems Management Server 2003, Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007, or IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express for Software Distribution 4.1.1 has been installed and configured.
