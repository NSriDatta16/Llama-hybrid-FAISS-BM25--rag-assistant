Querying current number of touches on screen without using events on iPhone

I have an application that starts playing a sound when user touches the uiview and changing to different tones as the user slides the finger on the screen. The sound stops when the user lifts the finger. I am using the touchesBegan, Moved and Ended Events for this. My problem is touches Ended (and/or cancelled) is sometimes not fired properly and the sound keeps playing even after the finger is lifted from screen. So as a workaround I would like to implement a timer that would check for the number of touches on the screen and if it is zero it will check and stop the audioplayer if playing. I have been searching for some code that could get me the number of touches like UITouch *touches=[self getAllTouchesonScreen]; or something :)
