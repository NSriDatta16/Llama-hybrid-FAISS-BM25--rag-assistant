Delete file from internal storage

I'm trying to delete images stored in internal storage. I've come up with this so far: File dir = getFilesDir(); File file = new File(dir, id+".jpg"); boolean deleted = file.delete(); And this is from another question, which was answered with : File dir = getFilesDir(); File file = new File(dir, "my_filename"); boolean deleted = file.delete(); My example always returns false. I can see the file fx 2930.jpg in DDMS in eclipse.
