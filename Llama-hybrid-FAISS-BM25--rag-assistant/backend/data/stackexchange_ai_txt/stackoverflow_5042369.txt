Well....I have to say that document classification is kind of different what you guys are thinking. Typically, in document classification, after preprocessing, the test data is always extremely huge, for example, O(N^2)...Therefore it might be too computationally expensive. The another typical classifier that came into my mind is discriminant classifier...which doesn't need the generative model for your dataset. After training, you have to do is to put your single entry to the algorithm, and it is gonna be classified. Good luck with this. For example, you can check E. Alpadin's book, Introduction to Machine Learning.
