Can Logistic regression be used as a Linear Regression model

In a question I'm given Construct a linear model and see how well the fat content can be estimated. That is, estimate the generalization error with a linear model. Optimize the number of principal components, i.e. determine how many and which components you need to get good generalization performance. It makes sense to report both an MSE and an RMS error. Do a residual analysis (this comment goes for all items). The dataset I'm using includes 2 class variables as 'democratic' and 'republican'. What I need to know is.. Can I use Logistic regression for this analysis? Can it be considered as a linear model or do I need to use the linear regression model?
