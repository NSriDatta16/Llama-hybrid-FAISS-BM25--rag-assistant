There is no surefire method of sanitizing user-uploaded images. Even image analysis software will miss a small percentage of images and have false positives. Flickr has community guidelines that say that you must flag your content appropriately, ie. if you're uploading adult images, you need to flag them as restricted. Otherwise, they will take action against your account. Often you'll see compromises in cases where it's not feasible to moderate all user uploads: you might give your users free reign to upload content, but provide "flag" functionality so that other users can notify admins of bad images. provide "cooldown" periods for new users to prevent scripted bots from logging in and uploading pictures immediately flag problem accounts for manual image verification IP black-listing or grey-listing for problem IPs You could even combine approaches, such as having image analysis software trigger a "requires moderator attention" flag. Unfortunately, there's no surefire method.
