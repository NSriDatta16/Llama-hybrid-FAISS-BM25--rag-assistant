Format vs Language

Elsewhere on the SO universe a storm has been raging for a some time now. On whether humans should prefer something they can read vis-a-vis something they can't. Which made me take my thinking hat out after a long hiatus and pose a question for the enlightened: When do formats evolve into a domain specific language? Or, how do I decide if I want a Human Readable Format or a Domain Specific Language. PostScript is what came to mind that sparked this off. PS: Excuse the prologue; mod-down/close if this has been asked already. PPS: When I say language, I really mean a programming language with conditions, loops etc.
