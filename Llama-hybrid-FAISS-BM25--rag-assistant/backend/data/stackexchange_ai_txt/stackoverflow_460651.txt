I think there is also a stored proc, sp_dts_deletepackage that you can call, if you feel deleting the row is unsafe. First call sp_dts_getfolder to get the folder ID, then pass this ID to sp_dts_deletepackage . Another way is to configure your local SSIS service so it has a folder for this remote SQL server storage (look at MSDN for SSIS service config editing). Then you'll see these remote packages when you connect to the local SSIS service, and can delete using the UI. The service will then connect to SQL and call these stored procs for you.
