Horizontal "tab"ish scroll between views

I'm interested in creating a horizontal scroll view that "snaps" to the viewed item, so only one item is ever shown at a time. The user can touch-drag left/right and will see previous/next views, switching to it if there's enough velocity. This interaction is exactly like what the new weather/news widget that comes with the Nexus One does for navigating between its "tabs". Are there any existing view widgets that do this? Update: found a copy of the news/weather widget (GenieWidget) and they seem to have implemented their own widget to accomplish this which they call com.google.android.apps.genie.geniewidget.ui.FlingableLinearLayout which is part of their own custom com.google.android.apps.genie.geniewidget.ui.TabView . As that source isn't available, that's not looking too hopeful a direction.
