In your scenario, I do not believe that regularly optimizing the table will make an appreciable difference. First things first, your second interpretation (B) of the documentation is correct - "if you have deleted a large part of ANY table OR if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length rows." If your table has no VAR columns, each record, regardless of the data it contains, takes up the exact same amount of space in the table. If a record is deleted from the table, and the DB chooses to reuse the exact area the previous record was stored, it can do so without wasting any space or fragmenting your data. As far as whether OPTIMIZE only improves performance on a query that utilizes the primary key index, that answer would almost certainly vary based on what storage engine is in use, and I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to answer that. However, speaking of storage engines, if you do end up using OPTIMIZE, be aware that it doesn't like to run on InnoDB tables, so the command maps to ALTER and rebuilds the table, which might be a more expensive operation. Either way, the table locks during the optimizations, so be very careful about when you run it.
