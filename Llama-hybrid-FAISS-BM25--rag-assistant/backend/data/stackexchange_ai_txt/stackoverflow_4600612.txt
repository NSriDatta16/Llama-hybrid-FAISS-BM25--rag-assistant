Extracting noun+noun or (adj|noun)+noun from Text

Is it possible to extract noun+noun or (adj|noun)+noun using the R package openNLP ? That is, I would like to use linguistic filtering to extract candidate noun phrases. Could you direct me how to do? Many thanks. Thanks for the responses. here is the code: library("openNLP") acq Reader can refer index on acqTagSplit to do noun+noun or (adj|noun)+noun extraction. (The code is not optimal, but it works. If you have any idea, please let me know.) I have an additional problem: Justeson and Katz (1995) proposed another linguistic filtering to extract candidate noun phrases: ((Adj|Noun)+|((Adj|Noun)*(Noun-Prep)?)(Adj|Noun)*)Noun I cannot understand its meaning well. Could you do me a favor and explain it? Or show how to code the filtering rule in the R language? Many thanks.
