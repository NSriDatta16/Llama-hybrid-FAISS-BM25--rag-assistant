jQuery Accordion /Tabs - Call different function upon load of content

I have the following markup: Question 1 Question 2 Question 3 Question 4 Question 5 Question 6 Click tabs to see answers to Questions I would like to utilize an accordion or the tabs plugin from the UI. Upon completion of the load event, I'd like to call a JavaScript function, but a different function for each tab -- almost like calling onDocumentReady for a page. I have the following JavaScript: $(function() { $('#tabs').tabs().bind('tabsselect', function(event, ui) { console.log("Loading: ajax/question_" + ui.index + ".html"); return true; //Ensure that the tab gets selected }); ); That's properly loading the Ajax file and all, but whenever I attempt to do something such as evaluating a statement in the JS, it seems to be ignored. Is there any way I can do this, so that once the file is loaded my function is called -- needs to be a different function for each tab. Edit below: Switching does in fact alleviate my problem of calling a different function. I wasn't thinking... However, what I'm after is having an empty div in each of these tabs which is used for logging (in case I'm in a web environment without Firebug). I have the following function: if (typeof console === 'undefined') { var console = { }; console.log = function(msg) { $('#dynamicContent').append(createElement('p', msg)); }; } Which is supposed to log messages to a div which is loaded in each of the fragments, but none of the logging is done when a new tab is loaded. My tabs are setup with the following: $('#tabs').tabs({ select: function(event, ui) { log.debug("Loading: ajax/question_" + ui.index + ".html"); }, show: function(event, ui) { log.debug("Finished Loading: ajax/question_" + ui.index + ".html"); } });
