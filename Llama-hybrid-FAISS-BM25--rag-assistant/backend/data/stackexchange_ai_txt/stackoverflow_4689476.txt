Here's a bit more detail on RobertG5's solution (too long for a comment): The problem was that the add-in had been hard disabled by Outlook. As I've learned, that's something different than the "usual" not-loading scenario. The key to realizing this was to notice that the add-in did not show up under Inactive Application Add-Ins , but rather under Disabled Application Add-Ins . That makes a difference: In the latter case, just going to the COM-AddIn screen and ticking the check box just does nothing. (I guess a nice message box "You cannot load this add-in because it has been hard-disabled" would be too much to ask... sigh .) So, how do I re-enable a hard disabled add-in? In the Manage box, change COM Add-ins to Disabled Add-ins , and then click Go. Select the add-in and click Enable . Click Close . OK, now the add-in can be loaded again: In the Manage box, change Disabled Add-ins to COM Add-ins , and then click Go. select the check box next to the disabled add-in. Click OK .
