You said you wanted the second space in your pattern to be on the new line. Now whether you'll be able to get this depends on where you got your string from (well, maybe not where , but I guess you get my point). If the data you're parsing is read from a file, then you must read the file in paragraph mode (i.e. each paragraph instead of each line will constitute a record). Assuming you are using the file handle FILE, do this: { local $/ = ""; # one paragraph constitutes one record while ( ) { if (/ \n /) { print "Found one match!\n"; } } } Please note that the regex pattern I have used does not take into account multiple occurrences of space-newline-space, as I wasn't sure what exactly you were trying to do. But anyway, my main point is the use of local $/ = ""; HTH
