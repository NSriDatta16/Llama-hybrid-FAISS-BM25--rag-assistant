Perl script to automate a website for bioinformatics

I would like to automate this website with a Perl script http://bioinfo.uni-plovdiv.bg/microinspector/ This is what I have so far and I am not sure how to get to the output page after this, I know it has something to do with POST, redirect_ok?, response(), but I am not sure. I read through the documentation but am confused about some things. Thanks. use strict; use warnings; use WWW::Mechanize; # create object for browser my $browser = WWW::Mechanize->new(); my ($sequence, $results); open (DRG, " ) { chomp; $sequence=$_; last; #for testing purposes } close (DRG); $browser->get("http://bioinfo.uni-plovdiv.bg/microinspector/"); $browser->form_number(1); $browser->field("target_sequence", $sequence); $browser->field("Choose an organism : ", "Mus musculus"); $browser->click_button( number => 1);
