There are valid reasons to use NULL, but saving space in row storage isn't one. If you want a ‘don't know’ placeholder use a NULL; if you simply want to store an empty string that behaves like an empty string, go ahead and store an empty string. If it's a VARCHAR column (which it probably will be) then it's hardly taking much space anyway.
