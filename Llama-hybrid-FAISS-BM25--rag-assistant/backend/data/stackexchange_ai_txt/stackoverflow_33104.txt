Communicating between websites (using Javascript or ?)

Here's my problem - I'd like to communicate between two websites and I'm looking for a clean solution. The current solution uses Javascript but there are nasty workarounds because of (understandable) cross-site scripting restrictions. At the moment, website A opens a modal window containing website B using a jQuery plug-in called jqModal . Website B does some work and returns some results to website A . To return that information we have to work around cross-site scripting restrictions - website B creates an iframe that refers to a page on website A and includes *fragment identifiers" containing the information to be returned. The iframe is polled by website A to detect the returned information. It's a common technique but it's hacky. There are variations such as CrossSite and I could perhaps use an HTTP POST from website B to website A but I'm trying to avoid page refreshes. Does anyone have any alternatives? EDIT: I'd like to avoid having to save state on website B .
