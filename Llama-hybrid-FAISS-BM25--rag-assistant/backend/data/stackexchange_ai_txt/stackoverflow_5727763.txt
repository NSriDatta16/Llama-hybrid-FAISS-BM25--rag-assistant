If you want to use ASM you don't need to create a filesystem on the ASM disk. The ASM itself will act as a filesystem for oracle. With regards to RAC installation, you will need to configure a shared storage between two or more servers involved into the cluster. If it is a proof of concept the easiest way will be to use NFS. Please check the following guide on how to install ASM on NFS http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/linux/UsingNFSWithASM.php Alternatively you can install RAC using NFS as a shared storage without ASM. http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/11g/OracleDB11gR2RACInstallationOnLinuxUsingNFS.php Best regards Yuri
