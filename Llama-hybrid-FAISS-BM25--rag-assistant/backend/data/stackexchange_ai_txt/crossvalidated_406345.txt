For a classification problem, does a feature need to have a statistically significantly different mean within each class to be a predictive feature?

I'm trying to improve my intuition surrounding machine learning algorithms. Let's say I have a continuous feature (for example, let's use the length of a flower stem), and I'm considering using that feature in a classification model to help me predict the type of flower it is (let's restrict the problem to roses vs. violets). Should the mean stem length for roses be statistically significantly different (through a Welch's t-test or some other test) from the mean stem length for violets if this feature is to be predictive in my model?
