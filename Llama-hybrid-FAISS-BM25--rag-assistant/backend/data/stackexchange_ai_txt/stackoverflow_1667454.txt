XSL Transformation in Java with parameters

I have a xsl file where i need to use parameters from an external source. I am using Java and my code looks something like this: TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer xsltTransformer = transformerFactory.newTransformer(xsltSource); xsltTransformer.setParameter(parameterName, parameterValue); However, an exception is thrown at the 2nd line - Variable or parameter 'variable_name' is undefined. I realize that XSL is compiled and is probably compiled when the transformer is created. So, how do i pass parameters to my transformation? How is the setParameter method supposed to be used?
