Optimizing Rank Aggregation of Two Different Methods in Information Retrieval

As the title suggests, I would like to train a rank-aggregating model. My target problem is to rank text2 s from a database as best as possible to a given query, text1 . What I have available is as follows: I have text1 , with some features, let's call them a,b,c I have text2 , with features d,e,f Every text1 has a corresponding target text2 For every text1 , I have ranks1 , with rankings of the top 100 text2 s that have been ranked according to query text1 using method A For every text1 , I have ranks2 , with rankings of the top 100 text2 s that have been ranked according to query text1 using method B I want my model to best apply appropriate weightings to each of the two ranking methods dependent on features a,b,c,d,e,f . Ultimately, the model should learn from my large dataset (in the format as described above), how to best aggregate the two rankings, so as to optimize a given metric (e.g. MAP, MRR). Intuitively, the model should learn to generally place the target text2 as high as possible, according to all the information it has. I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights, or for any pointers in a direction which would be useful to me. Thank you in advance!
