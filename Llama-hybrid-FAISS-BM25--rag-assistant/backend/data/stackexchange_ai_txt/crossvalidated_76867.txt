Random forest importance differs between rf$importance and importance()

My model is working ok (the AUC is 0.7) but the importances from a randomForest run for my binary classification problem differ depending on how I retrieve them. Is this normal? They seem to be scaled up when I call importance(rf) (by order 10 5 ). More importantly, the first three columns don't match at all, even discounting the magnitude! I'm unsure how to interpret this at the moment having read ?importance and ?randomForest . Here's my randomForest call: rf and here's a portion of the outputs: rf$importance : 0 1 MeanDecreaseAccuracy MeanDecreaseGini var1 -2.308793e-05 -6.124117e-05 -3.642557e-05 30.47050 var2 6.169346e-04 -3.947637e-04 2.563570e-04 48.04932 var3 3.621287e-03 1.834355e-03 2.981152e-03 68.28302 var4 3.655234e-03 1.981978e-03 3.057267e-03 79.12254 var5 5.350649e-03 1.041555e-03 3.812376e-03 84.88832 var6 3.366199e-03 1.707144e-03 2.773894e-03 78.02293 ... importance(rf) : 0 1 MeanDecreaseAccuracy MeanDecreaseGini var1 -0.4739717 -0.8497967 -0.8952541 30.47050 var2 7.9028043 -3.6680758 4.1625329 48.04932 var3 17.1279919 5.9733456 20.8354079 68.28302 var4 17.3895593 7.2370419 22.4948931 79.12254 var5 20.7470555 3.2702612 24.3069376 84.88832 var6 16.9071520 6.2532409 21.1648686 78.02293 ... My data has 8000 data points and 60 variables. There is definitely correlation between variables and they are of different types: some are binary flags, other are integers, others continuous. Some variables have missing values (which I'm fixing with na.roughfix() ). Additionally, a run from gbm: gbmBernModel produced relative importances (viewed by summary(gbmBernModel) ) that made logical sense to me. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
