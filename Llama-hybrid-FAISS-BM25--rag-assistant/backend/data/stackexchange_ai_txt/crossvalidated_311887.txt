In my opinion, one can speak of machine learning when a machine is programmed to infer parameters of some model using some data. If a linear regression is done by machine, it therefore qualifies. If done by hand, then it does not. Definitions that hinge on the prevalence of some agent (like Excel), or iterative improvement (like Sean Easter suggests above), somehow trying to separate it from statistics or depending on what to do with the results will prove inconsistent, in my opinion.
