I did a short discussion on Inverted Indexes and Cosine Ranking (the core algorithms and data structures of full-text retrieval systems) Here. On a pure cosine ranking, foo (1), bar (1) should be closer to the vector occupied by foo, bar than foo (10), bar (0). One can fiddle the cosine value post-hoc, which is essentially what Pagerank does. If the full-text search is fiddling the cosine ranking after calculating the dot product rather than weighting the axes, this would explain the disproportionate significance of foo.
