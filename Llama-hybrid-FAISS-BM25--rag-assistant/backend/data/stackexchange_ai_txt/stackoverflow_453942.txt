Backing up "blobstorage" will do it. No need for a special order or anything else, it's very simple. All operations in Plone are fully transactional, so hitting the backup in the middle of a transaction should work just fine. This is why you can do live backups of the ZODB. Without knowing what file system you're on, I'd guess that it should work as intended.
