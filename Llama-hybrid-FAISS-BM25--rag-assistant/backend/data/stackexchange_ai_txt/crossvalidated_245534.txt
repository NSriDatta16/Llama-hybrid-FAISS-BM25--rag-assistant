Imagine you have a stock whose value at time 0 is $S_0$ and at time 1 can take one of two possible values, $S_1\in\{a,b\}$ (corresponding to up-tick and down-tick in the price). Now you also have another financial security $V_1$ that depends on the value $S_1$ (for example, a call option). Since any two points determine a straight line, $V_1$ is a linear function of $S_1$. This allows us to find $V_0$, the price of the security at time 0, from $S_0$ using the linearity of pricing (the price of two cars is $2$ $\times$ the price of one car). This is known as risk-neutral pricing and is a central part of mathematical finance. Now suppose that $S_1\in\{a,b,c\}$ (three possible values) instead. Then the above type of argument only gives an interval for $V_0$, rather than an exact value. While I don't know for sure, it seems that the theory of belief functions in Dempster-Shafer theory is related to this -- so we have some belief in a proposition $p$ without assigning an exact Bayesian probability to $p$. Here $V_0$ could be equal to 1 if $p$ is true and 0 otherwise. In conclusion, this is certainly not pseudo-science, but seems like a useful way of organizing inconclusive evidence.
