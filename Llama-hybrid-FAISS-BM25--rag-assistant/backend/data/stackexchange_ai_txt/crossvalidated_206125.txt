how to use bootstrap simulation, is this method correct?

I just wanted to find out if my method is correct. the problem goes like this: I have 29 observations in a data set on which i plan to compute logistic regression involving 3 independent variables, but I know that this sample size is small so I decided to use bootstrap method by resampling 50 observations about 1000 times. from my 29 observations to run the logistic regression. from this i got 1000 coefficients, null deviance and residuals which i plan to use as the test statistics. my question goes thus: is this method ok especially to resample 50 observations instead of 29 observations 1000 times?
