How do I get initial transition matrix probabilities?

I have to develop a system to detect and prevent bank transactions fraud - just credit card transactions, for simplicity - I'm thinking about using markov chain. How would I get the initial transitions matrix probabilities? Do I have to use past transactions data? And what exactly can I do with Markov chain? Can I actually predict ahead of time a possible fraud? Or just use it to detect outliers and identify actual frauds? PS: Any advice, books or resources on developing such a system would be appreciated. Thank you
