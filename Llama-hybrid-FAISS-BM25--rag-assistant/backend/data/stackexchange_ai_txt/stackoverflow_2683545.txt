I can't help you because you did not post the complete code here. At least, I do not see where you're updating the positions of the sprites ( self.x += self.dx somewhere?) and updating the draw to screen. You're also not utilising your classes in the main() function. That said, I'm seeing def __init__(self, x=10): and inside the constructor you never used the x variable. That worries me, too. Consider using the Paddle and Ball class as a Sprite, like the following: if __name__ == '__main__': background_image = games.load_image("background.bmp", transparent=False) games.screen.background = background_image the_paddle = Puddle() games.screen.add(the_paddle) the_ball = Ball() games.screen.add(the_ball) games.mouse.is_visible = False games.screen.event_grab = True games.screen.mainloop() Note I've taken the liberty to make your code read more Pythonic. I have never used livewires, however, so my code may not function. But it should point you to the right direction. Good luck!
