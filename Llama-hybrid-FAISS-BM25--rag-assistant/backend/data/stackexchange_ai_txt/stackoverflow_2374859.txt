Actionscript 3 project in Flash Builder 4

I am attempting to import several different packages into a Flash Builder 4. I'm a bit lost... I found this explanation of what FB 4 has to offer. I am a bit confused as I am new to developing in actionscript all together. I have a component library that looks something like this... com.kiosk.ui com.kiosk.ui.dialog com.kiosk.ui.screens com.kiosk.util com.kiosk.managers com.clientName.ConfigData in order for a kiosk interface to run a .fla needs to be created with the following lines/calls in the 'actions' to this component library... import com.alohainvestment.ConfigData; import com.kiosk.util.Config; import com.kiosk.ui.Gui; import flash.display.StageAlign; stage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT; addChild(Gui.getInstance()); Config.getInstance().load(new ConfigData()); For the most part I got the linking up the packages in that all you have to do is drag/drop the com folder into the src tree via flash builder (is there a better way to do this?) My problem is i can't seem to mimic this .fla ... is this possible? I guess what it comes down to is I can't seem to actually run this component library, as it needs to be called from a .fla .
