JQUERY gotcha, Why can't I change inside an iframe that is hosted locally?

Give the following on a page: Download now adasdads a Download n1111ow The following works: $('#hi-world').css("width","10px"); But what I want to do is change the paragraphs in the iFrame, and this does not work: $('#hi-world').find('p').css("background","red");
