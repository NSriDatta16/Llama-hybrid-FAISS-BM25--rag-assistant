Analyzing the statistical independence of a Bernouli sequence

For my research, I need to check whether a sequence of Bernoulli trails (1 as success and 0 as failure) is a Bernoulli process and are statistically independent. As per the following discussion , and information from other articles, I am using a combination of different test. One of the suggestions from this discussion is to design a chi-square test (for checking independence). Based on that I designed the test in following manner: I divided the time series(sequence) $a_1, ..., a_n$ of length $n$ into $n/k$ many (successive) parts (results in $n/k$ many sub-time series of length $k$ (longer ones) or small) Let p be the average of success (1) in a_1, ..., a_n. i.e $p: = $ number of ones $/n$ The number of ones in the sub-time series is a Bernoulli distribution $B(k,p)$ (under the null hypothesis that the time series is stationary and independent) model, results in $n/k$ many natural numbers between 0 and k . Then I use Chi Square Test to test whether the natural numbers are observing corresponds to a typical histogram of $n/k$ many pulls from $B(k,p)$ . For me, this sounds similar to chi-square goodness of fit-test. I.e. comparing observed distribution to expected distribution. My questions, Whether the above test verify the independence of Bernoulli process? In order to calculate the p-value from the chi-square value, what is the degree of freedom? is it $(n/k) - 1$ or $k - 1$ ? Note: Since I am not a statistician and this is the first time i am doing some statistical test. I hope you understood the question.
