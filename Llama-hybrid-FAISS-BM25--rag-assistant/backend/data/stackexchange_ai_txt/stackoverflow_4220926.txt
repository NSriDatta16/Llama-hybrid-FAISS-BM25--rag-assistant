I think you have a few issues $board[$coords1[0]-1][$coords1[1]+1] = $board[$coords[0]][$coords[1]]; if $coords[1] == 7 (which appears to be allowed) then $coords[1]+1 == 8 which is out of bounds. Let alone the coords +/- 2 we see later. You probably don't want that 'bs'/'rs' in your storage, all of that can be inferred. $getSquareColor = function($x,$y){return ($x+$y)/2 == 1 ? 'red' : 'black';} //or better yet, const or enum function getSquareColor($x, $y) //alternatively { if ( ($x+$y) % 2 == 0) return 'black'; else return 'red'; } ps - if you drop those dollar signs the function is just as good in javascript
