Many returned records cause stackoverflow with Hibernate

If there are many return records from DB. It will get stackoverflow problem. User is a class, which has a one to many relationship (to 3 other classes). When I print out the SQL, i found that the system runs the same query many time to get the data from DB. Does anyone know what the problem is? result.addAll(getCurrentSession().createCriteria(User.class) .add(Restrictions.ilike("name", "tom", MatchMode.ANYWHERE)) .setResultTransformer(Criteria.DISTINCT_ROOT_ENTITY) .list());
