Example of independent observations

I came across an interesting (to me, at least) question. I want to predict the probability that a given boat will win a race . The dataset is something like: Y: winner (0-1) X1: size of the sail X2: weight of the boat X3: length in miles of the race We collected the data across several races . It means that there will be some observations from the same race . At first impression, observations are not independent , as there can only be one winner per race. This would warrant against the use of a logistic regression or, at least, against relying too much on statistical inference . First, is it true that observations are not independent? Second, does it impact the validity of a logistic regression model? Thanks a lot!
