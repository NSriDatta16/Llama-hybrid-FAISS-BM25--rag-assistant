Deserialize flat xml to entities

Have the following XML model Also have three classes class Foo1{ public string A; public string B; } class Foo2{ public string C; public string D; } class FooUnited{ public Foo1 foo1; public Foo2 foo2; } The problem. I want to deserialize xml into object of FooUnited type. The brute-force idea is to manually select values from xml and initialize FooUnited object, but maybe there is a more elegant solution for that?
