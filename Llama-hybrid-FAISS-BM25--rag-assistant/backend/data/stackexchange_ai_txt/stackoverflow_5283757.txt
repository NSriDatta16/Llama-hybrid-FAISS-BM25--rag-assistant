MySQL JSON Storage vs Two Tables

Would there be any benefit in using JSON to store data in a table vs having a separate meta table? Here is the original schema: Users Table UserId | Username | Etc... 5 | John | Avatar Table Id | UserId | ImageName | ImageType 1 | 5 | example.png | original 2 | 5 | example_thumb.png | thumbnail Here is the JSON version: Users Table UserId | Username | Avatar 5 | John | {"original":"example.png","thumbnail":"example_thumb.png"} I personally like the json version and would prefer to use it, but how much slower is it than the original version? In my case, I need the user's avatars (and different sizes) almost every query.
