Demmler-Reinsch basis for smoothing splines

I have seen some papers about using the so-called Demmler-Reinsch basis for smoothing spline because it is a basis for natural spline space and also Sobolev space. For example, these papers: A unified framework for spline estimators , Adaptive empirical Bayesian smoothing splines , and Adaptive Non-parametric Estimation of Mean and Autocovariance in Regression with Dependent Errors . I found some lecture notes like this note have also described this basis. I want to know can I use this basis for other non-parametric problems like the Gaussian process when we project the inputs into the feature space? (e.g. Section 2.1.2 in this book: Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning ). In all of the references, it was defined as a nice tool in the smoothing spline method. Since smoothing splines are a specific form of Gaussian process, is it possible to apply this basis as a basis of functions in the Gaussian process?
