Curve smoothing in the presence of non-gaussian uncertainty

What options are available for smoothing 2-dimensional real data for which the the ordinate points are real intervals of the form $(x_j , [y_{j0} , y_{j1}])$ In my case, the data is vague because of intrinsic measurement precision, and I want the knowledge of the quantity to be characterized by a uniform distribution over the interval $[y_{j0} , y_{j1}]$ (rather than Gaussian). One option is to use a smoothing spline where the ordinate data is taken to be the means of the intervals and the points are weighted inverse-proportionally to the the size of the interval (in the Gaussian case, I guess this would be standard deviation instead). Unfortunately, this encourages the curve to pass through the middle of the intervals despite the fact that I have no reason to favour this. What other options are available?
