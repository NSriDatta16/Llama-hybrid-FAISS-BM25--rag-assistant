You'll have to encode the state of the check boxes into the column in some way on the server side. For convenient visual confirmation you could use a string of ones and zeros to indicate checked/unchecked states. Or you could use an integer type whose bit values indicate the checked state if storage space is more important. Note that both of these strategies will require you to keep careful track of the order in which the values are stored, so adding/removing values to store in the column will be tricky.
