Energy based model of perceptron loss?

I was reading LeCun's tutorial paper on energy-based models of cost functions, and came upon this table. I don't understand how he got the equation for perceptron loss. Can someone clarify how that equation meshes with this, which I believe is the regular loss function: I'm new to neural networks and information theory, so if answers could come with examples, that would be extremely helpful.
