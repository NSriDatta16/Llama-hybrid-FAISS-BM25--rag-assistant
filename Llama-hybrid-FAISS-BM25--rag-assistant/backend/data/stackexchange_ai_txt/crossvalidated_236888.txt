What does it mean to have a "greater than" sign in a logit function parameter

I am reading a machine learning paper and at some point they write the likelihood of the observed data using $logit$ function in their model. However, they have a $>$ symbol in the parameter of the logit function, something like $logit(\alpha > uv)$ where $u$ and $v$ are the parameters to learn from the model and $\alpha$ is a positive tuning parameter. I specifically talk about Equation 2 in this paper . I haven't seen such a representation before, and want to learn what this really means. Thanks.
