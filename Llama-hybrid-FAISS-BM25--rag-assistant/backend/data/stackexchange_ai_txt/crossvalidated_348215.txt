Taking this from the comment section to the answer part: If you are doing Bayesian model comparison, then there is no way to include any uncertainties. The comparison will tell you, which model describes the data better. But, as mentioned in the wikipedia article ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor ), this doesn't mean that either model "fits" the data or even that either is correct. If the uncertainty is to be taken into account, then hypothesis testing can be used to determine which fits better. But again, this will not give any clue about whether either (actually: if any!) model is correct. That being said, you cannot determine a probability for a certain model to be correct. Nothing in the likelihood method will do this for you or enable you to do it. If you use it for comparison -- as in the question --, then you can determine which model is more probable. If (!) you get the priors right, then you can state the actual ratio of the probabilities. But nothing more.
