Getting size of document libraries in site collection

I'm trying to get a list of the size of all the document libraries in my site collection. I don't have access to central admin, and I don't have access to the server so I can't hit the object model. I am a site collection administrator and I can access the web services. The data I want is actually here: _layouts/storman.aspx , except I can only view 100 libraries. Other code I've found that does what I want is this: using (SPSite site = new SPSite("http://servername")) { DataTable tbl; tbl = site.StorageManagementInformation( SPSite.StorageManagementInformationType.DocumentLibrary, SPSite.StorageManagementSortOrder.Decreasing, SPSite.StorageManagementSortedOn.Size, 100); foreach (DataRow row in tbl.Rows) { foreach (DataColumn column in tbl.Columns) { MessageBox.Show("Doc Lib Name :" + row["Title"].ToString() + " Size (bytes): " + row["Size"].ToString()); } } } Since I can't run code on the server, can anyone point me to a web service that exposes this same functionality? I can't find it for the life of me. Enabling more than 100 rows in the above-referenced report would also work great.
