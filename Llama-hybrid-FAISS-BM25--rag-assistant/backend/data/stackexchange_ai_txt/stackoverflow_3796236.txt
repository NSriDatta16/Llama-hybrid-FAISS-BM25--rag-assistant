iPhone: fastest way to fire API calls and parse JSON?

I currently have a UITableViewController that parses a JSON response (using TouchJSON) fired asynchronously using an ASIHTTPRequest. I'm very concerned with the performance of my application.. 6 out of 10 API calls on average would lead to request timeouts and the combined time to fire an API call and parse an API call for 20 objects (each with about 10 attributes) ..takes around 8-9 seconds. What can I do to speed up/streamline this process? Any methods / libraries I should be looking at to strip down the time to 2 seconds or less?
