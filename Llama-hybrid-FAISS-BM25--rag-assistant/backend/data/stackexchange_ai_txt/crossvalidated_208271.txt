auto.arima Not Minimizing AIC

I simulated a MA(3) process using: set.seed(66) w Running auto.arima on the time series gives: > auto.arima(ma3) Series: ma3 ARIMA(0,0,1) with zero mean Coefficients: ma1 0.3854 s.e. 0.1152 sigma^2 estimated as 14.41: log likelihood=-275.39 AIC=554.77 AICc=554.89 BIC=559.98 However, fitting the series to a MA(3) model gives a lower AIC: > arima(ma3, order=c(0,0,3)) Call: arima(x = ma3, order = c(0, 0, 3)) Coefficients: ma1 ma2 ma3 intercept 0.4039 -0.0836 0.5125 0.2752 s.e. 0.1158 0.0905 0.1039 0.6078 sigma^2 estimated as 11.2: log likelihood = -264.67, aic = 539.34 I'm not sure what's going on. I thought that auto.arima selected the best model based on the AIC.
