We need to be clear on our terms here, but in general, yes : If your dependent variable is continuous (and the residuals are normally distributed—see here ), but all of your independent variables are categorical, this is just an ANOVA . If your dependent variable is categorical and your independent variables are continuous, this would be logistic regression (possibly binary, ordinal , or multinomial , depending). If both your dependent variable and your independent variables are categorical variables, you can still use logistic regression—it's kind of the ANOVA-ish version of LR. Note that both logistic regression and ordinary least squares (linear) regression are special cases of the Generalized Linear Model .
