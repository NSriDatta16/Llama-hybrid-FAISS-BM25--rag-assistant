I still prefer classnames. It does not require a good package organisation but reflects your (good - hey what else?) package orgnization. And it's a common pattern to use the class names. You can read the logging class file from the logs and set log levels on packages. And following the common pattern prevents me from spending too much time on thinking about good (perfect) custom logger names ;-)
