Why won't Silverlight handle the conversion of my custom float property

In a Silverlight 4 project I have a class that extends Canvas: public class AppendageCanvas : Canvas { public float Friction { get; set; } public float Restitution { get; set; } public float Density { get; set; } } I use this canvas in Blend by dragging it onto another control and setting the custom properties: alt text http://www.farseergames.com/storage/share/PropertyInBlend.Png When I run the app, I get the following error when InitializeComponent is called on the control containing my custom canvas: Failed to create a 'Windows.Foundation.Single' from the text '0.0' alt text http://www.farseergames.com/storage/share/SilverlightError.Png I'm not sure why Silverlight isn't able to convert this property from it's string representation in Xaml, to the float that it is. Anyone have any ideas?
