Similarity is the inverse of distance, below are commonly used distance metrics for time series. Correlation: You already talk about this. Eucledian Distance: Self explanatory I assume. Dynamic Time Warping: DTW finds an optimal match between two sequences of feature vectors which allows for stretched and compressed sections of the sequence. Mutual Information: Entropy based metric, introduced by Shannon. Applied to time series, there are quite a few papers by now. For example, this . iSAX: The final one I want to flag is the so-called "Motif Discovery" and the related iSAX representation of time series (by Eamon Keogh), which is very scalable. Also, I would recommend searching this website for Time Series Distance metrics, I am sure there will be a few others that I am missing here.
