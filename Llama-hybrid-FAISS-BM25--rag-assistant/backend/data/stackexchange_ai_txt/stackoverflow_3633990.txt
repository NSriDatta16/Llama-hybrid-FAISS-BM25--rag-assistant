A couple of things are good about your approach: You are giving them a task just like what they'll need to do. You're not looking for cheap ways to get rid of people. You're giving them something specific to get ready for. You can test candidates with surprise questions to get a feel for their personality but in the actual work it sounds like they'll always have time to come up with an answer, so on-the-spot brilliance isn't an important skill. One trap I would be wary of in interpreting their answers: by looking for someone "on the same page" as you who "gets it", you might encourage groupthink. Think more about the criteria for what constitutes a "good" pitch from them -- not necessarily hitting you personally in the gut, but displaying ingenuity or a way with words, etc. Here's something else to consider about the final sentence of your question. It shouldn't be hard for anyone to get what your business is about. A stranger in the elevator is supposed to understand your pitch in five seconds. So if people who are desperately paying attention to you don't get it, that's something to work on. And one last thing: just like Cletus said, "getting it" may come with time. If you can get along with the developers on a personal level, their views on the business may ripen. Two months down the road they have an "aha!" moment and give you a crucial insight. Try to figure out if they're the kind of people who could be interested in your business' goals, not if they're good at faking it.
