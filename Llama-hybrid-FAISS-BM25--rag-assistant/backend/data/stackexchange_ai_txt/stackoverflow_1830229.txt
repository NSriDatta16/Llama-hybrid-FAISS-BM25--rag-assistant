Are there any specific requirements for a Swing component to be run in JavaFX environment?

My company have a web application product for distribution planning and scheduling. An important part of it is a gantt chart component where user can fine tune the schedules. Currently the gantt chart component is pure javascript+dhtml. I am currently looking into the possibility of moving to JavaFX to get richer interactivity and generally nicer UI. We found this (100%) Swing component called FlexGantt ( http://www.dlsc.com/Java_Gantt_Chart_for_Swing.html ) and curious to know whether there are any specific requirements for a Swing component to be run in JavaFX environment before we actually spend time to learn JavaFX. Thanks.
