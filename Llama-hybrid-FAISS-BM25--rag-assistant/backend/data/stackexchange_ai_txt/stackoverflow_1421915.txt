Isolating the foreground from the background is beyond the scope of this particular answer, but... I've found that applying a pixelation filter to an image will draw out a really good set of 'average' colours. Before After I sometimes use this approach to derive a pallete of colours with a particular mood. I first find a photograph with the general tones I'm after, pixelate and then sample from the resulting image. (Thanks to Pietro De Grandi for the image, found on unsplash.com)
