Regret in online learning

In online learning/online convex optimization, it's often the case that you compare your algorithm against the best action in hindsight (i.e., from https://people.cs.umass.edu/~akshay/courses/cs690m/files/lec15.pdf ) $$ \operatorname{Regret}(T)=\sum_t{f_t(w_t)}-\min_u \sum_t{f_t(u)} $$ For sequence $t=1, \ldots, T$ , $u$ in this case is the best action over the entire sequence. In practice, a popular approach is to use a rolling window approach (i.e., regress over past 10 periods of data). Does the $u$ mean that it's basically using a growing window? If $f_t$ changes over time, wouldn't $u$ do terribly since it's basically taking the average over all past observations?
