Localizable.strings issue with SVN

these are the steps i followed to create Localizable.strings file. 1) created a folder called "en.lproj" 2) ran the command from terminal genstrings -o en.lproj Classes/*.m it generates correct file under "en.lproj". now my question is how do i add that file to my project. i did drag n drop that file but its not giving me any option to add to repository. am i doing something wrong.
