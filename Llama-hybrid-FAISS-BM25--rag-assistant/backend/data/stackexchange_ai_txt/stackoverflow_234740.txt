The Boost::serialization library handles this rather elegantly. I've used it in several projects. There's an example program, showing how to use it, here . The only native way to do it is to use streams. That's essentially all the Boost::serialization library does, it extends the stream method by setting up a framework to write objects to a text-like format and read them from the same format. For built-in types, or your own types with operator and operator>> properly defined, that's fairly simple; see the C++ FAQ for more information.
