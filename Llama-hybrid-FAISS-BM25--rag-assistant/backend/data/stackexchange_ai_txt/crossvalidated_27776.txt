I agree with most that has been said here, but I want to introduce a few practical issues that arise when applying for jobs in finance. Often you will see ads stating that a PhD in statistics or mathematics is required to apply for a particular trading or quantitative developer position. I know there are some particular reasons for this. Mind, I'm not saying this is right, but it is what happens in practice: There are many applicants to the job, especially for the most well known companies, and the employer can't possibly dedicate enough time to each candidate. Filtering applications based on the academic background shrinks the population size to a more manageable number. Yes, there will be misses. Yes, it's not the best way to find productive individuals. But on average you are looking at skilled professionals who have dedicated years to learn the craft. They should at least have the discipline to overtake a complex research project. The team and the company will be enriched by a number of PhDs to showcase to investors and clients. This will give an image of "oracleous" knowledge to the company and benefit its reputation. The company intangible valuation can rise. The average investor will be more confident in granting their capital to such a knowledgeable team of scientists. You can make a similar point about MBAs. Finally sometimes corporate policies dictate that higher academic achievements should have a preferential career path and compensation. I believe this is true for most corporations in different industries, not just finance. It is hard to see John with a BS in computer sciences managing PhDs in mathematics.
