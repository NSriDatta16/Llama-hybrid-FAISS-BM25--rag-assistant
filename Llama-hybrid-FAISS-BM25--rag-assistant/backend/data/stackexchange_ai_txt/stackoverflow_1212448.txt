Generating RESTful API documentation from a WCF Service

I've recently started on a project to build out a RESTful API in WCF, and I'm going to need to expose documentation along with the API itself. I was hoping to leverage the XML code comments in my docs for this documentation. But what I want to output is just the contracts that are exposed by the service: the endpoints and the JSON/XML object structures. Since I'm trying to create external documentation, I'm interested in any of the internals of my library, or how it ties into the .Net Framework (or even that it is .Net, for that matter). What are my options for tools, to create these docs? I've heard that Sandcastle or Doxygen are good tools for generating docs from XML code comments, but can I filter away the classes and methods that I don't want to expose?
