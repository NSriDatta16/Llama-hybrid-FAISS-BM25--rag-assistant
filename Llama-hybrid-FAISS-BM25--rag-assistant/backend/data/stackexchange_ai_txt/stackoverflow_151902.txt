As others have mentioned Windows is unlike UNIX where the file systems have a single logical "path" space for all the devices (each device mounts into this space, such as at /dev/floppy). In Windows, each device (be it a Hard Disk partition, a CD/DVD Rom or a flash drive) has its own logical path space, rooted at the "\" directory of its logical drive letter. While Windows Explorer does a half-decent job of organizing all the drives under "My Computer", this is pure UI sugar, and there's no way to get from one drive letter to another via relative paths. Each individual drive filesystem does however behave similarly to UNIX, and does have a root called "\".
