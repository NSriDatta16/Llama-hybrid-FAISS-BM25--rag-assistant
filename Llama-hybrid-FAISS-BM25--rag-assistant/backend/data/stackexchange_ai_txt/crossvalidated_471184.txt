GARCH models the entire distribution of a time series with (potentially) time-varying mean, time-varying variance but constant distributional features otherwise (e.g. time-constant higher moments once time variation in the first two moments is accounted for). The distribution of $y_t$ modelled by GARCH is moving up and down due to the conditional mean equation (unless the equation specifies a constant conditional mean) and its spread increases and decreases due to the conditional variance equation; see the direct expressions of the density of $y_t$ under GARCH and ARMA in my answer to the question "What is the difference between GARCH and ARMA?". You can also include seasonal and other effects into the equation of $\sigma^2_t$ in the GARCH model, thereby allowing richer dynamics depending on external regressors. What is specific to GARCH is that it offers a special kind of time-varying variance, the autoregressive one. Alternatively, if the conditional variance is not autoregressive but time varying in other ways, you can specify models other than GARCH for it. I have forgotten how the FB Prophet works, but perhaps it would be suitable for the task. On another note, you may wish to allow for time-variation in higher-order moments in addition to the first two. Volatility modeling is considered a special topic as its focus is the time-variation in the second moment, something different than the usual focus on the first moment. If more moments were modeled explicitly in addition to the second moment, we would have more flexible modeling of the density, but when only the first two moments are time-varying with explicit equations for them and the subject-matter focus is more on the variance than the mean, it makes sense to call this volatility modeling.
