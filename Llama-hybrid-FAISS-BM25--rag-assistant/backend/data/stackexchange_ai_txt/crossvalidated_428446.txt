The posterior is $$p(\omega,\theta,\kappa_2 | y) \propto p(\theta | \omega, \kappa_2) p(\omega)p(\kappa_2)f(\kappa_2,\omega,\theta; y)$$ Individual or marginal posterior can be obtained by integrating out other parameters, which in MCMC case, comes down to "ignoring" the other samples, and looking at one variable in isolation. Try to work out the math, and you'll see marginalizing is equivalent to "ignoring" the other variables (again, this is in the case that you are looking at samples/empirical distributions).
