Multivariable Wald to test equality of multinomial coefficients

I am trying to replicate a test in the Hosmer - Applied Logistic regression text (pp 289, 3rd ed) that uses a Multivariable Wald test to test the equality of coefficients across the 2 logits of a 3 category response multinomial model. Iâ€™d like to see whether (from a statistical standpoint) it is acceptable to collapse the 2 response categories and then simply use a binary logistic regression. The idea is that if the coefficients across the 2 logits are similar (non-significant p value with Wald test), then it is reasonable to pool the categories. There does not seem to be a built in way to do this in R? Using the mtcars dataset as an example (for the sake of the example, using cyl as a 3-factor response), does anyone have any ideas how to do this library(nnet) data(mtcars) mtcars$cyl summary(mod) Call: multinom(formula = cyl ~ am + hp, data = mtcars) Coefficients: (Intercept) am1 hp 6 -42.03847 -3.77398 0.4147498 8 -92.30944 -26.27554 0.7836576 So, I want to simultaneously test whether the 3 coefficients across the 2 logits are similar. Thank you.
