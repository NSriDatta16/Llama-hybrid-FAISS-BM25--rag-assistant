How does ResNet or CNN with skip connections solve the gradient exploding problem?

I read some papers which said that the ResNet or Highway networks can mitigate the gradient vanishing/exploding problem in very deep neural networks. I'm not sure how the skip connections can solve the gradient exploding problem. Could anybody give some explanations or references? Thanks.
