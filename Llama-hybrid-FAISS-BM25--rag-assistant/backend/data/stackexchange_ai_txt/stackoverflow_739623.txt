maintain history in a database

I am designing this database that must maintain a history of employee salary and the movements within the organization. Basically, my design has 3 tables (I mean, there more tables but for this question I'll mention 3, so bear with me). Employee table (containing the most current salary, position data, etc), SalaryHistory table (salary, date, reason, etc.) and MovementHistory(Title, Dept., comments). I'll be using Linq to Sql, so what I was thinking is that every time employee data is updated, the old values will be copied to their respective history tables. Is this a good approach? Should I just do it using Linq to SQL or triggers? Thanks for any help, suggestion or idea.
