Is probabilities mean of predicted class (RandomForest) a consistent estimator of class recall?

I'm working on a classification problem in order to predict among 50 different classes. I'm using a Random Forest classifier and I'm using the predict_proba method to the fitted RandomForestClassifier in order to know the estimated probability of the predicted class. Then, for each class, I calculate this estimated probability mean m . This mean could be interpreted as "On average, for this predicted class, the RF classifier estimates that it has m% chance that the prediction is correct". On the other side, the recall is the percentage of correct predictions for each class (fixed ground truth). If I'm right, and if it's correctly constructed, this mean should be close the class recall. But is it ? Is this mean a consistent estimator of the class recall ? Should it ?
