I'm afraid Mladen is correct. You can move the db's from one instance to another using attach/detach or backup/restore. You can transfer all logins (if needed) with this method . You can move SQL Agent scripts by right-clicking on them on the existing server and selecting generate script then running that script on the new server. . You will have to do the following (Assuming you'd like to make 2008 your default instance): Install 2005 named instance. Move the default to the named using above method. Uninstall 2005 default instance. Install 2008 default instance. Move the named to the default using above method. Uninstall 2008 named instance. Good luck!
