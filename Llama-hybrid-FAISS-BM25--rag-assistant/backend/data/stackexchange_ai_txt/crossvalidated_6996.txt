If I were a hardcore Frequentist I would remind you that confidence intervals are quite regularly just inverted hypothesis tests, i.e. when the 95% interval is simply another way of describing all the points that a test involving your data wouldn't reject at the .05 level. In these situations a preference for one over the other is question of exposition rather than method. Now, exposition is important of course, but I think that would be a pretty good argument. It's neat and clarifying to explain the two approaches as restatements of the same inference from different points of view. (The fact that not all interval estimators are inverted tests is then an inelegant but not particularly awkward fact, pedagogically speaking). Much more serious implications come from the decision to condition on the observations, as pointed out above. However, even in retreat the Frequentist could always observe that there are plenty of situations (perhaps not a majority) where conditioning on the observations would be unwise or unilluminating. For those, the HT/CI setup is (not 'are') exactly what is wanted, and should be taught as such.
