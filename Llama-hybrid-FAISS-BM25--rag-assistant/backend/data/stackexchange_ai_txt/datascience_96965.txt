The most common goal of machine learning is to learn the best overall model for the entire dataset. Given that goal, your time would be best spent on samples where the model is very confident but wrong. Correcting these errors will have the greatest effect on decreasing training error and the greatest chance of increasing generalization. Other paths might be useful for exploratory data analysis but will not as directly improve model performance. For example if the model is uncertain about a datapoint, then set a threshold to not make a prediction.
