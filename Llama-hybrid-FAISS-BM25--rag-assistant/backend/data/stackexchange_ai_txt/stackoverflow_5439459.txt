It sounds like memberTypeID is the only one-to-many relationship among the four ID's that you chose to create. So it's advisable to break that out to a related table as you've done, to eliminate repeated elements ('First Normal Form') The other three don't seem to refer to one-to-many relationships (each of them sounds as if it'll be unique to the primary table) so I'd move the contents of the other three back into the primary table.
