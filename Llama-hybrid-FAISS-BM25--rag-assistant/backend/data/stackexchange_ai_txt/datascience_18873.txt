If all above fails, I'd try this: Fit model for each class. So you'd have four models, each specialized for that particular class. I'd give a shot to any ensemble modeling technique - fit multiple models and combine them in a smart way. Complex methods such as neural networks (I heard that GAN's are popular these days with impressive results). But that can be overkill. In case non of that works, it could be just that your data cannot be separated in any way. I'd suggest to make some basic plots and calculate some simple statistics to get better understanding of the data and its separability.
