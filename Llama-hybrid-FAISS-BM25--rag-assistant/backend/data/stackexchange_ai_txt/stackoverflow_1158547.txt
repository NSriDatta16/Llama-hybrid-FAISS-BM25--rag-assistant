From wikipedia article Code coverage is a measure used in software testing. It describes the degree to which the source code of a program has been tested. It is a form of testing that inspects the code directly and is therefore a form of white box testing 1 . Currently, the use of code coverage is extended to the field of digital hardware, the contemporary design methodology of which relies on Hardware description languages (HDLs). Advocating the use of code coverage A code coverage tool simply keeps track of which parts of your code get executed and which parts do not. Usually, the results are granular down to the level of each line of code. So in a typical situation, you launch your application with a code coverage tool configured to monitor it. When you exit the application, the tool will produce a code coverage report which shows which lines of code were executed and which ones were not. If you count the total number of lines which were executed and divide by the total number of lines which could have been executed, you get a percentage. If you believe in code coverage, the higher the percentage, the better. In practice, reaching 100% is extremely rare. The use of a code coverage tool is usually combined with the use of some kind of automated test suite. Without automated testing, a code coverage tool merely tells you which features a human user remembered to use. Such a tool is far more useful when it is measuring how complete your test suite is with respect to the code you have written.
