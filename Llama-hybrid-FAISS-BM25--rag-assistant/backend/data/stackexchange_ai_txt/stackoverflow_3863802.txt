How to use User.Identity.Name as a parameter for SqlDataSource in ASP.NET?

For SqlDataSource I can configure the external source for the incoming paramater. For example it might be a QueryString, Session, Profile and so on. However I do not have an option to use User as a source. I know that I could provide value for the parameter in Inserting,Selecting,Updating,Deleting events. But I do not think that this is an ellegant solution because I have some parameteres already definied in aspx file. I do not want to have parameters defined in two separate places. It makes mess. So can I somehow define this parameter in .aspx file? //User.Identity.Name goes here as a value for another parameter
