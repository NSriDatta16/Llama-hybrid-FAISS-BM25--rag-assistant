You can add as many categories as you like as long as you do not run into problems like a perfect seperation. Also, as you add more levels, you will typically loose statistical power. So adding levels is not free. As to binning, that depends on the substance. Take occupation code: There are many class schemes like the EGP classes (Erikson, Goldthorpe, Portocarero 1979) or micro classes (Weeden and Grusky 2005). You could also transform occupational codes to a measure of occupational status like the ISEI (Ganzeboom, De Graaf and Treiman 1992), and add that linearly. There are long debates on which one is best, but in essence they just represent different theories and measure slightly different things. So, whichever is best depends on what your question is. R.
