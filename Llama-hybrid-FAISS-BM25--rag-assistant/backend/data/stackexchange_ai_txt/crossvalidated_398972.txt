Are random variables sampled upon stopping rules exchangeable?

In this article from D. Berry https://www.jstor.org/stable/2684222?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents the author uses an example to introduce some limits of p-values in frequentists analyses. He takes an example where two different sampling schemes lead to different inferences even if the same data are collected: A sampling of 10 Bernoulli, resulting in 8 sucesses and 2 failures A sampling of Bernoulli until 8 sucesses are obtained, resulting in 10 draws with 8 sucesses and 2 failures Letting $\theta$ be the probability of success the likelihood are the same for both experiments : $$\theta^8(1-\theta)^2$$ When testing $\theta = \frac{1}{2}$ versus $\theta > \frac{1}{2}$ those sampling schemes lead to different p-values. Since p-values can be stated as $P(T(X) \ \text{"more extreme than"} \ T(X_{obs}) \mid H_0)$ this lead to different definitions of "more extreme observations" base on the sampling scheme used and to different p-values. However, even if this shows a limit of usual frenquentist analyses regarding the Likelihood principle my question is: are Bayesian analyses still relevant under the second sampling scheme? It seems to me that those observations are not exchangeable in this case since observing 8 sucesses in a row will prevent from observing the 2 remaining values.
