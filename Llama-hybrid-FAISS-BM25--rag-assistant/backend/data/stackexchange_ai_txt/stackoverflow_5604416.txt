Do you know of a good event management software?

I'm creating a website for an event. We require storage of attendee's email-address, approval to sign-up to newsletter(s) and first & last name. Credit card information needs to be sent somehow (PayPal? and EGold?) with payment approval noted in our database. Confirmation emails need to be sent after sign-up (including receipt), also 2 reminder emails need to be sent; the month before and week before the event. Which event management software project (Django-based?) should I use for this website?
