Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) before or after k-fold cross-validation?

I have features extracted from a small dataset, would like to reduce the dimensions by using LDA. Also want to do a SVM classification with k-fold cross-validation. My question is: What would be the best practice: to do LDA before the CV, or to do LDA within the CV (i.e. to each train and test fold)?
