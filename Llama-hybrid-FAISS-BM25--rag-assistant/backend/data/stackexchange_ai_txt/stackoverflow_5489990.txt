The currentTarget of the drag event should be the TreeItemRenderer or your Tree component depending on where the drag is. The DragEvent extends MouseEvent and contains the current x,y position of the mouse pointer. You can compare the mouse coordinates to the coordinates of the item renderer to see where on the item renderer the mouse is currently located. If it is in the center show feedback for dropping in the folder if it is within x pixels of the top or bottom of the renderer then show the feedback for dropping at the same level as the folder.
