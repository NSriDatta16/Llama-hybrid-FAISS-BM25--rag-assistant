Calculating expected total populations based on evolutionary advantage

How to set up a spreadsheet to run scenarios based on the following: If people A have genetics that give an $a\%$ advantage over other people $B$ of surviving to age $m$ , mating age, and the average person has $p$ progeny, and the average age of death is $d$ , after $g$ generations how what percentage of the population will have people $A$ 's genetics? The idea being, let's say a certain mutation gives a person a $5\%$ better chance of surviving to mating age. If the average mating age is $15$ , couples have an average of $4$ children, and everyone dies at age $50$ , after $1000$ generations how much better will people with that mutation do as based on their percentage of total population.
