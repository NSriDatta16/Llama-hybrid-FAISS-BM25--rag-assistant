Are there any Unforseen Difficulties with Offloading Image Storage to Amazon CloudFront using C#?

I'm contemplating the use of Amazon's CloudFront service to offload my web applications image/file storage from my web host. Users of my app can upload images, the image is named and the path is stored in a database. I'm thinking of just having the app upload the image to CloudFront and then change the path to use the CloudFront service. Shouldn't be too hard... I've read of other developers using CloudFront for static images and haven't seen too much about using it for the primary storage of images that can be uploaded/deleted at any time. My app is ASP.NET MVC based, using C#. Has anyone used C# to setup an upload to CloudFront, from the user's uploaded file? Anyone recommend against this? The pricing looks affordable and the speed looks fantastic. The only thing that comes to mind would be in developing it, are there any technical difficulties in developing this that I'm unaware of? Should just be a simple file upload as long as my web app has write permissions, am I correct? Thanks in advance!
