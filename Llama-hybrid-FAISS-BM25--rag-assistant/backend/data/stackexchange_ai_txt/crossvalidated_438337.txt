Aggregation of daily futures prices to quarterly prices

We are working to incorporate the EIA future prices into our quarterly data set of financial balance sheet data. There are four different contracts, which are available at the EIA website . The idea is that instead of spot prices, we are using the prices of the future contracts as a more forward-looking price time-series. Initially, we just aggregated per contract and month and then averaged the three resulting values again for the complete quarter. 2019 - Q1 - January - Avg. of 1-Month-Ahead Contract 2019 - Q1 - February - Avg. of 1-Month-Ahead Contract 2019 - Q1 - March - Avg. of 1-Month-Ahead Contract I am pretty sure this is not optimal, since two of the values only look forward into the same quarter. Therefore, I am looking for better or established empirical ways to aggregate the futures data to a quarterly value. The available contracts are the respective forwards for 1 to 4 months ahead.
