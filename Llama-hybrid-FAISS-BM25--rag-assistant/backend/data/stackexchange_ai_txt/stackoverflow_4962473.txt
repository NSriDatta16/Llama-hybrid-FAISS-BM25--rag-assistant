JNLP with Custom Progress - loads applet classes before displaying progress

I have a JNLP that specifies a number of resource jars. One has the download="progress" to display a custom progress bar as other resource jars are loaded. The progress is found and displayed as expected, however it waits to display progress until after four of the other jars are loaded as well (these are 3MB). It then shows the progress for the rest of the resources (another 4MB) I expected the progress jar to load first and display before starting downloads of the main jar and any dependency jars. The jars that are loaded seem to contain the classes that are directly referenced by the "main" jar whereas the progress jar is only a few KB and has no dependencies/imports on any other jar in resources. Is there a way to configure JNLP to download only the progress jar first and display it and then grab the rest of the resources?
