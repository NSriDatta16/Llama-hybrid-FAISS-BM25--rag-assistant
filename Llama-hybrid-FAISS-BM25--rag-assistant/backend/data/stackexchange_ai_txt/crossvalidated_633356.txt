In addition to the differences between Mann-Whitney and mixed linear models, as noted by Stephan Kolassa, part of your problem might be: After applying a Mann-Whitney test to examine differences between groups for each dependent variable at each phase, I found some significant results. That sounds like you did multiple comparisons over multiple outcome variables at multiple experimental phases. That leads to a potential multiple-comparison problem : if you do enough comparisons, some will pass a given threshold of "significance" even if there aren't any true differences. If you didn't correct the Mann-Whitney tests for the multiple comparisons you might well have found nominally "significant" differences that aren't real. Note that the Mann-Whitney test can be considered a special case of ordinal logistic regression, a method that allows you to avoid the multiple pairwise testing you thought that you needed to perform. See Chapter 13 of Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies . Finally, if a parametric linear model is appropriate then these data might not require mixed modeling. It sounds as if a classic multivariate (multi-outcome) linear model might be OK, or other approaches like those described in Chapter 7 of Regression Modeling Strategies .
