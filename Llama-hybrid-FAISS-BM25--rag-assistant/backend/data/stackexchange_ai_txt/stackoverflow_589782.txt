c# Matrix of pictureBox

I'm developing a puzzle game for windows mobile. The objetive is to split an image in nine parts and rearrage them to obtain the original image. These split images are put on pictureBoxes and these pictureBoxes are redistributed in a matrix of 3X3 cells. The user move this cells to arrange them in the correct position (it's a puzzle game!). I need something to access these pictureBoxes and to know where are they in the matrix. Suppose that I need to update the image on row 1, column 2 (it's only an example). In C++ I use pointers to reference object, but I don't know how to do it with C#. Any advice? Thanks!
