[Update] The design seems proper. In a Rails specific way how would you validate the uniqueness? When adding a category pull the list and do an indexOf check to ensure it doesn't exist. If it does just bounce back an error. I'm not a Rails guy, let me know if I'm off track or something. I'm not sure MongoDB would be the best choice of storage engines for that. You would be better off using MySQL with a categories table. Knocks against MongoDB: Not ACID transactions No single server durability Not relational (you want relational for a bill tracking application)
