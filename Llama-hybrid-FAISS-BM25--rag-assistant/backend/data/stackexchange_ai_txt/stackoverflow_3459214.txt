You should check out this description of Antiobjects , which is the technique used by the Pacman ghosts to traverse the maze. In particular, note: Each of these antiobjects or agents has an identical and simple algorithm which it runs at every turn of the game. Instead of making Ghosts smart enough to solve "shortest path" problems around the maze, a notion of "Pac-Man scent" is created instead and each tile is responsible for saying how much Pac-Man scent is on its tile. So you consider a similar scent-based technique to control Pacman, perhaps where Pacman preferred traversing a path with a smaller amount of scent; this would reduce the chance of him going over old ground.
