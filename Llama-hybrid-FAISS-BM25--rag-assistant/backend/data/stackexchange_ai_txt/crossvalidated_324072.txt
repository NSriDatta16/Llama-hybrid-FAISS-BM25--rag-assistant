My first reaction is what's the confidence intervals on those estimates (or credible interval if it was a Bayesian analysis)? If the confidence interval is something like, 95% CI [ .1, .5] and 95% CI [.2, .14] I'd conclude that they estimate d to be within a similar range. Even if the results of one of the studies was not significant, like, 95% CI [ -.2, .8] and 95% CI [.2, .14] I'd still conclude they found consistent results.
