Imagine that you have three classes of points that look like a target with a bullseye: one group in the center, then another circling around that, then another circling around those. You can't take a pair of scissors and cut a straight line to separate any of these groups. Now imagine that this graph is on a sheet of rubber, and you stick a pin in the middle to hold it down and then pull the corners up, making a funnel shape. You've deformed the points by moving them from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. Now, you can make a straight cut with your scissors near the tip of the funnel, totally isolating the first group. Then a second straight snip farther up the funnel separates the second and third groups. What were curves in a lower dimension can become straight lines in a higher dimension. (In this example, the $z$ is related to the distance from the center.) This isn't the way that SVM actually does its job, but is the way I can see clearly that projecting data to a higher dimension can do nice things.
