Random Regression in R

I am a student. I have some knowledge of mixed regression models. I would like to implement Random Regression in R. I found "Random Regression Models" by Schaeffer ( http://animalbiosciences.uoguelph.ca/~lrs/BOOKS/rrmbook.pdf ) helpful. I have also read "MCMCglmm Course Notes" by Jarrod Hadfield ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCMCglmm/vignettes/CourseNotes.pdf ) Chapter 4 discusses random regression. My questions: Is "Random Regression" know by a different name, can anybody suggest a good fundamental learning resource that covers this? Preferable a text-book or tutorial type resource. Thanks Greg
