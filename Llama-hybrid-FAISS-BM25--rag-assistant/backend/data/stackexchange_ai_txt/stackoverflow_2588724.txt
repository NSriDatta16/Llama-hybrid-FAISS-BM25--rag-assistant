PHP mssql_query double quotes cannot be used

In java-jdbc, I can easily run the following SQL (NOTE the double quotes around columns and table names) Select cus."customer_id" , cus."organisation_or_person" , cus."organisation_name" , cus."first_name" , cus."last_name" , cus."date_became_customer" , cus."other_customer_details" From "Contact_Management"."dbo"."Customers" cus But the same query in PHP errors out saying invalid syntax "Warning: mssql_query() [function.mssql-query]: message: Incorrect syntax near 'customer_id'. (severity 15) " But If remove all the double quotes, the query works fine and no errors. The query is ported from a java application so I would like to keep the double quotes and the SQL as it is. Any alternative solutions? Thank you Nilesh Volkerk -- Solution (SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON) I did the following $sql = Execute('SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON'); $rs = $db->Execute($sql); And it worked perfect Thank you so much..
