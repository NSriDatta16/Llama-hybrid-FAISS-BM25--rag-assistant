Variance of the mean following multiple steps of subsampling

Let's say we have 10 sets of 1 to 4 values each. First we sample one value from each set, giving us 10 values. We then sample five of these. Lastly, we compute their average. If one repeated this two-step subsampling and averaging procedure thousands of times, one would obtain a distribution of means. How would I go about computing the standard deviation of these means?
