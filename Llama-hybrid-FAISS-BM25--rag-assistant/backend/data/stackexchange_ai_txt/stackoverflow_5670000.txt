Visual Studio: Missing Ctrl+O+O, Ctrl+T Eclipse analog

I very like Eclipse Ctrl + O + O hotkey which includes in the list of members not only members of current class, but also all the members of all super-classes. "Quick type hiererchy" feature also is pretty useful. Resharper has Alt + End and Alt + Home keys, but it doesn't organize result in a tree what is very handy. Is it possible to get mentioned functionality in VS?
