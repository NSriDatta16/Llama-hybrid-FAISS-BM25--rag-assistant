Cross Tabulation vs Logistic Regression

I ran a logistic regression with 20 variables. This model is to figure out what factors contribute to a greater likelihood of being a donor. Dependent Variable= donor (y/n) (1/0) Independent Variable in question = BEC member (y/n) (1/0) I ran the logistic regression and MLE for BEC was -.4265 and the odds ratio was .426. The odds ratio seems to say that for every person who is a BEC member there is a less likelihood that they donate. This doesn't seem to be consistent with the cross tab because if someone is a BEC member then they seem to have a much greater chance of being a donor. Am I reading the cross tab incorrectly? Or was there something wrong with my logistic regression model?
