PCA vs t-SNE in asset pricing

So I am trying dimensionality reduction techniques on the S&P500 FY2020 data. I understand the CAPM model and the fact that doing a PCA determines my market variability factor (the first PCA component). What I am wondering is, what intuitions (if any) does t-SNE give on the same data? Using scikit-learn I have embeddings for the first component, but does the embedding relate to CAPM in any way? Or for that matter any other asset pricing model? What I have tried, PCA for 99% variance and computed projections for the first PC (PC1 weight times daily change of every stock's price, then summed across all stocks) A 2D t-SNE on the same data A 1D t-SNE on the same data Below is a plot of the above 3.
