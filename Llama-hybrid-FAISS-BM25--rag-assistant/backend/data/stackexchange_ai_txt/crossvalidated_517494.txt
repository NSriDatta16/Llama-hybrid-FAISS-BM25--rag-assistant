How to find out the pattern or structure of the ACF plot only through the equation of an AR(1) process?

I recently started studying about time series analysis and forecasting and stuck on a problem statement as follows: I have been only given the equation of one $MR(1)$ and $AR(1)$ processes i.e. $Z_{t} = 0.5a_{t - 1} + a_{t}$ and the other one $Z_{t} = 0.8z_{t - 1} + a_{t}$ and asked to determine the pattern of the $ACF$ plots generated for the both the processes. The only thing which I am able to get from the equation is that as $|\phi| means the given time series data for which $AR(1)$ equation is generated is stationary. But how to find out the information for the pattern or structure of $ACF$ plots from the equations given. Could you also generalize the steps for any type of $AR(1)$ and $MR(1)$ process equation?
