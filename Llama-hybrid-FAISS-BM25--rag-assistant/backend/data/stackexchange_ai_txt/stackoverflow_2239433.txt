Something as simple as a check on compilation failure should be considered mandatory, nuff said . Check-ins that lead to broken builds should be unacceptable, although the sad truth is that many organizations do accept such. If the compilation fails: …you won't have a binary to use or run. …you can't run tests and analysis to make sure it works. …you can't do any other checks needed to build the project. …you can't please your client because you have nothing to show. Why? BECAUSE THE BUILD IS BROKEN .
