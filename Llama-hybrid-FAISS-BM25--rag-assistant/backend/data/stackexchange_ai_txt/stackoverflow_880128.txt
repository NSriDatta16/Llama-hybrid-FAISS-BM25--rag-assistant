(WPF) How to keep GUI code from being a mess

I have a GUI that is going to do a lot of disparate tasks. I currently have these separated in a tab UI. The functionality that does all of the heavy lifting is split into separate classes, but what is left still looks like a mess. How do you organize the GUI functions in code so that everything is coherent? I'm working with WPF specifically, but general answers are also appreciated.
