If you are trying to learn Drools there is also a pretty good book that has been published recently. It can be found at http://www.packtpub.com/drools-jboss-rules-5-0-developers-guide/book . I had already been using Drools for a while when it came out, but skimmed through it to learn some new concepts. Some of my teammates have also read the book and agreed it helped their understanding of the tool/application. There are some short falls. The information isn't organized real well. You must read it from front to back or you're sure to miss some foundational concepts that will inhibit you're learning at later points. Also the example code can be a bit hard to work through. Overall though I would say it will help flatten your learning curve.
