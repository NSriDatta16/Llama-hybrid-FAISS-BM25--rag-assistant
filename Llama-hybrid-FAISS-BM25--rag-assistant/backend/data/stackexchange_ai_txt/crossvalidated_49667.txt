I think you have confused the parameter you are trying to estimate ("p", the probability of a randomly chosen matrix having the property you are interested in) with the p-value or alpha value in significance testing in the question you have linked to. There is no relation between these different uses of "p" at all. Further confusion is whether your "p" is the real probability, your best estimate of that proability, or the upper limit of the confidence interval that you hope contains that probability. You may need to invest in some more letters. It sounds like you are trying to create a 99% confidence interval, with zero as the lower limit and an unknown number p as the upper limit, which contains the true probability of a matrix having that probability with 99% confidence (ie repeating the procedure infinite times, it would correctly include the true value 99% of the time). There is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing the value of p that gives you 99% confidence in the coverage of the interval [0,p].
