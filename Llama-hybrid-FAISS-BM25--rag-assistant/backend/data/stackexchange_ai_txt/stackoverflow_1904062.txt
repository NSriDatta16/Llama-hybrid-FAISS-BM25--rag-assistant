How to maintain table row height in scrolling window - Firefox?

I have a html table with static headers. The rest of the body scrolls within a fixed size window. (Using overflow:scroll; height:550px; overflow-x:hidden; for the tbody ) When the number of rows is less than what fits in the scrolling window, the row size automatically expands to fill the entire scroll window. How do I "disable this"? For example, with only 1 row in the table, the height of that one row becomes (gigantic) the height of the scrolling window. How do I maintain the original row height, even is it is the only row in the scrolling window? I attempted to use the CSS height property for all but it didn't take. (FYI - In IE, the original row size is kept.) Any suggestions? Thanks
