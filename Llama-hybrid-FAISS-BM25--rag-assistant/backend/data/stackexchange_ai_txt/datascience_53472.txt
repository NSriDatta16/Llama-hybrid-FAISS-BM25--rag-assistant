Is the activation function the only difference between logistic regression and perceptron?

As far as I know, logistic regression can be denoted as: $$ f(x) = \sigma(w \cdot x + b) $$ A perceptron can be denoted as: $$ f(x) = \operatorname{sign} (w \cdot x + b) $$ It seems that the only difference between logistic regression and a perceptron model is the activation function. Is this correct?
