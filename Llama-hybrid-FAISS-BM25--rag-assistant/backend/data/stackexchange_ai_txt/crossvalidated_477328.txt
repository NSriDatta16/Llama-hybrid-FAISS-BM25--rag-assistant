In the fundamental challenge of Machine Learning: Does the model I built truly generalize? one way to approach it is by using model capacity . Higher the model capacity, the more expressive the model (i.e., it can accommodate more variation). Capacity needs to be tuned with respect to the amount of data at hand. If a dataset is small we are better off training models with lower capacity. Yes you can measure the capacity of a model if you first agree what a good metric has to be used. Usually variation is used for that.
