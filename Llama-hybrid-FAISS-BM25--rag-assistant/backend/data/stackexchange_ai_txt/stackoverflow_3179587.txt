Interesting question. I don't think there are any formal definitions of what a monolithic class is, but you've got the idea. A class that contains multiple components that are logically unconnected, or pointlessly coupled, is a monolithic class. If you've read The Pragmatic Programmer , which I strongly recommend, you can define a monolithic class as an anti-pattern that goes against almost everything from that book. As for examples, you'll find more in the realm of chip and OS design, where there are formal definitions of monolithic chips/ kernels , which are similar to a monolithic class. Here are some examples, although each of them can be argued against being on this list: JOGL - Java bindings for OpenGL. This could be arguable, and with good reason. Most academic projects - For obvious reasons. If you started programming alone, rather than joining a team, then chances are you can open one of your first projects, and there will be a class that is monolithic.
