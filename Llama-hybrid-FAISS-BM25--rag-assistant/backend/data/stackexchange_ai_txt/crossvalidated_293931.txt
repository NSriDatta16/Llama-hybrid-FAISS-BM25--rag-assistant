You should use a feed-forward neural network, not a convolutional one. The idea behind neural networks is to work with hierarchical features. The idea behind convolutional neural networks is to find hierarchical features which are translation invariant across the image. Since your pixels are not arranged in any nice ordering, and there is no notion of translation invariance anymore, you must drop the convolutions, and just use a feed-forward network, which is perfectly capable of finding hierarchical features. The idea you said about choosing features randomly and using them as the x and y axes on an image might work, but it would be very tricky to get right. You would have to somehow discretize those values onto a grid. If you were dead-set on doing this, I suppose you could choose random features to use as x and y and see which two features work best.
