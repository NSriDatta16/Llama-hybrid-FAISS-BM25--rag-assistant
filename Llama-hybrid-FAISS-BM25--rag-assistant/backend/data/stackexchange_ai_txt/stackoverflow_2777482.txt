This is not possible. You'll need to use GB2312 characters from the beginning on instead, or to change the entire application to use UTF-8 only. You can't convert from character encoding X to character encoding Y that way. Any character outside the ASCII range would possibly get corrupted. The form's accept-charset attribute as some suggest is ignored by most webbrowsers. The W3 spec also literally states "User agents may interpret .. " , not "must" . And even then, it would only be used to encode the actual user input, not the hidden fields as in your example. They are already encoded in the page's own encoding (in this case GB2312). In other words, those UTF-8 characters are already corrupted at the moment the page is been processed by the browser.
