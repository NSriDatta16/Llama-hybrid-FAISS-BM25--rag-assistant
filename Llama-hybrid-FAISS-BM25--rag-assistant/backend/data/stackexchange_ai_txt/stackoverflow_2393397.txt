Have you tried:- private IsolatedStorageSettings app = IsolatedStorageSettings.SiteSettings; string loginId = app["LoginId"]; ? That should work fine. Note that if you are delivering your app entirely in Silverlight then you should consider using Silverlight's navigation framework so that you are not actually re-loading various Xaps as you navigate.
