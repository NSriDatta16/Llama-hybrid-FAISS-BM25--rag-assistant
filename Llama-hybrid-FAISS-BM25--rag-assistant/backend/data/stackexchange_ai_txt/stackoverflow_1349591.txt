I think Natalie Downe has the right approach to CSS organization, which she details in her CSS Systems presentation here: http://natbat.net/2008/Sep/28/css-systems/ The idea is that you move from the more general to the more specific in several chunks: general styles List item body styles reset links headings other elements, tags helper styles forms notiÔ¨Åcations and errors consistant items with normally just one class page structure skeleton including page furniture page components most of your styles will be in here overrides as little as possible goes here
