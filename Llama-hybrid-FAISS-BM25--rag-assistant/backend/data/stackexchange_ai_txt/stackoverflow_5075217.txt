Multithreaded programming in Netbeans Platform

I've looked through the books/docs about NBP, but there is nothing directly talks about multithreaded programming in NBP. Is there anything particular that needs attention regarding to multithreading in NBP? So, if I want to create a multithreaded NBP application, I just need to follow regular Java multithreaded programming practices, right?
