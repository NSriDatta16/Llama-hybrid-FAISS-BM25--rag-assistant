If I simulate many samples from this Normal(a,b) - the average value of all these simulations should equal to "a". The way I see it, simulating numbers from this Normal(a,b) has not really provided me with any new information. In this example, simulation is not important. The distribution of Normal(a,b) is well known and can be estimated with several computational techniques. Simulation is important when the distribution is not so easily computed. However, I keep hearing that it can be important to simulate data from the same model itself It is not clear where you got this from. It might relate to situations where the model is not so clearly computed as your normal distribution example.
