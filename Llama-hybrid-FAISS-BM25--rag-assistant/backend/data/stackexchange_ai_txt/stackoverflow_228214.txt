It can be very pragmatic to configure specific infrastructure concerns as singletons or global variables. My favourite example of this is Dependency Injection frameworks that make use of singletons to act as a connection point to the framework. In this case you are taking a dependency on the infrastructure to simplify using the library and avoid unneeded complexity.
