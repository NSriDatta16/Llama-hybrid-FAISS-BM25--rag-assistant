weights of coocurrence matrix in glove

I was studying the theory behind glove and was checking out some implementations of it. Before passing the data to its neural networks, I noticed that the weights of the co-occurrence matrix aren't the counts between the target and contexts words instead, the matrix is weighted with some dist from the target to the context word. For example: Original Glove at line 332 Pytorch Glove at lines 61 and 63 And at the paper the authors defined $X_{ij}$ like the count of contexts of a word $j$ in front of a word $i$ Why is the co-occurrence matrix weights with this distance value in the implementations? Instead of the counts between them.
