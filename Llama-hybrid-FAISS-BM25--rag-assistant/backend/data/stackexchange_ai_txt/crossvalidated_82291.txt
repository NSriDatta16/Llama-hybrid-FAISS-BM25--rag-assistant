time series dimensionality reduction

I have a call center data (such as one below) that has call data collected every 15 minutes. For a day the periodicity is 96 and for a week the periodicity is (7 x 96 = 672). If I would like to forecast this data I can use models that handle multiple seasonality such as DSHW, TBATS and BATS in R forecast package . As you can imagine having a periodicity of 96 and 672 would require tremendous amount of computational resource and not very many techniques can handle such a long periodicity. I recently came across an excellent article by Shen that uses Singular Value Decomposition to reduce the dimension/periodicity of the time series, so we could have a parsimonious model and the model would be more efficient/require less computational resource. I'm open to other methods such as discrete wavelet transformation (dwt), discrete Fourier transformation (dft) etc., Time in mins Date 0:15 0:20 0:45 1:00 1:15 1:30 1/1/2012 41 12 33 42 38 27 2/1/2012 50 12 20 14 27 46 3/1/2012 30 17 21 44 47 45 4/1/2012 26 15 10 13 50 38 5/1/2012 39 17 22 28 48 12 6/1/2012 30 10 25 30 21 21 7/1/2012 47 46 18 10 36 37 8/1/2012 26 37 41 36 37 12 Below are my questions: How to implement SVD/DWT/DFT based dimensional reduction for the aforementioned time series data using tools like R and matlab ? Are there any automatic procedures available for time series dimensional reduction ?
