save Linked List in Notepad.txt

I draw many triangle polygons and store it in Linked List. My problem is that, when I store the drawing in a Notepad file, the data is unreadable (weird symbol). When I try to print it using println the output is like this java.awt.Polygon@1d6096. How to store the coordinate of the polygon in Notepad? ... java.util.List triangles = new LinkedList (); String pathname = "eyemovement.txt"; ... int[] xs = { startDrag.x, endDrag.x, midPoint.x }; int[] ys = { startDrag.y, startDrag.y, midPoint.y }; triangles.add(new Polygon(xs, ys,3)); ... public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { if(e.getSource() == saveBtn){ try { FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pathname); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos); oos.writeObject(triangles); oos.flush(); oos.close(); fos.close(); } catch (Exception ex) { System.out.println("Trouble writing display list vector"); } } EDITED: I have tried all the suggestions but still I can't managed to get the output as the following. I have tried the "Printwriter" as well, but I cant solved the problem. Help me, please, my head is so heavy with this :-( I draw the triangles, make changes, and store it in Linked List. After finished drawing, and make changes, I click save button and save it in Notepad.txt with hope that I will get the output in Notepad like this: 40 60 50 this line represents vertices Xs of triangle 1 40 40 50 this line represents vertices Ys of triangle 1 60 80 70 triangle 2 60 60 70 100 120 110 triangle 3 100 100 110
