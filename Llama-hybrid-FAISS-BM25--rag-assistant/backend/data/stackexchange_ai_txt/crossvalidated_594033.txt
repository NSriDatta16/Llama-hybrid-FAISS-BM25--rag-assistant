Balancing covariates on binary outcome instead on treatment

Here's the following problem, in the abstract: y is a binary outcome X are covariates c is a continuous treatment/exposure variable a and b are regression parameters y, X, and c are somewhat correlated empirically (but the true model does not have to be). The GLM regression (identity link function) we estimate is thus: y = a * c + b * X + error (Eq. 1) The modern solution is perhaps to pre-balance X based on the continuous c treatment á la Tübbicke. [1] Question : What happens if one instead balances the covariate across the two levels of y (and run Eq. 1)? For example, could this lead to an endogenous selection bias? Example (firm setting, made up but practical) y = firm is insolvent, via an indicator that they announced it c = revenue growth (w.l.o.g. positive growth) X is size, leverage, age, industry, competition, etc Now assume the theory says low revenue growth is a precursor of announcing bankruptcy. The model above is a simple specification to test a Someone in the crowd shouts: are the two groups (insolvent, solvent) comparable firms, why don't you balance the covariates so that the groups are "the same"? Instead of dismissing them, I do think there is an intuitive or reasonable argument to be had. First, correlations are symmetrical, so it's not impossible to get inspired from a model c = y + X + error, whether that makes sense or not. Second, perhaps it's more complicated and firms self-select into a pre-treatment (insolvent but not announcing) status, so it would be nice to have balanced groups. Question : I'm not looking for a complete answer or the perfect DAG, but what would be the framework that guides your answer? How should we think about it and respond to the question-asker?
