Are jobs the only way out for data scientists?

I have reached this point in my data sceince journey that I am left wondering if jobs are the only way out for me... I am highly skilled in Hadoop, Machine Learning and now getting into Deep Learning algorithms... I am bored with having to be employed, I want a way out...any ideas? I would still like to use my skills in my life but what other options exist out here... I am open to ideas and collaborations....
