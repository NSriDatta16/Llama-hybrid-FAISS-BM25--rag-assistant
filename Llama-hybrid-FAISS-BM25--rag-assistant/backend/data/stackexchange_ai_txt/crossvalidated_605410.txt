Is it okay to sum logistic regression coefficients of multiple models to find an "average" model?

If I have N subsets of the data, each with the same variables, and run logistic regressions on each subset, could I then take an average of the coefficients found to find an "average" model? For example, a very large dataset of sensor data that could be split into subsets by machine/device ID. Then, lots of regressions could be run in parallel for efficiency. At the end an average of each of the variable coefficients could be computed. This could then result in a general model for this type of machine/device. Is this completely unreasonable to do?
