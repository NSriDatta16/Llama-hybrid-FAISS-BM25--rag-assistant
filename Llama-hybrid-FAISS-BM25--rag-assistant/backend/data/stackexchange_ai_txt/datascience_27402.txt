Can i use deep learning in my agriculture PHD?

My PHD is about yield of soybeans and it is typical agriculture theme, but I am pretty good with programming and Python programming language and I have already some deep learning programs which I made by myself successfully. Problem is that model is not very easy to show on the paper. Can I show model just like a chart or graph? And maybe somebody already solved issue with transporting deep learning model file to "paper"? Is it normal to use deep learning in my agriculture PHD instead common middle age Linear Regression etc? Inputs and outputs is ok on paper but deep learning model is a little bit controversial in my scientific circles and I don't know how to present it so I'm asking maybe somebody already has successful experience by presenting deep learning model on the paper in science.
