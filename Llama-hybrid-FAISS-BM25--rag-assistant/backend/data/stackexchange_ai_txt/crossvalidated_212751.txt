The sample mean that you obtain from a single sample of size n can be shown to be the Most Likely Estimate (MLE) of the mean of the sampling distribution of sample means (goodness that is a mouthful!). Of course, if you keep taking samples of size n and averaging all of the sample means you obtain to get a better point estimate of the population mean, the standard error of the mean from all these samples will become small and smaller, and your confidence interval will be tighter and tighter. But the idea is that with just one sample of size n, we can estimate a confidence interval around the point estimate of the population mean (using just the mean from our single sample of size n) within which the true mean of the population will fall, with a specified level of "confidence" or probability. Taking say 5 samples of size n, and using the mean of all five samples, will reduce the standard error by a factor of 5^(1/2). It is effectively the same as taking a single sample of size 5n. The economics of sampling and our tolerance for an acceptable margin of error determine how big a sample to utilize under different circumstances. If cost and time are no object, the bigger the better!
