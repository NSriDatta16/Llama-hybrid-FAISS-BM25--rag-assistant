Is this cassandra 0.6.x? You probably want to upgrade to the latest cassandra, 0.7.4 The error is because Cassandra can't locate storage-conf.xml. This file should be in your cassandra conf directory, see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/StorageConfiguration If you upgrade to cassandra 0.7.x, you will need a cassandra.yaml file instead.
