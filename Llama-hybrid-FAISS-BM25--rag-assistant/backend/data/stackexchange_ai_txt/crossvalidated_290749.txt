Covariance function of the cosines of two random variables

I have the following question: Let $\Phi_1(x)$ and $\Phi_2(y)$ be two random variables with uniform distributions $\mathrm{U}[0,2\pi]$ (actually $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ are two random fields so that $x$ and $y$ are two points in $\mathbb{R}^3$). The spatial correlation (covariance) function of these random variables writes: $R_{\Phi_1(x),\Phi_2(y)}(x,y) = \mathbb{E}[\Phi_1(x)\Phi_2(y)]-\mathbb{E}[\Phi_1(x)]\mathbb{E}[\Phi_2(y)] = \mathbb{E}[\Phi_1(x)\Phi_2(y)]-\pi^2$. I wonder if it is possible to relate the correlation function of the random variables $\cos \Phi_1(x)$ and $\cos \Phi_2(y)$, i.e. $R_{\cos \Phi_1(x),\cos \Phi_2(y)}(x,y) = \mathbb{E}[\cos\Phi_1(x)\cos\Phi_2(y)]$ (averages of the cosines of random variables vanish), to the covariance function $R_{\Phi_1(x),\Phi_2(y)}$. Many thanks in advance,
