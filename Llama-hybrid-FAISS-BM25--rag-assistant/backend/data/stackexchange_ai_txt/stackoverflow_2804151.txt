SSIS 2005 - How to Import a Fixed Width Flat File?

I have a flat file that looks something like this: junk I don't care about \n \n columns names\n val1 val2 val3\n val1 val2 val3\n columns names \n val1 val2 val3\n I only care the lines with values. These value lines are all fixed width format and have the same line length. The other junk lines and column names can have any line width. When I try the flat file fixed width option or the ragged right option the preview looks all wrong. Any ideas what the easiest way to get this into SSIS is?
