Ensemble learning with time-varying covariates and effects

We are interested in replicating several duration studies in the literature using ensemble learning methods. After some experimentation, we opted for random survival forests ( Ishwaran et al. 2008 ) for their simplicity and performance. However, the package randomForestSRC in R only allows for time-invariant covariates. As one might guess, many interesting theoretical problems usually involve parameters that take on different values over time. Does anyone know how to implement TVCs in R using machine learning? We would prefer sticking to random forests, but naturally would switch if there is a better alternative.
