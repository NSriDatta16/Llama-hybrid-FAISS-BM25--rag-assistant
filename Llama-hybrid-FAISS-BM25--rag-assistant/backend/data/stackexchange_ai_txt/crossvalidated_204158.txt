Tobit for corner solution models: normality and homoskedasticity tests

I would like to regress several explanatory variables (called X) on a dependent variable called Y where Y is strictly positive and continuous. It is left-censored at 0. Y represents how much a household is willing to pay to protect the environment in a specific area. It is cross-section data. I asked R to run a Tobit I model using censReg package or AER package: tobit or tobit2 and then plot(fitted(tobit), residuals(tobit)) When observing the residuals' plot, I see the distribution is not normal whereas it's necessary that the errors from this regression be normally distributed and homoskedastic. Does anyone know how I can test these errors for normality and heteroskedastcity in R with the specific censored data issue? Using bptest() from the lmtest package - the Breuch Pagan test- does not work. I know that in some programs, like Stata, it's pretty straightforward to test residuals, but I have no idea how in R. Thank you! Mareen
