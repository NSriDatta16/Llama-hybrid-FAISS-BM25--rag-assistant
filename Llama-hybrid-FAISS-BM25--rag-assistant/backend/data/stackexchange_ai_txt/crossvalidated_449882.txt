Using probabilistic scores in Bayesian Optimisation

I was reading up on Bayesian Optimization and in one of the articles, I came across the following passage. We could just use the surrogate score directly. Alternately, given that we have chosen a Gaussian Process model as the surrogate function, we can use the probabilistic information from this model in the acquisition function to calculate the probability that a given sample is worth evaluating. I am trying the understand why this would be necessary? Wouldn't simply using the scores suffice? If we are looking to maximize an objective function and find a sample that gives the highest value on the surrogate model, what's the harm in picking that sample directly? Also, what's the advantage of using acquisition functions based on the probability of improvement, expected improvement, etc? I am trying to find a justification for the extra step.
