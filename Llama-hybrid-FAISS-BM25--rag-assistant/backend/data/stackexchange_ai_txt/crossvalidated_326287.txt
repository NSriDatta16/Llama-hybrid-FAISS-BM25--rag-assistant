Impact of features

How can I see the influence of the features in my model (e.g. what is the impact of a specific feature on the target variable)? Saw a great article ( https://medium.com/applied-data-science/new-r-package-the-xgboost-explainer-51dd7d1aa211 ) "Making the XGBoost interpretable", but that package is not working. So, If I build a model (lets say I use Random Forest, Boosting tree ...). How can I see the impact of each variable (I'm using R most of the time). I only know the VarImp() function, which give the importance of a feature (in a scale 1 - 100, but not if the impact is positive or negative: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-78/topics/varImp )
