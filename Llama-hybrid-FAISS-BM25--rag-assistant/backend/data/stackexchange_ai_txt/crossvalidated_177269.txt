In addition to the severe problems in using SDs to normalize, as noted in the answer from @FrankHarrell, both proposed methods have additional problems and seem to address different underlying hypotheses. They tend to mix up (in different ways) the contributions of the age/sex covariates to cognition and to GM volume. In method 1 the only predictor variable for GM (presumably gray-matter volume) is the difference between observed COG score and the COG score predicted based on age and sex. Thus it ignores any direct effects of age or sex on GM. I would be very surprised if age and sex were unrelated to GM on their own, for individuals having normal COG scores, yet method 1 does not allow for that possibility. In method 2, you model GM as a function of the difference between the individual's COG score and the mean COG score of your entire HC group (among all values of age and sex), along with age and sex as separate variables. If you ignore the normalization by SD, method 2 examines GM ~ a + b * (COG-COG.mean) + c * age + d * sex Note that the mean COG score of the HC group, COG.mean, is a constant and its inclusion just changes the intercept of the model: GM ~ (a - b * COG.mean)+ b * COG + c * age + d * sex So subtracting the mean HC COG score doesn't add anything useful, and the information from the COG scores of the HC group about relations of age and sex to COG is effectively thrown out in method 2. This method combines the contributions of age and sex to COG score with any influences they may have on GM independent of their effects via COG. So neither of these methods addresses a clean hypothesis. If your interest is purely prediction, then a model including COG, age and sex (and potentially many other variables, as indicated by @FrankHarrell) would seem the simplest, and is effectively related to method 2 (without the troubling SD normalization). It seems, however, that you want to test whether there is a relation of GM to some measure of deviation from predicted cognitive function. But method 1 ignore effects of age and sex other than through the predicted COG score, and method 2 ignores the information about predicted COG scores based on age and sex. (And, on reflection, I wonder why you are modeling GM as a function of COG score rather than the other way around.) You have to specify very clearly the hypothesis you want to test, then devise a model that tests it. Added in response to comment Including other scores that evaluate memory or attention, which is certainly in keeping with both answers here, raises the same issues with respect to normalization by sample-estimated SDs. All variables are best entered into the model as their original scores. Keeping the variables in the original scales is not just more convenient, it is also much more reliable. If you try to normalize them into z-type scores before regression, dividing them by sample estimates of their SDs, you are making your results harder to interpret and harder to reproduce. There can be a large error in any sample-based estimate of SD, so you are adding extra variability to your coefficients. Anyone trying to reproduce your results will probably find different sample-estimated SDs and thus different z-scores even on retesting the same individual with the same instrument. There is no problem with including variables having different scales in this type of analysis. You already are doing this in your model with age, COG score, and sex. Your comment on "varying scales" suggests that you are interested in comparing different domain scores for some type of relative importance. If so, do that afterward. For example, you could examine the difference in predicted values between, say, the 25th and 75th percentiles of your sample for each of your domain scores. But be warned that measures of relative importance of variables are highly sample-dependent. You can learn that for yourself by comparing results of the same evaluation of relative importance on bootstrapped re-samples of your data set.
