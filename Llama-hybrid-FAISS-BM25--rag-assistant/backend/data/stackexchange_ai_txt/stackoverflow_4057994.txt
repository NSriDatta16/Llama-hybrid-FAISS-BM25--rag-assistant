I previously suggested ImageJ and others mentioned ImageMagick since I mentioned Java environment. However, I would like to change my suggestion. I came across Intel's OpenCV (Opensource Computer Vision) libraries. This is a great set of libraries for use with C, C++ and Python. This is cross platform too! So porting the code shouldn't be too difficult. Why I think OpenCV is great is because even novices (like me) in Image Processing can use it. for example, smoothing an image is as easy as calling one function cvSmooth() with a few parameters on which type of smoothing (blur, gaussian etc). It supports much more advanced functions such as Optical flow and blob tracking. And the great thing is, its quick to test out or build simple image transforms. for more info please go to http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/ . Here you'll find cheatsheats, reference manuals, examples and some tips. great help and starting point. Thanks
