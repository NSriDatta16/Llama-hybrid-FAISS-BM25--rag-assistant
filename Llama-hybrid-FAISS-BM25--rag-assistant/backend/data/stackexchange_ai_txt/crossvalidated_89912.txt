The predict function for glmnet offers a "class" type that will predict the class rather than the response for binomial logistic regression, eliminating the need for your conditionals. You could also do the cv.glmnet using the type.measure parameter value "auc" or "class" to produce some validation accuracy measures prior to prediction.
