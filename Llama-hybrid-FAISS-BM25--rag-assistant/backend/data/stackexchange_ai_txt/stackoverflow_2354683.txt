jQuery UI droppables in overflow scroll containers

I did ask this question already at the jQuery forums, but they are not as active as here. I have encountered a problem when I have multiple droppable areas on a page. I have a 'static' droppable area that will never move, above a div that has multiple droppable areas and can scroll (overflow: scroll). When I scroll the div so that one of the droppables in the div is 'under' the static droppable, the drop event is fired for both areas if I drop on the static area. Sorry, this explanation might be vague, so I put together a sample: Markup: Draggable Draggable Draggable Draggable Draggable Static Drop Area Droppable Droppable Droppable Droppable Javascript: //create draggables jQuery('.draggables li').draggable({ revert: 'invalid', cursor: 'move', helper: 'clone' }); //the static droppable area jQuery('.static-droppable').droppable({ greedy: true, drop: function(event, ui) { alert('Dropped on static drop area!'); } }); //scrolling droppables Query('.scroll-droppables li').droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { alert('Dropped on scrolling drop area!'); } }); I did try make the static drop area 'greedy', but that didn't seem to help in the situation. Any idea on how to stop this happening?
