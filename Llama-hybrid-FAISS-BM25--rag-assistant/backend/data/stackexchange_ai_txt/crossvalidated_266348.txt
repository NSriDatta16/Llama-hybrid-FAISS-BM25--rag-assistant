what does n_round means in Xgboost

I am using xgboost recently and here are my questions (1) When I applied xgboost both on R and Python, I found that there is a parameter called "n_round" in R, but I can't find this parameter in Python xgbRegressor(). What this n_round means? Does it equals to the n_estimators we set up? (2)By this website http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html I found that it used num_round, which seem to be n_round in R. import xbgoost as xgb xgb.train(num_round = 2) But when in xgbClassifier, why there is no num_round parameter ? from xgboost import xgbClassifier model = xgbClassifier() model.fit(train) Thanks
