From what I understand. SVD has to do with general matrix factorization in some sense. It can be called as a numerical method to do factorization such the we can decompose $A = UDV^T$ such that D is diagonal and U and V are orthogonal. Thats it. Now if we formulate the problem of PCA i.e. find all directions of maximum variation and those directions should be orthogonal and try finding the solution. One solution comes out to be the directions being eigen vectors of the covariance matrix. Thats why SVD can be used to find the solution of PCA. The eigen vectors are the principal components and its importance is based on the eigen value of each eigen vector. ( http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes10.pdf see page 5 footnote of how it comes to be eigen vectors).
