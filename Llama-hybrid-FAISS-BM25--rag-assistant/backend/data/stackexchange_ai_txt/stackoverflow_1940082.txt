In my opinion you are doing something wrong. As I understand: you are trying to instantiate a new object, pass it to browser and get it back. well you cant. If object you want to edit exists already in your storage, then you should alter your ActionLink to reference it by id, and instantiate it inside your Edit action. Take a look at default strongly typed index views created by tooling.
