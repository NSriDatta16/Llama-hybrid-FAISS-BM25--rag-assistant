Since the point coordinates are arbitrary and there is no special relation between them, I don't see this problem as a geometric specific problem. It is the generic problem of efficiently merging S1 and S2 into a new set S. I know about two options: 1) When the sets are stored in a hash table (actually a hash set), the union takes O(|S1|+|S2|) in average . 2) If you store the structures in a balanced search tree , you can achieve a worst case time of O(|S1| * Log(|S1|)), assuming that |S1|>|S2|.
