axis2 "unexpected subelement value"

I'm trying to use Axis2 to connect to a SOAP webservice. This was previously working in Axis 1, but 2 is causing problems. I've regenerated the Java code using wsdl2java which has generated the stubs for Axis2, but it's falling over when processing an element of the server response with "unexpected subelement value". The fragment of the wsdl document in question is: The response being returned looks like: dsfusdbifsdisuibvuidnfuisndfvl\sbvuidn string string string string string dsfusdbifsdisdfsfsdfsdfuibvuidnfuisndfvl\dfgd string string string string string dsfusdbifsdisuibvuidnfuisndfvl\sdfsdfvv string string string string string wwasdfgfbdfb\sbv==uidn string string string string string sort of thing. Most of these blocks process fine, but the last one fails on with the above error. Debugging the code, it fails because reader.isStartElement() returns false and new javax.xml.namespace.QName("","b").equals(reader.getName()) is false - reader.getName() returns "a". Debugging further, reader.currentElement reports " string " instead of the wrapped object type it usually returns. I have tried this with Axiom 1.2.7 and 1.2.8 - both seem to suffer from the same problem. Is this a known bug, or can anybody shed light on what might be going on?
