Dear GantengX, you should prepare your self to the fact that the answer is so large, complex and hard to understand. There is so many approaches to pattern and face recognition. And implementing real-life face recognition system is a huge array of work that one person can never handle. Prepare your self for at least 10 years of life behind books on mathematic and artificial intelligence, I'm not talking about hiring 5 highly payed developers in the end who will understand what you want them to do. And maybe you will end up having your own face recognition system. There are also dozen of other issues that will jump out during the process. So be ready for a life full of stresses and problems.
