I'm very happy with Assembla for my personal stuff. They offer all kinds of version control and project management tools (SVN, Git, Trac, etc). It's free for public projects (though there is a storage limit for these) and they offer rather affordable private plans (which I like a lot for managing my personal stuff with tickets, wiki etc).
