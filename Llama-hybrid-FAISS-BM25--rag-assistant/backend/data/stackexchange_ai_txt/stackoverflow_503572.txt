I dont know the book your using but the question here is what database are you using if its SQL then you can use LINQ to SQL and add a dbml file to your project through the VS designer, then just drag the tales you want to use from the Sever Explorer view onto the the dbml and all your bussness object classes will be auto generated. From there you can use the dataContex created and work with linq to filter the results before they are fetched. What you have been doing right now is filtering the objects you fetched through a diffrent means. HTH, Eric
