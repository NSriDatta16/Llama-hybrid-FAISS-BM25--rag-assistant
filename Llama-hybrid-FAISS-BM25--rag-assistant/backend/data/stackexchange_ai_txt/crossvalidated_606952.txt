The Cochran's Rule that is often simplified to a "minimum of 5 expected counts per cell" is originally meant for contingency tables with degrees of freedom > 1 ( see P. Kroonenberg & A. Verbeek, 2018 ). So it's not that evident that you should merge the "sample" categories together based on this rule, though merging them could prevent you from running underpowered tests â€“ but maybe the question of merging or not these categories should be treated as a separate question, as you seem to focus this question on what kind of following-up tests you could use or not. After conducting your goodness-of-fit test, two options appropriate for a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test are mentioned by D. Sharpe in Chi-Square Test is Statistically Significant: Now What? (2015): calculating residuals , comparing observed and expected cells . I won't rewrite here what Sharpe already wrote very clearly in his open-access paper (see pages 2 and 3 of the pdf ), but be sure to apply corrections to any following-up analysis you conduct after a chi-squared test, to limit the multiple testing problem . (Sharpe mentions some possible corrections in the paper). References: P. M.
