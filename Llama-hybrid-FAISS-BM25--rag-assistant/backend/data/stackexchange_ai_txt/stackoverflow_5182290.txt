Under File->Export in AI, you could choose the SWF format, then use the drop down to export to "AI Layers to SWF Frames" or "AI Layers to SWF Symbols" - This should allow you to keep them organized as movieclips or sprites or whatever. The import usually isn't a totally seamless process and depends on what features you used in AI (drop shadows, kerning/leading don't come across so well, etc).
