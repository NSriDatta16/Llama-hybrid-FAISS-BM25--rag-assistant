How do I call a nested function in a parent document from an iframe

In parent: function outer(){ function inner(){ alert("hello"); } } in iframe parent.outer.inner(); does not work. Edit: So they are private. No problem. The reason for doing this is to try and hide these functions from global scope as much as possible. I thought putting them behind a single function name with a pretty unique name would be the best way to do this. Essentially do I need to parent: function outer(action){ if(action == "inner") inner() function inner(){ alert("hello"); } } iframe: parent.outer("inner"); Is there a more elegant way of doing this?
