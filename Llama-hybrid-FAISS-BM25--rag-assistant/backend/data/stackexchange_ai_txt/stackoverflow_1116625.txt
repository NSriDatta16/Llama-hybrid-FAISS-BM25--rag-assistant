A simple problem with this in general is that any data you get could be very misleading. A lot of the time it is probably other servers making calls to your server. When this is true the location of the server in no way represents to location of the people using it, the user agent will be fake, and you can't tell how many different individuals are actually using the service. There's no referrers and if there is they're probably fake... etc. Not many stats in this case are useful at all. Perhaps make a PHP back end that logs IP and other header information, that's really all you can do to. You'll at least be able to track total calls to the API, and where they're made from (although again, probably from servers but you can tell which servers).
