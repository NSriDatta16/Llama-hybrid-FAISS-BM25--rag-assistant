One way to guarantee this relationship is to specify it explicitly through an if/else statement. E.g.: feature 1 == feature 3 == 100 => output = 5 else output = random forest predictions (you would train the random forest as "normal" is this instance). A couple of other things: changing the number of trees and/or nodes will not change the relationship between features - these are used to control accuracy and over-fitting. Introducing artificial data points is risky as it may cause data imbalances within your training set. creating a new column in the dataset which reflects the relationship might work, but it is not guaranteed.
