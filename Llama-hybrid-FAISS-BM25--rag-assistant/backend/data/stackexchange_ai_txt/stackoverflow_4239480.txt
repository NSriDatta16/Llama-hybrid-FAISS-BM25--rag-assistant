This unfortunately cannot be done currently in the way that you desire. Inline images in HTML email use separate MIME parts that are referenced via a content-id from the body of the message. MFMailComposeViewController doesn't give you control over the MIME structure of the message, and doesn't let you add inline referenced content parts. Embedding image data into tags as base64 can work on some combinations-- it's partly a function of email client and partly of the browser ultimately used to render it, but as you have noticed, it's not broadly portable.
