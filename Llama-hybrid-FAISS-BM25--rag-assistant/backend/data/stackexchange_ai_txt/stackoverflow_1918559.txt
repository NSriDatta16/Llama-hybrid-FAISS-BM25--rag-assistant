How can I have ifdefs in XAML

I have a lot of XAML code and would like to stay compatible with WPF 3.0 while taking advantage of the WPF 4.0 features. For example, I'd like to use UseLayoutRounding if it's available. Of course, I could do this in C#: void SetProperty(..) { #if WPF4 set property #endif } Is there an elegant way to accomplish the same thing in XAML?
