From the Python Style Guide : With regard to listing out a compound expression: Compound statements (multiple statements on the same line) are generally discouraged. Yes: if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing() do_one() do_two() do_three() Or for the code you supplied, Greg's example is a good one: if filecmp.cmp(local, config_file): shutil.copyfile(remote, config_file) else: shutil.copyfile(local, config_file) Rather not: if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing() do_one(); do_two(); do_three() Method Names and Instance Variables Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Update: Per Oscar's request, also listed how his code would look in this fashion.
