Update in 2023 If you are used to python, there is a scikit-learn clone for time series called sktime, which has appropriate methods for this problem: https://sktime-backup.readthedocs.io/en/v0.15.1/api_reference/clustering.html In general we should mention that TSC problems are well known and it is indeed possible. To see how it works I would visit this repo, which also links a paper from 2022. Especially kmedois in Time Series seems to work well with distance based clustering in Time Series problems. https://github.com/sktime/distance-based-time-series-clustering For those, who are lazy, and do not want to visit the github repo, here is the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15181.pdf
