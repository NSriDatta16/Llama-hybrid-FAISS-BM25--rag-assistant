$db = new mysqli("localhost", "", "", ""); $db->autocommit(FALSE); if ($db->query("INSERT ...")) $db->commit(); else $db->rollback(); Make sure your tables use InnoDB engine: MyISAM does not support transactions. Comment update : InnoDB is one of two major storage engines used by MySQL , the other one being MyISAM . MySQL comes with InnoDB support compiled in by default and in fact it takes some effort to disable it. I've never heard of MySQL with InnoDB disabled even by cheapest of the hosters.
