Approximate mean from .25, .5, .75 percentiles

If I have median (.5 percentiles), and the .25 and .75 percentiles, what is the best guess of the mean? If the .25 and .75 percentiles are in the middle of a probability mass with weight .5 (.25 on each sides) and the median has .5 on each of its sides, does it makes sense to approximate the average with: (`.25 pctile` + 2*`median` + `.75 pctile`) / 4 I do not have more granularity as in this case . I would like to avoid fitting a distribution in some parametric sense as in here
