Chunking is needed when file is bigger than settings.FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE (default 2.5M in django 1.2) Take a look at django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage class. It's save() method does the chunk-wise saving job for you and does the proper file locking. storage = FileSystemStorage( location = '/var/www/site/upfiles', base_url = '/upfiles' ) content = request.FILES['the_file'] name = storage.save(None, content) #you can use some suggested name instead of #None. content.name will be used with None url = storage.url(name) # In the older versions of django (e.g in 1.0) there was a defect in generation of file names. It kept adding _ to file names and the uploaded file name got longer and longer if you upload the same file repeatedly. This seems to be fixed in version 1.2.
