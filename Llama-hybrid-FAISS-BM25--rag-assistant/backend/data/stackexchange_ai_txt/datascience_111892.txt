How should a dataset looks like for Time series forecasting

What should a dataset look like for time series forecasting? Can I do time series forecasting with a dataset that contains apartments from ad sites obtained with: web scraping from 2018 to 2021 13 features Date, Region, area, rooms, level, price, levels, type etc. This the dataset link for further information about dataset dataset link Or should I have the historic of the change of price of these apartments over time? Like an appartement in region 1 with 1 room costs X in 2018 and costs Y in 2019?
