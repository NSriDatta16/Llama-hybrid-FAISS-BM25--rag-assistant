You can publish events in any component, by just getting the EA injected. In this case you would probably publish the event once the data retrieval is complete. However, this might not be the best approach. The one I would take is creating an interface for the WebService and registering it in the container. Differnt modules can get the service implementation from the container and request the data on their own without depending on a "feeding notification". There are many threads discussing this in the Prism forums at Codeplex .
