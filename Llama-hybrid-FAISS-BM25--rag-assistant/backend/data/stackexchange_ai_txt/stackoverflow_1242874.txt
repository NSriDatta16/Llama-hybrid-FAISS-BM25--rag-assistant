They're calls to the zlib library functions, so you'll probably find that libhpdf has a dependency on that library. In fact, if you go to http://libharu.sourceforge.net/ , you'll see that you need both zlib and pnglib . Quoting that page here: In addition, ZLIB and PNGLIB are required when you want to use the features of compression and embedding PNG images. (In the case of Windows, static library files for several compilers are included in the package for WIndows. In the case of most of UNIX, these libraries are usually installed.)
