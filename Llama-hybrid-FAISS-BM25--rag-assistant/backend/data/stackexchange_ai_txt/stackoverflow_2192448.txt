One way would be this: test Now, notice regexpr gives you the starting and ending indices of the string: > test [1] 4 attr(,"match.length") [1] 5 So you can use that info with substr function substr("aaa12456xxx",test,test+attr(test,"match.length")-1) I'm sure there is a more elegant way to do this, but this was the fastest way I could find. Alternatively, you can use sub/gsub to strip out what you don't want to leave what you do want.
