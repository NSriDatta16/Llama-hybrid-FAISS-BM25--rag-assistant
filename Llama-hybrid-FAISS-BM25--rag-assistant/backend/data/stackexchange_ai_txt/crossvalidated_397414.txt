What happens with my variance if I multiply observations by 5?

Suppose a dataset with observation values: 2 3 4 4 2 Variance of this observation, assuming this is the entire population, would be: Where the average is: 3. So the variance equals: 0.8. Now, i read around that if I multiply the observation values by 5 , the variance should increase by 25. But that doesn't seem to be the case, am I interpreting something erroneously? 10 15 20 20 10 The average is: 15, so the variance equals: 20.
