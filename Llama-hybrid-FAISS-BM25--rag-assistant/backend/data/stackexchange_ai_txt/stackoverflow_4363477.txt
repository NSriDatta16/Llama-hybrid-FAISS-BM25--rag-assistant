Impact of solving a Millenium Prize Problem

I just learned about P vs NP and the Millenium Prize Problems. I understand that one Grigory Perelman solved one of the problems but rejected the USD1m prize. That made me wonder something: Suppose a computer scientist discovered an algorithm to solve one of the remaining problems (to make it relevant to Stackoverflow, let's use the Travelling Salesman Problem as an example (TSP)) , would it not be wiser for him/her to patent the algorithm and retire rather than settle for that prize money? After all, solving one of maths' important questions should be a big deal. Or does solving the problems have no useful purposes for the average people other than to advance maths? I doubt this is so because the TSP problem seems to have real-world benefit. I would appreciate any enlightenment on this complexity (no pun intended) of human behavior.
