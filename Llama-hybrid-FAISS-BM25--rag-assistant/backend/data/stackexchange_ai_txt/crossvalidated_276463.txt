How about using a generalized linear mixed effect model. What I mean by that is you probably want to fit a longitudinal logistic regression. You have a single binary outcome variable which means logistic regression, further you have dependency where order matters (i.e. your time variable). I strongly feel that using a GLMM will do what you want it to do.
