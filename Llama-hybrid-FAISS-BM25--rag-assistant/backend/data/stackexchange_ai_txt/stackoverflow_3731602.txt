sortable.create: option "dropOnEmpty" not working inside a table with tbody element

I am trying to implement drag and drop functionality using "sortable.create" among 4 tables. The drag and drop functionality is working perfectly fine but is a particular table is empty then I am not able to drop anything inside it even after providing the option "dropOnEmpty: true". How can I resolve this?
