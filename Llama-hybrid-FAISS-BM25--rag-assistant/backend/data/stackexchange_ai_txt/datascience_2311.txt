First we need to understand why we need Deep learning. To build models ML need Test Data with Labels (supervised or unsupervised). In many domains as the data grows maintaining the data with labels is hard. Deep learning networks doesn't need labeled data. The Deep learning algorithms can figure out the labels. So this obviates the need for domain experts to come out with labels for the data which is very important in the areas of speech recognition, computer vision, and language understanding. Google Cat image recognition is a very interesting experiment. Also it is interesting to know "Geoffrey Hinton" the professor who was hired by Google. You may get more insight as you explore in this framework.
