Please use SHA1/256. MD5 is not cryptographically secure anymore and it's discouraged to use it for cryptography (it's fine for file hashes ETC). I'm not posting code, but explaining the technique: First, on the registration, take the SHA1/256 hash of the password and store it in the database. The next time the user logs in you take the SHA1/256 hash of the password he/she entered again and match it against the hash stored in your database. This works because the SHA1 hash for the password is semi-unique (the chances for duplicates are small) for that password.
