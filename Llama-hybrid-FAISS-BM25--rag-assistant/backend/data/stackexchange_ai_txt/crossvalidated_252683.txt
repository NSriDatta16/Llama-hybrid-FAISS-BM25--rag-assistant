Selecting randomly a random variable out of N

I have $N$ well defined random variables (each with their average $\mu_i$ and standard deviation $\sigma_i$). The outcome of an experiment can be the value of one of the random variables. For each variable, I do know their probability $p_i$ of being selected. Is it possible to determine the standard deviation and the average of the experiment?
