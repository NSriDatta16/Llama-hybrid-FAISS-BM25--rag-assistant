Sort on the customer id. And than do the time series split. If there is any overlapping than drop these rows if possible. These are mutually exclusive conditions, meaning that if you have class 2 for customer id in the beginning of the time series and Right and the end of it, you can not expect not to have to drop these rows in the beginning. Because not doing that would damage one of the two posed conditions.
