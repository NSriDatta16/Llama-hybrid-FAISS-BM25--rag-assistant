My solution, unsatisfactory as it may be, is to use no alternating rows colors. I would like to have kept this open, because it still doesn't accomplish what I want to do, but someone responded to this question with a question of his own, not an answer to my question, thereby dragging down my accept rate. If someone comes along with a good answer, I will uncheck this response and check that one. Sorry, but I'm not sure what else to do here.
