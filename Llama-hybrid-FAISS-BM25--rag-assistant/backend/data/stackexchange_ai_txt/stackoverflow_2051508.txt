A lot of options. Your controller's $this->_redirect() delegates the work to Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_Redirector . Check its documentation for all the options, and pick the one you like. Simplest ways not involving custom routes: $this->_redirect('/controller/action/param1/value1/param2/value2'); or $this->_redirect( '/controller/action', array('param1' => 'value1', 'param2' => 'value2') ); You're right in paying attention to the difference between _redirect and _forward . Forwarding means just re-routing the initial request, while _redirect really causes an HTTP redirect.
