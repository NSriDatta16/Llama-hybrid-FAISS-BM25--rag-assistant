When used with loss="hinge" The SGDClassifier gives a LinearSVM , so they should be the same. This is matter of choosing the same hyperparameters for both. Can you check that you using the exact same parameters? As a side note (I don't know your dataset), 41.1 and 41.5 looks pretty similar, this also might be about splitting the training/testing data exactly the same and stopping the training at the correct time.
