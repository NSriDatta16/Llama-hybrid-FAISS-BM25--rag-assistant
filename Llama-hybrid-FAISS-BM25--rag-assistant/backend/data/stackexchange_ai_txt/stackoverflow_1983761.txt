In php you would typically check the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] header in order to identify the web browser from where a web request originates. Developing a web site for a mobile browser is not a totally different world. However you have to keep in mind the following constraints: Screen Size: Not only your screen real-estate is smaller, but sizes and orientations vary a lot between different mobile devices. Flash Support: The majority of mobile browsers do not support flash. JavaScript Support: JavaScript is much more supported than Flash on mobile browsers, especially in modern mobile phones and PDAs. Rendering Performance: Complex pages take longer to get rendered in mobile browsers. In general if you decided to use JavaScript, manipulation of the DOM through JavaScript should be minimal. Mobile Bandwidth: Remember to keep images compressed as much as possible, and to minify all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
