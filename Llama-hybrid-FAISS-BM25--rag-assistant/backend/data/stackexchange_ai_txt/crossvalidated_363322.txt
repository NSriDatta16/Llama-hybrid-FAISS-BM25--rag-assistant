Logistic Regression Z-value

In logistic regression, when we look at Z-values or p-values, are we making an assumption that statistics or coefficients of a predictor follows normal distribution? Null Hypothesis is Coeficient of a predictor is zero. When we accept/reject based on z-value being higher or lower than Z calculated at a certain confidence say 95%, we are assuming normal distribution for coefficients right? What if the distribution is not normal and we are accepting/rejecting for incorrect thresholds?
