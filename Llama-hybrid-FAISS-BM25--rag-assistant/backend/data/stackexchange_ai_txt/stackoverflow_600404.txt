Edit: Sorry. Just read the question. With my advise below, you fork a spare process, and the question of "does in work in a single process does not come up". I also see no reason you couldn't spawn a separate thread to do the push... Not in the least elegant, but you could: open a named pipe. fork a streamer that does nothing but try to write to the pipe pass the name of the pipe which should be pretty robust...
