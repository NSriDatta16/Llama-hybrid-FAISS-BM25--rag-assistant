This problem occurs I think because a __stdcall function (for 32-bit builds) is normally decorated with a underscore prefix and an @count postfix. But if the function is also marked as __declspec(dllexport) additional decorations are added ( __imp , I think). You might be able to avoid using a .def file with the following pragma, if you're willing to live with the pragma (I think I'd go for the .def file): #pragma comment( linker, "/export:DllGetClassObject=_DllGetClassObject@12" ) Note that for an x64 build, you might have to conditionally compile the pragma, which I think would be: #pragma comment( linker, "/export:DllGetClassObject" )
