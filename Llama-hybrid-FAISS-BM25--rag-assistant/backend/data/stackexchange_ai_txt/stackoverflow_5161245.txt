I think you're overengineering your solution. If your application window is not the foreground window when you receive an update, then flash the window. The point of flashing is to capture the user's attention, and you have no way to determine if you have their attention programmatically. It seems like what you really want to know is: "Is the portion of my window that changes currently visible to the user?" That's quite a complex question to answer, and even if you answer it correctly, you have no way to know if the user will notice the change.
