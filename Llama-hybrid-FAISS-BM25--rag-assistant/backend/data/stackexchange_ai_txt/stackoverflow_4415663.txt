Implementing ACL for my PHP application

My RealEstate PHP Application have following user groups, Admins, Moderators Agents i want to specify following permission to the following users. Admins - > Can Create Moderators, Can Create Agents, Can Insert Properties, Can Update Properties, Can Delete Properties Hence an Admin will have all the privileges in short an Admin here will be superAdmin I want to assign limited privileges to the moderator and hence to the agents. i am confused on how to Create a Database for this and also on how to implement it in my PHP Application. thank you
