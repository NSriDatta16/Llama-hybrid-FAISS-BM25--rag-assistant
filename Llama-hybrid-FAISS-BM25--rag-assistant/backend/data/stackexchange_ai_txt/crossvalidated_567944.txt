How can I sample from a shifted and scaled Student-t distribution with a specified mean and sd in R?

I'm currently building some Bayesian models with the brms package and the default intercept prior is student_t(3, 0, 6.3) and so I'm looking to visualise the prior predictive distribution from this prior. Typically I would just use functions like rnorm or unif depending on the distribution; however, the rt function only takes n and df arguments and I cannot specify an SD of 6.3. How can I sample from this distribution?
