Offline storage - db sync

My question is: How can a make my Web app to store local data if not connected to internet and once the connection is available sync them with server. What is best solution to do this. My app is cakephp / mysql, I want to beable to store data, even if connection is down. I could use Sqlite too. I need to know if is possible to make this sync. So, No connection, use sqlite, connection ready, sync it with server.
