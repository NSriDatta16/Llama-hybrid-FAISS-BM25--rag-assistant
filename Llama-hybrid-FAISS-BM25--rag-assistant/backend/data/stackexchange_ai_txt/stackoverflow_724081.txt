Neither of those is actually the best (in terms of how DBAs think). The best would be (assuming RefNo is unique and therefore the primary key): Receivables: RefNo Date ReceivableDollarVals: RefNo Type Amount If RefNo/Date is the primary key, add date to the second table as well. This allows you to minimize storage space for those rows that don't have all three types (although savings is minimal). Then you use WHERE clauses combining the two tables (or JOIN s) to do your queries. It also allows you to add other types at will without restructuring the database. However, you need to keep in mind that third normal form is an ideal. It's quite acceptable to violate the rules to gain performance as long as you understand the implications. 100,000 records is actually quite small so, unless you think you're going to be adding more types in the near future, I'd go for your option 2 and use zeros for those values that don't exist. NULLs would most likely make your queries a little more complicated.
