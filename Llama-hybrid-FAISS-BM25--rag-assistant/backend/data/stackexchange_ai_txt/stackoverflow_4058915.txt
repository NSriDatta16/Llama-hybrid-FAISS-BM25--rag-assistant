Typcasting vector in C++?

I have two classes, obstacle and boid, boid inherits from obstacle. Now I want to write some functions that can work with objects of both classes, so that passing vector does work as well as vector . When I typecast like this and try to access the size of the vector I get a number of 1840700394 instead of 60: vector * boids; .... cout *)boids)->size() I also tryed "reinterpret_cast" but same problem.
