The definition that you quote uses order statistics notation, so $x_{(1)}$ is the first value of the ordered sample (i.e. the minimum), $x_{(n)}$ is the $n$ -th value (i.e. the maximum), $x_{((n+1)/2)}$ is the median for odd $n$ etc. Using such notation you can define the $\alpha$ -th quantile as $x_{(n\alpha)}$ when $n\alpha$ is an integer, e.g. if $n=100$ , and $\alpha = 0.5$ , then $n\alpha = 50$ . Notice however that this differs from how would we understand the median, because for the median we would take the average of $x_{(n/2)}$ and $x_{((n+1)/2)}$ . This is because the definition that you quote is not the formal one, but is rather one of the ways that we may translate the definition of distribution quantile to that of sample quantiles (see Hyndman and Fan, 1996). The definition of distribution quantile is $$ Q(p) = F^{-1}(p) = \inf\{x : F(x) \ge p \} $$ so it is the smallest value of $x$ such that its probability is at least $p$ (in case of your definition, $\alpha$ ).
