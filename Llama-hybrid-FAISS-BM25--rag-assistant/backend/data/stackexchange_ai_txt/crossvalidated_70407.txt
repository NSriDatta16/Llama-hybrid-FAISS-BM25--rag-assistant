Bayesian model averaging in the case of large number of predictors

In the context of a linear factor model, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is used to obtain the posterior probability of all possible combinations of predictors. A final model is obtained as a weighted average of all models, where the weight of each model is its posterior probability. In the case of a large number of factors K, the total number of possible combinations, i.e. models, is $2^K$. Therefore, it is almost impossible to average out over that many models. Is there an approach to get around this difficulty? Thanks,
