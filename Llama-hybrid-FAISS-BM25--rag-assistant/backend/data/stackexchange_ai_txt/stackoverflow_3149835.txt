There are two ways to do this. First would be, to create a cylinder and intersect it with the surface, get the intersection segments, and draw them. If you already have a math library which you can leverage, and if you don't have to do intersections every frame, then this might be a good idea. You will get accurately what you want. The other option, as you already suggested would be to use a projection. I am not sure though that, you will be able to see clearly the shadow of a circle on a surface. If however, you have parametric texture coordinates for your surface, you can create a texture with the circle imprinted on it, and apply this texture to the surface.
