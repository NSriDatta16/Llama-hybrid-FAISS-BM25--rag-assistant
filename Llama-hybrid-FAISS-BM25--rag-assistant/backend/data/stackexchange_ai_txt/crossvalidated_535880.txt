The simple system you are describing is called Multi-armed Bandit, where exploration (trying out new arms / items) is balanced with exploitation ("pulling" the most successful arm / item). It has no builtin mechanism to prevent showing the same item over and over, so you would have to add that based on what the practical requirements of your project. The wikipedia page on the book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto will get you started.
