How can I make use of the labels subdivision in a Deep Learning Image classification?

I want to solve an image classification problem. I want to recognize cats and dogs . However my labels are more detailed than this - they contain information about the dog/cat breed . In other words I want to classify images into A and B, but for each photo I know labels such as A.1, A.2, B.1, B.2. If I simply cast the labels into A and B I lose some of the expertise I have. I can try to classify into detailed labels first and then cast the results. However I don't want my neural network to focus on distinguishing between particular sublabels. Are there any rules of a thumb on it? Any name for such a problem I don't know?
