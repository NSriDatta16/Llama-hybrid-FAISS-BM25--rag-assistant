Is possible to perform a linear regression using log-normal priors?

I am trying to do a Bayesian linear regression. Since my data cannot be negative a gave them a log-Normal distribution, but I am not sure if the priors should be positive also. If I write my model using log-Normal priors for the intercept and the slope I get quite good adjustment. Instead, if I use Normal priors I don't and the priors do not separate from the posterior distributions. But I am not sure if this is statistically correct. Here is the model: #linear regression o distribuci√≥n de poisson cat(file = "reg.bug", " #Likelihood: model { for(i in 1:9){ o[i] ~ dlnorm(mu[i],tau) mu[i]
