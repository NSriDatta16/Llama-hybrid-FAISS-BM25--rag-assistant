How can i get a paragraph from a text file in c#

I have something like this: "Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 UEsDBBQABgAIAAAAIQDfz5sukgEAAJQGAAATANwBW0NvbnRlbnRfVHlwZXNdLnhtbCCi2AEooAAC AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" That ends with a line like this: "DwAPAPADAAA7KQAAAAA=" It is a file with MIME format, i thought about putting "base64\r\n" and it will end when it finds "=", but i am missing the way to cut that selection that from the text file to put it in another one. I am trying with streamreader and streamwriter but with no luck so far.
