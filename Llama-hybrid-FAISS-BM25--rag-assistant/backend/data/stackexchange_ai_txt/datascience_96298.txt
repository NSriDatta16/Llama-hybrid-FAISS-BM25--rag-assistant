What are good subscription based cloud ML platforms?

I'm currently working on multiple projects with Deep Learning and Keras. I've been using Google Colab for the last couple of months and it's been fantastic but I feel like I need stronger GPUs (maybe multiple V100s) to train some of the models that I have. My question is, are there any subscription based (not pay-as-you go) ML platforms out there that are similar to Google Colab? I'm willing to pay money and wouldn't mind paying a good amount per month for a good service that offers me multiple V100s (for Multi-GPU models) on demand. Any recommendations?
