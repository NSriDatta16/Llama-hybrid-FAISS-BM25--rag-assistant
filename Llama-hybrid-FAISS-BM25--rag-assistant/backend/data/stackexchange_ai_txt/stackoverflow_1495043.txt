So we have a number of gems or plugins of varying degrees of complexity, none of which seem to be very actively under development (or there's something going on but it's under the radar). In any case, I'm not looking to build a data warehouse, just to implement a fact table or two in star schema style. What I was asking for was ideas on how to access such a table. I'm leaning towards dropping the idea of multiple-levels, where an aggregate across a dimension would have a NULL in the foreign key for that dimension. While it would reduce the number of rows involved in a query the benefit would be small and not free: I'd have a larger fact table and more complex code. Retrieval looks like it might then be handled with a set of named_scopes , one for each dimension, for filtering. Or a custom finder, fed with a suitably-constructed Hash, might be better. When I've built it, I'll come back with some better information...
