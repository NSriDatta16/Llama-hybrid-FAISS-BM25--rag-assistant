How can I predict the acceptance of an article by publisher?

I am working on this project where I have to predict the acceptance probability of a literary article, let's say a research paper by a publisher, which in this case would be a Journal. I would like to use a machine learning algorithm for this project which would learn from the pool of articles/research papers published by the Publisher/Journal till date. Later I want to use the current article/research paper at hand to predict the probability of acceptance of this article/research paper on the insights that the algorithm has learnt. Here are my queries:- What algorithm are there to tackle such task? How should I make these algorithms learn the word vector, grammars, topics etc? How do I convert the article into a feature set from which the algorithms can learn?
