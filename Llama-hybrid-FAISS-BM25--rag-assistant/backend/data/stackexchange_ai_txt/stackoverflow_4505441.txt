There's something odd about the code in your question. First off, that you're calling your variable "String" and that it's of type "String". Ada will balk at that right off the bat. And the warning statements you reproduce for that code fragment don't make sense. Let's say your variable is actually called "Value", i.e.: Value : String := "34543"; Value(1) is not the same as Value(Value'First + 1), because Value'First (in this declaration) is 1 . So you end up referencing Value(1 + 1). You appear to be experiencing this because of mentioning that you can't reference the 'H' in a "Hello World" string. Now the warning is valid, in that you're safer using 'First (and 'Last and 'Range) to reference array bounds. But you need to use the proper indexing if you're going to offset from the bound retrieved via 'First, typically using either 0-based or 1-based (in which case you need to offset by 1). Use whichever base is more appropriate and readable in your context.
