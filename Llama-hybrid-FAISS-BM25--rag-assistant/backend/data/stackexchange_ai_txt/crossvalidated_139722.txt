Can we boosting or stacking with different input variables for each model in machine learning?

I have a question about Boosting and stacking in machine learning. Suppose that I will train neural network, SVM and logistic regression using optimization algorithm to optimize best inputs in first phase. So now I have 3 trained models with different combination of inputs. Can I use these trained models (based on different input's variables of each created model) for boosting or stacking?
