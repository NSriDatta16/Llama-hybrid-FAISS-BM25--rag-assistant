It is the same way in which one proves that any weighted average lies between its maximum and minimum component. Consider the set $$A=(P_{A},P_{B},P_{C})$$ Without loss of generality, let ${max{A}=P_{A}}$and ${min{A}=P_{B}}$ Now, consider weights $$0\leq\omega_{i}\leq1$$ such that $$\sum_{i}\omega_{i}=1$$ . Therefore, $$0\leq P_{B}\leq\tilde{P}=\sum_{i}\omega_{i}P_{i}\leq P_{A}\leq1$$
