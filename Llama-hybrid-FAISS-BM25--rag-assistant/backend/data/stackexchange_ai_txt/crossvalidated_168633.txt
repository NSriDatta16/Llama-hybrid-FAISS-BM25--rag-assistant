The regularization in those machine learning stabilizes the regression coefficients, so at least that effect of multicollinearity tamed. But more importantly, if you're going for prediction (which machine learners often are), then the multicollinearity "problem" wasn't that big of a problem in the first place. It's a problem when you need to estimate a particular coefficient and you don't have the information. Also, my answer to " When does LASSO select correlated predictors " might be helpful to you.
