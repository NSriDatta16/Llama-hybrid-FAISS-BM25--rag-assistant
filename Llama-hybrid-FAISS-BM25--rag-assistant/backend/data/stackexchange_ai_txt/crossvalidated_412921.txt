The Bayesian credible interval does not have nominal coverage, so it will not cover the true value 95% of the time (this is logically impossible, because of the prior). However, there is something similar as a coverage calculation: if you repeatedly draw parameter values from the prior, simulate data for these values, and fit the posterior, then the mixture of all posteriors will converge to the prior. Intuitively, you could say that this checks that the Bayesian estimation is unbiased, provide that data comes from the prior. See explanation here https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06788
