I am not familiar with tensorflow, but I can tell you what I know from your question. To start off, the problem is most likely how you're training, not your model itself. There are two possible problems you may have: 1 - You are overfitting to the train data 2 - You haven't trained your model enough I suggest that you either use a pretrained model and finetune it to achieve better results or train your existing model on more data before going back to cats and dogs. Furthermore, it helps to augment your data so your network has more images to train on. A few more things that help would be using dropout, batchnorm, and regularization (more helpful if you are overfitting). If none of these things work, then you may have a problematic model and may need to change it. I really hope this helps you in the future. (If you're a beginner to ML, I recommend you start of with Fast.AI's MOOC on machine learning and learn with the libraries they use, keras and theano. Although, they may seem much simpler, they are definitely good enough to achieve incredible results on a number of things.)
