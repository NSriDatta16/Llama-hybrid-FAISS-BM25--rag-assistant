What happens if there is not a left or right branch for a given test pattern attribute value? This can only be the case if the instance arrives in a leaf node of the tree, in which case no further traversal of it is necessary and we classify the instance based on the class-conditional probability of the instance resulting from the class proportions in this node. If the current node is not a leaf, the split operator is true for the given attribute value either on the right or the left, as for this purpose only $\geq$ (greater-or-equal) and $\leq$ (less-or-queal) are used. Consider the example below, taken from page 306 of (1): a two-dimensional data set is iteratively split by thresholds as shown in the top right plot, starting at $X_1$ where the first threshold $t_1$ is defined. In the plot on the bottom left we see the corresponding tree structure, where the first split is representing the top node $X_1 \leq t_1$ . Any given $x_1 \in X_1$ is either less-or-equal than $t_1$ , in which case it continues on the left, or greater than $t_1$ , in which case it continues on the right. There is no middle ground here.
