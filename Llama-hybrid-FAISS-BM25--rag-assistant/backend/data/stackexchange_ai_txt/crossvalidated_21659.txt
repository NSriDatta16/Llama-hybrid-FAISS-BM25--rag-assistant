Train a SVM-based classifier while taking into account the weight information

Currently I have a data set which are known to belong to two classes, and would like to build a classifier using SVM. However, there exist different confidence levels for this data set. For example, for some data points, we are very certain that they belong to class 1; while for some data points, we think they should belong to class 1 but not so certain. We can quantify this kind of confidence information as weight. But how can we cast these weight information into the training process? Does LibSVM support this type of training?
