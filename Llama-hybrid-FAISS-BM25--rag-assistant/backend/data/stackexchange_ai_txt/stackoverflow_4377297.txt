Can I display XML from a variable in through setContentView?

I'm trying to transform an XML file to Android layout XML through XSLT. So far I got this working, it's returning valid XML. I want this output to be displayed via setContentView (or if this isn't possible, I would like to add Views to a ViewFlipper. So far I haven't been succesfull and I also cannot find any information on this topic. This is my code: Source xmlSource = new StreamSource(projectFile); //a XML file on the SD card Source xsltSource = new StreamSource(getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.session)); TransformerFactory transFact = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer trans = transFact.newTransformer(xsltSource); OutputStream output = new StringOutputStream(); StreamResult result = new StreamResult(output); trans.transform(xmlSource, result); output.toString() returns the transformed XML in a String format, so far everything works! But how can I use this XML in my layout? I've tried the following approaches: setContentView(output); and: projectFlipper = (ViewFlipper)findViewById(R.id.projectFlipper); projectFlipper.addView(output); I've tried to cast the variable, but I've been stuck for quite a while now. What am I overlooking? Or is there no possible way to do this? Thanks in advance!
