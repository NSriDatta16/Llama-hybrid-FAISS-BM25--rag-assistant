Searching in subordinate table in an SQL GROUP BY

A few weeks ago I asked a question about eliminating duplicate records in a SQL INNER JOIN. The code I ended up using is similar to the following answer: SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY " + orderField + @") AS RowNum, mt.ID AS mt_ID, mt.title AS mt_title, [...] MAX(st.title) AS st_title, -- Other aggregates (MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, ...) for all other columns -- from sttable, whatever is appropriate. [...] FROM mttable AS mt INNER JOIN sttable AS st on mt.ID =st.ID WHERE st.field <> 0 AND mt.title = @title GROUP BY mt.ID, mt.title -- Group by everything else from mttable. This works well enough at eliminating duplicates, but the problem I have now is that I want to perform queries on sttable (the table that is not grouped), and the GROUP BY eliminates this data. For example, I want to be able to run the query WHERE st.title = '...' Is there any way I can achieve this? Thanks.
