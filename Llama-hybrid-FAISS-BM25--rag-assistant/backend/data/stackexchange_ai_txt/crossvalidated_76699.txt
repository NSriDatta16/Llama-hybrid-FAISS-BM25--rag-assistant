Test the convergence of a neural network

I'm using Weka multilayer-perceptron classifier to do classifications. I want to know after exactly how many epochs the neural network converges(weights don't update any more). I'm using its java API, but I cannot figure out a way to get the weight variables and test whether they're still changing or not in a loop. Can anybody help? Thanks.
