iPhone Caller ID Retrieval - TOOLCHAIN

I was wondering if there was any way to get the Caller ID of an incoming call on the iPhone, I am currently playing with SBTelephony.h (SpringBoard header) and the CoreTelephony.framework and I am not really seeing how to do this. I am planning on using this for a dylib using WinChain/ToolChain etc. Thank you!
