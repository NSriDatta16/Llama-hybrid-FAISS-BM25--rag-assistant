When you set nfolds>1 , H2O will perform k-fold cross-validation for the specific purpose of model evaluation, not model selection. It will train k models for cross-validation and then a final model on the full training set. The value of h2o.mse(model, xval=TRUE) is the average MSE over the k models trained in the cross-validation process. The value of h2o.mse(model, train=TRUE) will provide the (full) training set MSE and if you passed a separate validation_frame , then h2o.mse(model, valid=TRUE) will provide the validation MSE. If you want actually perform model selection (by choosing the best model based on cross-validation error), then take a look at h2o.grid() .
