Check this list: http://www.botsvsbrowsers.com/category/1/index.html It contains a total number of 4768 bot user agents. The other way around to accomplishing bot detection is to use the reverse approach in a white-list way, that is, check if the user agent is not a bot, then anything else is a bot. :-) To compile a comprehensive list of non bot user agents you can use the lists at http://www.user-agents.org/ and http://www.botsvsbrowsers.com/ .
