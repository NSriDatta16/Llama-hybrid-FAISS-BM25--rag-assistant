Reverse twenty questions

So given a typology, we can spontaneously generate a series of dichotomies that identifies types. That's what the game twenty questions does. It creates twenty dichotomies based on a neural net it has stored and the player's answers tell it which object to identify. But what about reverse twenty questions? Given K (where K is very large) n-tuples of "yes or no" questions regarding some kind of objects, is it possible to have a neural network analyze the frequency distribution of these n-tuples to come up with a non-arbitrary categorization schema? Let me give an example. Suppose I have K points on a map of the Earth. K is very large. For each point, there's an n-tuple of yes or no questions like "can you farm here," "are there four seasons," etc.... From these K n-tuples and looking at their distribution, can an algorithm recreate the Köppen–Geiger climate classification?
