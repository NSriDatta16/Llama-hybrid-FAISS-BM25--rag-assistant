Local variables are allocated to "stack", which is a storage space used to several purposes and limited to a certain size. Usually you can declare variables up to several kilobytes, but when you want to use more memory, usually suggested to use "heap", which can be allocated by new operator or std::vector. std::vector is an alternate for traditional arrays, and its data is safely stored in heap.
