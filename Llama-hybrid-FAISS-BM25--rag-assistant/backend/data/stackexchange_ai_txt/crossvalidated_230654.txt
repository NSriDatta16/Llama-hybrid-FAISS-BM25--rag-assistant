Your question is somewhat similar to this Why doesn't Random Forest handle missing values in predictors? You can modify the algorithm to take missing values into consideration as used in CART C4.5 implementation but it is adds computational cost because of modification that you make. Adding this computational cost may not outweigh the improvement & so imputation is generally preferred.
