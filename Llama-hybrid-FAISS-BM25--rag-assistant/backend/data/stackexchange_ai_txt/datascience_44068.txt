What NN architecture to predict fantasy character names based on description?

I would like to build a neural network to predict a fantasy character name given a description. Like 'Scar-faced long haired elf warrior' -> 'Glorfindel' I have a dataset of about 12,000 fantasy names and description from various fantasy works. I want to be able to map the description to names. Names are not vocabulary words and I want to NN to be able to generate new names for new description. I wanted to use something like Elmo to embed the description and the name which would then easily teach the NN to map one to another, but the problem I faced is how do I go back from an embedding vector to characters representing a word.
