If the two time series were recorded at the same moments of time (more or less) then vector autoregressions (VAR) is one way of combining them. They allow you to model the two time series as a 2-dimensional process $(X_t, Y_t)$ and check if values $(X_{t-1}, Y_{t-1})$ are predictive of $X_t$ or $Y_t$ . Many tests have been developed for detecting structural changes and/or trends in VAR.
