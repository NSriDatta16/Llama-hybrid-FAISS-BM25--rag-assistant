How to teach algorithm to mimic paths in a certain enviroment

I have a set of scenarios which represent the movement of a car in a certain environment containing some obstacles. So for each scenario I have the position of the car (x,y,t) and a description of the environment (a grid where holes to represent the presence of obstacles). Therefore for each element of the training set I have: label : List of car positions for each time instant (basically a trajectory) features : List of grids describing the environment around the car for each time instant (changing environment) My goal is to use some machine learning tool to teach it how the car should behave given a new sequence of environments (list of grids). What machine learning tool should i use? Can you provide some example similar to what I am trying to do in order to have some inspiration?
