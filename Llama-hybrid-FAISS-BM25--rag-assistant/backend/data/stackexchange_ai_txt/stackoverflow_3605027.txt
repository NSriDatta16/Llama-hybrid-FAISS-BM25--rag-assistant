There is c++ code available on this website: http://www.gpsy.com/gpsinfo/geotoutm/ Go down the page a bit to the "Source Code" heading, and look for these files at the bottom: Chuck Gantz Enclosures: LatLong-UTMconversion.cpp (view online as text file) LatLong-UTMconversion.h (view online as text file) UTMConversions.cpp (view online as text file) SwissGrid.cpp (view online as text file) constants.h (view online as text file) e.g. the first file links to: www.gpsy.com/gpsinfo/geotoutm/gantz/LatLong-UTMconversion.cpp etc There are functions here for going both ways: UTM to Lat Long, and vice versa. If you look elsewhere, there are python versions of this code. e.g. at code.google.com/p/pys60gps/source/browse/trunk/lib/LatLongUTMconversion.py?r=246 There are also c# versions of some of it: at mediakey.dk/~cc/convert-northing-and-easting-utm-to-longitude-and-latitude/ Good luck.
