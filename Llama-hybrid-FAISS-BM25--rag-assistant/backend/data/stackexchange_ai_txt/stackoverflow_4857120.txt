.SelectMany() and getting data from more than one related table

This query returns employee Id, name, company id, company name, and company city. I'm missing employee email address (emailAddress stored in the EmployeeEmailAddress table) and employee phone numbers (phoneNumber stored in the EmployeePhoneNumbers table). I needed to add the .SelectMany() to get the parent company relationship and access the company id, name, and city. Now, however, I can't access any properties not found in the PersonOrgMap table. I can't navigate to any other tables. Removing the .SelectMany() allows me to navigate to other tables but I lose access to the parent company information. var employees = Contacts.Where(c => c.ContactAttributes .Any (ca => ca.AttributeID == 1153)) .SelectMany (x => x.ChildPersonOrgMaps) .Select (c => new { employeeId = c.Child.ContactID, c.Child.FirstName, c.Child.LastName, companyId = c.ParentContactID, c.Parent.OrganizationName, c.Parent.City } ) .OrderBy (c =>c.LastName ).ThenBy(x => x.FirstName) .Dump();
