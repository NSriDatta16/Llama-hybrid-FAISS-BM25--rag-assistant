Number of coefficients in SVM solutions

We know that the SVM optimization problem with n data points has a solution in the form of $$f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i k(x_i,x)+b$$ which has n+1 coefficients. But as I understands it we don't neccesarily need all n+1 of them. So what is the minimum amount of them that is required for the solution?
