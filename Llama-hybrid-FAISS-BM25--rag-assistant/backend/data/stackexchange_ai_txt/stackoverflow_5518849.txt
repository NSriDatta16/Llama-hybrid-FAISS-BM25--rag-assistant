Yes it is correct. No, better to give mongodb as much disk space as possible( if mongodb can allocate more space than less disk fragmentation you will have, in additional allocating space is expensive operation). But if you wish you can run db.repairDatabase() from mongodb shell to shrink database size. Yes you can run repairDatabase on live mongodb instance ( better to run it in none peak hours)
