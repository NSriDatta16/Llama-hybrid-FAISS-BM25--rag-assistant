This reply begins by addressing the remarks in "Test 3" concerning the meaning of comparing correlation coefficients, then it applies the results to the question itself. We need a simple example that is easy to understand and interpret. To introduce it, the following graphics document the heights (in centimeters) and weights (in kilograms) at matriculation of all 600 students currently attending a former all-women's college which recently became coeducational. A minority (20%) of students are male. Values for males are shown in blue and values for females in pink. First, the frequency histogram of heights: Now the frequencies of weights: You can see these are realistic values (although a bit on the small side--perhaps some precociously young students have been admitted; there is no football team). How about their correlation? We use a scatterplot: This is a beautiful example of the classic football-shaped point cloud; there are no problems with nonlinearity, heteroscedasticity, outliers, or limited data (there are 125 males and 475 females). If anything is suitable for correlation analysis, this is it. So let's do it: Correlation coefficients Males: 0.51 Females: 0.78 Tests will find these to be strongly significantly different from each other (as well as different from 0). What do you suppose it means? In this case, absolutely nothing. It's time to reveal where these data really came from. An iid sample of 600 (height, weight) values from a bivariate normal distribution with correlation coefficient 0.8 was generated by computer. Each of those 600 cases was randomly assigned to be either "male" or "female." The probability of assignment increased with height, resulting in the 125 "males" having greater heights on average and, due to the correlation with weights, they also have greater weights than average. In effect we are carving the bivariate cloud into two overlapping regions. One of them is the upper right tip (the males), emphasized in this version of the preceding plot: It should be visually obvious that the tip of such a cloud will tend to be diffuse: its correlation coefficient is less than that of the cloud itself. (It's not hard to generate examples where the cloud has high absolute correlation but its tips have almost zero correlation.) The reason stems from the limited range of the subpopulation (males) compared to the overall range of the population (in terms of either height or weight). That explains the difference in correlation coefficients. It's purely a mathematical phenomenon related to the fact that males and females have different average heights (and weights), that's all. It does not imply there is any gender-related difference between the height-weight relationships: obviously, in this case, there is no such difference, because no difference was used to create the data. For this reason, merely testing correlation coefficients for differences among subpopulations in a sample is practically useless . Instead, look to exploratory graphics (like these here) to get a sense of what's going on and use regression modeling to quantify relationships. Now we have an answer to the main question (as well as to the four dozen or so questions that preceded it): making the corrections is pointless. Analyze the data in a different way.
