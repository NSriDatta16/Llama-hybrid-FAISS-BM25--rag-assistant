As already discussed by unicoder, there are several problems with your data. First of all, you have only average number of days with particular condition. Second, you don't have any data about co-occurrences of the conditions. Obviously, on a given day the temperature cannot be both very high, and very cold, so if one of the conditions occurs, the other one would as well. Same applies to other conditions, but it is less obvious (for example snow is very unlikely on hot weather, but cold weather does not guarantee it, etc). Nonetheless, remembering about the limitations, you can still get a rough approximation of the probability. If you are interested of a "bad weather day for [a] month" and you have data about average number of days with a particular condition, then you can use the following estimator $$\Pr(\text{day with the condition}) = \frac{\text{number of days with the condition}}{\text{total number of days}}$$ So if there were $4.4$ rainy days on January, then the probability of rainy day in January would be about $4.4 / 31 = 0.14$ , etc. Next, as mentioned above a day cannot be both cold and hot, so it makes more sense to count days with "extreme" temperature (either hot, or cold). Finally, if you assume that conditions $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ are independent (the fact that one of them occurred, does not make any other of them more or less likely), then you can calculate the probability of any of the conditions occurring. $$\begin{align} \Pr(A \,\text{or}\, B \,\text{or}\, C) &= \overbrace{1 - \overbrace{\Pr(\neg A \,\text{and}\, \neg B \,\text{and}\, \neg C)}^\text{neither of them happening}}^\text{opposite of this}\\ &= 1 - \underbrace{(1-\Pr(A))\times(1-\Pr(B))\times(1-\Pr(C))}_\text{assuming independence} \end{align}$$ What leads to the results plotted below. In the R code this translates to: rainDays As stated above, you should not treat those values as "correct" probabilities, since they follow from ill-defined assumptions (e.g. show can appear on day with hot weather). Treat them as rough approximation. To get more precise estimates, you would need to know the joint probabilities , so the joint counts (e.g. average count of days with "cold weather, show, but without rain"). Also notice, that if you want to use this as a criteria for making decision about the trip, then this is not the best one. First of all, probability "a day" of bad weather for a month does not seem very relevant, since if you had $30$ days with great weather and single rainy day, then you would probably remember this as a great holiday. Second, by doing above calculation you would weight equally all the conditions. Are they really equal? If you have adequate clothes, then snow in winter can be less problematic, then rainy weather. Is hot summer really worse, then some snow in winter, or few days of rain in autumn?
