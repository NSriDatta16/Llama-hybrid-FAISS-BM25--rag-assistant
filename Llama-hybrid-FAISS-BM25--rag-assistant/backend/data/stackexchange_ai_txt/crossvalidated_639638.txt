Odds ratio direction changes in multinomial logistic regression

I am doing a multinomial logistic regression in R for an outcome variable with four categories, and 9 categorical independent variables. My dataset contains 1408 observations. When I run the model with all variables, the GVIF (1/2*df) values are good. However, when I compare the odds ratios of the multivariable model with univariable models for each predictor, the direction of the odds ratio changes for the variable gender, and for the intercept of one group. When I leave the variable gender out of the model this still happens to the intercept of that group. I am not sure how to interpret is. I also tested interactions between gender and the other predictor variables, and those are non-significant. I know that changes in odds ratios/regression signs can be a case of multicollinearity, but can there be other explanations as this does not seem to be the case here?
