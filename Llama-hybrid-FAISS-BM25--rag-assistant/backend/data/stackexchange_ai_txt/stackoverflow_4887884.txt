Calculate variance with VB.NET lambda expression

I am trying to convert the following code for the variance calculation public static double Variance(this IEnumerable source) { double avg = source.Average(); double d = source.Aggregate(0.0, (total, next) => total += Math.Pow(next - avg, 2)); return d / (source.Count() - 1); } described on CodeProject into corresponded VB.NET lambda expression syntax, but I am stuck in the conversion of Aggregate function. How can I implement that code in VB.NET?
