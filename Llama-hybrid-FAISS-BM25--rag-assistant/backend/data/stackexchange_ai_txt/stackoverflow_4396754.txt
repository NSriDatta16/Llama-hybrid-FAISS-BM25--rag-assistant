Can different versions of DLL be loaded in same application?

My application uses one version of library (a.dll), I am using another DLL(b.dll) which in-turn uses older version of the same library (a.dll) that i use. I am building the application by embedding a manifest file. The DLL i use is also using a embedded manifest file. I am having both the versions of the library in my WinSXS folder. My application is not able to load the appropriate versions of DLLs. Will having a separate manifest file (not embedding into DLL) help resolving the problem? What is the work around?
