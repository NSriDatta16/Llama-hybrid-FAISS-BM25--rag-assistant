I tried a Sankey-style chart with simulated data. It's really a line chart with a translucent line for each of 1000 employees, applying some incremental offsets to reduce overlap. There is some appeal to seeing all the data, but I don't think it will be useful at answering your questions. It could, though, answer questions like, how did those Level 9 employees get there? And you might be able to recognize patterns in different populations. To answer your more analytical questions, I would go with simple charts targeted toward each question (or related set of questions). Here's a chart showing the average tenure at each level, with the shaded region showing some bounds of interest. A nice feature of this chart (not shown) is that you can reasonably overlay a small number of these for comparing different groups. For instance, you could have a line for each employee rating group. Script The above mock-ups were made in JMP using its scripting language, JSL. Included in case it's a useful template even if you don't have JMP. Here is the script to create the simulated data. The initial table has one row per employee and one column for each time period. ne = 1000; nt = 15; nl = 9; dt1 = new table("emp", New Column("ID", "Nominal", Formula(Row())), New Column("probs", "Expression", Formula(J(nl-1, 1, Random Uniform(0.05, 0.4))|/0)), New Column("t0", Formula(Random Category(.5, 1, .3, 2, .1, 3, .1, 4, 0.05, 5, 0.025, 6))), Add Rows(ne) ); for (i = 1, i Next, convert the table to tall form, stacking all the time periods into one column. dt2 = dt1 The formula columns add an offset to the level column. Here's the graph itself. Graph Builder( Size( 692, 428 ), Show Control Panel( 0 ), Show Legend( 0 ), Variables( X( :levelj ), Y( :Time ), Overlay( :ID ) ), Elements( Line( X, Y, Legend( 9 ), Row order( 1 ) ) ) ); I removed the color and transparency customizations for brevity.
