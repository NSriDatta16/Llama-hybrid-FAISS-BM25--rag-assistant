How to get an "averaged" score?

Assume a game wherein a character's "power" is made up of several factors, like speed, weight, body build, etc. And let's say that each of these factors were scored 0, 1, 2 wherein 0 means average, 1 means slightly above average, and 2 means above average. If there were, say, 5 factors that affected power, it means the character could score a maximum of 10 points. If the scores of the individual factors were added, that could be used as the character's "power rating" (e.g. 7/10). What if sometimes the score can be 0, -1, and -2 for a particular factor? Would the same formula apply to compute the character's power? The maximum score would no longer be 10 points (assuming some combination of factors that have 0 and positive values AND 0 and negative values). I'm just looking for some way to fairly compute such a score.
