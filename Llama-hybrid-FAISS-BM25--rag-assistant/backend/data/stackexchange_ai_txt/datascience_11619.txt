RNN vs CNN at a high level

I've been thinking about the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and their varieties and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and their varieties. Would these two points be fair to say: Use CNNs to break a component (such as an image) into subcomponents (such as an object in an image, such as the outline of the object in the image, etc.) Use RNNs to create combinations of subcomponents (image captioning, text generation, language translation, etc.) I would appreciate if anyone wants to point out any inaccuracies in these statements. My goal here is to get a more clearer foundation on the uses of CNNs and RNNs.
