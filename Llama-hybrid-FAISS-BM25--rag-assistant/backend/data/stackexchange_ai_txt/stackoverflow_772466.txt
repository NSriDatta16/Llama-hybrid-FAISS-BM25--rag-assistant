I have worked with OpenSceneGraph and in my opinion if you are not very good at organizing your graph you could end up with poor performance given the specifics of your models (high detail, high object count, scattered scenes). You will need to be able to partition your scene spatialy (like oct-trees, kd-trees, etc). If cost is not an issue you could go for vendors that also provide consulting services and sell engines that don't require quite the same 3D graphics expertise as the OSG for instance. Another issue to think of is how do you import your models into the engine. If you work with documented file formats you could do it yourself, otherwise you'll need to rely on external libraries for reading and/or importing the model into your engine of choice. If your models are extremely large you'll need something that is capable of paging as your model won't fit into the available memory (relying on the OS for paging in this case is not the best idea IMO). Here you can find a list of 3D engines, some of them commercial: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_graphics_APIs
