Building of your Domain Objects?

I'm in the process of trying to learn Domain Driven design so i'm sure this will be the first of many questions (i can already think of at least a couple more but i don't want to fragment my questions). I'm using Dino Esposito's "Architecting Microsoft .NET Solutions for the Enterprise" which, in some cases, is very abstract. First of all, i always assumed your business objects would have some type of connectivity (passed in through the constructor) whether it be a repository or DBConnection or whatever. Looks like i'm wrong. Do you just construct your domain object by a combination passing in ALL the data and maybe some add/remove functions for the underlying collections (Order-->OrderDetails)? So in your DataMapper you would construct the buisness objects from the tuples in your DB and then return them to an application layer through a repository where you would use them? Then both your application layer & DL would need a reference to your Business objects. This would of course force you to build in your own lazy loading mechanism if your not using an ORM or maybe even if your using an ORM because you would be disconnected at this point. You wouldn't want to load ALL the underlying data in all circumstances of course.
