Using jQuery plugins in Rails 3

Having finished Hartl's great Rails Tutorial I'm now working my way through the very good jQuery - Novice to Ninja by Castledine and Sharkie. While I've able to include jquery.js and jquery-ui.js in my rails projects, I'm getting stuck when it comes to adding other jQuery plugins. I've figured out that when the plugins are hosted on github, I can import them into my project using the command line and: [my rails app]$ rails install [github URL] The plugin gets successfully imported into the /vendor/plugin/ directory where javascript_include_tag can't find them. This situation prompts 3 questions: Is there a way to import jQuery plugins into my Rails app that puts them into the public/javascripts/ directory where they belong? If the answer to 1 is "no," is there a way to have javascript_include_tag search for scripts in vendor/plugins/? This seems like bad practice since jQuery scripts are hidden away from the public/javascript/ directory where people would normally look for them. If 1 and 2 are both "no's," is there a more elegant way to move the files from vendor/plugins/ than $mv or copying and pasting? Note: Through web searching I've come across 37signals' sprokets gem at http://getsprockets.org/ which seems like it might be useful at some point but beyond my current needs and understanding. Grateful for any thoughts!
