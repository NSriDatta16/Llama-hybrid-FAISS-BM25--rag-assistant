With Subsonic you will use inline, views and stored procedures. Subsonic makes data access easier, but you can't do everthing in a subsonic query. Though the latest version, 2.1 is getting better. For basic CRUD operations, inline SQL will be straight forward. For more complex data needs, a view will need to be made and then you will do a Subsonic query on the view. Stored procs are good for harder data computations and data retrieval. Set based retrieval is usually always faster then procedural processing. Current Subsonic application uses all three options with great results.
