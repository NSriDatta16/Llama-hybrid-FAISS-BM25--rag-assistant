Like you mentioned, This is just the average value of $\ln(1+e^x)$ , when x is normally distributed with mean μ and variance ν. So all you have to do is: 1) Draw N (large number) of $X_i \sim N(\mu, \nu)$ 2) Your estimate $\hat\theta$ is then: $ \hat\theta = 1/N * \sqrt{2\pi\nu }\sum^N_{i =1}\ln(1+e^{X_i}) $
