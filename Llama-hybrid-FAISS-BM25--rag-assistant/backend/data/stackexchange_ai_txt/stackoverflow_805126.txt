It seems any python web framework will suit your needs. I work with a similar system on a daily basis and I can tell you, your solution with threads and SQLite for queue storage is about as simple as you're going to get. Assuming order doesn't matter in your queue, then threads should be acceptable. It's important to make sure you don't create race conditions with your queues or, for example, have two of the same job type running simultaneously. If this is the case, I'd suggest a single threaded application to do the items in the queue one by one.
