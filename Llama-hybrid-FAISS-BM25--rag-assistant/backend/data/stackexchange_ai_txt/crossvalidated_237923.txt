Large odds ratio in binary logistic regression - huge scale difference of continous variables

I'd like to ask for some help with a binary logistic regression. In SPSS I am building a binary logistic regression with 4 independent continuous variables (Sample size - 85) . However, with one of the variables (Bicaudatus_index) I get a huge odds ratio: Maybe the scale of this variable is very different than other variables: As this variable is a ratio of two measurements I try to multiply the variable 100 times and get a new variable. The odds ratio of the new variable in the same regression seems to be within normal range. However I don't know if it is appropriate to do that. If I multiply the variable not by 100 , but e.g. 150 times, I get odds ratios that are different from the ones that I get with 100 .
