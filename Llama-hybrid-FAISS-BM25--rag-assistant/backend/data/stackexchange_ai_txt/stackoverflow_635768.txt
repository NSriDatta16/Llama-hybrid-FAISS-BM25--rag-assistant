How can I generate all permutations of an array in Perl?

What's the best (elegant, simple, efficient) way to generate all n! permutations of an array in perl? For example, if I have an array @arr = (0, 1, 2) , I want to output all permutations: 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 1 2 1 0 It should probably be a function that returns an iterator (lazy/delayed evaluation because n! can become so impossibly large), so it can be called like this: my @arr = (0, 1, 2); my $iter = getPermIter(@arr); while (my @perm = $iter->next() ){ print "@perm\n"; }
