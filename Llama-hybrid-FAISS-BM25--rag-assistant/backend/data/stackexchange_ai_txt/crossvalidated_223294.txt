How should new variables to be added in logistic regression model in production?

We have built a LR model (online SGD ) in Spark. There are more that 15 categorical variables only as independent variables. At run time new values come in few of the columns. We have used StreamingLinearRegressionWithSGD of Spark Mlib to build the model. How should I handle new values in the model at run time? Any guidance would be helpful. How does model handle the coming of new variables at run time on production in industry? (Irrespective for tool/framework used to build model)?
