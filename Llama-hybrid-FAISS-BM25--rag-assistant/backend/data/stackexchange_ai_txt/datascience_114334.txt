Good question - everyone talks about understanding your data, but no one actually explains how. Having the ethos of: "How is the real world encoded in my data"? will serve you well here. If I have a new dataset that I need to deeply understand, I normally take the following approach (have never formalised before): Split the analysis into 3 sections: Target analysis Univariate feature analysis Multivariate feature analysis For each section: Domain: What data source that feature has come from (e.g. what sql tables)? What does it mean in the real world? Basic stats: What type/scale of data is it? (ordinal, continuous, categorical, cyclical) How is your information stored? (object, categorical, datetime, float, int) Min/Max/skew/kurtosis/stationary? Distribution: Plot the distribution(s). Use the simplist plot possible to understand the unique characteristics it has. How does it relate to the target? How does it change over time? There is a much bigger list of what to look for, but following these steps should help. Put your modelling hat on when doing this, if you see something interesting that could be leveraged by your model, note it down . For example, if you see a interesting relationship between two features, think about what it means to combine the two, this will help feature engineering down the line.
