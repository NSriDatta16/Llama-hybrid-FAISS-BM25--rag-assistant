pitfalls with mixing storage engines in mysql with django?

I'm running a django system over mysql in amazon's cloud, and the database default is innodb. But now I want to put a fulltext index on a couple of tables for searching, which evidently requires myisam. The obvious solution is to just tell mysql to ALTER TABLE to myisam, but are there going to be any issues with that? One that comes to mind is that I'll have to remember to do that any time I build a new version of the database, which should theoretically be rare, but there doesn't seem to be a way to tell django to please set the storage engine at the table level. I guess I could write a migration (we use south). Any other things I might be missing? What could possibly go wrong?
