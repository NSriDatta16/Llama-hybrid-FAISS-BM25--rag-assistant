Does it make sense to do train test split when trainning GANS?

For normal supervised learning the dataset is split in train and test (let's keep it simple). Generative Adversarial Networks are unsupervised learning but there is a supervised loss function in the discriminator. Does it make sense to split the data into train and test when training GANs? My first opinion will be no, but I am not 100% sure. Is there any reason why having a test set will help the Generator?
