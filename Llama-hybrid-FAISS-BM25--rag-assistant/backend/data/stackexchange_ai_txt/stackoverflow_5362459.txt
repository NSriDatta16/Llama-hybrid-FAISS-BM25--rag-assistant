Customize Facelets error page

I have a Facelets(JSF 1.2 (myfaces)) web app and I want to customize my error page - which would seem to be a natural thing to do when an application matures. I got really confused in the process. I found the following: I haven't found a way to customize Facelets' error page. I haven't found where the template is. I have found solutions with overriding the ViewHandler that would do sendRedirect(). I think this should be accomplishable without writing code, especially the ViewHandler. I have found a way to switch off Facelets' error handling and using myFaces' one: code: facelets.DEVELOPMENT false org.apache.myfaces.ERROR_HANDLING true org.apache.myfaces.ERROR_TEMPLATE_RESOURCE /pages/public/errorPage.jsf Unfortunately I cannot seem to make myFaces find a JSF page. I need to use a jsf page because I want to use the site's layout which is fragmented over a few templates. Source: http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/Handling_Server_Errors I tried a tomahawk solution: web.xml: org.apache.myfaces.ERROR_HANDLING true org.apache.myfaces.ERROR_HANDLER org.apache.myfaces.tomahawk.util.ErrorRedirectJSFPageHandler faces-config.xml: * java.lang.Throwable /pages/public/errorPage.xhtml Source: http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/Handling_Server_Errors I found that I can use the container's error-handling via in web.xml . I successfully forwarded to a jsf error page. Here the problem is that I cannot display the Exception - I don't know how. Update : I found out how - with a ManagedBean: public class ErrorDisplayBean { public String getStackTrace() { FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance(); Map requestMap = context.getExternalContext().getRequestMap(); Throwable ex = (Throwable) requestMap.get("javax.servlet.error.exception"); ... } } see http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/Handling_Server_Errors for the rest of the code. What I want to accomplish : I want to use Facelets' error-handling mechanism without writing code and be able to display the Exception on a jsf page. If that is not possible, I'd like to use myFaces' error-handling again with displayin the Exception. I think one of them should be possible.
