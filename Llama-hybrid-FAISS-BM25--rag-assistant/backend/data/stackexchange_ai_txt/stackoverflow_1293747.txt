Hoptoad uses the Rails rescue_action_in_public hook method to intercept exceptions and log them. This method is only executed when the request is dispatched by a Rails controller. For this reason, Hoptoad is completely unaware of any exception generated, for example, by rake tasks or the rails script/runner. If you want to have Hoptoad tracking your exception, you should manually integrate it. It should be quite straightforward. The following code fragment demonstrates how Hoptoad is invoked def rescue_action_in_public_with_hoptoad exception notify_hoptoad(exception) unless ignore?(exception) || ignore_user_agent? rescue_action_in_public_without_hoptoad(exception) end Just include Hoptoad library in your environment and call notify_hoptoad(exception) should work. Make sure your environment provides the same API of a Rails controller or Hoptoad might complain.
