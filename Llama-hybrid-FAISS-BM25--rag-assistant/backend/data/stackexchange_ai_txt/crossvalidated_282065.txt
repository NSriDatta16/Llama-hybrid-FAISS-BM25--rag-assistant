As it written on the table explanation at the bottom, first column uses ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) which is a model that suits for time - series analysis. This model seems a bit complex and you can't simply interpret the coefficients as you do in your good ol' regression model, try this: ARIMA model interpretation for a lead. The second and third columns use OLS which is linear regression, there's plenty of stuff on it on the web, but shortly this model assume a linear connection, i.e: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_px_p+\epsilon$ The numbers in the column are the estimated coefficients ($\beta_i$) meaning the effect of $x_i$ on $y$ while holding all other constant. The asterisk near them indicate whether they are statistically significant (loosely speaking - it's plausible these numbers are not caused by pure chance). If you don't understand the meaning of the features (the $x_i$) like Term dummies, I advise you to open the original paper that this data was drawn from.
