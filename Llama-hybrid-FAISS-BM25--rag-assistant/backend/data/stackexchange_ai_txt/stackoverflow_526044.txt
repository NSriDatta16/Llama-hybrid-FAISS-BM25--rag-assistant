I am not sure what my dream language would look like, but I have a little improvement for C-style languages. How many times have I written something like this: Node foundNode = null; // need stupid null value here to keep track if it was not found foreach (Node testNode in nodes) { if (testNode.YesItsMe) { foundNode = testNode; break; } } if (foundNode == null) { // create new instance foundNode = new Node(blabla); } I know there are more elegant functional ways for this, but sometimes you still end up with code like this. A simple "guard" statement would help here: Node foundNode; // no need to initialize anymore foreach (Node testNode in nodes) { if (testNode.YesItsMe) { foundNode = testNode; break; } } guard { // we get here if break was never called // create new instance foundNode = new Node(blabla); }
