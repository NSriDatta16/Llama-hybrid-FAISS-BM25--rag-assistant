This depends entirely on the underlying architecture of your software. If it was written in a naive fashion, then yes, some form of brute force is just about the only way you can go (and that, of course, will just make the code that much worse-- this is why good architecture is important). If, on the other hand, the software has been reasonably well designed, then you'll have objects behind the user interface that track the UI state. These objects may implement something like INotifyPropertyChanged and you can leverage that with a mapping mechanism to update the UI for changed fields. I suspect you fall in the first situation, though, where any good answers to your problem were eliminated long before what you're trying to do now. I'm inferring this from your statement that the form "hosts a tabcontrol" and that "each of these tabs have[sic] plenty of controls..." This is a UI antipattern that I've seen time and time again from poor designers.
