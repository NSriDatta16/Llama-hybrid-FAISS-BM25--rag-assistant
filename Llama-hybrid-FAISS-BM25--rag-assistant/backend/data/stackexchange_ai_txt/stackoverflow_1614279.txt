Take the highest peak on the spectrogram that's within the range for voice (say, 400 to 10K hz). That should give you the fundamental frequency. Alternatively, you may need to integrate a histogram of frequencies. This is because sometimes you have words that start with or contain sibilants ("s" sounds) and fricatives ("f" and "th" sounds) which have fairly high frequencies and broad spectrum. You don't want to miss the start of speech because it started with something other than a vowel. Another factor is what else would you pick up besides voice. Is there a lot of background noise? What kind? If there isn't any, then just the presence of sound is enough. If, for example, there's music, then you have a whole different challenge. If you're trying to distinguish between voice and some other sounds, then I'd be tempted to try a neural network approach--it's likely to need that level of complexity.
