It's more to do with policy than the data type itself. The normal trunk tags * branches layout is really designed for code. It probably isn't the best way to organize your company documents, for example. For a lot of data, you can truncate svn history to save space, but for code you probably really don't want to do that very often. Once data's in a repository, it's blessed hard to get it out. If you've got to perform surgery to remove someone's address from a word document, you can avoid importing all the code revisions as well. etc, etc.
