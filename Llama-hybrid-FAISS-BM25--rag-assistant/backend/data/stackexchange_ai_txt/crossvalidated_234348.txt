Bayesian inference, finding unknown function of parameter

I'm completely new to Baayesian statistics and am having some questioning about the following: Given a probability distribution defined by the pdf $\pi(x|\theta) = C(\theta)x^2 e^{-\theta x^{3}}$ for $x \in [0, \inf)$ and for all $\theta > 0$, determine the function $C(\theta)$ I also know that $\pi(x|\theta) \propto x^2 e^{-\theta x^3}$ Now this is in a bayesian setting and I was considering Bayes formula $\pi(\theta|x) = \frac{\pi(\theta)\pi(x|\theta)}{\pi(x)}$ and rewriting it as $\pi(x|\theta) = \frac{\pi(x)\pi(\theta|x)}{\pi(\theta)}$ Where $\pi(\theta)$ would then be the prior, $\pi(x|\theta)$ the "likelihood" and $\pi(\theta|x)$ the posterior. So as I understand it, finding $C(\theta)$ would be similar to finding the normalizing constant in Bayes formula seeing as $C(\theta) = 1/\pi(\theta)$ and $x^2 e^{-\theta x^3} = \pi(x)\pi(\theta|x)$, but following the same procedure with finding the marginal density would mean to find the integral $\int_{0}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-\theta x^3} dx = \pi(\theta)$ But I don't know if it's even possible to find a closed form of this integral so it feels like I am on the wrong track?
