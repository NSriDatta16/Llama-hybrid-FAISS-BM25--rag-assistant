"Replicates" in bioassays are usually used as a method for reducing measurement noise, and sometimes as a way to decide on whether a run of the assay was a technical success. The variation between technical replicates is of little interest and so the technical replicates are typically averaged to give a single datum that is used in statistical analyses. The variability of interest will be the variability between mice. Use the averages of your technical replicates and you will have one measurement per mouse. Using technical replicates as individual data points is often called 'pseudo-replication' and it is a very bad thing in many circumstances. Having said that, a sample of 3 to 5 mice is far, far too small for any meaningful result from a test for normality. Many would argue that it is far too small for a meaningful result from any experiment, but I will allow that some biological effects are so large that a tiny sample like that can occasionally suffice.
