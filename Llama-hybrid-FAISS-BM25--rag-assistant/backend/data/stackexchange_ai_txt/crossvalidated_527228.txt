Your model: lmer(DV_at_level3 ~ class type + (1|school_id) + (1 | school_id:class_id)) specifies that class_id is nested within school_id , as per your description. This model makes sense to me. As for the questions about the level at which a variable varies, all the mixed effects software that I know of, such as lme4 that you are using, does not care about the level at which a variable varies. You just add them to the fixed part of the model. So you can go ahead and add whatever variables you want, but as always pay attention to the causal structure so as not to include mediators and colliders. As for references, one of my favourite books is "Multilevel Analysis" by Snijders and Bosker. Another good one is "Multilevel Analysis: Techniques and Applications" by Hox.
