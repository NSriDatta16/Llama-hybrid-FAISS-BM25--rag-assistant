The Julia project is one which I actively contribute to, including the advanced computing and XGBoost libraries. So, I can definitely vouch for it's maintenence and the quality of the community. Some really good open source data science projects where even the beginners can contribute are: Sklearn : Always developing at a rapid pace, the sklearn community is always open to new developers and contributors. H2O : H2O is another fast growing data science projects, working on scalable machine learning and Deep Learning solutions. Go : Open source data science road map and resources. Not really a technical project, but is very helpful for absolute beginners and aspiring analysts. Pylearn2 : Another fast growing Machine Learning and Deep Learning project. Vowpal Wabbit : The Vowpal Wabbit (VW) project is a fast out-of-core learning system sponsored by Microsoft Research and (previously) Yahoo! Research. Here is a Quora discussion on such projects and some more which are not mentioned in this answer. Here is a another nice discussion about open source Data Science and ML projects in Python.
