J.M. already mentioned the original Diehard battery of tests by George Marsaglia . As far as I know, this test set is no longer being maintained. Robert Brown has been working for years on DieHarder which is a GPL'ed reimplementation of the DieHard suite plus additional tests from the NIST suite plus development of new tests and you may find DieHarder useful.
