Rails is simple to learn, well organized and well documented. It's also agile and RAD (rapid application development). It's not perfect, but you could give it a try. It's another take on the web development. Java web framework are not so easy to understand and start is not so simple IMHO. If you have to build a large web application, with rails you could separate the monolith app with different apps and then use ActiveResource restfully. http://guides.rubyonrails.org
