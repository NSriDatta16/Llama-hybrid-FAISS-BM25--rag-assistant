I don't think it makes sense to say that any formal statistical model is "true" in reality; models are always idealisations, and what happens in reality is something different. Even the most iconic examples for statistical modelling like binomial for coin tossing idealise away the underlying physics, for which far more complicated models exist. Now if you compare a simpler with a more complex model such as a model with zero autocorrelation with a certain time series model that allows for autocorrelation, it makes sense to think that "zero autocorrelaton" is an idealisation, and reality would have to try extremely hard to achieve exactly zero "true" autocorrelation, so if someone said "in reality nothing really has zero autocorrelation", I'd agree with this (of course $10^{-5}$ and all kinds of extremely close to zero numbers are technically nonzero). That said, (a) in certain situations a model with zero autocorrelation can be a very good model for what happens ("good" being somewhat relative to what the model is used for, but one thing is that the data may look like typical data generated from such a model), (b) I wouldn't take any formal model involving restrictive assumptions such as independent innovations with nonzero autocorrelation as "really true" either; being "true" is just not the job of models. And then it's hard to even talk of any true single value of the autocorrelation, although often of course data can clearly rule out a zero autocorrelation model and be compatible with a model with larger (or negative) autocorrelation. If you are prepared to accept a model that implies nonzero autocorrelation for your data that has (as any model) some restrictive assumptions that are not exactly fulfilled in your situation, you can well also accept a model with zero autocorrelation in a situation in which there is nonzero autocorrelation (as implied by a more complex model) if this is sufficiently close to zero. (I'm not saying this should always be done; it depends on the purpose of the model.) By the way note that "time series data" isn't very restrictive as a definition. Any data that is collected over time can be seen as "time series data" even though in many cases a priori we may not really be interested in how they develop over time. This includes things such as coin tossing, the background noise of any process, or observations taken on individual items (such as persons) treated as independent that in fact have been taken at a certain time point, which was recorded. So pretty much anything you'd think of as independent, therefore not autocorrelated (by which I obviously mean that such a model is sensible but not that it's really precisely true, see above), can also be interpreted as "time series data" in principle, even though this may not have been intended by the question. If you say something like "99% of real time series have autocorrelation", this would depend on what kind of "time series" actually qualify for being counted, which isn't so clear or easy to define.
