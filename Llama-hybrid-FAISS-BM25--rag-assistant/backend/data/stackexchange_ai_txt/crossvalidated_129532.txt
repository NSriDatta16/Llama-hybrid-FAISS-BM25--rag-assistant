You can use a sentence splitter and split your document into sentences. I have never used the approach myself, but the tool is available with the open.nlp package in R, Python and Rapidminer. What you could also do is to train a topicmodel on corpus with clearly defined topics. Next you use the same model on your one document and you see how the topic structure turn out.
