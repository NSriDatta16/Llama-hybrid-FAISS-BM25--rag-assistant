Should the standard deviation vary along the curve?

I need to draw the error bars on a curve. in the images I have seen that this process is done, the bar lengths change from point to point. but when I do for my curve I get something like : I am doing the calcualtions by Python. and use this code what Python asks me to calculate standard deviation is a list that contain all of the values of one of the axes on a 2D curve I have : STDV_Mag=np.std(Mag) then if I use this value : line_Mag=ax.errorbar(xerr, Magerr, yerr=STDV_Mag, **lineStyle_Mag, color=color_Mag, label=filename + ShN[0]) I will have a plot with error bars all the same. Where am I going wrong ? Edit 2 : to provide some data to explain what I need : let's imagine the horizontal axis has these points : t= [10 , 20 , 30 ,40 , 50 , 60 ,70 + and I have 4 curves that their vertical axis values at the points above are : c1= [18 , 15 , 14 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 25] c2= [19.5 , 16.9 , 15.5 , 11.2 , 12.5 , 13.8 , 11] c3= [19 , 17.1 , 16.1 , 12.3 , 13.6 , 11 , 27.5] c4= [22 , 18.9 , 17.7 , 13.9 , 11.7 , 12 , 22] so to draw the graph in blue above , I should first find a curve c5 that its values are the point to point average of all of the 4 curves. then calculate the standard deviation (sd) of the whole curve which is one number. the other way is that after finding the curve c5, I calculate the sd of each group of 4 points and report them on the curve, so I will have something like curve in red. What I need to know is the conceptual difference and statistical correctness of these , and their meaning.
