Bayesian and frequentist approaches: What are some success stories for the former?

Possible Duplicate: Examples of Bayesian and frequentist approach giving different answers What are some practical examples where a Bayesian approach has an edge over frequentist statistics? Do you know of any success stories where a Bayesian model is superior to a traditional approach? By more successful I mean "better predictions" or "lead to more valuable insights" or "made explaining it easier". Examples should not discuss the philosophical nature of e.g. credible vs confidence intervals and its more "intuitive" interpretation. Perhaps Bayesian spam filtering could be a starting point, but I don't know enough about it. Similar? List of situations where a Bayesian approach is simpler, more practical, or more convenient Might be linked to this question: Examples of Bayesian and frequentist approach giving different answers
