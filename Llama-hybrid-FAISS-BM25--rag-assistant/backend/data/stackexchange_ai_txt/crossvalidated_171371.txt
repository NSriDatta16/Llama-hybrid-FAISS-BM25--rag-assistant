I am not a Matlab user, but you are approaching the problem from the wrong angle. PCA should not be used to help with overfitting - regularization is a proper tool for it. This way you are not throwing data away, and you will most likely end up with a model that is easier to explain (e.g. feature importance or weights, for your original variables, not transformed ones).
