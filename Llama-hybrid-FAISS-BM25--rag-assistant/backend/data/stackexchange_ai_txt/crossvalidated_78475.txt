Does more variables mean tighter confidence intervals?

Assume that the true (but unknown) relationship in a population between $Y$ and $X1, X2, X3, X4$ is $$Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \beta_4 X_4.$$ Further assume that I have a sample from the population that I wish to model using linear regression and I fit the following two regression models: \begin{align} Model \;1: \quad Y & =\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 \\ Model \;2: \quad Y & =\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \beta_4 X_4 \end{align} After obtaining my estimates $\hat{\beta}_0, \ldots, \hat{\beta}_4$ I then compute the predicted value of $Y$ for some covariate values $\tilde{x}_1, \ldots,\tilde{x}_4$. Additionally, I compute the confidence interval of my prediction, e.g. for model 1, $$ \tilde{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \tilde{x}_1+\hat{\beta}_2 \tilde{x}_2 $$ with confidence interval in the usual way, i.e., $$\tilde{y} \pm t_{n-3} \hat{\sigma} \sqrt{\tilde{x}^T(X^TX)^{-1}\tilde{x}}$$ where $\tilde{x}=(\tilde{x}_1, \tilde{x}_2)^T$. Now I do the same thing with model 2, which is the more correct model and compare the interval width of the confidence interval for the prediction. Do I get a tighter confidence interval for my prediction? I tried it in R for a simple simulated data set and the answer was yes. In this example I varied the value of $\tilde{x}_1$ and fixed the values of the other covariates. library(survival) set.seed(13) n My question: Is this always the case? Or more general: If the variables have an effect on my model, do I ALWAYS get a tighter confidence interval if I include more variables in my model? On the other hand, if the variables do not have an effect, do I get wider confidence intervals for the prediction? How about the standard errors of the parameter estiamtes? Is this also true when confounding is present? How about other regression models such as logistic regression or mixed models? Here I only considered confidence intervals for the prediction, but my question also applies to prediction intervals.
