debug_backtrace is one of the PHP error handling functions. The manual encourages users to define their own error handling rules, as well as modify the way the errors can be logged. This allows you to change and enhance error reporting to suit your needs. This also implies that the performance hit from using these functions is negligible. I think what you're doing is just fine.
