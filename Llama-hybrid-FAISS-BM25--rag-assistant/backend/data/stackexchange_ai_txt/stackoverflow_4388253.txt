If JTable doesn't support it natively then you are out of luck since this task will be quite difficult to manage. What you will actually need to do is to write one or two listeners: a MouseMotionListener , that is able to track dragging of the mouse a MouseListener , that is able to track all the other mouse actions Starting from this you will have to understand when the user starts to drag the mouse over a row separation line and then use the correct method: setRowHeight(int,int) (for a specific row) or setRowHeight(int) (for all rows). This won't be easy and it suggest you not to try to do it dynamic (the height is updated while the mouse is moving).
