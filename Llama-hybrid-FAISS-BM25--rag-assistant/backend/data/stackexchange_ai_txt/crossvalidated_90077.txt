The wording in the statement of the problem is problematic. If you just have ages and prices and want to assume a linear model, you can fit that model and you will almost certainly find a slope that is significant (assuming you have at least a few dozen cars over a few years). That should be the end of the use of the word "significant". Now, you appear to be asking whether you should expect a car in 2005 to be priced higher than a car from 2003. On average the answer is yes as you have already determined. However, there are other factors that affect price. A 2003 Ferarri will likely cost more than a 2005 Corolla. So now you can ask about the chance of a car in 2005 being more/less expensive than a car in 2003. This question is not answerable by the regression coefficients alone. It depends as much on the scatter or variance around the mean and it is possible that this scatter is not constant across age. If you assume the scatter is indeed constant and distribution is Normal, you can write down an equation for it which will involve error functions. Assuming other things will lead to different results.
