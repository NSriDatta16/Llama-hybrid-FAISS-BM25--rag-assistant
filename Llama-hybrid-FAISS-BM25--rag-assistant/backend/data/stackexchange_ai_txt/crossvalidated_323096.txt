Bayesian inference would, in theory, involve determining the joint probability distribution (JPD) $P(R,S,C)$ that expresses the probability of a certain combination of reaction force ($R$), sprint time ($S$) and creatine monohydrate ingestion ($C$). The JPD over all variables can later be used to infer all other possible conditional probabilities using Bayes's rule. $P(R,S,C)$, can using this same rule, be factorised as $P(R|S,C)\times P(S|C)\times P(C)$. With an eye on what you probably want to infer, you just need to is estimate the probability $P(R|S,C)$ of different reaction force's ($R$) given a certain value for repeated sprint time ($S$) and CM ingestion ($C$). The same can be done for $P(S|C)$. Estimating these probability distributions can either be done using continuous variables in which you would make certain assumptions about the functional form of your distribution and fit its parameters. Or you could bin your data in discrete intervals and count occurrences per interval. Once you estimated $P(R|S,C)$ and $P(S|C)$, the distribution of reaction force ($R$) given a certain CM ingestion ($C=c$) (which can be used to infer it's most probable value) is expressed as : $$ P(R|C=c) = \frac{P(R,C=c)}{P(C=c)}=\frac{\sum_S P(R,S,C=c)}{P(C=c)}=\sum_S P(R|S,C=c)\times P(S|C=c) $$ Or infer the complete distribution over both $R$ and $S$ given given a certain CM ingestion ($C=c$) $$ P(R,S|C=c) = \frac{P(R,S,C=c)}{P(C=c)}= P(R|S,C=c)\times P(S|C=c) $$ Using these distributions, you can also determine the standard deviation, confidence intervals, etc. Side note: You could also choose a different factorisation that might better suite your data, in the end the probabilities you infer will stay the same, these "factors" just serve as a way to make estimating your JPD practical. I did not assume any independence between $R$ and $S$, as this seems very unlikely. This would however ease the computation of $P(R|S,C)$ which would then $=P(R|C)$.
