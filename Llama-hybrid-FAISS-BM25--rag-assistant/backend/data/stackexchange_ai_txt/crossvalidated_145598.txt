I'm not quite sure how you would end up with non-integer counts (I'll just assume it's quantum or something!) A binomial distribution has no probability mass except at integer values 0, 1, ..., n, so even though the formula for Pr(X=x) can be coerced into working for non-integers (replace factorials in binomial coefficients by gamma functions) this is not correct to do. You need to establish what the domain is for this random variable and then look at appropriate distributions on that basis. One option could be a scaled beta distribution, but it's too early at this point to tell. EDIT Now you have given some more information I will have another stab at this. I am imagining you have a situation where your underlying process is $X_i \sim Bernoulli(p)$ and you want to know whether $p=0.5$, but you cannot observe $X_i$ directly, but instead $Y_i$, which is a confusion of $X_i$ according to a known process, such that $\Pr(Y_i|X_i)$ is a 2x2 table, e.g., Yi 0 1 Xi 0 0.7 0.3 1 0.1 0.9 You then estimate, for example, if $Y_i$ takes value 1 twelve times and takes value 0 eight times that $X_i$ was in expectation 1 ten times and 0 ten times. Except of course the numbers aren't always round like that. Am I roughly on the right track? If so then the approach that would spring to mind is Bayesian MCMC where you explicitly describe the process and calculate a posterior distribution. Other approaches may also be suitable.
