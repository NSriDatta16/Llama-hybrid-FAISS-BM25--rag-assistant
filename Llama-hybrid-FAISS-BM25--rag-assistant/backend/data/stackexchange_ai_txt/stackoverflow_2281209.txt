Retrieve TProc from Generic Container

Just discovered something rather funny: var Queue : TQueue ; MyProc : TProc; ... MyProc := Queue.Dequeue; I think you see what is intendend here. However, the compiler thinks I want to store the Queue.Dequeue method (type "procedure of object") in MyProc and reports an error E2010 Incompatible Types: 'TProc' und 'Procedure of object' The workaround I came up with goes like this MyProc := TProc (Pointer (Queue.Dequeue)); Is there a more elegant solution?
