Software Monkey set out to fight the whole world. He totally disagrees with the way browsers render font sizes, the major web sites and the way they set their font sizes, and tries to enter into hot arguments with every single poster of this thread. I have a simple guideline in life. When you think everybody else is wrong you might not be right. Furthermore even if you are right it's often smarter to go along with the world around you rather that fight each and all. Here is a thought. If you are a web designer and know that over 99% of visitors are not going to tinker with their default browser sizes then you most certainly want to make your site look well for that majority. That pragmatism explains the current situation. Anyway good luck in your quest.
