The null hypothesis isn't equivalent to a Bayesian uninformative prior for the simple reason that Bayesians can also use null hypotheses and perform hypothesis tests using Bayes' factors. If they were equivalent, Bayesians wouldn't use null hypotheses. However, both frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing incorporate an element of self-skepticism, in that we are required to show that there is some evidence that our alternative hypothesis is in some way a more plausible explanation for the observations than random chance. Frequentists do this by having a significance level, Bayesians do this by having a scale of interpretation for the Bayes factor, such that we wouldn't strongly promulgate a hypothesis unless the Bayes factor over the null hypothesis were sufficiently high. Now the reason why frequentist hypothesis tests are counter-intuitive is because a frequentist cannot assign a non-trivial probability to the truth of a hypothesis, which sadly is generally what we actually want. The closest they can get to this is to compute the p-value (the likelihood of the observations under H0) and then draw a subjective conclusion from this as to whether H0 or H1 are plausible. The Bayesian can assign a probability to the truth of a hypothesis, and so can work out the ratio of these probabilities to provide an indication of their relative plausibilities, or at least of how the observations change the ratio of these probabilities (which is what a Bayes factor does). In my opinion it is a bad idea to try to draw too close a parallel between frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing methods as they are fundamentally different and answer fundamentally different questions. Treating them as if they were equivalent encourages a Bayesian interpretation of the frequentist test (e.g. the p-value fallacy) which is potentially dangerous (for example climate skeptics often assume that a lack of a statistically significant trend in global mean surface temperature means that there has been no warming - which is not at all correct).
