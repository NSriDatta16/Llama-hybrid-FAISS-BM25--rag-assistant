I anticipate that the behaviour shown in the qqplot and residual plot is because of floor/ceiling effects. If weed coverage is measured as a percent then a linear model is not really the most appropriate model because it is not constrained to be within the unit interval. That doesn't stop people from using linear models for percent data (indeed there are times when it performs just as well), but in circumstances when the outcome is near the boundary the model can perform quite poorly. I would suggest using a Beta regression instead of a linear regression. This model should be able to accommodate the boundary.
