Prior Beliefs For your data generating model you need to select a likelihood that you believe the data will be generated from. This could be any distribution as long as you believe it fits. Let $M$ be a random variable that represents the movie length. Call your data generating model $\pi(m|\theta)$ . You now want to choose a prior distribution for $\theta$ , there are many ways to do this, but a simple example could be, say you believe $\theta$ is going to be $\hat{\theta}$ but you are unsure on your beliefs and you think the actual value could deviate slightly from your beliefs by an equal amount each way. You might want to fit a normal distribution to this such that your data generated model has a mean of 56 minutes with your expected value for your prior, $\mathbb{E}(\theta)$ . Let $\pi(\theta)$ represent the probability of your prior model. Posterior Beliefs Now you have observed some data, $m$ , you can update your prior beliefs for $\theta$ using: $$\pi(\theta|m) \propto \pi(m|\theta) \pi(\theta)$$ A really basic way to do this (which should only be used for discrete data) is Exact Bayesian Computation . Here is a really simple step by step guide on how to do this: Set $N =$ number of samples for $\theta$ you would like and let $i=0$ Make a single draw from the prior distribution for $\theta$ , $\theta*$ Make a single draw from your data generating model $M|\theta*$ , $m*$ If $m* = m$ , add $\theta*$ to your sample and set $i = i+1$ If $i repeat from step 1. You can now take an average of your samples for $\theta$ to find the average value. A few notes If you are unsure on your prior beliefs you can use a uninformative prior which essentially means setting the variance of your prior model higher so that your final model is more reliant on the data rather than your beliefs. There are many different sampling methods that can be used, above I described exact bayesian computation. A couple to look at are MCMC and ABC . When estimating your final value for $\theta$ many different methods can be used, above I used the mean but you can use the mode or median or any you believe are right. Bayesian is about your beliefs so you can experiment a little bit there does not have to be a wrong answer. Side note : I am not an expert in Bayesian so I apologise if this does not help too much, I am currently doing a Bayesian module at University and so I am still learning new things about this everyday but I hope I have been able to help you or give you some better understanding.
