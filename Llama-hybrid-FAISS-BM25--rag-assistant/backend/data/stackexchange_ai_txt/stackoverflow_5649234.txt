A lot depends on the sort of development and debugging you'll be doing. Some development is little more taxing than editing and web browsing. Other development is impeded by CPU and storage bottlenecks every time you hit F5. In general though, you'll want a SSD, not a mechanical hard drive and plenty of RAM. Don't undervalue your display, keyboard and mouse. Spend money on these first, then think about CPU and GPU.
