Is there a piece of public code available to create a page index using PHP?

I have a MySQL table holding lots of records that i want to give the user access to. I don't want to dump the entire table to the page so i need to break it up into 25 records at a time, so i need a page index. You have probably seen these on other pages, they kind of look like this at the base of the page: 5 6 7 8 9 > For example, when the user clicks on the '4' link, the page refreshes and the offset is moved on (4th page x 25 records). Here is what i already have: function CreatePageIndex($ItemsPerPage, $TotalNumberOfItems, $CurrentOffset, $URL, $URLArguments = array()) { foreach($URLArguments as $Key => $Value) { if($FirstIndexDone == false) { $URL .= sprintf("?%s=%s", $Key, $Value); $FirstIndexDone = true; } else { $URL .= sprintf("&%s=%s", $Key, $Value); } } Print(" "); Print("Page: "); Print(" "); $NumberOfPages = ceil($TotalNumberOfItems / $ItemsPerPage); for($x = 0; $x ".($x + 1)." "); } else { if(empty($URLArguments)) { Print(" ".($x + 1)." "); } else { Print(" ".($x + 1)." "); } } } Print(" "); Print(" (".$TotalNumberOfItems." results)"); Print(" "); } Obviously this piece of code does not create a dynamic index, it just dumps the whole index at the bottom of the page for every page available. What i need is a dynamic solution that only shows the previous 5 pages and next 5 pages (if they exist) along with a >> or something to move ahead 5 or so pages. Anybody seen an elegant and reusable way of implementing this as i feel i'm re-inventing the wheel? Any help is appreciated.
