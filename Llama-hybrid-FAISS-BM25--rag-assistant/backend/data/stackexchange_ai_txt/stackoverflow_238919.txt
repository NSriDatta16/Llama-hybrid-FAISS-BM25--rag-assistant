How do I provide a runtime form designer for my end user?

I would like to create a report designer that has the same functionality and ease of use as the Visual Studio IDE. The ability to drag controls onto a form, select various subsets of those controls, align left, evenly space, etc. The only tools I have ever encountered are really bad. Crystal Reports, the MS Access report crapola, ComponentOne, etc. Is there a third party tool that does this right, or do I have to roll my own?
