This is to be expected with ordinary running averages (including weighted) and so impacts exponential smoothing Consider what happens when you smooth a linear trend: If you want a smoother to "follow" a trend you need a more sophisticated smoother than simple exponential smoothing. If you introduce suitable negative weights you can get running weighted-average smoothers that follow linear, quadratic or cubic trends for example. Such methods were widely used many decades past but are less commonly used now (partly because the simpler forecasting methods generally produce better forecasts rather than better fits); nonetheless if you know before the fact your data will have a certain form of trend you can choose a smoothing approach that will take account of that trend and predict accordingly. Or you could look at say double exponential smoothing, which would be suitable for some situations
