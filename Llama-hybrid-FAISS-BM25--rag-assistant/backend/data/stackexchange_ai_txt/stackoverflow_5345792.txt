Sorted. The problem was that changing the value by js onclick doesn't fire the validation. So, I removed the onclicks and in jQuery added: $('#frmExperiment img').click(function(){ $('#txtIconG').val($(this).attr('src')); $('#txtIconG').keyup(); }); and in the custom rule: $.validator.addMethod("iconmatch", function (value, element) { return value=='btn1.png'; }, "That isn't the continue button" ); So, firing the keyup event on the input did the job. There may be a more elegant way of doing this, but it's working...
