I believe you misunderstood the question. When it asks: "Calculate the required sample size" this means that the value of interest is $n$ and not $p$. The trick here is that you need to find a single value of $n$ that works for all possible values of $p$. Since we are interest in finding $n$ we should isolate it in the expression for $MoE$: $$n = N\left(1 + \frac{MoE^2(N-1)}{1.96^2p(1-p)}\right)^{-1}$$ I strongly encourage you to derive yourself the previous expression. Maybe I did something wrong :) If we knew $p$ than all we have to do is compute the value given by the previous expression and select the first integer grater than the resulting value. But since we do not know $p$ we need to find a value of $n$ that works for all $p$. Note that we can write $n = N*f(p)$ where $f(p) = \left(1 + \frac{MoE^2(N-1)}{1.96^2p(1-p)}\right)^{-1}$ and now it is clear that the correct value of $n$ is $$n = N*\underset{0\leq p \leq 1}{\max}f(p)$$ But now we need to find $\underset{0\leq p \leq 1}{\max}f(p)$. First we note that $p(1-p)$ has a maximum in $p = 1/2$, consequently $1 + \frac{MoE^2(N-1)}{1.96^2p(1-p)}$ has a minimum at $p = 1/2$ and finally $\left(1 + \frac{MoE^2(N-1)}{1.96^2p(1-p)}\right)^{-1}$ has a maximum at $p = 1/2$. After all of this we get that the value of $n$ that works for all $p$ is $$n = N*f(1/2) = N\left(1 + \frac{4MoE^2(N-1)}{1.96^2}\right)^{-1}$$
