URL or session, there's no other (straightforward) way to pass data between two requests (which is what, in effect, you're dealing with here). (I am using "session" broadly here - any permanent or semi-permanent storage using user's unique identification as a key; and I also incorrectly include POST parameters into the URL method; but you know what I mean.)
