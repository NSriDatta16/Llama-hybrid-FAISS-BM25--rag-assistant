Probability with Limited Data

I have a theoretical question which has been bugging me, involving prediction based on limited data. Say you go to the horse track and see that horse A has just won its race with horse B. The two horses are scheduled to race again. If you have to bet and the other person will pick their side of the bet (aka you want fair odds), what odds do you give horse A? What I’ve considered so far: Past win ratio – gives you 1/1=100% odds, which is absurd. 50/50 – Assumes that the info about horse A winning means nothing, which doesn’t feel right. “Add 1 win to each horse” -> 2/3 or 2 to 1 odds – Doesn’t feel crazy, but seems arbitrary. Why is adding a number to each the right answer and why add 1 instead of 2 or 0.5? There is no answer, can’t know – If we imagine that a million different people did this for a million different races each, one would come out ahead. One method would eventually prove more effective on average for estimating the odds. It really feels like there must be a best answer.
