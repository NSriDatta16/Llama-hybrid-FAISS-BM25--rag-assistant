1) What you are referring to is the load factor of the hash table - the percentage of buckets that are expected to be filled. Wikipedia has this to say: With a good hash function, the average lookup cost is nearly constant as the load factor increases from 0 up to 0.7 or so. Beyond that point, the probability of collisions and the cost of handling them increases. I believe the Java implementation (and probably others) resizes periodically to keep the load factor within an acceptable range. 2) Just use the modulo operator (%) to keep the bucket index legal. The second operator should be the size of your bucket array.
