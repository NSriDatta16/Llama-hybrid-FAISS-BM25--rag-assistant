Why the validation loss is 0 even if accuracy not 100%?

I am training a CNN to perform a binary classification and at some point I get validation loss 0, however the validation accuracy is 84.5%. Why does this happen? I use binary_crossentropy as loss function and sigmoid as activation in the last layer.
