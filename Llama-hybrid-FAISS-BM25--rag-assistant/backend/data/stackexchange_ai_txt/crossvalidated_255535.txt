Multivariate ARIMA ( single equation) is called a Transfer Function/Dynamic Regression which is probably what you are looking for. You need to determine appropriate contemporaneous and lag structure while incorporating possible Intervention Detected structure. like pulses /step/level shifts, local time trends and seasonal pulses. One place to get an intro is here ARIMAX model's exogenous components? and here How to forecast a time series which is dependent on different time series? and http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/24-regression-vs-box-jenkins and here https://web.archive.org/web/20160216193539/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/75/ . If you wish to post your data in a csv or xls format I might be able to help you further.
