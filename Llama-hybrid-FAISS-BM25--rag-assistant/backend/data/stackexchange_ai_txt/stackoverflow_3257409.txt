If most of the application's access is via seeks, then the fragmentation is not a problem. Otherwise I'd try to find some time in which the index rebuild will have minimal effect, and do it via a scheduled job. Surely the application isn't running 24/7/365 with poor maintenance, without the company expecting some problem to occur. (Do they change the oil on their cars?) As far as your 4 step solution, copying the table to another database, rebuilding the index, and copying it back won't accomplish anything more than just rebuilding the existing index. On copying it back the index is rebuilt anyway, so just try and schedule a couple of tables at a time, until you get everything done. Good luck.
