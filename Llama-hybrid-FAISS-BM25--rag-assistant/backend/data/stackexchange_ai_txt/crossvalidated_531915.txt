A random variable is a random variable A vector of random variables is a random vector A set of random variables is a random field Like random vector, we need to give the random variables an index to identify that variable. Using different indexing schemas result in different real life applications, for example: If we index the random variables in the random field with rows and columns of pixel positions, then this random field can be used to represent images ; If we index the random variables in the random field with discrete time labels, then the random field can be used to represent time series . To your question, stochastic processes are about random fields, so the answer is yes.
