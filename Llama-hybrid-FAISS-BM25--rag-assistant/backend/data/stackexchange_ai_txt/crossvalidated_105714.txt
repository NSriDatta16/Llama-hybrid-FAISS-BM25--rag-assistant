A way to reach the goal without the use of a HMM but with markov chain would be the following: library('markovchain') trainMc =sequenceprobability(Mc2,sequence)){ return(1) } else { return(2) } } mybadMC Output would be: [1] 1 [1] 1 [1] 1 [1] 2 [1] 2 [1] 2 [1] 2 [1] 2 [1] 2 [1] 2 Not really what i am searching, but a way to go.
