Draw a line on top of a column chart

Apparently, it is not possible to have a chart with several independant horizontal axis. What I am trying to achieve is : display a bar chart, organized by any category overlay a line (actually a single horizontal line) on top of it (to display some sort of threshold) I tried doing the following : [Bindable] public var columnsDataProvider : ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection([{"Category" : "Cat1", "Value" : 10}, {"Category" : "Cat2", "Value" : 20}]); [Bindable] public var lineDataProvider : ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection([{"X" : 0, "Y" : 10}, {"X" : 1, "Y" : 10}]); ... This is the closest to what I want, except that the line does not start span all the graphs vertically (it is drawn only between the two columns of my bar chart). Is it possible to define a completely independant horizontal axis ? I also tried drawing directly on the canvas, but the canvas.lineTo() method only works in "data" coordinate ; I would need something that works in "chart/canvas/absolute/whatever" coordinates. Any help on that ? Thanks PH
