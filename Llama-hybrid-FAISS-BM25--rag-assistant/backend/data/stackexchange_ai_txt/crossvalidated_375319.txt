comparison of time series data for two group

I have to compare two time series. Lets say, that I have measurements of temperature from two towns. Now I have to find out if there is a difference in temperatures between this two towns. In another words, I just need something like t-studen test, but for time series. Could you recommend me something? Thanks, anba
