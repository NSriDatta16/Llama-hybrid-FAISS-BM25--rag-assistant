I think a slightly more accurate representation of your question would be: Why does C# allow an abstract class with only concrete members? The answer: There's no good reason not to. Perhaps someone out there has some organizational structure where they like to have a noninstantiatable class at the top, even if a class below it just inherits and adds nothing. There's no good reason not to support that.
