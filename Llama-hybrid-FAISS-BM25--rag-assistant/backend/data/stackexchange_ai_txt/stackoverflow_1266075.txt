Trac plugin with graphical representation of Milestones and Tickets

Do you use any trac plugin to represent graphically the roadmap with the various milestones and tickets ? If so, which one ? I find the view of active tickets really blur. I would like a tree-like representation of my various milestones with the tickets attached, a kind of complete map of my project. I've seen the Gantt plugin is no longer maintained. thanks.
