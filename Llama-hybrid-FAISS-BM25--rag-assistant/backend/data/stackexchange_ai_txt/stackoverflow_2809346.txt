You could set the ValidationRule.ValidationStep property for your validation rules to ValidationStep.UpdatedValue . This first updates the source, and then performs validation. That means, your property setter should be called even though your validation fails. Note that this property is only available from .NET 3.5 SP1 upwards. For more details, see this blog post (paragraph "How do I use it? (Part 1)").
