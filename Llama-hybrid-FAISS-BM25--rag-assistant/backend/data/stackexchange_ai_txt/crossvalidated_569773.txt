Modeling outcome-relevant geographic and demographic covariates directly, as @AdamO suggests, is the best way to go. Another answer suggests ways to start getting such information. The 3-digit ZIP code poses two problems. First, without care the numbers might be interpreted as a numeric variable and, as you state, "a one digit increase" in ZIP code would be meaningless. If you are to go with ZIP code as a predictor, you must ensure that it is encoded as a multi-level categorical predictor. That could allow you to use ZIP codes as fixed effects, or as cluster() or frailty/random-effect terms to account for correlations within ZIP codes. Second, as @AdamO notes in a comment, "The first 3 digits of a zip code doesn't mean anything." The first 3 digits of a ZIP code near where I live includes both wide-open suburban and dense urban localities, areas with some of the highest and lowest average wealth in the state, widely different education levels, and differences in access to transportation and to health-care facilities. If you can't get more detailed geographic and demographic data (e.g., from "ZIP +4" values combined with Census data), at least use the full 5-digit ZIP code.
