slideUp like some other effects ends up setting display:none on the element. That might be behind your problem. To deal with it, you could copy the values of these inputs to hidden form elements before triggering slideUp or you could use ajax to send them to the server at that time. It's a bit of a drag but I'm sure you can make it work.
