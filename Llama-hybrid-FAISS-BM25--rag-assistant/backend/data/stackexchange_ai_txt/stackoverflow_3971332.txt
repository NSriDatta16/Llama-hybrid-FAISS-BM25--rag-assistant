How to use entitycollection for binding to wpf UI

I'm using EntityFramework for data access and wpf as UI. If I bind WPF components to navigation properties of my entity classes(usually EntityCollection , exposed as IList in service layer), UI is not updating the changes. I know i have to use ObservableCollection or such, but I need some guidance on how to use it without iterating back and forth upon save and retrieval processes. (As you guessed, I'm new to WPF; so target your answers for a WPF beginner)
