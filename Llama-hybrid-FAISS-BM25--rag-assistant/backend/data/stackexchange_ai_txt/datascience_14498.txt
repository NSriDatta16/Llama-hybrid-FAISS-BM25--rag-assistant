For LSTM, the documents should be at word level. Hence, sentence vectors are not that useful for a document but word vectors are. You can use an embedding layer if you want do it though. in the 3D tensor, the first dimension is number of sentences. so 1000 is correct. The second one is the number of time_steps which is the number of words for each sentence. The third one is the word vector dimension. Hence, taking your numerical example, the input dimension of the LSTM will be (1000, 10, 100).
