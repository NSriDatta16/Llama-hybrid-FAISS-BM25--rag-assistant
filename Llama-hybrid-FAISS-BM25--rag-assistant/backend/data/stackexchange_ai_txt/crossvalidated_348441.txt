What are some potential reasons for no significant difference between Random Feature Selection and Automatic Feature Selection?

Basic info abut the experiment: Binary classification of exons 10 fold cross validation 1200 features of exons are ranked by Fisher Score, Relief and Gini Index feature selection algorithms 1-nearest neighbor classifier is applied to the ranked list of features. The classifier is trained on 1 best feature, on 2 best features, on 3 best features, ... There is no significant difference between Random Feature Selection and Automatic Feature Selection. John, Kohavi, and Pfleger defines the following categories of features: What are some potential reasons for no significant difference between Random Feature Selection and Automatic Feature Selection? Does that mean that all of 1200 features are strongly relevant? Reference: G. H. John, R. Kohavi, and P. Pfleger. Irrelevant features and the subset selection problem.
