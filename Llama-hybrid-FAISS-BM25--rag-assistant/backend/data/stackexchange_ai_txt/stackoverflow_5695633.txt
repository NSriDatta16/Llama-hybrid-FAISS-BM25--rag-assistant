the Picker hasn't been displayed

please i have hours with this issue without founding solution and adressing to you for that :) i have UIPickerView which has to be displayed from the bottom of the view when the user click on a UITextField (that's what my app requirement oblige me to do), so i implement this method to catch the touch event of the text field : -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch; touch=[touches anyObject]; CGPoint point=[touch locationInView:self.view]; if(CGRectContainsPoint([typeCarburantTextField frame],point)) { [self pickerTypeCarburantsShow]; } } and this method to prevent the keyboard from being displayed when the user click on the text field : - (BOOL)textFieldShouldBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField{ return NO; } pickerTypeCarburantsShow -(IBAction)pickerTypeCarburantsShow{ [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.5]; CGAffineTransform transform=CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation(0, 240); pickerViewTypesCarburants.transform=transform; [self.view addSubview:pickerViewTypesCarburants]; [UIView commitAnimations]; } all my IB connections are pretty good, however when i run and i click the UITextField the keyboard doesn't appear but i don't see the picker showed pleaaaase help, thx in advance :)
