Model which achieves good results on the Adult dataset, especially on the minority class

I'm looking for a model which achieves an high prediction and recall on the Adult dataset. I've tried with random forests, but couldn't get a model with good results on the minority class. Here are my results: precision recall f1-score support 0 0.88 0.94 0.91 5432 1 0.79 0.62 0.69 1802 accuracy 0.86 7234 macro avg 0.83 0.78 0.80 7234 weighted avg 0.86 0.86 0.86 7234 Has any of you ever achieved better results on Adult, especially on the minority class? I'm working on my thesis on Membership Inference Attacks, which work well on models who are slightly overfitted. Any suggestion on how can I reach better results? I've tried with neural networks (3/4 layers) (which aren't great for this kind of tabular datasets), Adaboost (with results similar to the random forest) and random forests. The preprocessing I applied on adult is target encoding on the categorical variables, deletion of duplicates/missing values, and Standard scaling. In this notebook there are my best achievements on the classification of Adult (first 20 cells), but I need way better results on the minority class in order to get good results in the membership inference attack.
