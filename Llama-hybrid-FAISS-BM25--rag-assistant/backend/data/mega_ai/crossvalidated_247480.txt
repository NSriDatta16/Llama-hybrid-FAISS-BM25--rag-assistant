In general, neural network (deep learning) can automatically learn the feature transformation to make a better model. For example, if you have 0 variance features, i.e., every data has same value, the neural network will automatically ignore it. Think about widely used example in neural network, handwritten digit recognition with MNIST data . Many models directly use all pixels as features. There are a lot of 0 variance features and many features are closely correlated. (Intuitively, the corner pixel may always be white for all images, and if current pixel is black, it is very likely next pixel is the same color.) Therefore, it does not matter too much if you have correlated or uncorrelated features. What it matter is how much are the features related to the label.
