Sorry to revive this thread. Just wanted to post for other users who stumble across this thread. I am having the exact same issues as Eli -- using Chrome 8.x. Eli -- to solve issue 2, I removed "myList" class from all sublists of the element being dragged. I change it to "mySubList" and then call .sortable('refresh') on the list item being dragged. Finally, I change it back once the dragging is complete (and call refresh again). That prevents the parent item from being placed into one of its own sublists and causing the error. You can't call sortable('refresh') in the start event of the sortable (it didn't work for me anyway), so you have to create your own 'click' event that does all of this work before the sortable events start firing. I have a handle, so I just do all of this work when the user clicks on the handle. Code (not tested, but you'll get the idea even if it doesn't work): $('.sortable_test').sortable({ distance: 5, connectWith: ['.sortable_test'], placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight', forcePlaceholderSize: true }).find('li').click(function() { $(last_selected_li).find('.mySubList').removeClass('mySubList').addClass('myList').end().sortable('refresh'); $(this).find('.myList').removeClass('myList').addClass('mySubList').end().sortable('refresh'); });
