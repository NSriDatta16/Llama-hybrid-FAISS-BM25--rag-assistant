You can re-set the decision boundary by maximizing the F-score, which takes into consideration both precision and sensitivity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score Without too much added information, you can also set the decision boundary as the probability of fraudulent in your training dataset. Any record with predicted probability above average will be identified as 'fraudulent'. Another way to decide the cut-off probability is by assigning 'loss' to each case of misclassification. For instance, non-fraudulent misidentified as fraudulent costs 1, while fraudulent misidentified as non-fraudulent costs 10. Then the optimal decision boundary will be the one that minimizes the sum of loss in your training data. It is more subjective this way, but you can customize your model with some personal beliefs.
