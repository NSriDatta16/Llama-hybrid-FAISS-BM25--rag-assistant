The figure shows a decision boundary for a binary prediction problem. It is a two-dimensional representation of the learned function and shows how the model would decide between the two classes in these two dimensions. If you have more than two predictors, such a figure is less informative and you may instead want to plot the ROC curve of the model. You could technically still make a similar graph using e.g. PCA or MDS to plot the function along two axes representing the largest variability, but you should be careful how you interpret that. As you already mentioned, one particular use of a figure of the decision boundary is to visualize over- and underfitting. Another potential use is to visualize the effect of moving the threshold for either decision. For example, in logistic regression you could choose to classify the outcomes as $A:y \leq 0.5$ and $B:y > 0.5$, but you can choose different thresholds as well. That said, both of these purposes can be fulfilled by better alternatives (e.g. out-of-sample performance estimates) and I think this type of figure is especially useful for didactic purposes.
