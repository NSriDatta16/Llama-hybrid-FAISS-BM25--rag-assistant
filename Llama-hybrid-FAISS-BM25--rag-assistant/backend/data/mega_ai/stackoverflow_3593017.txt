Great question! Only testing will tell which of those factors will be the best indicators. Some ideas: development of the bitrate over time with the same vbr codec: Sounds very CPU-intensive but I imagine it would give great results. Audio analysis seems like it would give similar results with less work. first and last frame picture analysis: Wouldn't 50% of these would be black? A better idea might be to use the very middle frame, but I wouldn't count on this technique being reliable. Use Bayesian statistics to record which factors make the best contributions to a positive match. This could be done in the testing phase to weed out unhelpful and expensive comparisons. Get users to help out! Let users group together duplicates they find. They vote on the one with the best quality and that one will act as the primary/official version within the group. Start with the easiest comparisons and add more sophisticated tests when you find the shortcomings of the simple ones. Video length would be a good one to start with, then perhaps some rudimentary audio analysis, and work your way up from there.
