I would point you to the paper Testing parametric assumptions of trends of a nonstationary time series (Zhang and Wu, 2011) which can be found here . In this paper the authors test whether the trend has a specific parametric form (which in my opinion is the most interesting case). If all you care about is whether the mean is constant, you can use one of a variety of changepoint detection methods for the mean of a time series.
