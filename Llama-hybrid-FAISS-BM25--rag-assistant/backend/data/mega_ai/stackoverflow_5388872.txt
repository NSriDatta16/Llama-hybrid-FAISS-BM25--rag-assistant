Use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext if you don't want to use XML: Standalone application context, accepting annotated classes as input - in particular @Configuration -annotated classes, but also plain @Components and JSR-330 compliant classes using javax.inject annotations. Allows for registering classes one by one ( register(java.lang.Class...) ) as well as for classpath scanning ( scan(java.lang.String...) ). In case of multiple Configuration classes, Bean methods defined in later classes will override those defined in earlier classes. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra Configuration class. Sample Code: ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationContext = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext( "com.mycompany.package1", "com.mycompany.package2", "com.mycompany.package3" // etc. ); applicationContext.refresh();
