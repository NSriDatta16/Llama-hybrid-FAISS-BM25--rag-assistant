Displaying log data in latest-first format

I like having log data in a last-first form (the same way most blogs and news sites organize their posts). The languages I'm most comfortable in are C++ and Python: is there a way to output log data either to the screen (stdout) or a file with the most recent entry always being on top? Or is there perhaps a way of modifying tail to show the latest lines in a scrolling-down fashion rather than scrolling-up? Would this entail needing a windowing system a la ncurses ?
