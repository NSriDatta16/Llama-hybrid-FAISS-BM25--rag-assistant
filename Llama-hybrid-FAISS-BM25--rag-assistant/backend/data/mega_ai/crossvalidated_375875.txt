Typically, you run a weighted regression model of the outcome on the treatment, and use robust standard errors to estimate the confidence interval and p-value. See Harder, Stuart, & Anthony (2010) for an example and example R code. The coefficient on the treatment in the regression is the effect estimate (i.e., the ATE), and the intercept is the counterfactual mean under the reference category (i.e., the control group if your treatment variable is dummy-coded with 1 as treated). The interpretation of the ATE is the average difference between the potential outcomes under treatment and the potential outcomes under control in the population from which your sample was drawn, which is the same interpretation as it would be in a completely randomized experiment. One final note is that if you have a model that perfectly explains the propensity scores (e.g., males get a probability of treatment of .5, females get a probability of treatment of .7), it ends up being better to estimate the propensity scores in your sample using the correct model than it is to use the true propensity scores.
