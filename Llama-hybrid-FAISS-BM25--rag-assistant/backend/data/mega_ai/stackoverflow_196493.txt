I haven't used Cobertura in a while (2005?), and saw this behavior back then. A similar problem exists with NCover for C# and curly braces following catch/finally blocks. My suggestion would be to add to this Cobertura bug report detailing a similar issue . Also, follow @tvanfosson's advice and realize not having coverage on a curly brace, which doesn't actually become anything in the JVM, is something you can ignore as 'noise'.
