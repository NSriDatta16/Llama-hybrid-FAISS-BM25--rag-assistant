I know people use DIC and Bayes factor, as suncoolsu said. And I was interested when he said "There are results which show that BIC will select the true model with high probability" (references?). But I use the only thing I know, which is posterior predictive check, championed by Andrew Gelman. If you google Andrew Gelman and posterior predictive checks you will find a lot of things. And I'd take a look at what Christian Robert is writting on ABC about model choice . In any case, here are some references I like, and some recent posts in Gelman's blog: Blog DIC and AIC ; More on DIC .
