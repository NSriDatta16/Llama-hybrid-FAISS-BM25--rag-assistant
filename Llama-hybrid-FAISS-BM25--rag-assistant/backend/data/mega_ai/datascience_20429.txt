There are many ways in which you could create an ensemble from your base models. Some resources to take a look at are the following: Firstly, I would point your attention towards this question , that has a lot of answers and interesting ideas. Regarding implementation : I have used in the past the brew module that has extensive implementations of different stacking-blending techniques etc, while using different combination rules and diversity metrics. It is also compatible with sklearn models. Another interesting project is xcessiv , which I haven't used myself but provides a helpful gui for managing your ensemble's details. Finally, regarding theoretical details , I would suggest you take a look into this survey that focuses on ensembles in regression tasks.
