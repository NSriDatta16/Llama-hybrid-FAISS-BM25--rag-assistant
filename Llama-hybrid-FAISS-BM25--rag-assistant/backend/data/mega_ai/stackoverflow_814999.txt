as3 swc component preview through code

I am developing an as3 swc-based component that populates its contents entirely through actionscript in the constructor (e.g. sprite.graphics.lineTo...). When I drag the component onto the stage, it is empty. If I export my movie, everything works perfectly, but I also need the live preview to work. I could get around this with a placeholder graphic, but I would much rather leave it purely as code. Is there any way to get around this? Thanks, David.
