Unfortunately, Chipman et al. in their Bayesian CART approach only extract the most probable tree. They never tried to average over trees and compare the performance to Random Forest and Extra-Trees. I've just read the BART paper from Chipman. If I understand correctly, it is a Bayesian averaging of K samples over a collection of m tree. It is interesting in many ways and does seems to perform really good. When m='1', it is a simple Bayesian averaging of K samples of 1 tree, coming from the posterior. However, not much test have been done on that particular aspect. And I would still be interested in knowing how does Random Forest or Extra-Trees compare to the true Bayes model.
