Best way to model repeated measure differences across groups

Let's say I have three groups, each consisting of two individuals. Each group answers questions together, and each member independently reports their confidence in their groups' answers. I want to see if one kind of group has members that are more confident in their collective answer than members of other groups. On the one hand, this is a repeated measures problem since the same question is asked multiple times ("what is your confidence?" on a 0-100 scale). But the measures actually relate to different questions. There's a temporal component to the problem, since confidence likely evolves over time. It's also multi-level (individual + group characteristics). The most trivial way of dealing with this is by averaging each individual's confidence across all the questions at the group-level and doing a simple comparison of means. I'm afraid this loses a lot of interesting information, however. What is the best way to model this?
