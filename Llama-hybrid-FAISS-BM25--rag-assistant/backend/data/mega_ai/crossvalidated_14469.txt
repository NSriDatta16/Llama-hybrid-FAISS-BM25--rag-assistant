How to remove skewness from the population?

Just want to know the ways to remove skewness from the skewed population. I am working on logistic regression (in the insurance domain) for finding out the repurchase propensity of existing users. Income data is right skewed. Will it cause any problem for runing logistic regression? If yes then how to remove it (deletion or any other transformation)?
