You should definitely include days with zero emails in the dataset, those days are legitimate data. Omitting them you couldn't have a poisson distribution---the poisson have a positive probability for zero. Also, what you have is time series data. So you should look into time series methods for count data, search this site. If you have enough data, maybe look into an latent variable process, where the poisson mean is a stochastic process with autocorrelation, and the daily count is then independent Poisson given the value of the latent process.
