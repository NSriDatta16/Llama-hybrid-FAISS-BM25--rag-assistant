What is the name of this type of tree / graph / representation?

I have come across a tree like way to organize variables and I wonder if anybody knows the name. A colleague thinks it has a "Japanese sounding name" (sorry by no mean I wish to be derogatory). So here is a quick example with a picture. Here, I want to identify the possible factors that could influence the results of a student to an exam in order to be able to study and test all the combination. I can't pretend this is a state of the art example. I am just very curious of how you call it and without knowing a name my researches for possibly linked keywords were unsuccessful.
