Well, the constructor is used to create a new instance of a class, and to do any necessary setup on that class. If you're just creating the class and leaving it, that does seem a bit of a waste. Why not, for instance, use static functions in the class as an organizational tool and just call them(or a function that calls them) instead of constructing a new instance that you'll never use?
