Feature in the data science context is the name of your variable, answering your question it would be things like name , address , price , volume , etc. It is also known as attributes, columns, variables , etc. Each row in your data set is denominated an instance , in your example again, it would be dorothy , 123 yellowbric road , U$12.3, 1000, etc. They might be called just rows, examples, etc. I hope it helps.
