First off I'd recommend using FasterCSV to parse this rather than using your array. This is just so you don't have to remember what number matches up with each field. Secondly, your model must have the singularized + "classy" name of the table. This is so that when you call create on the model, Active Record will map that to the correct table. For example, if you have a Post model, it's reasonably expected that you also have a posts table to go along with it. In this case, this isn't possible because of how your table is named. To force the table name, use set_table_name in your model like this: class Part I've also taken the liberty of changing the class name to something more Ruby-esque too. You don't need to say it's a "db", that should be implicit.
