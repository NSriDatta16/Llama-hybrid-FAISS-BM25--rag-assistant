Method to prevent web caching throwing exception ASP.NET?

I am trying to stop the caching of web pages using the following snippets in the ASP.NET however its not working and showing following error to me, Response.CacheControl = "no-store"; Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); Response.Expires = -1; Following is the exception i am getting, Exception Details: System.ArgumentException: Property value for CacheControl is not valid. Value=no-store. Reading at the MSDN document it looks "no-store" is valid value but still there is this error. Can some one please help on this. Thanks,
