I'll give you an extreme example where they are different. Suppose I create my 95% confidence interval for a parameter $\theta $ as follows. Start by sampling the data. Then generate a random number between $0 $ and $1 $. Call this number $ u $. If $ u $ is less than $0.95 $ then return the interval $(-\infty,\infty) $. Otherwise return the "null" interval. Now over continued repititions, 95% of the CIs will be "all numbers" and hence contain the true value. The other 5% contain no values, hence have zero coverage. Overall, this is a useless, but technically correct 95% CI. The Bayesian credible interval will be either 100% or 0%. Not 95%.
