I once read a book titled The Art of Game Design: A book of lenses . I found it to be a pleasant, high level, nontechnical coverage of the subject. It's divided into small chapters called "lenses." And in one lens, the author explains how to prototype a game without using any software. One of the examples he uses is that of prototyping a First Person Shooter (FPS) using a few tokens, a rulebook, a stopwatch, and some dice. Judging by the technical requirements you cited above (PHP, static images, no JavaScript), I think your game would be a good candidate for that kind of prototyping. Try it out, play it with friends, and if it's fun, then you can start to worry about coding. If not, then tweak the concept and the rules until it's fun.
