difference between GOLOGIT and a series of binary logistic regressions

I have recently learned about Generalized Ordered Logit regression, which is something in-between ordered logit regression (ordinal regression) and multinomial regression. It frees us from the proportional odds assumption, but it does account for the dependent variable categories being ordered. It looks perfect for analysing my data... but. I only have SPSS, which does not support such analysis. From what I understood from reading about the actual mathematical workings behind this method, it kind of works as if we did multiple binary logistic regressions for dependent variable collapsed into a series of dichotomous cumulative categories. But... does it work EXACTLY like this, and could I go around not having proper software by simply re-coding my dependent variable into those dichotomous cumulative categories, and performing the series of binary logistic regressions, and looking at the behaviour of my betas? Or would I be missing something then?
