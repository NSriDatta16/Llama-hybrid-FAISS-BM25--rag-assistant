Model averaging in mixed models

I am reading this blog post regarding using model averaging for mixed models and the last para says " https://sites.google.com/site/rforfishandwildlifegrads/home/mumin_usage_examples " One word of warning, do not estimate model averaged parameters for mixed models! You can, however, model average the predictions of GLMM . Could anyone explain why this cannot be done and in case I want to model average the parameters from multiple mixed models, how to go about it?
