Outer product approximation of the Hessian

On p251 of Bishop's machine learning book, the Hessian for least squares is derived (as a preliminary step to the outer product approximation): $ E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left(y_n - t_n\right)^2$ $H = \nabla \nabla E = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \nabla y_n \left(\nabla y_n\right)^T + \sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - t_n) \nabla \nabla y_n $ Firstly, why is the Hessian not given by $\nabla \nabla ^T E$ ? Secondly, could someone please explain how the full expression for the Hessian is obtained?
