Neural network using Orange

I'm using Orange Data Mining in a regression analysis applying Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Some works suggest defining the number of neurons in the input layer as the number of variables. The Orange ANN uses sklearnâ€™s Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm (MLP); however, I can only set the number of neurons per hidden layer (e.g., 4, 3 and 2; tree layers with 4, 3 and 2 neurons). Should I assume a hidden layer as the input layer and set the number of neurons as variable numbers? Does the MLP set the input layer automatically?
