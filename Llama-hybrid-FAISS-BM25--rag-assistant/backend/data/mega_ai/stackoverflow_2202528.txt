How do I make a app match a provisioning profile on xcode?

I am having a heck of a time trying to get this to work. At this point, I am only trying to create little test apps in xcode and "build and run" them on xcode-not on my phone. I have a provisioning profile for my phone in the xcode organizer, but that is the only one I have. Do I also need a separate provisioning profile for the desktop sdk?
