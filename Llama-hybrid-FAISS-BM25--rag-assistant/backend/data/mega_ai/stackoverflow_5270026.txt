App Never launches successfully again after Tombstoning. No exception thrown

I am having problems getting my app to restore/load from start after tombstoning. It fails at the following line: ServerCollection collection = AppSettings.GetSetting(AppResources.settings_servercollection) as ServerCollection; This line is in a function that is called inside Launching and Activated. The AppSettings class is this class Here :, but I modified it to use a object instead of a . The debugger does not seem to enter the AppSettings function. It also displays the string i'm expecting to key on ( AppResources.settings_servercollection ), so I do not think that is the problem either. Lastly, no exceptions are thrown. I have the entire section in a try, and breakpoints inside UnhandledException and NavigationFailed of the application, but I never seem to arrive at any of them. Has anyone else experienced this before, or know what the cause might be? Edit: Just wanted to point out that of course the app works after Cleaning/Rebuilding/Reinstalling etc. Edit: I've been able to isolate it to this: IsolatedStorageSettings Settings = System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; I found that out by placing it in each the Get/Set functions of AppSettings, and seeing it die directly on that line after entering the function. That said, Any ideas?
