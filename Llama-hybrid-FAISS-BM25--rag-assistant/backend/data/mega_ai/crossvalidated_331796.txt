What's the difference between a simplex Correlated Matrix and a Principal Component Analysis? One is a form of representing bivariate correlations between variables, the other is a projection to a space where its variables are linearly uncorrelated. Or we can say that "Everytime that we do a PCA we generate a Correlated Matrix" No, we can't, a covariance matrix eigen-decomposition is a theoretical necessity to perform PCA, but in practice one can achieve the same using SVD, so nowhere a covariance matrix is formed during the procedure.
