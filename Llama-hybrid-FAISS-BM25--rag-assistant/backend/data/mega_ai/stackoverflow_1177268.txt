For most browsers, you should add a class to the table (e.g. 'selecting') and have the following CSS declaration: .selecting { -moz-user-select: -moz-none; -webkit-user-select: none; user-select: none; } For IE, however, you should subscribe to the selectstart and dragstart events and cancel them through javascript.
