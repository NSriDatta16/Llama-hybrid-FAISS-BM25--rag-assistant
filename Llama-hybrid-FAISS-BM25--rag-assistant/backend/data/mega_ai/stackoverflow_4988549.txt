C# MVC 3 Root Route doesn't seem to work

EDIT: Sorry I explained it badly. Basically, in the below example, I want "this-is-handled-by-content-controller" to be the "id", so I can grab it in ContentController as an action parameter, but I want to access it via the root of the site, e.g mysite.com/this-is-not-passed-to-homecontroller. I'm trying to create a root route that will go to a separate controller (instead of home). I've followed the "RootController" example posted somewhere else that implements IRouteConstraint but it just doesn't seem to work and I've already wasted a couple of hours on this! Basically, I have a LoginController, a HomeController, and a ContentController. I want to be able to view HomeController/Index by going to http://mysite/ . I want to be able to view LoginController/Index by going to http://mysite/Login . But.. I want the ContentController/Index to be called if any other result occurs, e.g: http:/mysite/this-is-handled-by-content-controller Is there an elegant way to do this that works? This was my last attempt.. I've cut/pasted/copied/scratched my head so many times its a bit messy: routes.MapRoute( "ContentPages", "{action}", new { Area = "", controller = "ContentPages", action = "View", id = UrlParameter.Optional }, new RootActionConstraint() ); routes.MapRoute( "Default", // Route name "{controller}/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters new { Area = "", controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }, // Parameter defaults new string[] { "Website.Controllers" } ); Any help is appreciated greatly! chem
