If your goal is just to forecast (which, if you are using an ARIMA model then my guess is that's the goal), then out of these two competing models you have quite large evidence to suggest that the additional complexity of the ARIMA(6, 1, 8) model is worth it. Out of these two models, it would be justified to go with the ARIMA(6, 1, 8). What I would recommend: rerun auto.arima but increase the max.p and max.q arguments to something like 10. There seems to be evidence that your time series has significant autocorrelation over large lags.
