WCF doesn't like insecure communications - it wants to use safe and secure comm channels by default. The default security mode for netTcpBinding is transport-level security with Windows credentials. Can you use that default instead of turning everything off?? If your server machine and all the clients calling it are on the same company LAN, behind a firewall, there's really no point in not using Windows credentials. To do so, use this binding configuration: That security feature is very fast, often implemented in hardware on your network card, and using Windows credentials inside an organization typically is the best way to go. So why did you disable all security on netTcpBinding and get yourself into this trouble?
