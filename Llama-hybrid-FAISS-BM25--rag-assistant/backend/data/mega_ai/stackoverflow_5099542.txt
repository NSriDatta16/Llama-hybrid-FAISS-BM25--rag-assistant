Location of image resources

I have a plugin that runs off my customer's websites. The plugin is at http://mycompany.com/Tool.js , and needs to pull in some images. The problem is that the javascript seems to try to pull images from the customer's site, rather than from my own site. Here is the JS: button.style.cssText = 'position:absolute;top:-20px;right:-20px;background-image:url(/Resource/Button.png); In the above JS, the retrieval URL is CUSTOMER.com/Resource/Button.png (the site where the plugin runs), rather than my sites mycompany.com/Resource/Button.png. Note that I cannot use absolute paths, as they become a pain between environments (test/prod) and also because my image retrieval must use http/https based on the client environment (otherwise you can errors if http is used on an https site).
