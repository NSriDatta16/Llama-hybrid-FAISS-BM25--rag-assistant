Over-fitting issue in a classification problem (unbalanced data)

I am working on a rare event (unbalanced target variable) classification problem using decision trees. My dataset comprises of 95% non-event and 5% minority (events) class. I used decision tree over logistic regression because I had many categorical variables comparing to continuous variables. I get a good performance for training data with the decision tree C5.0. However I get poor results for the new data. I use the confusion matrix as a measure of performance. Training model is over-fitting. I did pruning to reduce the over-fitting caused by the decision tree. I used the following code to build the model Classifi_C5.0 I balanced the minority and majority class using the following code: training_data_SMOTED Any sort of advice will be helpful.
