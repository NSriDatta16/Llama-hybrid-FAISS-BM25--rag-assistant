No, that is fine, as container is not attached to the DOM. This is the preferred way to add a lot of elements to the DOM. But by using html() you will loose all event handlers or data you add to the elements. If you want to keep them, consider using this: $('#actualElement').empty().append(container.children()); You could also use a DocumentFragement , but as you are using jQuery, I would stick with jQuery. Update: To answer the actual question: Yes, it is DOM manipulation, but you are adding to the DOM only once which is the best you can get (besides not inserting at all ;)).
