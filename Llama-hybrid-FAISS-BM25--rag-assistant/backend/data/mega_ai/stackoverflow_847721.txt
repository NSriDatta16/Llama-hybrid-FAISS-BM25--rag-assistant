How to identify if a library is DEBUG or RELEASE build?

Our project is using many static libraries to build the application. How can we make sure we are using release version of libraries in release build of application? We are making mistakes by taking debug library in release application build. I am looking for an elegant way in which I can write a module in that we can check whether a particular library is release or debug and report it if not matching. Our application is written in C/C++. (Platform MSVC & GCC)
