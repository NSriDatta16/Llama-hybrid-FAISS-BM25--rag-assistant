Does PCA provide advantage if all PC's are used?

The question is basically stated in the title. Does principle component analysis even provide an advantage if all principle components are used later? In an application I am looking at PCA is conducted before a simple regression. The author claims that if all PC's are included in the regression, the result will be equivalent to OLS on the original feature set. Is this true?
