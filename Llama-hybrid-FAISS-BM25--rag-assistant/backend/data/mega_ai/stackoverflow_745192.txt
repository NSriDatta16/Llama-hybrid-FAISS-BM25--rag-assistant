What is a smoke testing and what will it do for me?

I thought I understood that a smoke server was used for continous integration to measure the performance and test coverage of a project. Is this basically correct? What does it mean to smoke-test a program? Does it simply mean to continously apply the tests defined on the smoke server to be able to pinpoint performance degradation to a particular time frame? This other question does describe the difference between sanity testing and smoke testing but does not ask to define smoke testing. This question is many years older than the reference question.
