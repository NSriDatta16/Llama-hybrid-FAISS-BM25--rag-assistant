WP7 - Clearing Isolated Storage for my application

I would like the users to be able to wipe out their isolated storage for my application and start over. Is there a way to do this? Is this suggested? If so to both prior questions, what is the best way to do this? Update: After thinking about this question a little bit, I'm thinking I can probably look through my collection and do a remove operation... So I guess that is one way. Is there a more complete way?
