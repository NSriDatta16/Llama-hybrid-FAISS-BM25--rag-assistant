How to get a single PDF document from Doxygen?

When I generate Doxygen documentation in PDF format, I get plenty of different files with a single diagram in each. Is it possible to obtain a single PDF document, organized as a book, roughly as the HTML version? Is it possible to get it automatically, i.e. without dealing manually with the latex files? Thank's!
