Personally I would stick to WinPCap. But since you asked, it is possible to sniff packets from the network using for the following code to enable raw sockets. Socket s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Raw, ProtocolType.IP); s.Bind(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(" "), 0)); s.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.IP, SocketOptionName.HeaderIncluded, 1); byte[] inBytes = new byte[] { 1, 0, 0, 0 }; byte[] outBytes = new byte[] { 0, 0, 0, 0 }; s.IOControl(IOControlCode.ReceiveAll, inBytes, outBytes); Once this is done, you can use Socket.Receive or Socket.BeginReceive to read the raw IP packets.
