& has still pretty good distinction: calling with it ( &YourSub ) makes current @_ visible to called sub too. Anyway, i use it in my scripts mostly for clarity reasons: it makes clear, which are my own functions and which functions from core or modules. About my . Every tutorial and doc suggest to use use strict; pragma, so you have then declare your varaible with my too. So, the situation from my point of view is pretty backwards: if scope is so important for best practicies, it would be normal that variables are scoped by default (like we say with my now) and when we really need global variables, we should declare them as that. I understand it is perl's legacy, but still it is against Perl's ideology to keep out redundancy. Using my every time for declaring could be overridden by some sort of pragma.
