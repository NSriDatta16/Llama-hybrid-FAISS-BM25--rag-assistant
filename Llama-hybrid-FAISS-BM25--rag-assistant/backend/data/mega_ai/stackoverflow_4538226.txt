How does the "Remember my password" checkbox work?

There are numerous login forms with the little check box "Remember my password" so that the next time you visit the website, the browser automatically fills up the password field for you. But I have noticed a behavior in modern browsers, such as Chrome/Firefox, which shows up a notification bar to save the user name/passoword even though that particular web page does not have any "remember password" check box. so my questions are: If I have to put the "remember password" check box in a login form, what do I have to do when the user checks it? I mean, do I have to store the password in browser cookies (or Local Storage)? If so, should the password be encrypted or plain text? The "Save password" notification bar is a browser's functionality or is there any way to invoke it from the web page?
