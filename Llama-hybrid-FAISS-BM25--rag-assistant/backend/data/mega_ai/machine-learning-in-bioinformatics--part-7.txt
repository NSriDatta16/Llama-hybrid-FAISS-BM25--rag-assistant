machine learning. As proposed by Mirtskhulava, feed-forward networks were tested to detect strokes using neural imaging. As proposed by Titano 3D-CNN techniques were tested in supervised classification to screen head CT images for acute neurologic events. Three-dimensional CNN and SVM methods are often used. Text mining The increase in biological publications increased the difficulty in searching and compiling relevant available information on a given topic. This task is known as knowledge extraction. It is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge. Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as natural language processing to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database. Text Nailing, an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017. This technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets, as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals. Annotations of proteins in protein databases often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein, so additional information must be extracted from biomedical literature. Machine learning has been applied to the automatic annotation of gene and protein function, determination of the protein subcellular localization, DNA-expression array analysis, large-scale protein interaction analysis, and molecule interaction analysis. Another application of text mining is the detection and visualization of distinct DNA regions given sufficient reference data. Clustering and abundance profiling of biosynthetic gene clusters Microbial communities are complex assembles of diverse microorganisms, where symbiont partners constantly produce diverse metabolites derived from the primary and secondary (specialized) metabolism, from which metabolism plays an important role in microbial interaction. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data are an important source for deciphering communications signals. Molecular mechanisms produce specialized metabolites in various ways. Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) attract attention, since several metabolites are clinically valuable, anti-microbial, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, anti-tumor and immunosuppressive agents produced by the modular action of multi-enzymatic, multi-domains gene clusters, such as Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs). Diverse studies show that grouping BGCs that share homologous core genes into gene cluster families (GCFs) can yield useful insights into the chemical diversity of the analyzed strains, and can support linking BGCs to their secondary metabolites. GCFs have been used as functional markers in human health studies and to study the ability of soil to suppress fungal pathogens. Given their direct relationship to catalytic enzymes, and compounds produced from their encoded pathways, BGCs/GCFs can serve as a proxy to explore the chemical space of microbial secondary metabolism. Cataloging GCFs in sequenced microbial genomes yields an overview of the existing chemical diversity and offers insights into future priorities. Tools such as BiG-SLiCE and BIG-MAP have emerged with the sole purpose of unveiling the importance of BGCs in natural environments. Decodification of RiPPs chemical structures The increase of experimentally characterized ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), together with the availability of information on their sequence and chemical structure, selected from databases such as BAGEL, BACTIBASE, MIBIG, and THIOBASE, provide the opportunity to develop machine learning tools to decode the chemical structure and classify them. In 2017, researchers at the National Institute of Immunology of New Delhi, India, developed RiPPMiner software, a b
