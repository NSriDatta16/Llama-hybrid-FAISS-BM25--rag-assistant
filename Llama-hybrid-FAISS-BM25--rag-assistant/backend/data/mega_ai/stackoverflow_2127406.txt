Get Non-Distinct elements from an IEnumerable

I have a class called Item. Item has an identifier property called ItemCode which is a string. I would like to get a list of all non-distinct Items in a list of Items. Example: List itemList = new List () { new Item("code1", "description1"), new Item("code2", "description2"), new Item("code2", "description3"), }; I want a list containing the bottom two entries If I use var distinctItems = itemsList.Distinct(); I get the list of distinct items which is great, but I want almost the opposite of that. I could subtract the the distinct list from the original list but that wouldn't contain ALL repeats, just one instance of each. I've had a play and can't figure out an elegant solution. Any pointers or help would be much appreciated. Thanks! I have 3.5 so LINQ is available
