WPF Sidebar style drag and drop

I'm trying to write a WPF control that has similar functionality to the Windows Sidebar. The functionaly I would like to replicate is the drag and drop ordering. When dragging an item the other items move out of the way to show you where the item will end up when dropped. Has anyone else had to implement this sort of functionality, if so how did you go about it?
