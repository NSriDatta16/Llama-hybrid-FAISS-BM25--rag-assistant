>>> zip((1,2,3),(10,20,30),(100,200,300)) [(1, 10, 100), (2, 20, 200), (3, 30, 300)] >>> [sum(x) for x in zip((1,2,3),(10,20,30),(100,200,300))] [111, 222, 333] To do this with an arbitrarily large set of tuples: >>> myTuples = [(1,2,3), (10,20,30), (100,200,300)] >>> [sum(x) for x in zip(*myTuples)] [111, 222, 333] sidenote: in python3, note that zip returns a lazy iterable, which you can always explicitly turn into a list like any other kind of iterable: list(zip(...)) (thanks to Seganku for catching mistake in examples in an edit which was thrice rejected by other editors)
