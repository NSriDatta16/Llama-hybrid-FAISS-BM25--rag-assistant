First, Kvam & Busemeyer (2020) have recently published a Psych Review paper on this topic which you may find useful ( preprint here ). Kvam, P. D., & Busemeyer, J. R. (2020). A distributional and dynamic theory of pricing and preference. Psychological Review, 127(6), 1053â€“1078. https://doi.org/10.1037/rev0000215 I can see two principled approaches you could take here. Bootstrap Let's call the indifference point calculated from the choices $\mu_c$ , the average valuation $\mu_v$ , and the difference between the two $\delta \mu$ . You already know how to calculate these estimates from your $N_c$ and $N_v$ data points. A bootstrap estimate of $\delta \mu$ can be obtained by a) drawing $N_c$ samples with replacement from the choice data, and $N_v$ with replacement from the valuation data, b) calculating $\mu_c$ , $\mu_v$ , and $\delta \mu$ for the resampled data, and c) repeating this procedure 1000 times or so, producing a bootstrap distribution for $\delta \mu$ . Full Probability Model Alternatively, you can set up a statistical model that specifies the likelihood of observing your data under different sets of parameter values. A general purpose way of using doing this is with a probablistic programming language such as Stan, where you would also specify prior distributions for your parameters, and obtain samples from the posterior distribution, given your data. A sensible approach here is to assume your valuation data come from a normal distribution with mean $\mu_v$ and SD $\sigma_v^2$ , while your choice data come from a binomial probit distribution: they choose the cash if it exceeds a threshold $x$ , where $x \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_c, \sigma_c^2)$ varies randomly from trial to trial.
