Polynomials in a regression model (Bayesian hierarchical model)

I am not a trained statistician and am looking to get some clarification of a model from literature. The study in question is ` A Hierarchical Framework for Correcting Under-Reporting in Count Data . The model as defined by equations 11 to 14 (with subscripts, nonrelevant terms removed for easier interpretation): $$ \begin{align} z_{t} \mid y_{t} &\sim \operatorname{Binomial}\left(\pi, y_t \right) \\ \log \left(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\right)&=\beta_{0}+g\left(u\right) \\ y_{t} &\sim \operatorname{Poisson}\left(\lambda_{t}\right) \\ \log \left(\lambda_{t}\right) &=\log \left(P_{t, s}\right)+a_{0}+f_{1}\left(x_{s}^{(1)}\right)+f_{2}\left(x_{s}^{(2)}\right) \\ &+f_{3}\left(x_{s}^{(3)}\right)+f_{4}\left(x_{s}^{(4)}\right) \end{align} $$ where $z_t$ are observed counts and $y_t$ are real, true counts. And the functions $g, f_1, \ldots, f_4(\cdot)$ are (from the paper) orthogonal polynomials of degrees 3,2,2,2, Compared to raw polynomials, these reduce multiple-collinearity between the monomial terms (Kennedy and Gentle 1980), and were set up using the “poly” function in R From my understanding, this model first estimates the true count $y_t$ . The true count itself depends on a logistic regression formula where the covariates are population, and social indicators such as $x_s^{(1)} = $ unemployment. The covariates are used as input to orthogonal functions . Once it estimates the true count, it uses that value in a Binomial model to count the number of "successes", i.e the observed count. The probability of success in this case is given by another regression formula that also has an orthogonal function for the covariate. My questions are rather simple: What is so important about using orthogonal functions in the regression models. Why can't simple coefficients be used (and these coefficients estimated in the Bayesian implementation). The interpretation of the log of $\pi$ and $\lambda$ . For $\pi$ , I am guessing, the regression formula can evaluate to numbers outside of (0, 1), so the the ilogit will transform it between 0, 1. I don't understand why the log is taking for $\lambda$ .
