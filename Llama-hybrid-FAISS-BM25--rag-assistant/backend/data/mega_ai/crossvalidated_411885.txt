Comparing two machine learning models

Let's say I'm working with two models, ResNet-50 and ResNext-50, and I want to compare the results. Due to the stochastic nature of deep learning, would it be advantageous or even encouraged to seed the models? Should the same learning rate schedule and hyperparameters be used? Finally, should the input data be fed in the same order?
