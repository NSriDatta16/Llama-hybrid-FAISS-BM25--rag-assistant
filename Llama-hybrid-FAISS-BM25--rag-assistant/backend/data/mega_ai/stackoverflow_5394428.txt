If it's not even possible to automatically determine whether a program terminates , I don't think you'll get much leverage in automatically determining whether an app does "naughty stuff". Part of the problem of course is defining what constitutes malware, but the majority is simply that deducing proofs about the behaviour of other programs is surprisingly difficult/impossible. You may have some luck spotting particular patterns, but on the whole you can't be confident (and I suspect it's provably impossible) that you've caught all possible attack vectors. And in the general sphere, catching 95% of vectors isn't really worthwhile when the attackers simply concentrate on the remaining 5%.
