Yes, there is a difference. A classic time series decomposition model is $$ Y = T + S + C + I, $$ where \begin{align} Y & = \text{data,} \\ T & = \text{trend,} \\ S & = \text{seasonal,} \\ C & = \text{cyclical,} \\ I & = \text{irregular (i.e. error left over).} \end{align} 'seasonal' refers to REGULAR patterns that occur with time, e.g. oatmeal sales higher in winter, or Starbucks coffee sales being highest at 7 a.m. These are usually very predictable. 'cyclical' refers to longer term patterns like business cycles. These aren't as regular as seasonality, and may involve some subjectivity in estimation. 'periodicity' refers to seasonal component. Periodicity could be monthly, biweekly, hourly, etc. The equation above has $+$ signs, indicating an additive model. Multiplicative models are also commonly used if the seasonality is multiplicative. I took out the '*' signs in deference to comments below ;)
