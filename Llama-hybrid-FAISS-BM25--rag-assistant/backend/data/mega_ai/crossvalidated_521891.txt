How about trying to predict the number of individuals found instead of the biomass? You can then look at a useful question: Is it Poisson, or does this species flock together? For a herding species, average biomass isn't a very meaningful figure over any small area. Once you have a model of number of individuals, you can also investigate individual weight, to get to biomass. Of course, the mean weight might be different in areas where the species is dense.
