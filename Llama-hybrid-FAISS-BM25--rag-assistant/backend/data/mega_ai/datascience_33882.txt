It is sorting, but it doesn't know that it is of date type, therefore it's sorting according to alphabetical order. I encourage you to change it to of datetime and do the same again. Otherwise small hack, replace the name of the months with integers and make it something like 201701 for January , 201704 for April , but this isn't appreciated. But may work for you.
