Android Organise Layouts into Sub Folders

I have a fairly complex android app, the contents of the 'layout' folder is becoming increasingly large. I've tried to organise the individual layout xml files into sub folders e.g. layout/buttons/, layout/activity/, layout/views/ etc. This doesn't seem to work, the content of the folders in not parsed into the R. class. Is there a way to do this? Thanks!
