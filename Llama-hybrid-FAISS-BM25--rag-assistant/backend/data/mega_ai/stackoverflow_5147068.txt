For safer more robust and reliable code always check the stream state before and after reading, especially after reading. An example code fragment: int x; int y; int main(void) { if (!(cin >> x)) { cerr > y)) { cerr Remember that a read may fail for other reasons than EOF. In your case the "cin >> x" may fail because the user entered something that is not a number, such as a letter or symbol.
