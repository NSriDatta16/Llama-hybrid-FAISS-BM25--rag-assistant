Can I double my dataset by including opposites?

The data set I'm working with is a set of votes. Experts in a field vote for outcome A or outcome B and I'm running a logistic regression to get a feel for how the intensity of the majority vote relates to the actual probability of the outcome. For example, if in Case 1, 51% of experts think that a given outcome is more likely and in Case 2, 86% of experts think a given outcome is more likely, I would expect the real probability of the outcome in Case 2 to be higher than Case 1. Currently I'm only considering the majority side of the case. So in keeping with the above example I'd only be using 51% vote for outcome A and 86% vote for outcome B in my logistic regression inputs. In effect: [.51, .86] [A, B] Could I also include the minority predication as well? To the effect of: [.51, .49, .86, .14] [A, B, B, A] I have this vague thought that it would double my data. At the same time, since I'm really only interested in the portion of the X axis that is above 50%, I'm concerned that I'd be spending time and effort on a portion of the graph that isn't really relevant.
