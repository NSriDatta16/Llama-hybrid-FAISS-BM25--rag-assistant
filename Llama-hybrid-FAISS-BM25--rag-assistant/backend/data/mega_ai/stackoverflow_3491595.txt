I have been using php for more than 10 years now and learned C# when it was put on the market and use it ever since. I think PHP is a very powerful language that can be very well structured if the programmer has driven to be organised and thorough. Undeniably PHP doesn't give you the ease of a framework (EDIT:unless you implement one). C# with .NET framework does a lot of things for you, whereas in PHP you often need to write your classes yourself. There are gigantic class libraries on the net where you could find almost everything that you would ever want, however implementing them is sometimes more challenging compared to the highly sophisticated assemblies of .NET. I think there is a huge market for PHP with all the UNIX platforms in use, however there is a new candidate in the horison with RUBY on Rails which has a lot mor in common with C# (I think). Why did you decide to go with PHP?
