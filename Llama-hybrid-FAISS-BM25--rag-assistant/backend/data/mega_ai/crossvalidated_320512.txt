There is much to imputation in the field of statistics, ranging from full likelihood/Bayesian models to multiple imputation and to crude approximations that are faster such as single imputation. Full modeling or multiple imputation are necessary to get the right uncertainty (e.g. standard errors, confidence limits, credible intervals). There's a lot to study. My chapter on imputation in Regression Modeling Strategies is a start. Free course notes for RMS are here . If using multiple imputation I'd recommend predictive mean matching for your case.
