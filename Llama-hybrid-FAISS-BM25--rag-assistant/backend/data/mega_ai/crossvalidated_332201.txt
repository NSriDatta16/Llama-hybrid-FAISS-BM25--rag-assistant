Markov Switching GARCH conditional distribution

Given a Markov switching GARCH model $\epsilon_n=Z_n \sqrt{\sigma_{\Delta_n,n}}$ where $\epsilon_n$ is a time-series of residuals, $Z_n $ is a sequence independent and identically distributed random variables with mean zero and unit variance, and $\left\{ \Delta_n,n\in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$ is a Markov chain. If we assume that $Z_n$ follow a t-distribution does this mean that each regime will have the degrees of freedom $v$ and only changing the conditional variance $\sigma_{\Delta_n,n}$ or is the degrees of freedom changing with the regime as well.
