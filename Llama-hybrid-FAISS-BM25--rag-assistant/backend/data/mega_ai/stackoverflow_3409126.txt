Is there a nice way to share your cucumber features with your clients?

I LOVE cucumber, my clients love it too. As far as I know currently there isn't a nice way to share your features with your clients. Us nerds have TextMate or NetBean bundles that give us nice syntax highlighting -- my clients not so much. What I would love is to be have something hosted at features.myclientsapp.com that would be a organized nice marked up view of the features of the application. Maybe as a bonus an overview page with % coverage, which steps are passing. Ideally this will be exposed as a Rack Engine. If I am getting greedy -- git integration to see version control, and a way to solicit feedback from the clients. Does anyone know of anything that does can do this? What other strategies do people have on sharing there features files with their clients/users?
