How do I alphabetize a list of domains in this way?

So if I wanted to organize a list of websites alphabetically, and there were all of this form: example1.com, test.com, stackoverflow.com, google.com, it would be easy. However, I want to also organize subdomains. Consider the following three domains: a.domain.com domain.com anotherdomain.com If I handed them over to software to alphabetize, they would be alphabetized like this: a.domain.com anotherdomain.com domain.com However, this is not how I want them alphabetized. I want them to be alphabetized by domain, and then by subdomain as a "tiebreaker," in other words, like this: anotherdomain.com domain.com a.domain.com Could someone tell me how to code PHP (or JavaScript) to do this? (You can assume that each "website" is on a fresh line of code.)
