Ordinal logistic regression by hand

Now, I'm not going to bother you any longer, this is my last question (and thanks so much for all of your help): Is there a way of calculating an ordinal logistic regression "by hand" without going insane? Maybe it's just me but it seems incredibly difficult. I'm not opposed to shortcuts in R, I just don't want to use the simple ordinal regression command for once. I'm sorry if this question isn't very specific, I'm basically clueless.
