self.viewDelegate = 0x0 why?

In the following code the self.viewDelegate is 0x0 and I don't know how to solve this problem. Should I have to go to the interface Builder? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([touch tapCount] == 2) { if ([self.viewDelegate respondsToSelector:@selector(openFlowView:doubleTapOnIndex:itemView:)]) [self.viewDelegate openFlowView:self doubleTapOnIndex:selectedCoverView.number itemView:selectedCoverView]; }
