Maybe another measurement for this would be the COCOMO measure - even though it is probably as useless as LOC. A single developer could only do organic projects - "small" teams with "good" experience working with "less than rigid" requirements. In this case, efford applied in man months are calculated as 2.4 * (kLOC)^1.05 This said, 1kLOC would need 2.52 man month. You can use several factors to refine that, based on product, hardware, personel, and project attributes. But all we have done now is projected LOC to a time measurement. Here you again have to decide whether a 2-month or 20-month project is considered large. But as you said, LOC probably is not the right measure to use. Keywords: software metrics, function points, evidence based scheduling, the planing game.
