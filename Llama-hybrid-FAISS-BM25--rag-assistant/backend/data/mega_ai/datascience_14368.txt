Benchmarks based on neural networks libraries to compare the performance between different GPUs

I am looking for benchmarks based on neural networks libraries (Theano/TensorFlow/Torch/Caffe/â€¦) to compare the performance between different GPUs. I am aware of: https://github.com/jcjohnson/cnn-benchmarks (CNN in Torch) https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style#speed (CNN in Torch) https://github.com/glample/rnn-benchmarks (vanilla RNNs and LSTM in Theano, TensorFlow, and Torch) What are some other benchmark codes?
