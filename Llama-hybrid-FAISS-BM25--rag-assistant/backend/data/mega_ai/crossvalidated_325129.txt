How can the AIC or BIC be used instead of the train/test split?

I've recently come across several "informal" sources that indicate that in some circumstances, if we use the AIC or BIC to train a time series model, we don't need to split the data into test and train - we can use all the data for training. (Sources include among others, a discussion on Rob Hyndman's blog post on CV , this presentation from Stanford , or Section 4 of this text ). In particular, they seem to indicate that the AIC or BIC can be used when the data set is too small to allow for a train/test split. Rob Hyndman's comment for example: "It is much more efficient to use AIC/BIC then to use test sets or CV, and it becomes essential for short time series where there is not enough data to do otherwise." I can't seem however, to find any texts or papers that discuss this in detail. One thing that especially puzzles me is that the AIC and BIC asymptotically tend towards cross-validation, which means that if possible at all, they would replace CV for large data sets - which goes against the idea of them being useful for small data sets. Can anyone point me to a formal discussion (book chapters, papers, tutorials) of this idea?
