[sigh] People keep saying 'web app' vs. 'desktop app', and no one has a good set of criteria that would define one or the other. Using "web" technologies - HTML, CSS, JS, one can develop an application that is packaged and deployed to the user's computer using one of the traditional "desktop" deployment technologies - ZIP, MSI. Such application could benefit from "desktop" technologies like offline storage, but still authenticate against a third party server using OAuth, OpenID, or a plain user/pass combo. Is such an app a "web" or a "desktop" app?
