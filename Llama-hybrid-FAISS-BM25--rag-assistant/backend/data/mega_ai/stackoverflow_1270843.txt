I strongly suggested you use the Access2007 version of the Access database engine, known as ACE, and use its Attachment field type: Attach files and graphics to the records in your database Attachments also store data more efficiently. [Access2003/Jet 4.0 and earlier] versions of Access used a technology called Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to store images and documents. By default, OLE created a bitmap equivalent of the image or document. Those bitmap files could become quite large â€” as much as 10 times larger than the original file. When you viewed an image or a document from your database, OLE showed you the bitmap image, not the original file. By using attachments, you open documents and other non-image files in their parent programs, so from within Access, you can search and edit those files. ACE is available as a free download from Microsoft: 2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components .
