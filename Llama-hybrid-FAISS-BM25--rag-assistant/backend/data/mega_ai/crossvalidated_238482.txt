In convolutional neural network how can I identify overfitting? Comparing the performance on training (e.g., accuracy) vs. the performance on testing or validation is the only way (this is the definition of overitting). should dropout be blindly added to the model hoping that it increases testing or validation accuracy? Dropout often helps, but the optimal dropout rate depends on the data set and model. Dropout may be applied to different layers in the network as well. Example from Optimizing Neural Network Hyperparameters with Gaussian Processes for Dialog Act Classification , IEEE SLT 2016.: You may also want to do some early stopping:
