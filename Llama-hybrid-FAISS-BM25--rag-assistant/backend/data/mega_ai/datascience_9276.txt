To combine the cosine distance and euclidian distance, I would first normalize the euclidian distance on the same scale as the cosine distance [o-1], and then combine them by average. But I am sure you already try that approach. Thus I am wondering what is your definition of "combine both scores effectively" ? Do you need to weight differently the two metrics? How did you came to the final matrix you are showing? Is it intuition? If so, you can investigate this further to better define the weights you want to put on each feature and it associated metrics.
