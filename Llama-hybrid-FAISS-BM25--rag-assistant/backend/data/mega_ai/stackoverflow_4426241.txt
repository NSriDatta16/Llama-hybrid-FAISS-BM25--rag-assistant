Dragging anchors with :active CSS in Firefox/IE breaks CSS anchor behavior

In Firefox and IE, when an anchor with a CSS :active state is dragged and the mouse button is released, the normal go-to-url does not occur nor does the anchor return to its normal :link state. After this, :hover state does not trigger on the anchor either. So I'm basically stuck with an anchor that is perpetually :active until the mouse is clicked somewhere else in the window. This odd behavior does not occur in Chrome. Is there a fix for this? Should I just use div s instead of anchors?
