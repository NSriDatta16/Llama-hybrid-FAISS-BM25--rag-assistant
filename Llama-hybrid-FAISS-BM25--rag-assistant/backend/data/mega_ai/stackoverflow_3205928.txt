Is there a way to get the artifacts from the builds (.JAR files) from these two modules into a common 'dist' directory after building? The Maven Assembly Plugin can do that, it is very powerful and flexible. But power and flexibility also mean that this is not the most trivial plugin to use. In your case, the idea would be to generate a dir distribution from a moduleSets and you'll have to create a custom assembly descriptor for that. I suggest starting with chapter 8.2. Assembly Basics of the Maven book and to pay a special attention to the chapter 8.5.5. moduleSets Sections .
