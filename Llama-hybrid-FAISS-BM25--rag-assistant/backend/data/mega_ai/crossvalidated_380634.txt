My suggested approach encompasses models that are much more general than ARIMA as they include the potential for seasonal dummies that may change over time , multiple levels ,multiple trends , parameters that may change over time and even error variances that may change over time. This family is more precisely called ARMAX models but for complete transparency does exclude a (rare) variant that has multiplicative structure. You asked for tips and I believe that this might be a good one to get you started. I would suggest that you write code to follow/emulate this flowchart/workflow. The "best model" could be found by evaluating the criterion that you specify ... it could be the MSE/AIC of the fitted data or it could be the MAPE/SMAPE of withheld data or any criterion of your choice. Be aware as the detailing of each of these steps can be quite simple if you are unaware of some of the specific requirements/objectives/constraints of time series analysis BUT it can be (should be !) more complex if you have a deeper understanding/learning/appreciation of the complexities/opportunities present in thorough time series analysis. I have been asked to provide further direction as to how one should go about automating time series modelling ( or modelling in general ) https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=peeling+an+onion contains some of my guidance on "peeling onions" and related tasks . AUTOBOX actually details and shows the interim steps as it forms a useful model and could be a useful teacher in this regard. The whole scientific idea is to "add what appears to be needed" and "delete what appears to be less than useful" . This is the iterative process suggested by Box and Bacon in earlier times. Models need to be complex enough (fancy enough) but not too complex (fancy). Assuming that simple methods work with complex problems is not consistent with scientific method following Roger Bacon and tons of followers of Bacon. As Roger Bacon once said and I have often paraphrased : To do science is to search for repeated patterns. To detect anomalies is to identify values that do not follow repeated patterns. For whoever knows the ways of Nature will more easily notice her deviations and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describe her ways. One learns the rules by observing when the current rules fail.In the spirt pf Bacon by identifying when the currently identified "best model/theory" is inadeqaute one can then iterate to "a better representation" In my words "Tukey proposed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which suggested schemes of model refinement based upon evidented model deficiency suggested by the data" . This is the heart of AUTOBOX and of science. EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. The litmus test of an automatic modelling program is quite simple . Does it separate signal and noise without over-fitting ? Empirical evidence suggests that this can and has been done. Forecasting accuracies are often misleading because the future is not accountable for the past and depending on which origin you pick results can and do vary.
