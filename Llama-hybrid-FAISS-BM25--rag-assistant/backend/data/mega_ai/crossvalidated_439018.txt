Scaled and Unscaled features are giving different feature importances when using LIME

Now, based on my understanding, feature scaling should have no impact on my model results due to the fact that XGBoost isn't sensitive to monotonic transformations. Ref My concern is the model interpretation. While using LIME, I am getting signficantly different "top drivers" for scaled and non-scaled models. Questions: Why would I see different results for both? Which version should I use? Any guidance would be much appreciated.
