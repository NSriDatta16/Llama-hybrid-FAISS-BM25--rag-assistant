In the paper you have referenced, the author uses cross-validation in the context of a predictive modeling approach, e.g. to perform (automatic) variable selection. In descriptive modeling, variable selection is performed based on theory first and only then confronted with the model output and data. See this post for a discussion on predictive vs descriptive. In a purely descriptive setting, model quality assessment is also not solely focused on quantitative indicators but also relies on theoretical assumptions, expectations and the modeling process itself. This is unlike a setting which includes a predictive purpose, where being able to put a confidence interval around quantitative quality measures such as R squared can be considered indispensable. In descriptive modeling and more particularly for OLS, cross-validation or most often bootstrapping can rather be used to identify or measure the impact of potential leverage points and outliers. As such, you will gain further knowledge about the underlying population or sample and be able to decide on the approach to take, such as for example whether to resort to more robust regression methods or to flatten certain observations in the sample.
