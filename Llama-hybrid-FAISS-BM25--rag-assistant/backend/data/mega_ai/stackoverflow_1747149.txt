How do I properly fix deploy permission issues with Hudson and ant?

I'm having trouble deploying my Web start to the web server due to permissions problems (reformatted): /home/hudson/.../build/build-web-start.xml:20: Failed to copy /home/hudson/.../dist/app.jnlp to /var/development/.../webstart/app.jnlp due to java.io.FileNotFoundException /var/development/.../webstart/app.jnlp (Permission denied) and I couldn't delete the corrupt /var/development/.../webstart/app.jnlp ...so it's obvious what the problem is. I need to do one of the following: Find the build user so that I can give it permissions Configure hudson to build the app under a specific user (perhaps separating the deploy from the rest of the build) Configure the ant build script to execute the deploy under a specific user. Current situation: I'm running Hudson under jetty I've given the jetty user group permissions to be able to write to the deploy folder HUDSON_HOME is set to /home/hudson
