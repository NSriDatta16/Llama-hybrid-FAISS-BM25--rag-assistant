Finding a PHP based product manager

I'm looking to find an user friendly PHP app to manage my client's collection of vintage tools. I can't find ANYTHING to just simply organize his collection. The closest thing I can find is a shopping cart, but that's not what he needs, as he doesn't want to sell his collection. I don't have the time to code this myself and he's getting agitated because this is taking longer than I promised. Any suggestions? I'm sure there's SOMETHING out there.
