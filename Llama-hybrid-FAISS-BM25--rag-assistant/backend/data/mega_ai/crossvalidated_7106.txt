Colin Gillespie mentioned BUGS, but a better option for Gibbs Sampling, etc, is JAGS . If all you want to do is ARIMA, you can't beat X12-ARIMA , which is a gold-standard in the field and open source. It doesn't do real graphs (I use R to do that), but the diagnostics are a lesson on their own. Venturing a bit farther afield to something I recently discovered and have just begun to learn... ADMB (AD Model Builder), which does non-linear modeling based on the AUTODIF library, with MCMC and a few other features thrown in. It preprocesses and compiles the model down to a C++ executable and compiles it as a standalone app, which is supposed to be way faster than equivalent models implemented in R, MATLAB, etc. ADMB Project . It started and is still most popular in the fisheries world, but looks quite interesting for other purposes. It does not have graphing or other features of R, and would most likely be used in conjunction with R. If you want to work with Bayesian Networks in a GUI: SamIam is a nice tool. R has a couple of packages that also do this, but SamIam is very nice.
