Work-items, Work-groups and Command Queues organization and memory limit in OpenCL

Okay i have already been through most of the ati and nvidia guides to OpenCL, there are some stuff that i just want to be sure of, and some need clarification. Nothing in the documentation gives a clear cut answer. Now i have a radeon 4650, now on querying my device, i got CL_DEVICE_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS: 8 CL_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BITS: 32 CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_ITEM_DIMENSIONS: 3 CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_ITEM_SIZES: 128 / 128 / 128 CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE: 128 CL_DEVICE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE: 256 MByte CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_MEM_SIZE: 256 MByte ok first, my card has 1GB memory, why am i allowed to 256MB only? 2nd i don't understand the Work-item dimension part, does that mean i can have up to 128*3 or 128^3 work-items? when i calculated this before i run the query, i got 8 cores * 16 stream processors * 4 work-items = 512 why is this wrong? also i got the same 3 dimension work-item stuff for my inte core 2 duo CPU, does the same calculations apply? As for the command queues, when i tried accessing my core duo CPU as a device using OpenCL, stuff got processed on one core only, i tried doing multiple queues and queueing several entries, but still got processed on one core only, i used a global_work_size of 128*128*128*8 for a simple write program where each work-item writes its own global-id to the buffer and i got only zeros. and what about Nvidia Cards? on a Nvidia 9500 GT with 32 cuda cores, does the work-items calculate similarly? Thanks alot, i've been really all over the place trying to find answers.
