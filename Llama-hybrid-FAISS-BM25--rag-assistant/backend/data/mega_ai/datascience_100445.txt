Pattern recogniser library for C# programs

I'm a regular user of the StackOverflow forum, but as this question is about a recommendation for libraries, which is supported at StackOverflow, and as my question is about data science libraries, I've decided to take my chance here ( my original question has been kicked from the "Artificial Intelligence forum"). I'm developping a program that takes a table of a database and predicts the next (limited list of) tupple(s), e.g. for the following table: A B C D ================ 1 12 0 A 2 14 0 A 3 16 0 A 4 18 0 A 5 20 0 A I would like to predict the following tupple: A B C D ================ 6 22 0 A For that, I have created two SQL queries: SELECT COUNT DISTINCT ... => if the result is 1, then all values are equal, easy peasy :-) SELECT MAX(col1-lag_col1) FROM ( SELECT Col1, LAG(Col1) ... (take the difference between subsequent tupples) => If both maximum and minimum are equal and not zero, there's an arithmetic progression (more information here). I thought I was on a good track, but then the first problems started arising: In a list of +800 tupples, the arithmetic progression was disturbed by one single erroneous entry, messing up my prediction. I have seen values like AB123, AB124, AB125, ...: although this is easy for a person to predict, it's not that straightforward for a computer (and what in case of ABC12x or AB12, AC12, AD12, ...?). In both cases, the key solution is pattern recognition: if I can feed the values to a pattern recogniser, it might find the pattern (and maybe the values, messing it up) and I might use that for predicting the next tupple(s). What's the programmers term for pattern recognition? Right: it's A.I., artificial intelligence, more exactly data science. But as most of you know, that's an enormously broad term. Therefore I'm risking my chances here: does anybody know about a library (or whatever) I might use in my C# program in order to find patterns and predict values (numbers, strings and their combinations)?
