It's an image. Use a convolutional neural network rather than a fully connected network. Here's one of my favorite tutorials (check out their entire collection of tutorials, it's worthwhile). https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/3_NeuralNetworks/convolutional_network.ipynb Convolutional neural networks take advantage of the spacial locality inherent in images, whereas fully connected networks flatten the image and effectively permute the pixels randomly. Ever tried to look at an image flattened into an array with the pixels randomly permuted? Not easy. Nor is it for a neural network.
