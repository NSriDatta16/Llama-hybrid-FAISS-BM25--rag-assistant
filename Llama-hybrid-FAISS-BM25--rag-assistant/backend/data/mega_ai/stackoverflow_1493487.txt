Although I agree with other posters that there are many entry-level C++ "no-no's" in your sample, putting that to the side and answering your question directly: In practice, I tend to make many but not all of my member fields* public to start with, and then move them to get/set when needed. Now, I will be the first to say that this is not necessarily a recommended practice, and many practitioners will abhor this and say that every field should have setters/getters. Maybe. But I find that in practice this isn't always necessary. Granted, it causes pain later when I change a field from public to a getter, and sometimes when I know what usage a class will have, I give it set/get and make the field protected or private from the start. YMMV RF you call fields "variables" - I encourage you to use that term only for local variables within a function/method
