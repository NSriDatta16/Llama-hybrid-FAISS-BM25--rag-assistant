Is there a limit to Asp.Net 4.0 or IIS7 response redirect calls you can use in a row

In our application we have broken our app into several modules. When the logout.aspx page is called, it builds a stack of logout pages to call, one in each module. Then it redirects to each module's logout page which redirects back to the caller. This has been working fine but in our new app, which uses APS.Net 4.0 the redirects just seem to stop working. Fiddler shows that the redirect was sent... but the browser doesn't send the next GET. Strange thing is if I remove and one module then things work. It doesn't matter which I remove, so I know no error is occurring in any of the logout pages. So, the only difference seems to be less redirects are being used in a row. Here is the final 302 that the browser receives... it just doesn't do a get to loginredirect.htm: > GET /AmsiWeb/logoutCoordinator.aspx > HTTP/1.1 Accept: > application/x-ms-application, > image/jpeg, application/xaml+xml, > image/gif, image/pjpeg, > application/x-ms-xbap, > application/vnd.ms-excel, > application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, > application/msword, > application/x-shockwave-flash, */* > Accept-Language: en-US User-Agent: > Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; > Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; > SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR > 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2; MS-RTC LM > 8; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E) > Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate > Connection: Keep-Alive Host: ustawvqa1 > Cookie: > ASP.NET_SessionId=uf51gkiem0ditfvyi3pvkhoj; > GeacSessionId=aa6be7f2-9bd5-4700-9a21-e9fa6c0a3b19; PortalPathURL=; > PortalPath=C:\inetpub\wwwroot\AmsiWeb\esiteweb\; ASPSESSIONIDQQRDQTCC=EIMNDBIDIPHCGCMFNHBOHOOK; > .ASPXAUTH=51C5F3FA040DFEDDFB163D0DF5B5F9D2AAAB91EA76A5388BFE61BC54D83FEF29EB3B0C7886FB473EF9391999D67921B5BE0CEA403F6BA00D5954D8E16BF054212EA4754C40F409473A3990D1A41867D9099ECD45EC229C6205C599727A5BFB19F6DD0CE72B8480CE1C13C10C7A39D50503420A79B70248DF236403C5E632CE8D670DBEF5F0F64F87141A546B8A471EAA163DEA445F76AC6F36D36F7EC3BA805C > > > HTTP/1.1 302 Found Cache-Control: > private Content-Type: text/html; > charset=utf-8 Location: > /AmsiWeb/LogOutRedirect.htm Server: > Microsoft-IIS/7.5 X-AspNet-Version: > 4.0.30319 Set-Cookie: .ASPXAUTH=; expires=Tue, 12-Oct-1999 04:00:00 GMT; > path=/; HttpOnly X-Powered-By: ASP.NET > Date: Tue, 25 Jan 2011 19:20:21 GMT > Content-Length: 144 > > Object > moved Object > moved to href="/AmsiWeb/LogOutRedirect.htm">here . > My question... is there a limit to response.redirects you can use? If so, how do I change it... if not, does anyone have any other ideas what could be happening here. (Supposedly there is an answer to this on Experts Exchange)
