Why do I need Stored Procedures when I have LINQ to SQL

My understanding of Linq to Sql is it will take my Linq statement and convert it into an equivalent SQL statement. So var products = from p in db.Products where p.Category.CategoryName == "Beverages" select p Just turns into Select * from Products where CategoryName = 'Beverages' If that's the case, I don't see how stored procedures are useful anymore.
