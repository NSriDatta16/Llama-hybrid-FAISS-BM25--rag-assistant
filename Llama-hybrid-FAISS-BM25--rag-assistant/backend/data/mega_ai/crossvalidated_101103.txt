Your approach is statistically valid. With that being said, you may also want to split the first 10 months into a training and validation set. Build a logistic regression model using only the training set or perform cross-validation to obtain the lowest misclassification error rate in the validation set. This way you are less likely to overfit the first 10 months of data, which will likely lead to better predictions in the 11th month (your validation set), the 12 month (your test set), and most importantly, future months. As with any predictive model, it will be important to see how the model holds up over time! Please let me know if you need any further help! Happy modeling!
