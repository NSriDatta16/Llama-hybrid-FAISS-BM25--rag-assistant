How to interpret a neural network in R?

I am taking a course in machine learning and just made a neural network, but I don't know how to interpret it. The input variables are related to wine, and the output variable is representing whether it is red or white wine. From the figure I should be able to interpret how the network predicts the type of wine, but I have no idea about how to do this, so I hope that someone can help me. How do I interpret this neural network?
