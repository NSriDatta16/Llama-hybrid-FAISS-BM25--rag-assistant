Neither method is a subset of the other. Suppose you have response variable $Y$ using covariates $X$. In linear regression, you assume that $E[Y|X]$ is linear in the parameters $\beta$, whereas in logistic regression you assume the log-odds, $$ \log\Bigg(\frac{P(Y=1|X)}{P(Y=0|X)}\Bigg) $$ is linear in the parameters $\beta$. For each method you assume two different quantities are linear in $\beta$. The estimates of $\beta$ will likely be different and have different interpretations as well. It may or may not make sense to use logistic regression for your data, but linear regression is almost certainly not a good way to analyze your (dichotomous) data.
