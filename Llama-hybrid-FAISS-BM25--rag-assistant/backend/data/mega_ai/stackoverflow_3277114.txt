Here is the slolution: User32.INSTANCE.SetWindowLong(new HWND(Native.getWindowPointer(frame)), -20, new Pointer(0x00000080L)); User32 is part of the JNA platform.jar. But most probably it only runs with a 32bit JVM. With 64bit you have to call SetWindowLongPtr but this doesn't seem to be mapped in JNA (UnsatisfiedLinkError).
