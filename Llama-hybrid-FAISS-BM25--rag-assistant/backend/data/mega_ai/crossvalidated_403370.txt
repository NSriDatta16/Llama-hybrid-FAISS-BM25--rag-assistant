Design of experiments (DoE) is most often used with regression (or ANOVA)-like models, machine learning here is a red herring, if your intended model is regression-like (including classification, maybe you should look into logistic regression), then surely you can use DoE. But to say much more, we need more details of your setup. But I would maybe start looking into fractional factorial designs. Some similar posts here with answers is Machine Learning for optimization of configuration file and Is factorial experiment used only for prediction (regression or classification)? . Then search this site.
