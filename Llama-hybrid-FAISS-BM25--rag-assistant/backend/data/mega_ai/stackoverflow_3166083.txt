It is not possible to disable the bundle cache, it is required by the framework. You can configure it to be cleaned each startup (org.osgi.framework.storage.clean) or you can try to use the approach referenced in your URL to create your own bundle cache. Those are your only options, other than hacking on the framework code itself. The bundle cache has changed a little bit since the info referenced by URL was written, so it is not clear if there was an impact on the approach.
