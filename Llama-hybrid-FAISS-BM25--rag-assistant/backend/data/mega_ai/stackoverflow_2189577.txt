Simple File I/O in C++ - Never Exits This Loop?

I'm a programming student in my second OOP class, my first class was taught in C# and this class is taught in C++. To get our feet wet in C++, our professor has asked us to write a rather large program with File I/O. The problem is, I have a small part of my program that is not working, at least, not for me. The project requires that we code a loop to test if the file could be opened successfully, and the loop I have written doesn't seem to be working. I don't get any compiler errors, but when I enter in the path to the file, either relative or absolute, it says it's invalid. I have a feeling it has something to do with my conditions in my do-while loop, but I can't pinpoint it. I don't mean to bring my homework to SO, but I've been scratching my head for two+ hours, and I can't seem to figure this out. Would you mind helping me fix my loop? And maybe explain what it is that I'm doing wrong? I want to learn. Thanks! Code: Rainfall rData; ifstream actualReader; ifstream averageReader; string aRDataLoc; char response = 'a'; const int KILL_VALUE = 1; double actualRainfallD; double actualRainfallPassedArray[ARRAY_CAPACITY]; double averageRainfallPassedArray[ARRAY_CAPACITY]; int i = 0; do { actualReader.clear(); cout > aRDataLoc; actualReader.open(aRDataLoc.c_str()); if (!actualReader.is_open()) { cout > response; if (response == 'n') { exit(KILL_VALUE); } } }while (!actualReader.is_open() && response == 'y');
