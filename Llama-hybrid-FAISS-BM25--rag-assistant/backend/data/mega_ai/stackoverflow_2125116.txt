There are a lot of similar questions on StackOverflow already, for example, Can someone please give an example of 1NF, 2NF and 3NF in plain english? Look in the Related sidebar to the right for a bunch of them. That'll get you started. As for your specific questions: Normalization saves disk space by reducing redundant data storage. This has another benefit: if you have multiple copies of a given entity attribute in your database, they can get out of sync, while if you have a normalized database and use referential integrity, this cannot happen. The INSERT statement references only one table. A TRIGGER on the insert statement can add rows to other tables, but there's no way to supply data to the trigger other than those columns in the table that spawned it. When you need to insert dependent rows after inserting a row to the parent table, use the LAST_INSERT_ID() function to retrieve the auto-generated primary key value of the last INSERT statement in your session.
