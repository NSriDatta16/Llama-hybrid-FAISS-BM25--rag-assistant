Is this a web server you're talking about? If so, then normal web requests have a User-Agent string in the HTTP header. You can check this value to see if the request is coming from an iPhone. If it's not coming from an iphone, you can reject the request, or redirect the user to a page explaining that your website is only for iphones.
