Typically the OS interface for "temporary files" (eg tmpfile() / tmpnam() ) actually creates storage inside the disk cache so that the operations go to memory and not to disk (up to a certain limit). It's not a perfect solution in that it relies on the OS rather than explicitly creating a file-like buffer inside the process space, but it's probably the easiest one. tmpnam() is the generic C stdlib interface, but various OSes may have their own methods of doing what you want more precisely. For example, Windows has GetTempFileName() .
