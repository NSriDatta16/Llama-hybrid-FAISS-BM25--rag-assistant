As others have pointed out, jQuery is a library (for toying with DOM mostly), Mootools (1.2) is a full fledged javascript framework that allows you to organize your code in an object oriented fashion and thus keeping it easy to maintain. I recommend you read this to really know what each one really is (jqueryvsmootools.com) And this other link, so you know how to get best from both worlds ;): http://ryanflorence.com/object-oriented-jquery-with-mootools-pigs-take-flight/ In the end it boils down to what you need. My general recommendation: if you need to grab some quick snippets and fancify your web application jQuery alone is good; if you are going to center your development in javascript, you should really try mootools: the code will scale and you should better be ready. To upgrade your code from Mootools 1.1 you can use the upgrade helper, it will help you identify the code in conflict through the javascript console (mootools.net/blog/2009/12/31/mootools-1-1-upgrade-layer-beta/) [Sorry for posting only 1 active link, this is my first answer]
