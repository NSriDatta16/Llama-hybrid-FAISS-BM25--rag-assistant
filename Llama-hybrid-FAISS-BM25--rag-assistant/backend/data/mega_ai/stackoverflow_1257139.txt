custom controls, dynamic creation

I've created a custom control in asp.net, if I drag it onto another web page it works fine, as expected, however I want to use it dynamically as in Dim lCustomControl as new cldButton However I can't work out how to do this, the compiler does not recoginise the cldButton as a control.I will add it to the page latter in the code. I've added the following to the web.config. But it seems to make as much differance as my typing is making Thanks
