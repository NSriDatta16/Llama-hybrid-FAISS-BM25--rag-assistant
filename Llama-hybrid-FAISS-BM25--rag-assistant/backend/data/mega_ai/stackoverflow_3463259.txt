Changing Image quality for the iPhone 4 users in an iPhone app

I want to display an image to my users which is larger than the screen area and will overscroll to let the users drag it around and zoom in. Do I need different images with different dpi for iPhone 4 users because of the higher resolution? Or can I just set the zoom level differently depending on device?
