HTML5 drag and drop file upload with multiple target drop areas on a page

Are there any Javascript solutions to allow HTML5 drag and drop upload to multiple targets on a web page? Example Five different folders on a web page and the user can simply drag files and drop in target folder to upload it to that folder. So far, I got drag and drop uploading done to single target. But I would like something that works with multiple targets on the page. As well has queueing options so not all files are uploaded at once which might jam server. Solutions I am looking at are: http://code.google.com/p/html5uploader/ http://www.uploadify.com/ http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload
