Add UITabBar Control!

I m stuck in a really simple problem. And i m afraid my question might annoy some people. The problem i am facing in short is that i want to add UITabBar Control to my iphone application other than the main screen. Let me explain, I have done everything successfully Added UItabbar control from IB in the main window's xib, added a variable at the back end , associated it by dragging the line. Also added a UIWindow variable and wrote these lines . [window addSubview:tabBarController.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; when i launch the application a blank window appears and tab bar shows on its bottom. But the problem is dont want the tab bar to be displayed on my 1st screen ( or Main Screen whtever u call it). Its actually the 3rd ,4th screen of my app where i want the tab bar to be displayed on the bottom. Its so strange that TabBar control variable are added in the app delegate files of the application.Can anybody help ? Thanks! Taimur
