Javascript removeChild() and appendChild() VS display=none and display=block|inline

I'm developing a web application that shows some controls and descriptions dynamically (I don't want to use jQuery or other libraries). At this moment i make appear and disappear controls using: element.setAttribute("style", "display : inline"); and element.setAttribute("style", "display : none"); but i'm thinking about using: element.appendChild(childRef); and element.removeChild(childRef); So, which one is the best solution in terms of system speed and elegance of the code? Or is there a better way to go about this?
