REST's 'resource communication mechanisms' and 'on-the-fly' improvement of a client's knowledge of them

I'm trying to come to terms with REST, as defined by Roy Fielding. Recently I've been trying to wrap my mind around: http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven The concept I'm interested in is in this quote: The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the clientâ€™s knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand). Specifically, what is knowledge of "resource communication mechanisms", how is that knowledge described in documentation/specs and realised in an implemntation? Then, how best to improve that knowledge 'on-the-fly'? I think I understand addressing 'the client's knowledge of media types'. I have some guesses (PUT,GET, etc.) but would appreciate any suggestions, examples or pointers to RESTful API's that explicitly adress the issues in that quote. If it helps I'm thinking about these issues in the context of HTTP+JSON, I appreciate REST isn't limited to HTTP+*. The Sun Cloud API has previously been cited as good RESTful design, I couldn't see where or how it addressed these specific issues - maybe a case of not seeing the wood for the trees? Clarification: What puzzles me is if PUT,GET,etc. are these mechanisms, this suggests a client knows which to apply to specific hyperlinks within some , and this seems fragile, and might suggest hypertext-links map (directly) to resources.
