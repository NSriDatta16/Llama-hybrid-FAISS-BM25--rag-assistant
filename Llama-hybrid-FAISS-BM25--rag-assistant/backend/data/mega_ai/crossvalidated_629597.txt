Your question is primarily concerned with $P(Y|A)$ where Y is allowed yards for your QB of interest and you condition that probability on the opposing team's historic allowed yards. The comments on your question are correct that there is a lot of unknown variables or model decisions here, but if you are comfortable either assuming things for convenience of calculation or with being representative of the uncertainty, then you can probably still get a model for it with varying certainty. If you know this QB gets >= 282.5 yards 53% of time unconditional on opposing team (averaged), then a question is what is the distrib of passing yards for a player? It may be fine to assume Gaussian for Y if they always perform similarly each time independent (enough) of the opposing team and other external factors. Given the (very small amount of) data, the assumed model, and an accepted 53% prob at that point, you can construct a Gaussian for Y that satisfies the data and probability constraint. Fit a Gaussian whose 53% of cumulative prob is at the 282.5 yards and hold that as true as you find the sample standard deviation given that constraint. The result can serve as Y. The same Gaussian assumption could then apply to A for the opposing team. Similarly fit it the best you can with the data available and fill in any variables with best guesses or use em as parameters to explore possibilities. You then may think of that as two opposing forces Y vs A and so you can think of how they would interact to one another. With our assumption of Gaussians, you could take the convolution and get a resulting Gussian that would indicate the probability of passing yards Y given team's allowed yards A. Y * A Then you could do your z score test and it at least incorporates all the information at the cost of what may be a naive model.
