You can find many datasets here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html They are not especially for neural networks but you can look for those that fit your case. I have worked with the set air foil noise: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise And tried a simple adaline and an MLP obtaining great results. Hope it helps
