I don't think that "form feeds" are treated as page breaks by MigraDoc automatically. The output probably looks better if you process the text file anyway (e.g. treat single CR/LF as spaces only, treat empty lines as new paragraphs, etc.). It could even make sense to ignore the form feeds - the text files probably weren't made for proportional fonts. If you use proportional fonts with MigraDoc (e.g. Arial), the documents could fit on a smaller number of pages.
