should I use n-1 dummies variables or all variables for a multinomial logistic regression?

Recently I have been working with gut microbiome data, like abundance and its metabolic content (but for purposes of the question this may be indifferent). I'm inexpert in the field of multinomial logistic regression and also in how to report it in a scientific paper. I'm working in R (the one_hot() to convert my categorical independent variables to one hot and multinom() for generate my model), with a sample of 402 individuals (213 for healthy or control or reference group, 56 group 1, 50 group unhealthy 2, 44 group unhealthy 3, 39 group unhealthy 4), the scope of my analysis is to identify those interactions of bacteria (3 types of interaction: cooperative, competitive, no interaction) that are related to each group and how much does each bacterial interaction contribute to describing each group. I used the 5 groups of individuals as response or dependent variable, and the bacterial interactions as predictors or independent variables. And for my final model I just keep those independent variables that has a p My issue: In the beginning, I set it as an independent categorical variable without converting it to dummies in the "multinom()" function. For that model, I saw that "multinom(status~. , data = df_categorical) " generates 2 dummies variables (n-1) for my categorical variable with 3 categories. I got a 73% of accuracy for that model. Then I select a different set of 2 dummies and I got 74% of accuracy with "multinom(status~. , data = df_onehot_coperative_and_competitive)". Then I tried using the 3 dummies in my model and a got 75% with "multinom(status~. , data = df_onehot_cop_com_non)". The way I see the accuracy is by dividing the number of right classified individuals by my model by the total number of individuals. I don't use all my data to training the model and all the data to generate the predictions because I just want to describe my sample data by the independent variables. I found on the web that the right thing is to use n-1 dummies to generate a model, but I was expecting to get the same accuracy in every selection of dummies. My questions: 1.- am I getting the wrong result? or why do I get a different accuracy? 2.- should I keep the 3 dummies for the best accuracy? 3.- If I use just 2 of my 3 dummies variables, how can I interpret the beta coefficients respecting the missing dummy? (because I want to interpret the model based on its beta) 4.- if I got some not statistical significant dummies (2 of the 3) should I remove them? should I generate a new model with just the significant dummies? If you could attach your source I would be very grateful, but it is not necessary
