You might want to check out the literature on so-called 'double hurdle' models (Cragg, 1971). One example application of this is in Chalupka's econometric model (c.f. Chaloupka, 1999) of rational addiction (i.e. how do microeconomic actors make valuation decisions around cigarettes, when these goods are addictive). Depending on your application, zero-inflated models may also present some attractions. References Cragg, J. G. (1971). Some Statistical Models for Limited Dependent Variables with Applica- tion to the Demand for Durable Goods. Econometrica , 39(5):829–844. Chaloupka, F. J. and Warner, K. E. (1999).
