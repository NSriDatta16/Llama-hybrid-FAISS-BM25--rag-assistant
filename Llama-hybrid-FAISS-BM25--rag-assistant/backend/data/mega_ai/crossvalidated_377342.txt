What you're describing seems to fall under image segmentation . There are many algorithms for it, some listed on wikipedia page (actually some of them perform clustering on pixel values). If you're interested in using deep learning for that, you can check out kaggle, since there are many competitions on segmentation, and you can find architectures and pretrained models there. If you're interested in Python, you might want to check out scikit-image. It even has a tutorial on image segmentation .
