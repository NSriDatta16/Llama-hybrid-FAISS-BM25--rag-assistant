I think you are on the right track. The essence of it is that an SVM adds dimensions and places the data in that new space - possibly infinite in number of dimensions - and looks for the hyperplane that best separates. In practice, some vectors get lightly weighted. I view it as 'inbuilt' in that - unlike a neural net - it doesn't have to hunt hoping to find a solution; there either is such a hyperplane or there isn't. However, how and what happens depends a great deal on the kernel you choose and how it is tuned. A great lecture is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHsErlPJWUU
