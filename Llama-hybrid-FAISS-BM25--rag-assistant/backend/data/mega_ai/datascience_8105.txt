What commercial software should a data scientist purchase?

I am setting up a work computer and have free reign here. My typical go-to software packages are all freely available, such as Rstudio and Anaconda. I have thought about investing in commercial BI software such as Tableau or Spotfire, but nobody else in the group (or myself) is a proficient user. Are there other obvious choices I am missing? At the outset, much of what this group is working on will be exploratory. They are needing some justification to invest further into "data science".
