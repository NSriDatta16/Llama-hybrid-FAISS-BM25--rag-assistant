You could also look at Java3D ( https://java3d.dev.java.net/ ), which would be an elegant solution if your server architecture was Java-based already. I'd also recommend trying to get away with a software-only rendering solution if you can - trying to wrangle a whole lot of server processes that are all making concurrent demands on the 3D rendering hardware sounds like a lot of work.
