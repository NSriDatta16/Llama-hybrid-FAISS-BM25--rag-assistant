Neural Network border condition or extrapolation data

I was reading the user guide of NN for Matlab and I found this quote about extrapolation data: It is important that the data cover the range of inputs for which the network will be used. Multilayer networks can be trained to generalize well within the range of inputs for which they have been trained. However, they do not have the ability to accurately extrapolate beyond this range, so it is important that the training data span the full range of the input space. My concern is about testing (or validating) some observation located near the outside boundary that probably increase the error. So in that cases I was thinking don't evaluate this observations. By the way, in my problem I have few data so the model it's more sensitive to outliers. Someone know an article or some explanation about this?
