Maybe use an adaptation of J-Charts and/or Market Profile charts , but instead of plotting price (y-axis) vs volume (x-axis) you could plot time of trade (y-axis) vs no. of trades (x-axis) and use colours to delineate different trading days or averages of no. of trades at these times for different look back periods.
