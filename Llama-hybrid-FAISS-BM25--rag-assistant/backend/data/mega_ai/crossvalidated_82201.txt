Leave-one-out cross-validation for MLR

I am doing cross-validation using the leave-one-out cross-validation method (total 10 runs). I have predicted $\hat{y}$ and observed $y$ from all the runs. I have applied the following equation to calculate $R^2$. Can anyone please confirm whether I am doing right? I am confused because the $R^2$ value appeared negative. \begin{align} SSE&=∑(y-\hat{y})^2 \\ SST&=∑(y–\bar{y})^2 \\ R^2&=1-(SSE/SST) \end{align} (N.b., $\bar{y}=$ is the average of $y$.)
