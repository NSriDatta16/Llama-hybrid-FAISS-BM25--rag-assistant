Dummy Variables and Learning algorithms

Suppose a predictor variable $x$ is nominal/categorical with three levels: $1,2,3$. Thus we create two dummy variables $x_2$ and $x_3$ with level $1$ as the reference variable. Let $y$ be a binary response variable. Then a logistic regression model could be: $$ \text{logit}(p) = \beta_0 +\beta_1 x_{2} + \beta_{2}x_{3}$$ In SVMs and decision trees, is it necessary to create the dummy variables $x_2,x_3$ for $x$? Or can we just keep it as is?
