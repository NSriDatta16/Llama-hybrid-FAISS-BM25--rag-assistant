yes, you can do it all in Java, if there are something that must be done in C , you have JNI package through which you can call 'dangerous' routines. Java grants you robustness, security model,scalability is not big issue... you don't have to cope with 64 bit OS, or optimizing your code to take advantage of multiples CPU-s, you will find it odd but true: your software might run faster in Java than in C. If you are not average developer, if you are familiar with CPU structure, understand machine code and handling with registers thorughly, then forget my text, you might have it done better in C.
