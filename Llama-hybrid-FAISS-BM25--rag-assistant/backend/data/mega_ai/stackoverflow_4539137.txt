receiving data after curl_easy_perform

I have the following question: how can i write data returning with http-response in char * buffer? I've found several approaches: use CURLOPT_WRITEDATA or CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION . but CURLOPT_WRITEDATA requires file pointer ( FILE * ). use of CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION with callback function seems to me as quirk... use curl_easy_send and curl_easy_recv . but in this case i'll need to write all POST headers with hands... Is there some other, more elegant approach? e.g. pass char * buffer pointer into some function to get http response in.
