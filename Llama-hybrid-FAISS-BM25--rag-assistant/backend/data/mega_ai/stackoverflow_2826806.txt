How do I retain the state of a data input screen on a ASP.NET Page using ExtJs Controls

My Client has an application that is built in ASP.NET (c#) that makes use of a lot of ExtJS controls. I need to enable the application to save every thing on the entry screen to a temporary storage mechanism and when necessary restore it. The scenorio is the user has captured some data to a specific screen but is unable to continue and then there session expires. If this happens and the user then logs in, it needs to restore there data/ Are there any good ideas I can investigate this type of thing. I would like to make it as simple and robust as possible. Thanks
