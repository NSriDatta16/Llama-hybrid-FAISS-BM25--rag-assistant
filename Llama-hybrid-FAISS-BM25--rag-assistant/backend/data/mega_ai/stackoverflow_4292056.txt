How can i indent my html file with vim correctly?

I set up the indentation in my vimrc in the following way: set tabstop=2 set shiftwidth=2 set autoindent set indentexpr set expandtab I created the indent folder in my ~/.vim/ directory and pasted an html indentation-plugin into ~/.vim/indent/ . I'm using the following one: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2075 Whenever i try to "gg=G" in normal-mode it deletes all the indentation instead of indenting the file in a proper way. JavaScript files for example work nicely with another indentation plugin i have found, but nomatter which html plugin i have used so far, it didn't really work in a useful way. Is there anything i can do here? /////////////// Update: i just tried to change the filetype to xml and it began to work. Now i'm asking myself how i can get this to work with html files. Hope someone can help me out. Heading
