The most likely problem is that your numeric data is being interpreted as a string. From the API.txt : Note that to simplify the internal logic in Flot both the x and y values must be numbers (even if specifying time series, see below for how to do this). This is a common problem because you might retrieve data from the database and serialize them directly to JSON without noticing the wrong type. If you're getting mysterious errors, double check that you're inputting numbers and not strings. So either force your data to numeric types on the PHP side, or do it in javascript, perhaps with . Number(some_data)
