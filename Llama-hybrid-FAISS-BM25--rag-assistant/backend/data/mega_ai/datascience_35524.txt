As far as I can tell, every pixel is considered a feature, so reducing the number of pixels would definitely affect the features. What you really mean is how to reduce the size of the image without losing out on the most important features or most important feature patterns. It's hard to tell but worth trying a few experiments. 1) Bicubic interpolation ( imresize in MATLAB does this ) 2) Add pooling layers before you start convolutions 3) Pyramidal pooling- as far as I know, this works well. Here's a link 4) As explained in the previous answer you could try dimension reduction such as PCA which is linear or you could try something like t-SNE which is non-linear.
