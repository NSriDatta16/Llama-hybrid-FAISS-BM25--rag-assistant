This really shouldn't be that hard. Markdown does not support the following syntax; h1. Header p. Paragraph ... so you simply scan for that to check if it is textile. Very simple regular expression to get you started (scans for lines beginning with hX. or p.) in PHP code: if (preg_match('/^(p|h[1-6])\. /m', $subject)) { // Successful match } else { // Match attempt failed } You will probably be able to write your own regex to scan for Markdown.
