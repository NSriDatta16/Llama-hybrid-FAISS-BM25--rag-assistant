Parameter selection in multiple kernel learning

I just got to apply multiple kernel learning to my data recently. I have data from three sources, so I want to learn three RBF kernels for each data source. But the MKL algorithms so far I know assume that the kernel parameters and the cost are fixed. When I used SVM with single RBF kernel before, I need to make a grid search for two variables (gamma and C) and do cross validation as well. I wonder how people in the application field usually deal with the kernel parameters. Take an n+1 dimension exhaustive search for n kernels? Use heuristic? Or make it into a convex problem to solve? Is there any method or tool related? Thanks.
