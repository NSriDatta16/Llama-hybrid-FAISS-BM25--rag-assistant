The only thing that I can think of right now is for you to save it as an html which will give you a tag for every paragraph. Then you can get the begining of each paragraph text and used that to find the first starting position of each paragraph on the original document. Also, you can do a Selection.Find and search for "^p" which is a paragraph mark.
