Interesting point. I hadn't really thought about this. I tend to put frequently-accessed functions at the top (utility functions, and such), as they're most likely need tweaking. I don't think organization is particularly important, as I can find any function quickly. I don't scroll through my file to find a function; I search for it. In C++, I do expect that the functions in the .cpp file are in the same order in which they're declared in the .h file. Which is usually constructors, followed by destructors, followed by primary/central functionality functions, followed by utility functions.
