Has YouTube broken IFrame embedding on iPhone?

We've been using YouTube's iframe embedding for videos. All is fine; execpt on iPhone. On the iPhone the video placeholder image gets stretched about twice as high as it should be. Playing the video results in the message 'You need to update your Adobe Flash Player...' - which surely can't be right? This was working fine about a week ago. I'm currently testing on an iPhone 4 with 4.3.1 - but have also tested on an iPad 4.2.1. My example clip I'm testing with is here: http://wexion.net/posts/youtube_iframe_test The HTML for that page is just the following, but it's the same issue happens if I put it on a 'proper' page. Does anyone else have this issue? Know what's going on? Or/and have a possible fix?
