Is it good to use a logistic reg if I combine many factors into p and many other into 1-p?

I have a large survey sample. I have a question like "What is your level of satisfaction with ...". It should be my outcome variable. Each respondent can give a unique answer of one of this possibilities: 1. Very Good 2. Good 3. Bad 4. Very Bad 5. Don't know My predictor variables are: Gender (factor and nominal): Male vs Female Age (numeric) Country (factor and nominal): Germany Switzerland France Italy Time the respondent visit the exhibition assuming the exhibition runs its 3d year (factor and ordinal): 1 time 2 time 3 time Is it a good way to use a logistic regression, for instance if I put Very Good and Good as success , and Bad Very Bad and Don't know as failure ? Otherwise, should I use another test? If yes which one?
