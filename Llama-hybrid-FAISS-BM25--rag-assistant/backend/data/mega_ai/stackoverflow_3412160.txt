You have to check at least all the fields used by .hashCode() so objects which are equal do have the same hash. But you can check more fields in equals, its totally fine to have different objects with the same hash. It seems your doing SCJP 1.6? This topic is well covered in the SCJP 1.6 book from Katherine Sierra and Bert Bates. Note: thats why its legit to implement a useful .equals() while returning a constant value from .hashCode()
