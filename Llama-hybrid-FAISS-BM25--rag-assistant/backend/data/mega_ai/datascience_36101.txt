How to use a CNN to predict free space in a 2d environment with obstacles?

When given a image(300 x 300) with obstacles(Basic 2D shapes) I want to predict 10 coordinates values in the image that will not collide with the obstacles using a CNN. For now I am giving the coordinates of those 10 points(as train labels) like following [[x11,x12, ..., y11,y12..], [x21,x22,... , y21,y22...]] And I trained the nw but predicted label values are not close to the original one. IS There a different approach I can take to find the coordinates of those 10 points with a CNN?
