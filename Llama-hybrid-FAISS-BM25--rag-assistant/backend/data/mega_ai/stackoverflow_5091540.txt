itextsharp measure chunk width / height

I am trying to do some precise alignment with iTextSharp, but I keep falling short as I can't figure out a way to get a width / height value for a chunk or paragraph. If I create a paragraph that is a certain font and size and text, then its dimensions should be known, right? I know that the default left/right/center alignments will do the trick for me mostly, but I have scenarios where knowing the dimensions will be most useful. Any ideas?
