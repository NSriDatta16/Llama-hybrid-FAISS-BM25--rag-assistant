Question about the distribution of the average of Dirichlet-distributed random variables

Suppose that each in a set of $n$ random variables $\boldsymbol{X}_1, .., \boldsymbol{X}_n$ are Dirichlet-distributed with parameters $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i$ , where $i$ is an index for the random variable. I have an intuition that the average of these random vectors are also Dirichlet-distributed with parameters $\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i$ . i.e., the element-wise average of the Dirichlet distribution parameters across all random variables $i$ . Am I correct?
