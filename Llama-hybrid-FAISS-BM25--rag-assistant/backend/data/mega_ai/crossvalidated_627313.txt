Obviously there is a perfect correlation between 'noise' time series and the noise part of 'net_signal', however, the 'noise' timeseries might also explain some variation in 'signal' time series which is also part of 'net_signal'. Have you checked linear dependence between the time series 'noise' and 'signal'? I would be interested what would be the result if you made sure that 'noise' and 'signal' were independent by forcing them to be orthogonal. Another problem is that you have added a vector of constant ones in the regression, this will make the 'denoise_signal' to have mean 0, which might not be true for the 'signal' time series.
