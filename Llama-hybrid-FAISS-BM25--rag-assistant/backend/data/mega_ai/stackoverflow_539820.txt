A) I play a MMO and do not support bots, voting down... B) Download Backtrack v.3, run an arpspoof on your default gateway and your host. There is an application that will spoof the remote host's SSL cert sslmitm (I believe is the name) which will then allow you to create a full connection through your host. Then fireup tcpdump/ethereal/wireshark (choose your pcap poison) and move around do random stuff to find out what packet is doing what. That will be your biggest challenge; but proxying with a Man in the Middle attack on yourself is the way to go. C) I do not condone this activity, this information is only being provided as free information.
