Principal components have a diagonal correlation matrix. That is, the components are uncorrelated, so "no confounding factors." This reduces standard errors of regression coefficients and precludes worrying about artifacts due to endogeneity. Unfortunately, PCA shifts the pressure to interpretation of the components. What are they, exactly, in some meaningful, domain-specific notion? This is generally fairly hard to elucidate, but if you can find an a priori reason to believe that the components should be mixed as they are, then that counts as a genuine aha moment -- a real discovery of interpretation. Incidentally, we should also use Hermite polynomials $\{1$ , $x$ , $x^2-1$ , $x^3-3x, \dots \}$ instead of the usual $\{1$ , $x$ , $x^2$ , $x^3, \dots\}$ for polynomial regression for the same reason: Hermite polynomials are orthogonal to each other in the same way that principal components are orthogonal to each other. We should but we don't, because, rather like principal components, they are too hard to explain to marketing.
