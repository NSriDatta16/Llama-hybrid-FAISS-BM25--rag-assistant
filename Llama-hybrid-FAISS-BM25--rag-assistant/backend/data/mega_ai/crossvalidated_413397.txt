Answering a question with Multivariate analysis - benefits of machine learning?

I'm doing an medical analysis examining the relationship between 20odd variables with a particular patient outcome. I've always run a multivariate analysis to answer these sort of questions, with the aim of developing a predictive model for identifying "at risk" patients. I'm trained in traditional statistics, and wonder if there's differences in machine learning algorithm. I can't find alot of information examining the exact methods that a ML algorithm uses, and wonder if it adds much above a well fitted traditional Multivariate analysis. Thanks for any input! Cheers Sing
