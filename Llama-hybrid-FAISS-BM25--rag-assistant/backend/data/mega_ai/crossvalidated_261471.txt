For the record, I don't view this as an answer, but just a long comment ! The PDE (heat equation) that is used to model the flow of heat through a metal rod can also be used to model option pricing. No one that I know of has ever tried to suggest a connection between option pricing and heat flow per se. I think that the quote from Danilov's link is saying the same thing. Both Bayesian Graphs and Neural Nets use the language of graphs to express the relations between their different internal pieces. However, Bayesian graphs tells one about the correlation structure of the input variables and the graph of a neural net tells one how to build the prediction function from the input variables. These are very different things. Various methods used in DL attempt to 'chose' the most important variables, but that is an empirical issue. It also doesn't tell one about the correlation structure of either the entire set of variables or the remaining variables. It merely suggests that the surviving variables will be best for prediciton. For example if one looks at neural nets, one will be led to the German credit data set, which has, if I recall correctly, 2000 data points and 5 dependent variables. Through trial and error I think you will find that a net with only 1 hidden layer and using only 2 of the variables gives the best results for prediction. However, this can only be discovered by building all the models and testing them on the independent testing set.
