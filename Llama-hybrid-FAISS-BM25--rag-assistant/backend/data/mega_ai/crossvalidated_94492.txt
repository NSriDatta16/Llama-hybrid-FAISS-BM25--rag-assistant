To restate your problem: you have certain variables in your dataset that describe "households," and you are hoping to predict the energy consumption of households based on their metadata. I would suggest you start by trying to a simple linear regression model (there are lots of other models you can try, but this is an easy one). I strongly suspect you will find the number of members of a household have a stronger effect on energy consumption than the average age of the household. If you are able to build a model that has a strong fit to your data, then you might focus your analysis on points with high residuals (large error terms, i.e. outliers to your model fit). You can consider these points "unlikely" under the description given by your model. You suggested applying clustering. I'm not sure what you are hoping to accomplish with clustering, but it's not unthinkable that it could be applied here. The thing is, I suspect your data doesn't group into discrete clusters: instead, your points probably fall along a spectrum. To apply clustering, you are basically saying: "Most of the members of my data fall into a small number of categories, so I'm going to represent my data by those categories." You can verify this graphically. Ignoring location, you only have three dimensions. Throw together some plots and see if it looks like clustering might be reasonable. I suspect it won't be helpful.
