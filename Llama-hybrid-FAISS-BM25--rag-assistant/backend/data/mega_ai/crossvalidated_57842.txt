KPSS test - output interpretation in stata

I did KPSS test for some variables in stata to check for stationarity; I want to interpret the the stata outputs, but I don't know how to do that. For instance, in the following case: KPSS test for mIlliq1 Maxlag = 13 chosen by Schwert criterion Autocovariances weighted by Bartlett kernel Critical values for H0: mIlliq1 is trend stationary 10%: 0.119 5% : 0.146 2.5%: 0.176 1% : 0.216 Lag order Test statistic 0 .557 1 .309 2 .229 3 .188 4 .162 5 .144 6 .129 7 .118 8 .109 9 .102 10 .0974 11 .0934 12 .0901 13 .0873 Maxlag = 13 chosen by Schwert criterion Autocovariances weighted by Bartlett kernel How Can I interpret this result? Does it mean that the TS is stationary or not? If it isn't, how can I can make it a stationary time series? Thank to everyone.
