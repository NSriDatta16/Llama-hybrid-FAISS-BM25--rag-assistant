As Majid stated in the comment, using AUC is causing this error as normally ROC curves are calculated for binary classification. Try removing the eval_metric line and your code will run properly. That or removing the watchlist and early stopping options. The eval metrics you need to use for multiclass are either merror or mlogloss which are the only ones specific for multiclass in the xgboost documentation .
