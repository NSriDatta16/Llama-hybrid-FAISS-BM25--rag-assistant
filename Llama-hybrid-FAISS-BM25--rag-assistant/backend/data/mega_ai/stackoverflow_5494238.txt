Kohana 3: How to route subdirectories in application/classes/controller

I'm quite new to Kohana and was wondering what the best way was of organising a lot of files in the application/classes/controller directory. My current structure is: -application --classes ---controller ----page -----test.php And I want to call the page from a url without it needing the page or optionally the name of any other subdirectory: www.website.com/test/ My controller class starts: What do I need to do to avoid the 404 error it is throwing? I assume I need to set up a route in bootstrap.php but I don't really get what to do to allow the pages to activate from within subdirectories. Thanks in advance.
