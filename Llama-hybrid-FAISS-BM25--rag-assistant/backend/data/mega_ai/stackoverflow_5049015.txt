If you are concerned about removing duplicates in $PATH, the most elegant way, IMHO, would be not to add them in the first place. In 1 line: if ! $( echo "$PATH" | tr ":" "\n" | grep -qx "$folder" ) ; then PATH=$PATH:$folder ; fi $folder can be be replaced by anything, and may contain spaces ("/home/user/my documents")
