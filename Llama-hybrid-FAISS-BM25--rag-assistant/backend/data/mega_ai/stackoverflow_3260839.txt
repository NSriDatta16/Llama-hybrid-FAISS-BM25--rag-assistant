Usually, you don't have to. Users who wish to re-arrange the windows can right-click the taskbar and choose the tile and cascade commands from the context menu. And I've seen TV commercials for Windows 7 showing that you can even just drag windows in a certain way to make them arrange themselves. If you still want to provide the command yourself, use the TileWindows and CascadeWindows API functions.
