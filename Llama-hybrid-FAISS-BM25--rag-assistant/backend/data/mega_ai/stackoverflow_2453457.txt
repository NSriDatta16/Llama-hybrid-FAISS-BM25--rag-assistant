How can I get notified when a UIView becomes visible?

Is there a way to get a notification, a callback or some other means to call a method whenever a UIView becomes visible for the user, i.e. when a UIScrollview is the superview of some UIViews, and the ViewController of such a UIView shall get notified when its view is now visible to the user? I am aware of the possible, but not so elegant solution of checking to which position the ScrollView scrolled (via UIScrollViewDelegate-methods) and compute if either one of the subviews is visible... But I'm looking for a more universal way of doing this.
