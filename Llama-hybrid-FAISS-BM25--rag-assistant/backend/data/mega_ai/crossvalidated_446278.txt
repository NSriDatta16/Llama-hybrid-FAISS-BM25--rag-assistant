Should I use One-Way ANOVA or Paired T-test in this data? What software can you recommend?

I am a beginner on Statistical analysis and I'm honestly not confident with the tools I'm choosing. I conducted an experiment on measuring a person's pulse rate using our project/ device and compared it with their ACTUAL pulse rates the results are given below: We want to know if the Measured values can be interpreted as "effective" (regarding the device) compared with the Actual Pulse Rates measured by a commercial oximeter. The average outcomes from the trials will be compared with the Actual pulses.
