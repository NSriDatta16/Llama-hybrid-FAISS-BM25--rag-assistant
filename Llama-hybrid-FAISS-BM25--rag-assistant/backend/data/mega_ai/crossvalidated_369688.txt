logistic regression vs. linear regression

in the following table (association between cognitive score and Folate intake), the beta coefficient represents difference in slope between different groups with the standard group. the interpretation of such data will present the change in the dependent value per unit change of the independent value? or something else? and the second question, is it appropriate here to use the linear regression not the logistic regression? or both of them are feasible?
