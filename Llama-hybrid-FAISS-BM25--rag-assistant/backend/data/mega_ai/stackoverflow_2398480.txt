First of all the folders you create in Xcode are simply organizational structures without any counterpart on the filesystem level. In other words all folders except for the "Classes" folder gets flatten out at the filesystem level. Therefore, even if you put your image file in the following location within xcode, it would still exist at the top-level in the filesystem: f1/f2/f3/f4/f5/image.png. Thus, in pathForResource method, you should not include the inDirectory argument. As for the second issue, mac osx doesn't recognize case-sensitive file names. Therefore, f1 and F1 are equivalent to mac osx and will reference the same file. You can easily see this by executing the following 2 commands at a terminal session: touch f touch F you'll notice that only 1 file exists after this: namely f. If you reverse the 2 commands, you still get one file, but it is named F.
