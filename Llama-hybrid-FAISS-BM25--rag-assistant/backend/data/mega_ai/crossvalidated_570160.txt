Using Pairwise Differences Between Two Conditions as Data (Bayesian)?

Suppose I have measurements for the expression-level of a "gene" from two groups of arbitrary (possibly different) sizes. Maybe one group is a control and the other treated. $x$ = and $y$ = The data are log-transformed (say base 2) and I am interested in modeling the fold change. I do not care about the means of the two groups. I could take the 12 unique pairwise differences between members of the two groups and obtain $d$ = which are the observed logarithmic fold changes. I am wondering whether or not it is legitimate to treat these pairwise differences as the data and then do inference? I'm not sure if this is a reasonable question to ask, but I strongly suspect there may be problem. If this is wrong, what is the reason? With a likelehood $p(d_i| \mu, \tau) \sim N(\mu, \tau)$ and some priors $\mu \sim N(0, 1)$ (precision) $\tau \sim Exp(0.5)$ I could estimate posterior distributions for the parameters $\mu$ , $\tau$ or I might be interested in the posterior predictive distribution. Clearly a toy example, but in some contexts I might have better prior beliefs about the fold change than the mean abundances of the two conditions. For example, I might strongly believe that most genes are not expressed differently between the conditions, while having almost no prior information about the log-abundance itself. Or maybe, for the raw abundances, the variance or precision are tricky to model and depend strongly on the mean abundance. If I had many "genes" measured in parallel, I might use a hierarchical model.
