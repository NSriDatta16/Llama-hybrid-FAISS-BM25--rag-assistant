Which statistical method can be used to compare the values of the same variables measured from different views?

I got a biological data set, where I need to run a statistical analysis on. The data was created on a mass spectrometer and contains the intensity values for around one hundred lipids. The analysis was done on five different types of blood (Plasma, Serum, EDTA Blood, DBS Finger and DBS Venous) from four persons at three different time points. All five types were gathered from each persons at each of time point. Each sample contains the categorical variable person (0,1,2 or 3), the date (date1, date2 or date3) and the type of used liquid. Additionally around one hundred different float values for the different detected lipids. The higher the number the more of the lipid is present. The general motivation behind the experiment is to test a new standard operation procedure for reliably detecting as many lipids as possible in a repeatable way. To add further value into this small test study we want to further analyse the data, aside from the sheer number of detected lipids. The first idea was to measure differences between the used types, e.g. EDTA should get throughout higher values than dried blood samples. At the moment the goal is only to measure if differences between the types are present, which there are, and not a non-inferiority analysis. Second, is the question of repeatability. Are the numbers for the lipids in one blood type mostly constant between the time points. This point could be problematic, because we only have three repetitions. For the first question I compared all samples of two types with a Wilcoxon signed rank test. For the second question I used a Friedman test to compare the different time points in one blood type. Both tests were done on the values of one lipid individually and the number of times H0 got rejected were counted. Is that a statistically correct way to test it? My background is machine learning and not statistics so I do not want to do something completely wrong.
