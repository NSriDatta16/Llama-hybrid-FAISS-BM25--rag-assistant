Testing significance of random effects in a linear mixed-effects model with interactions

I would like to test the significance of all interactions in a 3 factor linear mixed-effects model. Factors A and B are fixed, and factor C is random. Using lmer , the full model is: lmer(response ~ A*B + (1 + A*B|C), data.frame) My question concerns getting p-values for the 2-way interactions and the main effect of C. I initially planned to use likelihood ratio tests to compare this full model to reduced models by removing one interaction at a time. But of course specifying the 3-way interaction automatically includes the 2-way interactions and main effect of C. So I would like to know if there is a way to construct a reduced model that includes the 3-way interaction and omits only a single 2-way interaction (or the main effect of C). But of course the LR-test has its limitations. I would appreciate any advice on other ways to obtain p-values for random effects in this model. I am aware of RLRsim , MCMC, bootMer . Are any of these preferable/more feasible for my situation?
