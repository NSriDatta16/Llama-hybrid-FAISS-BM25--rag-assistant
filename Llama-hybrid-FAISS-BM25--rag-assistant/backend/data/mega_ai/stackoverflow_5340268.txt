Getting ILocalVariable from parsing VariableDeclarationStatement

i am parsing java source code with Eclipse AST parser and successfully can locate local variable as VariableDeclarationStatement . Problem is i need variable as ILocalVariable for usage of refactoring. In this case getJavaElement() doesn't work since local variables arent in Java Model. Any idea how to get it from there?
