Class is an object-oriented term. A class is a description of a set of objects, the common behaviour they have and the state they have. Classes can inherit state and behaviour from superclasses. To put this another way: Human is a class. Humans have state: Eye colour; Skin colour; Type and colour of hair; Height; Weight; and so on. and behaviour: Walk; Run; Swim; Eat; Drink; etc. Human has two subclasses in this example: Man and Woman. They have all the state and behaviour of Human but also some state and behaviour unique to each, like the obvious anatomical differences as state and behaviour as, for example, women can have babies. An object is an instance of a slass. To put this another way: Megan Fox is an instance of the class Woman. Being a Woman, she is also an instance of the superclass Human. As for Java, it generates one .class file for each class encountered when it compiles source code. Source files can contain multiple class files.
