Do I need to have studied econometrics to do time series analysis?

I have an undergrad degree in Economics and Management but my academic training/background in econometrics is insufficient, although I did study micro/macro economics and fundamental math and statistics for economics. I still struggle with advance math and statistics topics and do not have sufficient background in econometrics. I want to be able to do time series analysis and forecasting professionally. Is it possible for me? Any recommendations (books/resources) would be highly appreciated.
