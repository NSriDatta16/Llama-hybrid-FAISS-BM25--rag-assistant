Most Python methods that mutate a container in-place return None -- an application of the principle of Command-query separation . (Python's always reasonably pragmatic about things, so a few mutators do return a usable value when getting it otherwise would be expensive or a mess -- the pop method is a good example of this pragmatism -- but those are definitely the exception, not the rule, and there's no reason to make append an exception).
