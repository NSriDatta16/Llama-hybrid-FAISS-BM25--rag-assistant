Assuming SQL-Server based on @date, although the same can be applied to most databases. If your primary query is to select out a range of data (based on sample), adding, or altering the CLUSTERED INEDX will go a long way to improving query times. See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190639.aspx By default, SQL-Server creates the Primary Key as the Clustered Index which is great from a transactional point of view, but if your focus is to retrieve the data, then altering that default makes a huge difference. CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX name ON MarketPlan (LaunchDate DESC) Note: Assuming LaunchDate is a static date value and is primarily inserted in increasing/sequential order to minimize index fragmentation.
