I did one of these. It's actually how I ended up programming. I was responsible for maintaining a legacy, er... "database". I won't go into gory details but it was the usual evil application. The company pretty much ran on it, it would sometimes go down for days. At the time the IS director (a friend) was actively looking for replacements, talking to large consulting organizations, etc.etc. but management was committted/emotionally invested in the existing system. I volunteered (to the IS director) to try to rewrite is (well, more like he asked if anyone was interested in trying to deal with this mess and I volunteered because I was bored). We had no real programmers on staff, and I'd only written a few small ad-hoc things. I had no idea how little I knew. Finished the thing in about 8 months or maybe a year (this was a while ago, don't remember exactly). Was it successful? yes, worked as advertised. Were you found out? It initially started as a sort of super-secret, cloak and dagger thing. Kind of silly in retrospect, but it made it more fun. About halfway through it just started to become more obvious that that was what I was doing, and as it turned out the idea was supported. Writing this thing eventually became my job. Were you punished or rewarded? Rewarded How did you fund it? / How did you staff it? The success of it was pretty much due to the support of my boss, who made sure I had the time and resources I needed to do it. Was it formally adopted? Yes, we eventually ran the company on it.
