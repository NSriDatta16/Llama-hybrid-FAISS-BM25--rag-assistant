Spearman's rho is note a good idea here, it is more for looking at the correlation of two continuous variables. Assuming that assignment to the different prompts was done in a randomized manner, your example would seem like a classic case for using logistic regression (or if there is no further things to be taken into account Fisher's exact test, which is essentially exact conditional logistic regression). Logistic regression provides you both an effect measure (the odds ratio), measures of uncertainty around the effect measure (e.g. standard error, confidence interval) and a hypothesis test. If the assignment was not randomized (e.g. by self-selection), things become much more complicated and you may have to look e.g. into propensity score methods (e.g. logistic regression stratified by deciles of propensity scores).
