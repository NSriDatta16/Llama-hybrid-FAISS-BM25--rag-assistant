You could try cross-correlation analysis with R for example. Cross-correlation at lag h measures temporal dependency of two time series (x{t+h},y{t}) at lag h. If h In R cross-correlation can be calculated as follows: ccf(x series,y series,lags to show) Look spikes in the graph produced by this function/object call. EDIT: Raw time series must often be pre-whitened before ccf - analysis should be done. Pre-whitening can be done this way: 1) Create an arima model for series x{t} and save residuals. 2) Use previous model to filter series y{t} so that you get residuals. 3) Do ccf- analysis for the residual series. Why pre-whiten? Autocorrelation structures and need for differencing might demand that ccf - analysis should be done for the residual series and not to raw pre-filtered series.
