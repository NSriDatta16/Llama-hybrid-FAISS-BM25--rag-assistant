Skills hard to find in machine learners?

It seems that data mining and machine learning became so popular that now almost every CS student knows about classifiers, clustering, statistical NLP ... etc. So it seems that finding data miners is not a hard thing nowadays. My question is: What are the skills that a data miner could learn that would make him different than the others? To make him a not-so-easy-to-find-someone-like-him kind of person.
