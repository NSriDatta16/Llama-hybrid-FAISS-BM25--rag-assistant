Testing multivariate ARCH effects in R

Using the function MarchTest of package "MTS" in R, I am testing whether or not there are multivariate ARCH effects in my time series. I simulated some series without multivarate ARCH effects, so per definition there must be very high p-values. Running the MarchTest , there are high p-values only in small samples but they turn to 0 when the sample becomes bigger (1,000 or more observations). I am sure that there is no mistake in the construction of the time series. Does anyone have an idea why there are such misleading results? The underlying parameters are: p Then Y_t As you see, it is a pure VARMA process without any ARCH effects by construction. The output with 1,000 observations is: > MarchTest(Y) Q(m) of squared series(LM test): Test statistic: 35.62607 p-value: 9.758118e-05 Rank-based Test: Test statistic: 14.08036 p-value: 0.1693574 Q_k(m) of squared series: Test statistic: 138.9744 p-value: 0.0007122924 Robust Test(5%) : 100.2475 p-value: 0.215975 The output using the same parameters but only 50 observations is: Q(m) of squared series(LM test): Test statistic: 14.46804 p-value: 0.152693 Rank-based Test: Test statistic: 16.10272 p-value: 0.09672955 Q_k(m) of squared series: Test statistic: 92.35173 p-value: 0.4116147 Robust Test(5%) : 122.0541 p-value: 0.01385632
