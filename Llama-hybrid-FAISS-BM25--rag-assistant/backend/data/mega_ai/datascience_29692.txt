You could explicitly provide correlation as an nn input, as calculated in Local Correlation Tracking in Time Series , with code available via Vlad's Blog . I have also read a paper ( unfortunately I can't remember its title or names of authors for a google search ) where a prediction of future correlation is an explicit nn target as part of a multivariate target nn target. The authors claimed inclusion of correlation as a target improved the accuracy on the non-correlation part of the multivariate target.
