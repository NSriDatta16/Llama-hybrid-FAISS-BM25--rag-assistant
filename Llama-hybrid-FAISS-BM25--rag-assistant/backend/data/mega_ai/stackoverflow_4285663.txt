How to instill the TDD habit in a team

Possible Duplicate: How do I convince programmers in my team to do TDD? What are some of the best ways to encourage and instil the TDD habit into a team that has never used TDD? Can anyone share their experiences with the right and wrong way to get a team using TDD such that they find it effective and want to keep using it on all future projects?
