Answering my own question, I just wanted to draw attention to the TeX FAQ entry Typesetting pseudocode in LaTeX . It describes a number of different styles, listing advantages and drawbacks. Incidentally, there happen to exist two stylesheets for writing pseudo code in the manner used in "Introductin to Algorithms" by Cormen, as recommended above: newalg and clrscode . The latter was written by Cormen himself.
