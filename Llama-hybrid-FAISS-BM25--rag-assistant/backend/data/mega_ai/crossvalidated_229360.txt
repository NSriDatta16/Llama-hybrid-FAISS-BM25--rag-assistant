Is it possible to model using Bayesian Network (probabilistic graphical model) if you have no prior knowledge of the data?

Is it possible to model using Bayesian Network (probabilistic graphical model) if you have no idea at all of the interaction of the variables in the data? From my reading, I find that Bayesian network is very intuitive and aligns well with human reasoning. As such, I think that it should have a high performance. However, if one has no knowledge of the dataset, say a dataset for a hospital patients, how can one decide on the interaction between the nodes in the network? Or is this a big flaw of BN?
