Dynamic Time Warping and non-stationarity of time series

Dynamic Time Warping ( DTW ) computes the optimal alignment between points of two time series. If we consider two non-stationary time series (e.g. the first proportional to the second), is the DTW able to detect the similarity between the series although their non-stationarity?
