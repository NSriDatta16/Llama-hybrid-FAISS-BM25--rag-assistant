On a 32 bit windows OS , each process gets 4 GB virtual address space out of which 2 GB is available for user and 2 GB is for Kernel. So whatever allocations done should be within this 2 GB space. Note that this 2 GB contains other things such as the other dlls which are loaded by your application, so this memory is fragmented. When you do malloc(), since malloc guarantees that it returns a continuos block of memory the CRT will try to find 1 GB of continuos free memory which may not be avaiable, hence the malloc() fails. One way of solving this would be to use the memory mapped files and map only a portion of the required memory into your virtual address space.
