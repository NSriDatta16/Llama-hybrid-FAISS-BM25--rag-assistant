Your idea is a pretty good one, providing the interactive bits of the site are disabled - if you are uploading code/modifying databases then you don't want to introduce new data in that time due to the errors you might get. Another way would be to schedule a cron job (or simply wait till 12AM and do it manually) to upload/change all the things you want uploaded/changed. I can't really think of anything else right now - does magento have a way of disabling-while-updating? Thanks, James
