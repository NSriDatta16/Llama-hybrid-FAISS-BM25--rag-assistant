For the products I work with, customizations that are built either by the Services group for a given customer, or sometimes by the customers themselves, get shared to the rest of the team (for stuff we've made) and often get "productized" in later releases. We support a [nearly] full-access API which can be used to do [almost] anything the GUIs can do, but in an automated fashion. We encourage customers to write custom scripts and then share them back with us. Growing the available uses of a product through extensions, whether they be officially supported, or remain community tools, helps to engender goodwill amongst your customer base. For customizations we build, the initial work, while billed to a specific customer, can then be implemented rapidly elsewhere, allowing current and future users mroe flexibility when using the product.
