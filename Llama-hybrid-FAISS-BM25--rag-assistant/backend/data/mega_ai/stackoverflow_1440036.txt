My answer assumes you are using the TreeMap implementation of SortedMap . 1.) If using TreeMap , you have a choice. You can either implement Comparable directly on your class or pass a separate Comparator to the constructor. 2.) Example: Comparator cmp = new MyComparator(); Map map = new TreeMap (myComparator); 3.) Yes that's correct. Internally TreeMap uses a red-black tree to store elements in order as they are inserted; the time cost of performing an insert (or retrieval) is O(log N).
