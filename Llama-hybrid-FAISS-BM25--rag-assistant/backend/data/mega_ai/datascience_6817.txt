Clasification - ROC Curve with very high number of false negatives

I have the following curve as the result of a azure machine learning classification experiment. This obviously shows a lot of false negatives, but I'm struggling to interpret this, as my data has a high number of negatives and a low number of positives (I'm doing a binary classification). I am interpreting this as saying my data is almost entirely made up of positive values, with the majority being identified as negative. I believe that the false negatives on the chart are actually true negatives. Am I reading the chart correctly?
