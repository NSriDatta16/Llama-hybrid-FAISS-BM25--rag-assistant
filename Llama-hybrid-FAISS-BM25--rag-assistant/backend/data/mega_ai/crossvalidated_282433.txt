Is this understanding of cross validation good?

I have fitted my model, checked the diagnostics, and it looks good. From wiki, I now understand that "cross validation" can be used to check the predictive accuracy of my model. How exactly does this work in practice? Say my original data is 1000 data lines. So I split it into 5 groups. Then I fit a model on each group, and test it on the other 800 data lines. So, far, so good. Then what? Every time I test it, what "statistic" do I compute? And after I do that 5 times, do I average that statistic? Or, do I do something else to measure the accuracy?
