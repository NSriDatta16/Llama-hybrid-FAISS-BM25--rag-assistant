I'll confess this isn't a domain I know very well, so take this with a grain of salt. First of all, note that what you are proposing doesn't yield such a simple algorithm: in order to compute the new $q^\star_i$, we don't need to compute a single expected value (like a mean or variance), but the expected value of a whole function. This is computationally hard and will require you to approximate the true $q^\star$ by some $\tilde q$ (for example, we might find a histogram approximation) But, if you are going to be restricting the $q_i$ to a small parametric family, a better idea might be to use stochastic gradient descent to find the best parameter values (see: Variational bayesian inference with stochastic search, 2012, Paisley, Blei, Jordan). The gradient they compute is very similar to what you wrote: they sample from all the approximations they are currently not optimizing. So what you propose isn't that simple, but it's quite close to an actual method that has been proposed very recently
