Different AIC values for the same SARIMA model in different R packages

I've been trying to run a simple time series model for a data set. My biggest question is when I run the auto.arima model (from package "forecast) for this data set I receive an output as follows mod1 mod1 Series: datSet ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,0,1)[12] Coefficients: ma1 sma1 0.5490 0.1047 s.e. 0.0506 0.0650 sigma^2 estimated as 42245: log likelihood=-1693.13 AIC=3392.26 AICc=3392.36 BIC=3402.84 I interpret the AIC value as being 3392.26, but my problem arrives when I assign the model through the sarima function (from package "astsa"): mod2 mod2$AIC [1] 11.67195 Unless I am doing/interpreting something wrong, I'm assuming both models would have been the same; so why is there such a drastic difference in the AIC values and which would I use in my time series analysis?
