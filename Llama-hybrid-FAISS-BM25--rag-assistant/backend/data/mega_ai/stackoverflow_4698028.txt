Just to add to Brian's answer but for a win32 framework that's more beginner friendly take a look at Win32++ . The library itself isn't as comprehensive in features compared to MFC or QT but that is a tradeoff the designer made at the beginning to keep the library easy to understand and simple to use. If you're still interested in this topic, I highly encourage you to take a look at it since it uses yet another technique for saving the 'this' pointer by utilizing thread local storage.
