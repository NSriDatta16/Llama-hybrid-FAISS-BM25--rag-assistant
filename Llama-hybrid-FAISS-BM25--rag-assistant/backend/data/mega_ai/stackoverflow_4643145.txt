Javascript / jQuery : Split content in two parts

I'm not sure if this can be accomplished with Javascript and any help or suggestions greatly appreciated. Here is a scenario: Let's say I have content (all text), that's 6 paragraphs long. The content is dynamically pulled from the database at once (meaning all 6 paragraphs are outputted through a single variable, so no way for me to change that). What I need to do is, show the first two paragraphs at the top of the page, then show some other content, then show the remaining paragraphs below the other content. So, content = 6 Paragraphs Paragraph One Paragraph Two SOME OTHER COOL STUFF IN BETWEEN Paragraph Three Paragraph ... Paragraph Six Is it possible to split this content with Javascript. The paragraphs are outputted inside p tags.
