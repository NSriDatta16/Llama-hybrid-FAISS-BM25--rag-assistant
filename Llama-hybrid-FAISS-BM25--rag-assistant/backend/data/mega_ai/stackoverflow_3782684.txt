Why not, it looks OK to me. The most convenient way of accessing request inside Form, that I know, is embedding it (i.e. Form) inside a function: def formX(request): class FormX(forms.Form): def clean(self): if not request.session.get('file_downloaded', False): raise ValidationError('File not downloaded!') return FormX ( Note that regarding clean(), this is pseudocode - I was writing out of my head and I probably don't remember details of form cleaning) Then in view you just write: def my_view(request): form = formX(request)(...)
