The field(s) of ML and DS are very broad. Some topics are related to "classical" statistics (which require good knowledge in standard algebra and matrix calculation), while other fields expand into computer science and programming. Things like image classification (or "computer vision") for instance have been developed mostly in the computer science community, while other predictive models (linear regression etc) are widely used in "classical" statistics. As the fields/topics in ML/DS are very diverse, you will eventually need to focus on some fields according to your needs and interests. However, a good starting point surely is " Introduction to Statistical Learning " (avaliable online) which also comes with R "labs" (also Python labs are available). In case you want to dive deeper into some topics, you may refer to " Elements of Statistical Learning ", which is more formal and allows you to go into more details. For Reinforcement Learning you may have a look at the introduction by Sutton and Barto . For more applied work related to neural nets, you may also follow the Keras Blog . Often links to various papers and other sources are provided, so that you can go into the details by topic if you are interested.
