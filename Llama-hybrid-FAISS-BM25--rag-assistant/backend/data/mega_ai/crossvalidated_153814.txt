Correlogram and ACF/PACF applied to US index of unemployment rate

This eviews workfile contains US index of unemployment from 1960 to 2008 quarterly. I'm trying to understand ACF and PACF. Below is a correlogram for the first 24 lags: What can the correlogram and ACF/PACF tell me about the data? To my understanding, the ACF applies to Autoregressive model while PACF is for Moving Average?
