Well, if you know that they will merge: Say you start with: A-->B-->C | V 1-->2-->3-->4-->5 1) Go through the first list setting each next pointer to NULL. Now you have: A B C 1-->2-->3 4 5 2) Now go through the second list and wait until you see a NULL, that is your merge point. If you can't be sure that they merge you can use a sentinel value for the pointer value, but that isn't as elegant.
