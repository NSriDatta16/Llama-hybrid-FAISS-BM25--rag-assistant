Rank advertisement and Score keywords used in advertisement based on its performance

I am trying to classify my advertisements and trying to understand which advertisement is performing better than others and why. Step - 1 : compare two ads based on CTR. The problem here is I am basically comparing 2 advertisements with different impressions, for example, ad-1 is having 100 impressions and 25% CTR, whereas ad-2 is having 50 impressions but 10% CTR, here I cannot compare both directly because ad-1 has got more CTR because the impressions are more(which means we have shown this more number of times), we can use basic math and try to figure for ad-2 by multiplying by 2 and making it for 100 impressions but is there a better way that we could potentially forecast the ad-2 based on impressions and predict CTR. Step - 2 : score the keywords in each. Here I am trying to score the keyword and tagline used in the image of ads(I have extracted them using AWS rekognition) but what is a good data science technique to score the taglines? sample dataset - ad-1 Date - ad name - audience type - ad type - Impressions - Clicks - Conersions - Taglines 02-12-2020 advertisement 1 sports generic 10000 100 50 (Play like star, It's never late, Dont give up) 03-12-2020 advertisement 1 sports generic 10000 130 60 (Play like star, It's never late, Dont give up) ad -2 Date - ad name - audience type - ad type - Impressions - Clicks - Conersions - Taglines 02-12-2020 advertisement 2 Kids generic 5000 100 40 (Whatever it takes, Play like a champion) 03-12-2020 advertisement 2 Kids generic 4000 50 10 (Whatever it takes, Play like a champion) Here is a screenshot of the data mentioned above Can someone please guide me on this
