I have been using plain GWT and I like very much the flexibility and the performance. On the other side, I miss a bit of organization of the information. Much of the topics are covered in scattered post in several forums and a lot of hacking is needed. IMHO there is not a clear concept to where this framework is going, and for what use. On the other side, Vaadin , which I have tested, has very interesting features, works very well righ out of the box, and is free, but the supporting community is much smaller. Flex looks very oriented to content display, while GWT, and its heirs (SmartGWT, Vaadin, ..) seems to preval for business-like applications.
