You can't use HASH Indexes with MyISAM or InnoDB. So, if you are using MEMORY or NDB (Cluster) storage (which you probably aren't), you can use HASH Indexes. BTree are more flexible (you can use to retrieve sorted data on index key, you can use to resolve ranged-queries) so, unless you have a very specific case (a EQUALITY-ONLY lookup query, on a special storage) just go for BTree.
