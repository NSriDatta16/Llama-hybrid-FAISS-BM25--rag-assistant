In the paper Y. W. Teh, D. Newman and M. Welling (2006), A Collapsed Variational Bayesian Inference Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation , NIPS 2006 , 1353â€“1360. a second order Taylor expansion around $x_0=\mathbb{E}[x]$ is used to approximate $\mathbb{E}[\log(x)]$ : $$ \mathbb{E}[\log(x)]\approx\log(\mathbb{E}[x])-\frac{\mathbb{V}[x]}{2\mathbb{E}[x]^2} \>. $$ This approximation seems to work pretty well for their application. Modifying this slightly to fit the question at hand yields, by linearity of expectation, $$ \mathbb{E}[\log(1+x)]\approx\log(1+\mathbb{E}[x])-\frac{\mathbb{V}[x]}{2(1+\mathbb{E}[x])^2} \>. $$ However, it can happen that either the left-hand side or the right-hand side does not exist while the other does, and so some care should be taken when employing this approximation.
