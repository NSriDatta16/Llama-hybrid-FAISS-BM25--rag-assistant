VirtualBox + Powershell?

I have created a virtual machine. Now I am trying to launch it using Powershell. I have searched all over the internet for any details on how to do that. This is the only code i found... #---------------------- $vBox = New-Object -ComObject VirtualBox.VirtualBox $vBox | Get-Member * $vBox.Machines $vBox.CreateMachine() #---------------------- (Source: http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/?p=1275 ) In fact, I cant find any documentation on the com objects on virtualbox.org. I am fiarly proficent with powershell, I spent some time exploring the com object with... $vBox | gm I tried every thing I could think of but only receive errors. My question is how do I launch my VM using Powershell Thanks
