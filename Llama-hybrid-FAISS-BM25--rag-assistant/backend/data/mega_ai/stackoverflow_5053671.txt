After having no time to work on it, I finally made some time. I came up with this: Data = dlmread('000-int.txt', '', 'A1..B10'); M = mean(Data) This reads only the first two columns of a file named "000-int.txt," and then takes the average. The problem now is that I can't figure out how to make it do this for 162 more files. Actually, it is a bit less since there are gaps in the numbering. I have no idea where to start from, as I could not find anything online. Thanks, and sorry for the delay and initial post that seemed like I was asking for someone to write my code for me. I was merely stating all the facts initially, so the readers/writers would have all the info necessary.
