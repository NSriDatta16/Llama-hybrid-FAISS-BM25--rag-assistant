It depends on the state of your disk and whether or not the DLLs might be used in other processes. A cold start happens when your program and its DLLs were never loaded before. An EXE without DLLs has a faster cold start since only one file needs to be found. You would have to have a badly fragmented disk that's almost full to not have this case. A DLL can start to pay off when it is already loaded in another process. Now the code pages of the DLL are simply shared, startup overhead is very low and memory usage is efficient. A somewhat similar case is a warm start, a startup where the DLL is still available in the file system cache from a previous time it was used. The difference between a cold and a warm start can be quite significant on a sluggish disk. The one reason that everybody likes a SSD.
