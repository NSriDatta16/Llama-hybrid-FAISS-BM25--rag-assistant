Maximum size when parsing XML with DOM

Currently I'm implementing a REST client which shall parse the XML response messages. It is intended, later, to be running on an Android device. Thus, memory and processing speed is quite an issue. However there will be only one XML response at a time so processing or holding multiple XML documents at a time is not an issue. As fas as I understood there are three ways of parsing XML with the Android SDK: SAX XmlPullParser DOM Reading about these different parsing methods I got that SAX is recommended for large XML files as it won't hold the complete tree in memory like DOM. However, I'm asking myself what is large in terms of kilobytes, megabytes, ...? Is there a practical size up to which it does not really matter whether using SAX or DOM? Thanks, Robert
