An elegant way of linking global methods and logging the results

Imagine I have a set of global methods that aren't associated with any specific classes. Each method takes exactly one object and returns exactly one object of various types. I want to be able to link these methods together so that the object returned by one method gets passed as a parameter to the next method and so on. Extension methods are the easiest and most elegant way I can think of for accomplishing this: var result = someObj.ExtensionMethod1().ExtensionMethod2().ExtensionMethod3(); However, I also have a log method which takes an object parameter and I want to pass the result of each method to this log method. For example: var result1 = someObj.ExtensionMethod1(); log(result1); var result2 = result1.ExtensionMethod2(); log(result2); var result3 = result2.ExtensionMethod3(); log(result3); Is there a more elegant of way of doing this so I won't have to create temporary variables to pass every time I call a method?
