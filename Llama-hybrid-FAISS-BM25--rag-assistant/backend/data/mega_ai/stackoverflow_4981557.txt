You can start by getting the HTML by using a WebClient : Dim client As New WebClient() ' Add a user agent header in case the ' requested URI contains a query. client.Headers.Add("user-agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.0.3705;)") Dim data As Stream = client.OpenRead(args(0)) Dim reader As New StreamReader(data) Dim s As String = reader.ReadToEnd() Console.WriteLine(s) data.Close() reader.Close() From here you can parse that string (s) looking for something that matches "BACKGROUDN-IMAGE: {*}" - someone else will need to chime in, my regex-fu is horrible. Regex.Matches() - MSDN
