Please have a look at my answer to the following question. What is the difference between a stationary test and a unit root test? Here is the most important part of the answer: If you have a time series data set how it usually appears in econometric time series I propose you should apply both a Unit root test: (Augmented) Dickey Fuller or Phillips-Perron depending on the structure of the underlying data and a KPSS test. Case 1 : Unit root test: you can’t reject $H_0$; KPSS test: reject $H_0$. Both imply that series has unit root. Case 2 : Unit root test: Reject $H_0$. KPSS test: don`t reject $H_0$. Both imply that series is stationary. Case 3 If we can’t reject both test: data give not enough observations. Case 4 Reject unit root, reject stationarity: both hypothesis are component hypothesis – heteroskedasticity in series may make a big difference; if there is structural break it will affect inference. Edit : In case 4 a more profound approach would be to apply a variance ratio test. The variance ratio test renders you a value between 0 and 1 if the data is "between stationarity and a unit root". As the variance ratio test does not only affirm or reject a null hypothesis, but gives you a continuous value it can capture mixtures in more detail. It may also give you insight to visualise the data.
