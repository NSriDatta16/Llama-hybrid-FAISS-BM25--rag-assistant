Logistic regression and Poisson regression are modelling different things. In the first one, you are modelling the logit of the probability that your dichotomous variable is 1, where you can estimate probabilities and odds ratios. With Poisson regression you are modelling expected frequencies in a cell, your output will be expected values. In this case you can compare the expected number of events given one profile versus another one. If your frequencies are events in some interval of space/time, you can model the rate and only in this case you can compare Relative Rates, also named RR . I don't think there's such estimation as a Relative Risk with Poisson Regression. Logit and Poisson regression are different models that apply to different views of the same scenario - depending on how you define your response variable Y. (With a binomial distribution in the first case and Poisson in the second) If you use Poisson regression, then provide results for that model, not only Relative Rates but also goodness of fit (use Deviance) and significance of effects (Wald test are ok).
