Mimicking the "rubber band" effect from iOS in the Gallery on Android

I've got a Gallery class showing a bunch of images in an Android app, but since only one image is ever displayed at a time, it is difficult for the user to see when they have reached the first or last image in the gallery. Is there a way to mimic iOS' "rubber band" effect, so that the user sees a bit of empty space when dragging the last image, and they release it, the image snaps back to the center of the view. Is this possible to do?
