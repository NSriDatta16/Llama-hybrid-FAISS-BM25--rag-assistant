Turn a string into a valid filename?

I have a string that I want to use as a filename, so I want to remove all characters that wouldn't be allowed in filenames, using Python. I'd rather be strict than otherwise, so let's say I want to retain only letters, digits, and a small set of other characters like "_-.() " . What's the most elegant solution? The filename needs to be valid on multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux and Mac OS) - it's an MP3 file in my library with the song title as the filename, and is shared and backed up between 3 machines.
