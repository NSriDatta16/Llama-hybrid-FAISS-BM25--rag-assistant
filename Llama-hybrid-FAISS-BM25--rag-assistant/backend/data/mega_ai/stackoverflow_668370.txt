You are getting a System.RuntimeType from [Math] because that is what it is. It's a Class type as opposed to an object of that particular type. You haven't actually constructed a [Math] object. You will get the same output if you typed: [String] | gm However, if you constructed a string object from the String type, you would get the string members: PS C:\> [String]("hi") | gm TypeName: System.String Name MemberType Definition ---- ---------- ---------- Clone Method System.Object Clone() CompareTo Method System.Int32 CompareTo(Object value), System.Int32 CompareTo(String strB) Contains Method System.Boolean Contains(String value) CopyTo Method System.Void CopyTo(Int32 sourceIndex, Char[] destination, Int32 destinationIn... etc... Since System.Math has only static members, you can't construct an object of it. To see it's members you can use the GetMembers() function of System.RuntimeType: [Math].GetMethods() You can use one of the format-* cmdlets to format the output: [Math].GetMethods() | format-table Edit: Oh, and I should add, to invoke one of the static members, you would do it like this: [Math]::Cos(1.5)
