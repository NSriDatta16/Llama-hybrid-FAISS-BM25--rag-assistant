jQuery UI Tabs: How to implement drag and drop AJAX reordering?

I am using the jQuery UI Tabs widget and would like to implement drag and drop reordering. I have a "display rank" value on each of those tabs which determines which order to display them in. I need to be able to save the order of those tabs when they are reordered, so I need to do some AJAX. Can you give me a brief tutorial on how I can achieve this? Or point me to a tutorial which explains how to do this?
