Migrating to WCF from ASP.Net 2.0 web services

I currently have a suite of .Net web services that are developed in ASP.Net 2.0. They don't utilize any WS-E extensions, rather they implement security at the application level. They are fairly straightforward data retrieval/update features. I am interested in re-factoring these web services gradually over time into WCF services, mostly to future-proof them against the deprecation of old framework versions. My main concern is the amount of re-coding that will need to be done in the client applications to re-connect with these services. Has anyone gone down this road already? Was it worth it? Can you recommend any reading materials that I can use to continue my research in this area?
