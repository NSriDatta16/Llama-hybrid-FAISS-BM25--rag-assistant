You could stick another span in there as a "fake" p tag: List item words words words that are "paragraph" 1 of List item different words that make up "paragraph" 2 of List item And in your css: #rightlist span span {display:block;margin:...} Note anything you declare for #rightlist span will apply to #rightlist span span , so you might need to override some of the rules in #rightlist span span .
