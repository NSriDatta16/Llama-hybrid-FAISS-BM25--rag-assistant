There's nothing fancy to it: just use two for loops, with the inner loop checking the month index ("Thirty days has September, April, June and November") and accounting for leap year (I believe this year is one), remembering ActionScript's Date object doesn't use zero-based indexes for days (though it does for months): 29) { break; } dates.push(date); } } for each (var d:Date in dates) { trace(d); } } ]]> Make sense? (If there's a more elegant way, I'm not aware of it.)
