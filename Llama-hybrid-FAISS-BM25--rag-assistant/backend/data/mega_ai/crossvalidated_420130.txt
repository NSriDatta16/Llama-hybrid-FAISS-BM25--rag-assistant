I can think of a number of reasonable seeming analyses: Exact stratified logistic regression with environment as a factor and repeated experiment as a stratum. Generalized linear mixed effects model (random effects logistic regression) with environment as a factor and a random effect for the repeated experiment. Either should give you an odds ratio.
