Error loading images in Signed Jar, JNLP Application

I am developing JNLP Application and using maven-webstart plugin to create JNLP. When running the application in my local, it works correctly but when I run in Tomcat Server using jnlp, it does not load images and also does not give any exception. I am loading images as below new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("/icons/save.png")) What is wrong with my code?
