[Model] Validators would work for you. Perhaps simplest, though, would be to use: class BaseOrganization(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length="100",) alias = models.SlugField() class Meta: abstract = True class Organization(BaseOrganization): pass class Division(BaseOrganization): parent_org = models.ForeignKey(Organization) class Meta: unique_together=['parent_org', 'alias'] Note: as with your current code, you could not have subdivisions of divisions.
