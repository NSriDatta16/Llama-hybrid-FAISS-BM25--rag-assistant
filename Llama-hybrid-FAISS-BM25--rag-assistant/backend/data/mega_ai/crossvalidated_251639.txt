First off, just to comment on terminology. Cointegration, just like correlation, is a relationship between time series. Spuriousness is usually used in the context of a "spurious correlation", and is not a property of the time-series themselves, but rather a property of a test statistic, in this case the correlation. For me it makes more sense to ask: can the correlation between two time-series can be spurious even if the time-series are cointegrated? 1: Despite @A. Webb's answer, which raises some valid points, the short answer to your question is no: according to Granger (2004), if the two time series are co-integrated, even if they both have stochastic trends, correlation significance tests are not going to be spurious. This is why he won the Nobel Prize in 2004. More precisely, testing for co-integration will fix the problem of spurious correlations arising specifically from the initial time series being I(1), i.e. having trends that confound the results. There are of course more general ideas of "spurious relationships", but this is a different idea. When it comes to "spurious correlation", a term that refers specifically to this particular problem, testing for co-integration indeed solves the problem. 2: Generally speaking, the two most common tests are the Johansen test and the Engle-Granger test. However, the Johanson test is usually favored in multi-dimensional situations such as VAR models. In contrast, the engle-granger test was designed for two time series, and due to its relative simplicity, it is often prefered in this situation. 3: Well, what is you time resolution for your regression? You should simply use the same time-resolution. If you are trying to actually do something with you cointegration model, then it is important what time scale you choose as this affects the parameter estimates in your model, as @A. Webb suggests. But if you are simply trying to verify whether a given correlation coefficient is spurious, the answer to you question is simple: just use the same time scale as your regression.
