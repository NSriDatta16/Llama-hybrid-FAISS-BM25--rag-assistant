I think good bonafide data analysis examples will not often be found alongside proofs of statistical theorems in a single text. For graduate level studies, most Masters students do not touch proofs. They do work out sophisticated problems in probability, and so the programs tend to be "quantitative" but not really "mathematical". For PhD level students, graduate mathematical training is usually incorporated and proofs need to be grasped at the Lehman Casella level: measure theory and functional analysis primarily. If a book like that were to include data analysis examples, it'd be 2000 pages long! The content in the book you link, however, is only good enough for an undergraduate degree with no calculus training. If you would like to be exposed to applied material appropriate for a graduate level statistician--and this means that integration, differentiation are regular parts of the development and discussion of concepts--there are many references out there. Some of my favorite graduate level applied self-learning texts are: Categorical Data Analysis - Alan Agresti Probability Models - Sheldon Ross Regression Modeling Strategies - Frank Harrell Logistic Regression: A Self Learning Text - Kleinbaum and Kleine Survival Analysis - Kleinbaum and Kleine Longitudinal Data Analysis - Diggle Heagerty Liang Zeger
