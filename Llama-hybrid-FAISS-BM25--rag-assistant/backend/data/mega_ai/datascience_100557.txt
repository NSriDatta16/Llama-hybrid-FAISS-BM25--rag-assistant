Using lm is not the right approach to model a binary outcome. You would use a Logit in this case (see some example here and see why not lm here ). However, there are (at least) two more issues: You have a highly unbalanced target You may have "noisy" features Regrading 1: You should check if some oversampling of the minority class or using SMOTE would help to tackle the problem of the unbalanced target. Generally, when you have 99% of say class 1 (and 1% of class 0), you will often end up with an estimator with 99% accuracy while all predicted values are assigned to class 1. This of course is not a good prediction (since the "naive baseline" is 99% accuracy, namely assign all cases to class 1). Regarding 2: Logit may not be a good choice (depending on the nature of your explanatory variables). Logit is "linear" in parameters, meaning a logit model looks like $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n +u. $$ In case the true data generating process is "more complex" you may benefit from using tree-based models which do not require any ex-ante parameterization such as Random Forest or Stochastic Gradient Boosting (e.g. xgboost ). Make sure categorical features are encoded as "dummy" (or factor, depending on the model). You could also check if feature generation helps to find more detailed aspects in the data. General idea: Generate features such as $x_1/x_2$ , $x_1-x_2$ etc. and check via feature importance if they have good explanatory power. Keep the useful features on top of the features you would include anyway. You should also check if there are features which are redundant. You could do this by looking at the feature importance from a Random Forest or from Boosting. Exclude features with little or no explanatory power. You could also check if a Lasso/Ridge approach to (automatically) "shrink" redundant features would help. Lasso/Ridge can also be seen as a tool to investigate feature importance. " Introduction to Statistical Learning " is a very good source to understand some of the models mentionned above (if you are not familiar with them). ISL also comes with R labs which should be helpful. The book can be downloaded for free.
