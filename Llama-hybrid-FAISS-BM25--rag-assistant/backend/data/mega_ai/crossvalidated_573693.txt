Bayesian Poisson Regression with Gamma Prior Formulas

Are there closed form formulas for the posterior and evidence of a Poisson-Gamma Bayesian regression model? I was not able to find anything that is accessible online. I am not sure for which model can we find such an expression. I was thinking of the following formulation (notation follow): Likelihood is Poisson: $P(y|X, \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{y_i!}(x_i^t \theta)^{y_i} \exp(x_i^t \theta)$ and prior is Gamma: $P(\theta) = \prod_{j=1}^n \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma (\alpha)} \theta_j^{\alpha-1}\exp(-\beta\theta_j)$ . Notation: $m$ number of observations, $n$ number of parameters, $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ a design matrix with rows $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ the parameter I would like to infer and $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$ data. My questions: Is there a closed form expression for the posterior / evidence for the above model? Is there a closed form expression if we formulate the model as a GLM with (e.g.) with a $\log$ link? If there are no closed form formulas - is there a regression model with a conjugate prior, for positive data and parameters? Freely available references are great, a complete derivation is even better.
