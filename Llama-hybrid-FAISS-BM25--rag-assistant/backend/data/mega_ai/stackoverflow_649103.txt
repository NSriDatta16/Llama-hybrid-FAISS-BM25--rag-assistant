This isn't as elegant as CaffineFueled's answer but maybe easier to read for a regex beginner. String RegExString = "(\d*-\d*)\s*-\s*(.*)"; Regex rx = new Regex(RegExString, RegexOptions.Compiled | RegexOptions.IgnoreCase); MatchCollection matches = rx.Matches("13-40 - Computer Keyboard"); Assert.AreEqual("13-40", matches[0].Value); Assert.AreEqual("Computer Keyboard", matches[1].Value); or even more readable: String RegExString = "(\d*-\d*) - (.*)";
