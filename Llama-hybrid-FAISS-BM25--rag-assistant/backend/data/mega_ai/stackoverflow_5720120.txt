Is there any logic in just maxing tempdb and never having it change size?

The reason I ask it we have a dedicated RAID10 array with ~150GB for the tempdb (the "t" drive). It is only used for storing tempdb. The t drive isn't used by by SQL Server or any other process for anything else. Our DBA has tempdb setup with 15GB initial size and autogrow 20% increments. Everytime the server starts it resized to 15GB and then over the course of the day grows to ~80GB (on average). Now IT is looking into making initial size larger say 30 or 40GB but given the drive is ONLY used for tempdb my thinking is why not "max it" right away. Is the any negative effect to simply create 4 data files in the primary group for tempdb give them each an initial size of 30GB (120GB total), turn autogrow off and be done with it? Are there any limits on SQL Server ability to span multiple tempdb data files in one query? i.e. will it cause problems if the tempdb has say 70GB total free but the file used by one process is full (30 of 30GB used)?
