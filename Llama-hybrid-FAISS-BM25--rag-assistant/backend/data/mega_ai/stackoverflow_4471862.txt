Reorder tabs in TabControl without flickerng

There are multiple examples of modified TabControls on the Internet which allow the user to reorder the tabs using drag and drop. However, all seem to use the following technique: Determine which tab is being dragged Determine the index to which the tab is being dragged Empty the tab page collection and add in the new order The last step, hoewever, causes the control to flicker alot. Besides this, when there are a lot of tab pages on the tab control, it is rather slow. Is it possible to swap items (i.e. swap indexes) in a TabPageCollection, without the TabControl flickering?
