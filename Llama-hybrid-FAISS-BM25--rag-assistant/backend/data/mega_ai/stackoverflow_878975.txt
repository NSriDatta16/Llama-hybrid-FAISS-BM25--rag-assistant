There's no built-in touch-responsive API for moving table view sections - you'd have to do it programmatically then send a [tableView reloadData] message or similar. It is concievable, though, that you create a table view where each UITableViewCell's view is itself a UITableView containing a section of your data, so that the cells in the "master" table are draggable as UITableViewCells. This would let you reorder "sections" in your table, but they wouldn't be sections anymore - they'd be separate tables, each with a single section.
