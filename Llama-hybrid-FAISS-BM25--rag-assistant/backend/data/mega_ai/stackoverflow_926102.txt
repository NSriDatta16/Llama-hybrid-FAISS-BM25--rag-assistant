One part of a solution might be to run a sample session with a code coverage tool. If you ensure that you exercise all functionality of your application, then classes with no coverage are not used and you can filter them out. In fact it might not be that hard to get a list of classes that are used from the coverage report, then for each class on the list find what JAR/source folder it's defined in and add these to a list (or rather, set). Something I found useful is that the standard Unix grep tool is actually quite usable to see what JAR file a given class is in; though since you can't fully-qualify the name, I expect it will give the occasional false positive and so shouldn't be used in an automated fashion. Hope this helps you work something out!
