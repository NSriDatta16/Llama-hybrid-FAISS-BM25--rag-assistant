Prediction with one very strong and many weaker variables

I want to create an RF model, with about 100 weak variables and one very strong variable. The strong variable is a probability score, I do not have visibility on how it was derived. It may be using many of the variables I already have, and also some I do not have. If I create Random Forest, wouldn't it mask the strong predictor with the weaker ones, since it randomly selects the variables at each stage? What is the best way to deal with a very strong variable and many weaker ones - with the idea being to add value over the stronger variable?
