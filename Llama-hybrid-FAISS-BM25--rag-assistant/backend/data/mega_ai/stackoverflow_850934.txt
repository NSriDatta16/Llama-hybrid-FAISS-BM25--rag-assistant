In Rails, how do I access the Request.ServerVariables like you do in ASP?

I want to access a given Requests ServerVariables, but I can't seem to find anything on Google on how to get access to the Server Vars of the request object. How do I do this or am I doomed to simply never know? An example of why I'd want to do this (but not actually what I want to do): User logs in, and you want to store the IP address of place where they logged in, or perhaps I want to record the user-agent or referer from the browser that they are viewing the site.
