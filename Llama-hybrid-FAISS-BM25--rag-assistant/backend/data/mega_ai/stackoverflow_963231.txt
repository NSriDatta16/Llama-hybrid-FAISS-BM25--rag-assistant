The Location header requires an absolute path per the HTTP specification . Try using an absolute path. The errata says that document fragments (#id) are allowed in the Location header, but the behaviour when a user is linked to a page with a fragment (e.g. http://example.org/a_redirector#this where a_redirector redirects to http://example.com/destination#that ) is undefined.
