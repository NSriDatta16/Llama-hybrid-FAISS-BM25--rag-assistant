Survival Function vs Conditional Survival Function?

Consider the Survival Function: $$S(t) = P(T_1 > t) = 1 - F(t)$$ Where: $S(t)$ is the survival function, which gives the probability of surviving past time $t$ . $T_1$ is the random variable representing the time of the first event (such as death or failure). $P(T_1 > t)$ is the probability that the event has not occurred by time $t$ . $F(t)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the time to event, which gives the probability that the event will occur by time $t$ . As I understand, the Survival Function describes "the probability that the individual is still alive past time t". Initially, I had thought that the Survival Function was by definition "conditional". For example - to be alive at time "t" is implicitly conditional that I have survived all times between time = 0 and time = t -1. However, then I found out there is something separate called the Conditional Survival Function. Apparently, the Conditional Survival Function is described as follows: $$CS(t|s) = P(T > t + s | T > s) = \frac{S(t+s)}{S(s)}$$ Where: $CS(t|s)$ is the conditional survival function, which gives the probability of surviving past time $t + s$ given that the event has not occurred by time $s$ . $T$ is the random variable representing the time of the event. $S(t)$ is the survival function, which gives the probability of surviving past time $t$ . $s$ and $t$ are positive time intervals. In other words, the conditional survival function provides the survival probability after time $t + s$ , given that the individual has survived to time $s$ . This brings me to my question: Why is so much attention given to the Conditional Survival Function? The Conditional Survival Function is created by dividing two (Ordinary) Survival Functions. Could I not just divide both of them and thereby estimate the Conditional Survival Function? And in what kinds of situations/applications would we be interested in estimating the Conditional Survival Function vs the (Ordinary) Survival Function?
