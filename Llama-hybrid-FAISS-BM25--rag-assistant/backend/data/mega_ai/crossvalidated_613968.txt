If you did a more routine regression model, such as OLS linear regression, your approach would be a standard designed experiment. Your work would be described as a full-factorial ANOVA. A nice aspect of (multinomial) logistic regression is that the way to think of the predictor variables (often called "features") does not really change from the linear regression case. In linear regression, you use the features to help you distinguish between values on a continuum. In binary logistic regression, you use the features to distinguish between two categories and determine their relative probabilities. In multinomial logistic regression, you use the features to distinguish between three (or more) categories and determine their relative probabilities. Overall, it sounds like you have performed a full-factorial ANOVA with a categorical outcome and that you have done so correctly.
