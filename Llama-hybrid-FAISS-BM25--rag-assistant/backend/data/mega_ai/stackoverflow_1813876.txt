The first order of business would be to educate your staff on how SVN works, and the methodology behind it. No matter how elegant you make your scheme, if they can't follow it, they won't. I myself do everything in 'Feature' branches. My layout is like this: branches/ [feature branches] stable/ tags/ [all of our releases] trunk/ Anything that touches more than a few files, or major work, gets done in a feature branch. Small bug fixes or quick work is done straight in trunk. Throughout development, the branches are all kept in sync with trunk (trunk is merged into the branches every few days). When release time comes, we take all the features slated for release and merge them into trunk. One feature branch is merged, checked, and if good, moved into the stable branch. Wash, rinse, repeat for all the feature branches. Once stable is complete, it is tagged as a release, and our build system can now build Production based on the new tag. If we need to do emergency fixes that go straight into production, the tag is checked out, corrected, and a patch is generated. The patch is applied to trunk, and then fed into Stable and any new feature branches.
