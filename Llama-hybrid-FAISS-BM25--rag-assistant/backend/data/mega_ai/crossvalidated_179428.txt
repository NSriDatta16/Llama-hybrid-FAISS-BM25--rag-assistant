A few thoughts - Single-class SVMs can give better results when the purpose of your model is to identify outliers within noisy data - so long as you tune the misclassification slack parameter appropriately. It directly addresses the problem of "build a model to classify healthy and unhealthy behavior". Daily/Yearly seasons are cyclical, and thus can be modeled nicely using spectral components of time - Sin(x), Cos(x), Sin(2x) etc... This will likely give better results than the spline fit you mentioned. The ongoing non-seasonal trend, e.g. you friend's increasing popularity over time, is a tricky part. You might simply retrain the model every night to predict the next day. However, it is easy to account for being more popular over time while maintaining alerting on drops on traffic (i.e. the "server down" scenario) since no special behavior is needed!
