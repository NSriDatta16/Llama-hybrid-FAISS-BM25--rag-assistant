How exactly does a "random effects model" in econometrics relate to mixed models outside of econometrics?

I used to think that "random effects model" in econometrics corresponds to a "mixed model with random intercept" outside of econometrics, but now I am not sure. Does it? Econometrics uses terms like "fixed effects" and "random effects" somewhat differently from the literature on mixed models, and this causes a notorious confusion. Let us consider a simple situation where $y$ linearly depends on $x$ but with a different intercept in different groups of measurements: $$y_{it} = \beta x_{it} + u_i + \epsilon_{it}.$$ Here each unit/group $i$ is observed at different timepoints $t$. Econometricians call it "panel data". In mixed models terminology, we can treat $u_i$ as a fixed effect or as a random effect (in this case, it's random intercept). Treating it as fixed means fitting $\hat \beta$ and $\hat u_i$ to minimize squared error (i.e. running OLS regression with dummy group variables). Treating it as random means that we additionally assume that $u_i\sim\mathcal N(u_0,\sigma^2_u)$ and use maximum likelihood to fit $u_0$ and $\sigma^2_u$ instead of fitting each $u_i$ on its own. This leads to the "partial pooling" effect, where the estimates $\hat u_i$ get shrunk toward their mean $\hat u_0$. R formula when treating group as fixed: y ~ x + group R formula when treating group as random: y ~ x + (1|group) In econometrics terminology, we can treat this whole model as a fixed effects model or as a random effects model. The first option is equivalent to the fixed effect above (but econometrics has its own way of estimating $\beta$ in this case, called "within" estimator ). I used to think that the second option is equivalent to the random effect above; e.g. @JiebiaoWang in his highly upvoted answer to What is a difference between random effects-, fixed effects- and marginal model? says that In econometrics, the random-effects model may only refer to random intercept model as in biostatistics Okay --- let us test if this understanding is correct. Here is some random data generated by @ChristophHanck in his answer to What is the difference between fixed effect, random effect and mixed effect models? (I put the data here on pastebin for those who do not use R): @Christoph does two fits using econometrics approaches: fe The first one yields the estimate of beta equal to -1.0451 , the second one 0.77031 (yes, positive!). I tried to reproduce it with lm and lmer : l1 = lm(stackY ~ stackX + as.factor(unit), data = paneldata) l2 = lmer(stackY ~ stackX + (1|as.factor(unit)), data = paneldata) The first one yields -1.045 in perfect agreement with the within estimator above. Cool. But the second yields -1.026 , which is miles away from the random effects estimator. Heh? What is going on? In fact, what is plm even doing , when called with model = "random" ? Whatever it is doing, can one somehow understand it via the mixed models perspective? And what is the intuition behind whatever it is doing? I read in a couple of econometrics places that random effects estimator is a weighted average between the fixed effects estimator and the "between" estimator which is more or less regression slope if we do not include group identity in the model at all (this estimate is strongly positive in this case, around 4 .) E.g. @Andy writes here : The random effects estimator then uses a matrix weighted average of the within and between variation of your data. [...] This makes random effects more efficient[.] Why? Why would we want this weighted average? And in particular, why would we want it instead of running a mixed model?
