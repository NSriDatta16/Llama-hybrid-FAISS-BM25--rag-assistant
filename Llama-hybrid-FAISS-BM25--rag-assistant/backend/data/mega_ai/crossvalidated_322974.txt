How can I be sure my sample size is large enough for conditional logistic regression?

I am performing a conditional logistics regression (CLR) case-control (1:3) study over a very large dataset that has been partitioned according to a set of study requirements (to follow). Each entry is a patient record: age, gender and up to nine disease entries, etc. I take a male 20-29 population and I divide it into those with illness A (case) and those without illness A (four controls per case). I then use CLR to calculate the odds of an illness A if they have a second illness B. For large sample sizes, I am seeing really good odds ratio with CI for those with a headache (illness A) and hypertension (illness B); OR of around 1.8, which sits perfectly with current literature studies i.e., your odds of having a headache almost double if you have hypertension. However, if I replace a headache (illness A) with a rare illness my sample size for those males 20-29 with illness A, drops through the floor e.g., I might only have 30 records. Therefore, the number of cases I have with rare illness A and illness B is very small (1 to 3 in some cases), causing the clogit to return Inf values or really large odds and very broad CI. I was thinking of trying to determine using power analysis how large my sample size should be and that way do away with any scenarios where the set is too small Firstly , would this be the correct approach to take? And if so, how the do I calculate a power analysis for conditional logistic regression? I believe to determine a sample size I need to know my effect size (odds I want) which requires knowing prior probabilities? Secondly , by manually partitioning my population by gender and then into age-groups on the assumption that everyone in this group will be the same, should I even both matching for age within the age-range in my case-control design? e.g., should I match a 22 yr old with another 22yr even when I am suggesting that a 28 yr old shouldn't be treated differently? I have looked at matching for age within the age-group and not matching for age (both control and case populations are always between 20-29) in which the odds differ by 0.101: Matching for age: coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p hypertension_UNTRUE 0.845 2.327 0.150 5.63 1.8e-08 Likelihood ratio test=29.9 on 1 df, p=4.56e-08 n= 6633, number of events= 1670 2.5 % 97.5 % hypertension_UNTRUE 1.734574 3.1224 Not matching for age but case and control are still always between 20-29: coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p hypertension_UNTRUE 0.895 2.448 0.154 5.81 6.1e-09 Likelihood ratio test=32.1 on 1 df, p=1.48e-08 n= 6615, number of events= 1670 2.5 % 97.5 % hypertension_UNTRUE 1.810327 3.311272
