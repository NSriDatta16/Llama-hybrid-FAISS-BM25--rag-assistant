Upgrade to Java EE 6 / Servlet 3.0, then you'll be able to register the servlet by the @WebServlet annotation. package com.example; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; @WebServlet(urlPatterns={"/myServlet/*"}) public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet { // ... } No need for web.xml anymore. The above does basically the same as following: myServlet com.example.MyServlet myServlet /myServlet/* As far now you can choose from under each Glassfish v3 and Tomcat 7 as Servlet 3.0 implementations. Prior to Servlet 3.0 your best bet is likely the front controller pattern. Have a single servlet in web.xml which delegates requests/actions to domain objects based on the request parameters and/or pathinfo. This is also used in the average MVC framework.
