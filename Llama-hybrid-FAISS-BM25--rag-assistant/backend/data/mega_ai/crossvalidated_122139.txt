Denote $X_i, i=1,...,n$ the $U(0,1)$ independent RVs. The transformation described by the OP is (using the usual notation for order statistics), $$Z_i = \frac {X_i-X_{n,(1)}}{X_{n,(n)}-X_{n,(1)}} = R_n^{-1}\cdot (X_i-X_{n,(1)})$$ where the double index in the minimum and maximum order statistic serve to remind us that they are functions of $n$. $R_n$ is the range of the untransformed sample. We want to consider $$\frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^nZ_i \equiv \bar Z_n = R_n^{-1}\frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^nX_i - R_n^{-1}X_{n,(1)}$$ We have that $$R_n^{-1} \xrightarrow{p} 1,\;\;\; \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^nX_i \xrightarrow{p} \frac 12,\;\; X_{n,(1)}\xrightarrow{p} 0$$ So in all, applying Slutsky's lemma, $$\bar Z_n \xrightarrow{p} \frac 12 = \text{plim} \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^nX_i \equiv \text{plim}\bar X_n$$ So the sample average of the transformed sample is also a consistent estimator of the common expected value of the $X$'s. Note that $\text{Var}(\bar X_n) = \frac 1{12n}$ Then, consider the manipulation $$\sqrt{12n}\left(\bar Z_n - \frac 12\right) = \\R_n^{-1}\cdot \sqrt{12n}\left(\bar X_n - \frac 12 \right) +\sqrt{12n}\left(\frac 12R_n^{-1} -\frac 12\right) -\sqrt{12n}R_n^{-1}X_{n,(1)}$$ We examine each of the three components in turn: A) By the CLT we have that $\sqrt{12n}\left(\bar X_n - \frac 12 \right) \xrightarrow{d}\mathcal N (0,1)$. Since also $R_n^{-1} \xrightarrow{p} 1$, then by Slutsky the first term converges in distribution to $\mathcal N (0,1)$. B) We can write $$\sqrt{12n}\left(\frac 12R_n^{-1} -\frac 12\right) = \sqrt{3}\left(\frac {n(1-R_n)}{\sqrt nR_n}\right)$$ In Dasgupta 2008 ch. 8 p. 108 Example 8.12, one can find for the sample range from an i.i.d. sample of $U(0,1)$ uniforms that $n(1-R_n) \xrightarrow{d} \frac 12 \mathcal \chi^2(4)$). So the numerator above converges while the denominator goes to infinity. So the whole term goes to zero. C) We know that the minimum order statistic from a sample of non-negative random variables, needs to be scaled by $n$ in order to converge in distribution ( see this post ). In other words convergence is "fast", and scaling the third term only by $\sqrt n$ doesn't cut it. Therefore we have that $\sqrt{12n}R_n^{-1}X_{n,(1)} \rightarrow0$. So, we conclude that $$\sqrt{12n}\left(\bar Z_n - \frac 12\right) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal N(0,1)$$ as does $\bar X_n$, for the same shifting and scaling.
