Best way to show "live" comments

I want to show user comments in a grid (easy enough) but I want to show the new records as they come in as well. In theory, the user stays on this page a while, adding their own comments and viewing others' as they come in. It behaves very much like a chat window with multiple users making comments, though I don't expect it to be as active as one (I expect it to be about as intermittently-updated as a Facebook wall) I've considered: - jQuery+AJAX+Timer? - Web Sockets. Are Web Sockets ready for prime time? And can Web Sockets be implemented with ASP.NET + IIS? I'm looking for a solution that is elegant, clean, fast (low bandwidth; only load the new comments if possible, popping off the older ones) and not so esoteric on an ASP.NET/IIS platform...not sure how to go about this, kindly requesting your help. Thanks! PS I tried searching on "comment system" "show new records" "chat systems", but couldn't quite hit the results I sought.
