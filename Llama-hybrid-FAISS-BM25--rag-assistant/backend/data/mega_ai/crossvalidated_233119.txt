how do you interpret this diagram?

there is poll to evaluate the number of women that are working. The number of women is 784. And we have the following variables: X: Is one if the woman was working in 2008. Y: is the average age of the children. And is 0 if the woman doesn't have kids. We have 3 groups $Y=0, 0 3$ What is the correct answer? a)If the average age of of the kid increases then the woman works more. b) There is no correlation between the average age and the participation of the woman in the labor force c) When the average age is between 0 and 3, the participation of the woman in the labor force is lower. Blue: working White: not working Apparently the correct answer is b, but i dont know why. Maybe is wrong?
