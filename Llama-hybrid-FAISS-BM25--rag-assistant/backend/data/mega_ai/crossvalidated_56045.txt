In short: if which condition betters performance depends on the stimulus level, you can't say which condition betters performance overall without some kind of averaging over stimulus levels; which is only likely to be a meaningful procedure if you have data on the distribution of stimulus levels over some population or other. And surely ignoring what's interesting in your results just to be able to do a boring old t-test is putting the cart before the horse. Logistic regression could be really good here. Assuming the stimulus can sensibly be treated as a continuous variable (see @Peter's comment), try fitting $$\log\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}=\beta_0 +\beta_p p + \beta_c c + \beta_s s + \beta_{pc} pc + \beta_{ps} ps + \beta_{cs} cs$$ where $\pi$ is the probability of success, $p$ is a dummy variable for person, $c$ is a dummy variable for stimulus, & $s$ is the strength of the stimulus. Each of the estimated coefficients (the $\beta$s) tells you something useful, & you can use a likelihood ratio test instead of a t-test.
