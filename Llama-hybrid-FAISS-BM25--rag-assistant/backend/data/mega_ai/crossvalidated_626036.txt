Is there a difference between Principal Component and weighted mean using PC loadings? How to get Principal Component on scale of original variables?

I was interested in doing a Principal Component analysis but returning a Principal Component on the scale of the original variables. Principal component analysis in R defaults to scaling and centering, and so I thought that if I set scale and center to False, that it would return a Principal Component on the scale of the original variables. However, this was very much not the case, and the not-scaled and not-centered Principal Component was on a very different scale, confusingly. I then tried taking a weighted mean using the loadings from the scaled/centered PCA as well as a weighted mean using the loadings from the not-scaled/not-centered PCA. The values of the original dataset were bounded between 1 and 5, and the weighted mean using the scaled/centered PCA exceeded these boundaries and thus appeared not to be on the original scale. Meanwhile, the weighted mean using the not-centered/not-scaled PCA loadings was within the 1 to 5 boundaries of the original scale. I thus have a few questions: What does scaling and centering PCA versus not scaling and centering PCA do? Why is PCA without scaling and centering not on the scale of the original variables? I would assume that not scaling and centering should return a PCA on scale of original values, but it does not seem that way. It seems that a weighted mean using PCA loadings should return a variable identical to the PCA, but on the scale of the original variables. Is that a correct interpretation or is that off?
