Wouldn't you just use an indexer (an anonymous property that takes parameters)? private string []storage = new string[10]; public string this[int index] { get { return storage[index]; } set { storage[index] = value; } } and then called with: MyClass[0] = "Hello World"; Sure, it doesn't have the fancy "TestIt" name tag... do you need that name tag? Edit: Lol, I googled for "C# named indexers" and who did I find answering silly questions with excellent answers in 2005? None other than Jon Skeet .
