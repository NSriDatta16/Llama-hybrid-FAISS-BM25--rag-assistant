At heart, geometric means are what you want to work with because what you get back from investment is multiplicative - if you invest $1$ for two periods, getting $(1+r_1)$ and $(1+r_2)$ you end up with the product of the two single period amounts, $(1+r_1)(1+r_2)$ (since $(1+r_1)$ is available to invest after 1 period). The arithmetic mean would be what you would use if instead you ended up with $(1+r_1+r_2)$ (which would happen if you only reinvested $1$ after the first period, losing the compounding). So the appropriate averages are based on products not sums.
