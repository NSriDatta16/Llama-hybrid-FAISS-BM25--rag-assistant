Including a trend and drift term when they are not necessary reduce the power of the test---that is, its ability to reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity (i.e., the null of a unit root in the time series). Contrarily, the test is biased when these parameters are needed, but missing. In economics, we typically don't worry about the trend term, which would imply a trend that was quadratic in time in our variable of interest. Drift implies a linear trend and is commonly incorporated. You may plot a time series of your variable and look at the pattern to see if a trend is noticeable. A basic linear regression of the variable on a linear time trend may give you an idea of whether there is a linear trend as well (of course, you shouldn't pay attention to official hypothesis tests here because serial corrleation/non-stationarities could be biasing your results). Using a spline may also indicate whether there is a linear or quadratic trend in the variable. These visual cues are often good indicators of how you should conduct your Dickey-Fuller test.
