.net, Login.aspx, can't display tag?

I'm actually following a tutorial about creating a login page etc for a web project. It all works and now I am working on layout. I have added an image tag to my login page, as simple as , the src is correct, the image is definitely there, but the image will not show up on the page, why?? The image works if I copy and paste the tag into one of the other pages in the project, but not the Login.aspx page! I must be suffering from 'lack of brains friday' syndrome because this has got me stumped! Maybe I should see if I can get a half-day and go home... Thanks. Code: Login Page username password So, I added the following to my web.config file under the file, which according to the docs should grant anybody access to the images folder whether they have logged in or not: I'm actually going to change this in future and reorganize it so that only those images required by pages such as the login etc. are available to all and the rest are protected. Interesting lesson for today! Thanks for all the replies.
