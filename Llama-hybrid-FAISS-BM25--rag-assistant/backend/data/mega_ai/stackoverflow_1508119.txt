Here is our current process. 1. Documents We send 2 documents: + An Excel spreadsheet, comprising 1 column for an 'id', 1 column for the English translation and then 1 column for each language. A 'NOT TRANSLATED' string is used when necessary and we reuse the strings we already have. A script is responsible for indexing the strings and creating this document (generates a .csv which we import). + A PowerPoint document comprising various screenshots of the application made with a 'fake' translation file which includes the 'id' of each string, it is used to give context to the translators and so they have a rough estimate of the space available. The problem here lies within the PowerPoint document, each time there are changes a human intervention is needed to update the screenshots. Furthermore several screens may actually vary because of conditional or mutually exclusive elements (so we have to generate some variations of the screens). 2. Translation Apart from the fact that it takes time, we do not have much visibility since the client is responsible for the wording (we only provide a default and they have to adapt it to their own vocabulary / branding) and thus the translation. Apparently the PowerPoint document is used, but perhaps not as much as we could hope for. The translation teams seem to work as quickly as possible and referring to a document (with the time it takes to look up) not only breaks the flow but adds significant overhead. 3. Integration / Feedback More often than not, the client is not so happy with the translations. Some may break the layout, other are poorly worded and clearly expose a lack of understanding of the context/situation/field (not that there is much we can do there, I for one do not speak Finnish...) We have thought about our process, and two points have been raised: The human intervention required to update the screen shots is costly It would be beneficial if the translators had a more immediate feedback Despite that, we have had several ideas: The PowerPoint is killing us, but the translators need context (well, we could hope that they use it more...) we have thought about embedding a 'context' column in the Excel spreadsheet to give this context, but it seems a poor substitute There has been propositions to replace the PowerPoint document by a 'living' demo of the website. The idea being to send a static replica of the website with some variations for the screens that need it. However how this replica is built and powered is another question, we don't want a human intervention to update the screens... If we could completely automate the 3rd step, we could perhaps provide a sandbox to the translators / client so that they could work on the translations in a tighter loop. As you can see, it really is an open question, and yes we really have got a lot of thought into this. To compound the problem, of course there is a budget (money / time) issue in which this task does not appear as a priority to our management since after all it does not work so badly at the moment... I am looking forward to your comments.
