jquery.corner problem with IE8

Been making this site for the past week. Only just came across this error in IE8. There's an error in the jquery.corner.js file: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Timestamp: Sat, 25 Sep 2010 16:13:34 UTC Message: Unexpected call to method or property access. Line: 163 Char: 17 Code: 0 URI: file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/User/Desktop/diverse2/js/jquery.corner.js Here's a link to the site, it will view normal in chrome etc but in IE8 the error also stops other jQuery plugins from working e.g jQuery.cycle. http://eosa.co.cc/themes2/diverse2/ Here is the rounded corner codes: $("#pageTitle, #pageTitle div#title").corner("tl bl 5px"); $("#navbar, .postDetail").corner("bl br 5px"); $(".jqueryslidemenu ul li ul li a, .boxGrey, div#slideshow-container, #searchForm, #pageTitleContainer, .twoThirdsGrey, a.button, a.button-2, .rounded").corner("tl tr bl br 5px"); That file is located in js/rounded.js and the file for jquery.corner.js is located in js/jquery.corner.js . Can anyone help?
