Usually RDBMS can handle Integer keys as PK more efficient, than other datatypes. The reason is how it build up the index for the column, so yes: As long as you dont require string (or other typed) keys, you should always use integers. However: CHAR(36) and INT(10) are far away from being equal, because a INT(10) is much smaller, than CHAR(36). I dont know, if you require so many different keys, but you should keep that in mind. Update, to complete the last paragraph: INT(10) is 32-Bit, CHAR(36) is 36 - ^Byte^ (= 288-Bit). This does not only mean, that INT consumes less space, it also means, that CHAR(36) has about 4 times more different keys.
