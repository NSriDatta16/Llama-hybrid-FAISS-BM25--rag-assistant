Better Classification of default in logistic regression

Full Disclosure: This is homework. I've included a link to the dataset ( http://www.bertelsen.ca/R/logistic-regression.sav ) My goal is to maximize the prediction of loan defaulters in this data set. Every model that I have come up with so far, predicts >90% of non-defaulters, but I'm stuck, any recommendations would be helpful in your choice of words, R-code or SPSS syntax. My primary variables are outlined in the following histogram and scatterplot (with the exception of the dichotomous variable) A description of the primary variables: age: Age in years employ: Years with current employer address: Years at current address income: Household income in thousands debtinc: Debt to income ratio (x100) creddebt: Credit card debt in thousands othdebt: Other debt in thousands default: Previously defaulted (dichotomous, yes/no, 0/1) ed: Level of education (No HS, HS, Some College, College, Post-grad) Additional variables are just transformations of the above. I also tried converting a few of the continuous variables into categorical variables and implementing them in the model, no luck there. If you'd like to pop it into R, quickly, here it is: ## R Code df
