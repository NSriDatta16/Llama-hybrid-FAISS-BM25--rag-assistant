There are some artificial algorithm techniques used for data mining, such as C4.5 or ID3 . These algorithm does classification. Other techniques such as ant clustering, neural networks or genetic algorithms are used for classification purposes in data mining. As far as algorithms, I don't know much but ID3/C4.5 can be easily programmed. Hope this helps.
