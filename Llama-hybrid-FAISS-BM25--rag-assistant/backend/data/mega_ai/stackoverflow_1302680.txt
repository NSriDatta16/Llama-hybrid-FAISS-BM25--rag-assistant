It would be better to distribute it as a tarball ( .tar.gz ), not as an egg. Eggs are primarily for binary distribution, such as when using compiled C extensions. In source-only distributions, they are just unnecessary complexity. If you just want to throw your code out into the world, the MIT or 3-clause BSD licenses are the most popular choice. Both include disclaimers of liability. All you have to do is include the main license in the tarball; typically as "License.txt", or similar. Optionally, you can add a small copyright notification to each source file; I encourage this, so the status of each file is obvious even without the entire archive, but some people think that's too verbose. It's a matter of personal preference. The BSD license is available on Wikipdia , copied below: Copyright (c) , All rights reserved.
