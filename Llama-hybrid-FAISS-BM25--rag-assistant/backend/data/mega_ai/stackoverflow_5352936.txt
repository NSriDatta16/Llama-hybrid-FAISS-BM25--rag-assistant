Make sure that you are adding the tab to whatever view is assigned to the main window's root view controller property. If you drag and item into the window itself it won't work. To complicate matters, some of Apple's templates configure the root view controller in the application delegate's application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method, so check there to see what is being assigned. UPDATE: You should add one view to the window and add the other views as subviews.
