How to interpret an MCMCglmm ordinal model in R?

I'm trying to explain changes in tree vitality from 1 to 3 (1=green, 2=damage, 3=dry) using climatic variables in an MCMCglmm model. Unfortunately, I am struggling with two questions: How do I interpret the summary of the MCMCglmm model? I see which variables are significant, but what does it mean? Does this mean that with increasing precipitation the vitality gets to 1 (green)? I plotted the posterior means of the model and looks like precipitation and diameter have no influence on the vitality of the tree, but species react differently. How do I check if the model is correct? I checked the posterior means and 95% CI as well as Gelman-Rubin criterion (the value is 1.51). If I increase the nitt, the burnin and the thin values, the density plots look better. Data structure: Species, diameter (DBH), vitality 2018 (vit_2018) and precipitation (pp18). Were made plots, 1 plot contains 10 trees measured, precipitation is one value per plot. ###MCMCglmm model, family= ordinal prior1 Data and R script can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LmgEAssR5FfFw1CkYjygsaawg84dDAwk?usp=sharing Here are attached a part of the data, when I run the model with all the data, the density plots look better. P.S. I also tried the clm function from the ordinal package in R, but the McFadden pseudo r ^ 2 was 0.06 = not a good fit. So I checked the precipitation data and the location of the plots with Moran's I test and there was spatial autocorrelation. I am using MCMCglmm because I read that it can deal with spatial autocorrelation. So far I followed several tutorials or questions that I found online. Any suggestions would be really helpful. Thank you for your time and help!
