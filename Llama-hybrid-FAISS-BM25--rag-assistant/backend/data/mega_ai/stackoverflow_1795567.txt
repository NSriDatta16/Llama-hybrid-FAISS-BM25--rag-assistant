There is a tutorial for installing XDebug for use with phpDesigner here . MVC is an organizing principle (also called a "design pattern"). It can be helpful keeping logically similar parts of a project together, and encouraging clean interfaces between them, but—especially for low complexity projects—strict MVC modeling isn't always an improvement. You ask: Is this control flow good for debugging? Debugging is to identify flaws in programs. Writing a program to be easy to debug is like intentionally driving a car off the left side of the road so you'll know where to direct an ambulance to find you. Granted—there are small things which can be done to greatly improve debugability. But the point is to architect any control structure so it naturally expresses the algorithm. By doing that, it is far more likely to avoid the need to debug. Anything you can do to write correctly functioning code is justifiable. Your control flow is clear to me. I wouldn't have any qualms about working on it.
