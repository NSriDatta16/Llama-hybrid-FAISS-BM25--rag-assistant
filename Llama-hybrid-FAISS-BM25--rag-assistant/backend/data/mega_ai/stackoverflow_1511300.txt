If the list is sorted, you can simply remove the element you're about to change from the list, and after changing it, you could "binary-insert" it, no? That would take an average of log(n) steps. If you can, change from an array to a java.util.TreeMap: both removal and insertion will be log(n) operations: which will be faster than your O(1) access + O(n) re-insertion solution using an array.
