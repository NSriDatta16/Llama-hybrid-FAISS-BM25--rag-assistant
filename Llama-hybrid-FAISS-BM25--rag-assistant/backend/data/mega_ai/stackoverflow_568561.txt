CSS box model (margins and padding) for vertical spacing between paragraphs

How should CSS 'margin' and 'padding' be used for vertical inter-paragraph spacing: Can the vertical space between paragraphs be defined using padding and/or using margins? If it can be done with either, then which is the better or more normal one to use? Do you tend to define non-zero padding and non-zero margins, and if so then how much of each? The Example of margins, padding, and borders explains in theory what the difference is between margin and padding: I'm questioning how much of each to use in practice , to render a normal, good-looking page. Secondly, given markup like the following ... Paragraph. List item. Another list item. List paragraph. If you want equal vertical space between each paragraph and/or list item, then: Would you tend to define the as having zero margin+padding of its own? Or would the normally have non-zero margin, which would then have no effect because this margin will be collapsed with the margin of the within it and of the which precedes it? Thirdly (and I'm not sure whether I ought to ask this third question), the specification for collapsing margins says, "If the top and bottom margins of a box are adjoining, then it is possible for margins to collapse through it." If I have an empty paragraph like the following one in the middle ... Hello World ... then I'd expect to see this as an empty paragraph, i.e. with an extra amount of vertical space between the Hello and the World : What would prevent this empty paragraph's margins from collapsing, and the empty paragraph therefore being invisible: is it non-zero padding which does this? In what scenario is it useful for a box to have adjoining top and bottom margins which collapse? Answers to any or all of these three questions would be welcome. I'm not especially interested in IE-specific box model problems at the moment: instead I want to know about how to use the standard.
