My first thoughts are that the properties of SearchFragment do not have the same case as the form fields. I might be wrong, but it might be worth checking. Edit : On further inverstigation, you might also want to consider the fact that the form uses SearchFragment but the View uses IndexViewModel - why not just use SearchFragment as the ViewModel?
