Best practices for project organization with ASP.NET MVC

I recently downloaded Rob Conery's excellent ASP.NET Storefront reference application and am finding it incredibly instructive. One question that comes to mind is where one should place the Model classes (and the Data classes upon which they depend). The MVC project template creates a Model folder. But it seems to me that I would be better served breaking the model out into a separate project assembly so that it can be re-used by other potential applications (e.g. management tools related to the website's application domain)? I'm curious to get people's opinions.
