tcpclient vs httpwebrequest

I used a tcpclient to make a connection to a streaming API and for some reason it doesn't work with a 301 error, (something wrong with my credentials). However when I use a httpwebrequest to the same API and use the same credentials and that works. I am trying to figure out what I am doing wrong: TCPclient connection: Try Dim bufferread(defaultSize) As Byte url = "xxxxxxxxx.com" Dim tclient As TcpClient = New TcpClient(url, "80") ' use a network stream to download the tcpClient stream nstream = tclient.GetStream() ' check if we can write to the stream to add the relevant headers and credentials If nstream.CanWrite Then Dim headers As String headers = "GET " & addedUrl & " HTTP/1.0" & Chr(13) & "" & Chr(10) headers &= "Authorization: Basic " & userNamePassword & Chr(13) & "" & Chr(10) headers &= Chr(13) & "" & Chr(10) Dim sendBytes As [Byte]() = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(headers) nstream.Write(sendBytes, 0, sendBytes.Length) If nstream.CanRead Then Dim timestamp As DateTime = DateTime.Now Dim data As String numbytesRead = 0 ' start reading from the stream Do.... httpwebrequest: While Not responseData = Nothing Try ' setup the webrequest and headers to send url = "https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.com" & addedUrl If Not parsingTools.refreshDate = Nothing Then url = parsingTools.refreshDate End If Dim poststring As String = "" webrequest = TryCast(System.Net.WebRequest.Create(url), HttpWebRequest) webrequest.Method = "GET" webrequest.UserAgent = "xxxxxxxxxx" webrequest.Referer = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx" webrequest.Timeout = 20000 webrequest.KeepAlive = True webrequest.Credentials = New System.Net.NetworkCredential ("xxxxxxxxxxxxx", "yyyyyyyyyyyyyy") 'get the responsestream responseStream = webrequest.GetResponse().GetResponseStream() 'check if stream is readable If responseStream.CanRead Then
