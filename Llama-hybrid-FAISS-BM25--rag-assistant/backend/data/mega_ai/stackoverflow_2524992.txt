Ok, so lets say you get Django to return an empty string instead od None for empty values. So now what happens with this code: {% for item in choices %} {{ item }} {% endfor %} You will either: Get a bunch of empty links ( ) Or an exception form the url reverse mechanism (because the positional argument is required). The method you don't want to use is much (!) more elegant: {% for item in choices %} {% if item %} {{ item }} {% endif %} {% endfor %} Of course you are also free to build a list without empty items beforehand: in the view, or even using a custom manager .
