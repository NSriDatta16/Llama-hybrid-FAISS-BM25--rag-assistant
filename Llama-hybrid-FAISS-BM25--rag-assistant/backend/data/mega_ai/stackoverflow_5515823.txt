MySQL: Change Collation from utf8_bin to utf8_unicode_ce

Given a full table, how do I change the collation from utf8_bin to utf8_unicode_ce? The normal "alter" query does not work, because of "duplicate entry errors". For example there are two entries David Hussa and David Hu√üa I know they are the same. Is there an elegant way to tell MySQL to "merge" the entrys? I should mention, that the id of the entries are used in other tables as reference so this has to be respected too by MySQL. Or do I have to do this the long and annoying way: Means merging every duplicate manually and then change the collation? The table looks like this: delimiter $$ CREATE TABLE `authors` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `name` varchar(100) COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL, `count` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '1', PRIMARY KEY (`id`), UNIQUE KEY `name_UNIQUE` (`name`), FULLTEXT KEY `name_FULLTEXT` (`name`) ) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=930710 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin COMMENT='Stores all authors from dblp.xml.'$$
