The main difficulty is that Your measures provide You with response time and accuracy while You are interested in the performance of a participant irrespective of their speed-accuracy trade-off. This question discusses the analysis of response times and accuracy. It points out that the linear methods are not recommended and suggests a model-based approach. In your case, you may wish to fit a times/accuracy model for each participant and for each of the three tasks (face categorization, emotional flanker, neutral flanker task). This will provide you with a single-valued mean estimate of the performance of each participant on each task. You can then analyze the mean estimates with the familiar linear methods such as ANOVA or Pearson correlation. This is often done in published research, albeit this method discards the information about the precision of the individual performance estimates. A hierarchical approach such as the one used by Vandekerckhove et al. (2011) is a much better idea. See also White et al. (2011) for an application of the drift diffusion model to analysis of flanker task data. Vandekerckhove, J., Tuerlinckx, F., & Lee, M. D. (2011).
