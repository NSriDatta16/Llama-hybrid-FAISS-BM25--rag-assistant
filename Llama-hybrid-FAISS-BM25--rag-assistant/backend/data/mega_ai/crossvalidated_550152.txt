Let the success probability be $\theta,$ and the symbol $\propto$ (read as "proportional to") indicate the the 'kernels' of density functions are used (density functions without norming constants). Prior distribution is $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1) \equiv \mathsf{Beta}(1,1),$ which has mean $1/2.$ This prior distribution has density $f(\theta) \propto \theta^{1-1}(1-\theta)^{1-1} = 1.$ For the data you give, the binomial likelihood is $g(x|\theta) \propto \theta^{27}(1-\theta)^3.$ Thus, by Bayes' Theorem, the posterior distribution is $$h(\theta|x) = f(\theta)\times g(x|\theta) \\ \propto \theta^{28-1}(1-\theta)^{4-1},$$ where one can see that the posterior distribution has the kernel of $\mathsf{Beta}(28,4).$ Can you see that this is the posterior distribution and that it has mean $0.875?$ If you are not familiar with beta distribution, see your text, class notes, or Wikipedia . [When the prior and likelihood are mathematically compatible in this way, making it easy to identify The posterior distribution, one says they are 'conjugate'.] Note: If you want a Bayesian posterior 95% credible interval for $\theta,$ a computation in R gives $(0.710, 0.947).$ qbeta(c(.025, .975), 28, 5) [1] 0.7100516 0.9472494 For comparison, a popular style of frequentist confidence interval for $\theta$ is $(0.734, 0.972).$ Although the Bayesian credible interval and the frequentist confidence interval are numerically similar, you should be sure you understand that their interpretations are quite different. The frequentist CI is interpreted in terms of the long run properties of intervals made in a similar way. The Bayesian credible interval refers to the specific problem at hand, in view of the prior distribution used. p.est = (27+2)/(30+4) AC.CI = p.est + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(p.est*(1-p.est)/34) AC.CI [1] 0.7338955 0.9719869
