What meaningful information can I extract from this data set?

Sorry in advance for this question. Probably is not meant to be here. If it is not, please point me in the right direction. This is going to be very generic and probably opinion-based. However, I don't know who else to ask. I am not a data scientist, or statistical trained person. I am a developer that has been tasked to show "useful information" from a particular data set. In our shop, we process documents. We take them from point A to B . This translates to take each one of the pages of the document and process them. This process is achieved using multiple threads. So, I have access to the following information: I can easily calculate the time that a page spent going from A to B in the entire process. This could be used to give some type of average time spent for any page of any document between a particular set of dates. Because this process is done using threads, I have access to the same information for each of the threads. For instance, thread 1 spends an average time of 2 seconds per page while the thread 2 spends 3 seconds per page. All of this information is somewhat related, but at the end it isn't. What do you guys think that I could do with this as an analysis point of view? Is there an index kind of variable that I could calculate dividing this numbers to create some kind of ratio and relate this to something else to see if we can make decissions based on all of this? Thanks
