Copied from importance function details: Here are the definitions of the variable importance measures. The first measure is computed from permuting OOB data: For each tree, the prediction error on the out-of-bag portion of the data is recorded (error rate for classification, MSE for regression). Then the same is done after permuting each predictor variable. The difference between the two are then averaged over all trees, and nor- malized by the standard deviation of the differences. If the standard deviation of the differences is equal to 0 for a variable, the division is not done (but the average is almost always equal to 0 in that case). The second measure is the total decrease in node impurities from splitting on the variable, averaged over all trees. For classification, the node impurity is measured by the Gini index. For regression, it is measured by residual sum of squares. Back to your questions: For classification, the first two columns are the measures computed as mean descrease in accuracy applying to your “zero” class and your “one” class. Accuracy is a dimensionless quantity. Also note that permutation of variables is done because dropping the variable is a false comparison to the method of creating one of the individual trees.
