Is it acceptable in mathematical saying that the E-step is equal to posterior probability

I am studying EM-algorithm for mixture data. I read that some authors said that, the E-step is equivalent to the calculation of the posterior probability (I think this come from Bayesian rule). So, my question is, is it acceptable to says that the E-step is the same as or can be interpreted as a posterior probability? I meant will I be wrong if I said that the E-step can be viewed as a posterior probability that the point $s$ belongs to the $k^{th}$ component.
