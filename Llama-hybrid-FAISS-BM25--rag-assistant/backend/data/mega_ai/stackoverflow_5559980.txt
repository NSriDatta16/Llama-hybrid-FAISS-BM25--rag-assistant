What's the best way to do integration testing for a Javascript heavy UI in a rails app?

We have a web application that makes extensive use of AJAXy Javascript in the UI. We have nearly complete code coverage of our backend using Shoulda and Webrat, and would like to extend our test suite to include full integration testing through the Javascript UI. We tried Selenium but found it brittle and temperamental. Are there more reliable options? UPDATE For those still checking this out, we ended up using Xvfb so we can run Firefox without a screen. Allows us to run the test on a headless Jenkins CI server. We still have to run tests "live" locally occasionally to debug, but it works pretty well.
