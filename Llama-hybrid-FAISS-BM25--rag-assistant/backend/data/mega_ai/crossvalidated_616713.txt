Short text-pieces analysis with machine learning

I have a list/database with short lines of text. Maybe one million such lines. Every line 10-60 characters. I need to categorize them, in the simplest case there would be just two categories, e.g.: "interesting" and "not interesting/spam". Example short text category call me asap interesting ahahaha spam ... ... my address is Newstreet 1001 interesting this is just a dummy spam it is a good weather today spam ... ... I need to provide a proof of concept, if this list can be successfully processed with machine learning tools. E.g. in python. Do I understand it correct that this kind of problems can be solved by classification ML algorithms? Or there are other, better, more promising approaches? Given, I would like to try the proof of concepts in python, is the sklearn library the tool of choice? Can somebody provide a link to a "ML classification hello world" example for machine learning newbies? I have found these: https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-with-python-classification-complete-tutorial-d2c99dc524ec https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/how-to-classify-data-in-python/ but... well, maybe there are even shorter and better and even more understandable newbie-examples? If possible, in python. I know, there were similar questions here in the past like Sophisticated models for classifying short pieces of texts Machine Learning for Text Classification but they are rather old and I would like to know the state of the art.
