How to concat strings in LINQ while properly dealing with NULL values

I'd like an elegant way to concatenate several columns together using LINQ, but using the + operator or concat() when any of the columns are NULL results in NULL for the value after concatenation. Is there anything similar to concat() that handles NULL differently, or am I thinking about this in the incorrect way? Any help is appreciated! Here is the code I am using: List objects = ( from obj in ObjectTable where obj.Id == Id select new CustomObject() { EnteredBy = obj.EnteredBy, EntryDate = obj.EntryDate, WorknoteText = obj.VchWorkNote1 + obj.VchWorkNote2 + obj.VchWorkNote3 + obj.VchWorkNote4 + obj.VchWorkNote5 + obj.VchWorkNote6 + obj.VchWorkNote7 + obj.VchWorkNote8 + obj.VchWorkNote9 + obj.VchWorkNote10 + obj.VchWorkNote11 + obj.VchWorkNote12 + obj.VchWorkNote13 + obj.VchWorkNote14 + obj.VchWorkNote15 + obj.VchWorkNote16 + obj.VchWorkNote17 + obj.VchWorkNote18 + obj.VchWorkNote19 + obj.VchWorkNote20 }).ToList();
