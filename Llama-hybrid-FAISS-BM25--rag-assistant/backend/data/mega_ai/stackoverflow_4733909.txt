XML Signature signs part of an XML Document starting with a given element (i.e. a sub tree in DOM) after it is normalized with a C14N algorithm. The standard C14N algorithm you use preserves line breaks and white spaces (see http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n#Example-WhitespaceInContent ). So all line breaks in the signed part of the original document (including between last tag of data and the tag, and between and the next closing tag) * must be preserved so as not to alter the signature. The line breaks and spaces in the Signature element itself are not important and may be removed without altering the signature. Here an example: ... ... Here are your possible options: define your own C14N algorithm that will remove spaces and line breaks by it self. I would discourage this as the other side must also use this non standard C14N algorithm. remove line breaks an spaces from you XML before signing it (and potentially remove spaces in signature afterwards) with the example this will give you the following signed XML: ... ... and after removing spaces in signature ... ...
