It really depends a lot on how you're building your app. If you're in VS and you're doing an ASP.Net site, then you can either do it as a Website Project, or as a Web Application project. in the former case, your files will remain as aspx and .aspx.cs files and you xcopy (or FTP) whichever files change. if you want logic that's outside the scope of a single page, you'll either create a separate class library project or else use the App_code directory. In the latter case, you'll compile all the logic into one or more .dll files that get copied to your site's /bin directory, and any number of aspx files that can either stay as such or be embedded (recommend leaving them as aspx files). Again, if an aspx file changes, you just movethe one that changed, if anything in the dll changes, you replace a whole dll. All that said, a huge chunk of what's on the site you posted is probably being pulled out of the database. Most sites now dont' have content on pages, they just have organizational (view) logic on paes, and have other classes which fetch the actual content out of a database to serve up. This allows greater reuse and means that the 4,000 pages (number chosen at random) on MSDN don't have to be each coded individually as an HTML page.
