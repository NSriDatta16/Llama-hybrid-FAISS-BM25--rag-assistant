When you're copying files, if you're physically moving the bits from one disk to another (like with cp or drag and dropping), then you might consider creating a bare repo on your external drive to push/pull from on your other systems. It doesn't address the EOL changes that need to be made ( mentioned in VonC's response for example), but it does save a little time copying files back and forth between drives.
