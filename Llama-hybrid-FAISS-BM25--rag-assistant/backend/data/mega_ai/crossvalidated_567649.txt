From my post on SAS Communities Kathleen Kiernan. https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/support/en/sas-global-forum-proceedings/2018/2179-2018.pdf "The choice of the marginal (population-averaged) model or conditional (subject-specific) model often depends on the goal of your analysis: whether you are interested in population-averaged effects or subject-specific effects. The GEE model is a marginal, or population-averaged model. If you are interested in making predictions about individuals, then you would use GLIMMIX to the fit the conditional model using G-side random effects and obtain the subject specific estimates."
