ML algorithm to find optimal control parameter

I have a training dataset $(X, y) \rightarrow z$. Where $X$ is an $n$th dimensional real vector, $y$ is an integer number in $\{1, 2, 3\}$, and $z$ is a real number. I am looking for machine learning algorithm which solves the next problem: $X$ is given and we need to choose $y$ for maximization $z$. I would prefer if it would be something like decision trees. I would really appreciate some advice on that.
