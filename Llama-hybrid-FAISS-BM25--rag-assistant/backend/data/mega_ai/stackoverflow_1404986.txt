Simple Server Monitoring with Java

I'm trying to find a solution that allows me to monitor resource consumption of a server. Preferably, the metrics I'm wanting to obtain are network utilisation IO, and if possible CPU usage/load average and disk IO. The only other requirement I have is that this information be obtainable by Java so it can be manipulated, and at least work on Linux (Fedora). I've heard about a few monitoring tools but I'm just not sure of the best way of going about this. I would probably want to be gathering the information about every 30 seconds. Thanks Update: Just to re-iterate, I am referring to system-wide monitoring NOT Java specific monitoring. I just want to use Java to access to these metrics
