SQL Agent does not actually run backups, it is capable of executing commands in SQL Server which performs the backup. Threfore, the SQL Server service account is the one that needs permissions to the UNC share. However, I think there is an actual issue with the xp_create_subdir procedure. I am going to stop using maintenance plans because I get this exact same error every once in a while. No permissions are changing and it "usually" works, but "usually" doesn't cut it.
