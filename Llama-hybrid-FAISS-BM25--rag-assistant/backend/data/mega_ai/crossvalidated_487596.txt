Splitting method for time series

Say I have a website with a lot of pages and traffic. Some of them are more visited, some of them a less. My task is to split pages into two groups for the given time period, so that the total traffic going to these groups is as similar as possible (day-wise). Could you please suggest a powerful method which could help me with this problem? Thank You!
