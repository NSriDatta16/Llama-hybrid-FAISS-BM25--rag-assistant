youtube 150 error in Air app

Hi I'm trying to develop an Air app which includes downloading and playing youtube videos I have a tilelist of thumbnails and a player which plays the selected version The event is protected function videoList_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { player.cueVideoById(videoList.selectedItem.actualID); } Some videos play fine both in flashbuilder and the compiled air app but others throw the 150 player error which is apparently when the video requested does not allow playback in the embedded player. However, if I go to the youtube site, there is no problem obtaining the embedded code and applying it successfully. The videos I have problems with work fine on web sites like http://www.yvoschaap.com/youtube/ Examples of actualID : works xTFNdHqwiQY; fails SRcnnId15BA The youtube prefix is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= TIA
