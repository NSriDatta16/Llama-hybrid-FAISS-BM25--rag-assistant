QDockWidget Tab Position

When I group multiple QDockWidgets in the same place, their tabs go at the bottom. Is there a way to put them at the top? Even better is if I can replace the title bar with the tabs themselves. the Eclipse IDE has very similar behavior, as can be seen in this screenshot: . For example, the JUnit tab is also it's header and can be dragged to dock it anywhere else.
