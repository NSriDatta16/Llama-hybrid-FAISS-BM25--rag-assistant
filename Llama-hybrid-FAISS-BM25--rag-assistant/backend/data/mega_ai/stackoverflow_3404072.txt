Git for Peer to Peer content distribution network

Is there anyone using git in such a fashion? I would like to distribute some multimedia content from a server to some Android remote devices . I would like them sending back a log file with device usage statistics (provided by an android app I will write). The server could be anything but I would prefer a linux box. I thought that since git handle and sych only differences between files, It would be a nice tool for this purpose and I would have content revision history as a bonus. I need some piece of advice on how the repositories architecture could be organized: does It have to be a star topology or something different? The remote end of the sistem don't need any interactivity, in other words the remote git repository could pull and push whatever It needs to, autonomously and automatically. UPDATE: I've found here on SO the author of git internals (I'm downloading It right now), Scott Chacon talking about the architecture I would like to implement. UPDATE 2: OK I read the chapter about "Non-SCM uses of Git" and here is what the author says about a Peer to Peer CDN: You have to get new content [...] consist of any combination of xml files, images, animations, text and sound. You need to build a content distribution framework that will easily and efficiently transfer all the necessary content to the machines on your network. You need to constantly determine what content each machine has and what it needs to have and transfer the difference as efficiently as possible.[...] It turns out that Git is an excellent solution to this problem. I don't find anything about mentioning little portions of the book inside it, so I hope that I'm not violating any copyright. In any case I will delete It if someone complain.
