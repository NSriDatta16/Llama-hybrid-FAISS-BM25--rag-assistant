You should ignore what you've already done and run a subset (joint) F-test of significance for the entire educational variable (all dummy variables for edu). If the p-value for this subset F-test is significant, then go ahead and look at the individual tests for the different levels of education in reference to the base group. Irrespective of p-value for the individual levels of education, you should leave them all in (as a general rule) because the subset F-test told you the variable of "Education" was important and it's nonsensical to remove portions of this variable and can turn into p-hacking. If the subset F-test is not significant, then do not make the individual comparisons of educational level. There are some very good points made by @Robert Long.
