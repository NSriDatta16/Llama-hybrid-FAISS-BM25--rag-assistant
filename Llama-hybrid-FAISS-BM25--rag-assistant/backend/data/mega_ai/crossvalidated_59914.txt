Confusion on a Statistical Statement

I am confused about the statistical statement I am making based on the following scenario: Scenario: The membership of a professional organisation is only open to the top 10% of students in a district. There are 400 members, coming from (say) 45 schools. Statement : The organisation represents the top 10% of students in the district. My confusion is that School A may have lower quality students who make the top 10% than School B. e.g. School A has students who scored 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45 out of 50 (top 10%) School B has students who scored 46, 47, 48, 49 and 50 out of 50 (top 10%) In this case, can they be the top 10% of students (especially when School B has students who scored 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45)? I am using just 2 schools for simplicity.
