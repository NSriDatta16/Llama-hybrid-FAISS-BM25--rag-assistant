Instead of worrying about how non-Gaussian your data is, you can go with the fact that it has a nice clear binomial distribution. You need to fit a mixed effects logistic regression model. You can do this with the lme4 package in R (which is free). Use the lmer() function with family=binomial. A search term to use to get more info is "mixed effects generalized linear model". It's not clear what confidence interval you want (ie estimate of what parameter? average number of malformations? or impact of some other variable on malformation rate?), but whatever your analysis is, the above approach will work.
