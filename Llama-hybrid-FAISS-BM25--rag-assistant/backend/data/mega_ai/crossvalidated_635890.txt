(I'd be more confident in my answer if you included some output). The first approach is using the mean difference - this is appropriate when all your outcomes are using the same scale. In this way you can interpret a standard deviation difference as equivalent in every measure. A 10 point increase in the outcome (bone density, PHQ-9, mobility score) means the same thing. This is generally considered the best approach, when you can use it, which is rare. The second approach is using the standardized mean difference. You use this when different studies have measured the outcome on different scales and you can't easily convert between them. One study used the PHQ-9, so a change of 5 points has one meaning, another study used the BDI, so a change of 5 points has a different meaning. You can't average these two, so you standardize and then you are talking about the average change in standard deviations. The problem with the second approach is that different populations might have different standard deviations. Weight in adults might have a very different SD depending on the population that you sampled from - so a 1 kg difference in weight gets a different SMD. But if someone measured difference in kg, someone else measured difference in waist size, and someone else measured difference in BMI, you don't really have a choice. The second approach is (an order of magnitude or two) more common, at least in my experience.
