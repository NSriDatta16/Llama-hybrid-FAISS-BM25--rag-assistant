Covariance matrix proposal distribution

In a MCMC implementation of hierarchical models, with normal random effects and a Wishart prior for their covariance matrix, Gibbs sampling is typically used. However, if we change the distribution of the random effects (e.g., to Student's-t or another one), the conjugacy is lost. In this case, what would be a suitable (i.e., easily tunable) proposal distribution for the covariance matrix of the random effects in a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and what should be the target acceptance rate, again 0.234? Thanks in advance for any pointers.
