Time-series clustering with python

I have a multiple time series data of different customers (around 10k customers, for 100 days). I want to cluster this data into 5-10 groups. However, I don't have any tips about the time series clustering. Is the K-means works for them? Any python package works for this data? Any help appreciated.
