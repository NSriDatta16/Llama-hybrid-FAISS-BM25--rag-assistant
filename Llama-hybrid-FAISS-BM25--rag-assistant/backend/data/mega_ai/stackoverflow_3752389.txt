If I create a sqlserver db and don't check use full text indexing can I add it later?

If I create a sqlserver db and don't enable use full text indexing, can I add it later? Currently using sqlserver 2005 but going to be upgrading to 2008. Would there be disadvantages in terms of performance, storage space, etc in allowing for full text editing now although I wouldn't need it for a long time if ever?
