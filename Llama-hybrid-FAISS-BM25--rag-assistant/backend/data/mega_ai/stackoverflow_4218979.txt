Seeing as this is homework, it might not be smart to use techniques you haven't discussed in that course yet. Using only basic methods, you could try creating an array to hold each value of the combinations individually. After each time you create a random number for the combination, check it against all the values in the array. If it is unique, set it as the value for that part of the combination. If it's not unique, come up with another "random" number. This might not be the most elegant solution, but at least it uses methods at what I'm guessing are around your level of programming coursework.
