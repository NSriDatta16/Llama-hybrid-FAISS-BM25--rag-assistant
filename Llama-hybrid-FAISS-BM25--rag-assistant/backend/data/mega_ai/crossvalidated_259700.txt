Ordinal logistic regression for allele frequencies?

I have some data I would like to look at to investigate associations between specific TLR genotypes (wild type, heterozygous, homozygous) and both a binary outcome variable (death) and continues (biomarkers). Would an ordinal logistic regression be appropriate here? Or separate logistic models between the wild type and homozygous, and wild type and heterozygous? When I look at covariates- do i look at associations with TLR or associations with outcome?
