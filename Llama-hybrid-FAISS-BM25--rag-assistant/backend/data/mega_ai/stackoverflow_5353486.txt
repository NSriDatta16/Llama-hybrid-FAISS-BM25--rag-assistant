Ok, got it, make like this: BOOL controlsVisible = NO; for(id views in [[_moviePlayer view] subviews]){ for(id subViews in [views subviews]){ for (id controlView in [subViews subviews]){ controlsVisible = ([controlView alpha] Where _movePlayer is your instance of the player. In the deepest loop, the MPFullScreenVideoOverlay view instance will have alpha == 0.0 if the controls are hidden, or alpha 1.0 if the controls are shown. You can add an observer and fire things as needed. I know is not elegant but it works for me, as Apple has not documented anything regarding this task. Cheers ...
