A simpler approach: There's a 30-minute interval during which he can leave, thus there's a $x/30$ chance of leaving during any given $x$ -minute period. There's a $5/30$ chance of leaving between 6:15 and 6:20, and there'll be a $100\%$ chance of arriving before 7 if he leaves at any point during that interval. There's a $10/30$ chance of leaving between 6:20 and 6:30. At 6:20 there's a $100\%$ chance of arriving before 7. At 6:30 there's a $0\%$ chance of arriving before 7 (since time is continuous, there's a $0\%$ chance of taking exactly 30 minutes). The chance of arriving before 7 decreases linearly between 6:20 and 6:30, because this simply corresponds to (the reverse of) the probability of having the duration of the journey be shorter than some duration, which is linear. We can average these percentages and say there's a $50\%$ chance of arriving before 7 if we leave at some random point between 6:20 and 6:30. There's a $0\%$ chance of arriving before 7 if we leave after 6:30, so we can disregard this. Now we can simply add up the probabilities to get the overall probability: $5/30 * 100\% + 10/30 * 50\% + 0 = 5/30 + 5/30 = 10/30 = 1/3$ So there's a $1/3$ chance of arriving before 7 AM.
