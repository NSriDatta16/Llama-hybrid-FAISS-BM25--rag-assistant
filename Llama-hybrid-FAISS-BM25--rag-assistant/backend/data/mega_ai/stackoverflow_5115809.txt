What are the alternatives to Struts 1.3

My product presently uses Struts 1.3 for web GUI development. This was more or less thrust upon us as an organizational directive. Of late, we are having problems with it. The main main point is its steep learning curve - the new web developers who came into the team recently are used to Spring MVC and require several weeks before getting productive with it. We've had a few discussions on whether we should look for alternatives to Struts 1.3. Our web GUI will soon have a lot of new features going into it and I'm not sure whether it is worth the effort to start from scratch with a new web framework. From what I have gathered by talking to a few experienced web developers (outside my current organization) and from my own research on the Net, Struts 1.3 is a stable, mature and fairly popular (the Apache Struts page claims that it is the most popular web framework, but I take it with a pinch of salt). What are your opinions?
