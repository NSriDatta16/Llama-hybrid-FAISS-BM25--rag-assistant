Depending on how the uuid() function is implemented, this is very bad programming practice - if you try to do this with binary logging enabled (i.e. in a cluster) then the insert will most likely fail . Ivan's suggestion looks it might solve the immediate problem - however I thought this only returned the value generated for an auto-increment field - indeed that's what the manual says . Also what's the benefit of using a uuid()? Its computationally expensive to generate, requires a lot of storage, increases the cost of querying the data and is not cryptographically secure. Use a sequence generator or autoincrement instead. Regardless if you use a sequence generator or uuid, if you must use this as the only unique key on the database, then you'll need to assign the value first, read it back into phpland and embed/bind the value as a literal to the subsequent insert query.
