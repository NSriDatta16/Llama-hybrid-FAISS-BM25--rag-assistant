Yep, your exactly right. The response wasn't being disposed properly. We'd been leaving this upto the garbage collector, which, you guessed it, wasnt being collected in time. Unfortunately, I closed my browser and forgot to read any answers ( lol how stupid do you think I feel ) and the problem is solved. I've learned 2 things tonight. 1, dispose of your WebRequests properly; and 2, PAY MORE ATTENTION TO STACK-OVERFLOW ANSWERS!
