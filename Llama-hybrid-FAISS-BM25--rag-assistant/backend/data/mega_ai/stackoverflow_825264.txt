What pattern should I use to process reports into an infrastructure to allow various representations?

Just starting to learn patterns. Here's a simple question I have. I have an object Report that contains Page s, each of which contains various ReportElement s ( Table , Paragraph , Image ) and so on. Suppose I want to create an infrastructure for taking a Report and spitting various representations of this Report such as an RTF-formatted document, a TeX-formatted document, an HTML document, etc. Which design pattern am I looking for here?
