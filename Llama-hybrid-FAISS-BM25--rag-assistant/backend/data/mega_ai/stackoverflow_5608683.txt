Save information to database after jquery callback

I'm new here and I'm very new at programming but I need some serious hand-by-hand help here. I was searching jquery and found a script to drag and drop stuff on the screen, basicly i just want to move some divs around, thats the easy part, the script I found has a callback function that writes onto the div that you just moved "dropped", this is exactly what I need but instead of writting dropped I want to save the 2 postion variables into a database (mysql), this is so that if I close the browser and open it again the div's will be on the last place I dropped them. Can you help? Is there a jquery user interface with this already built in ? I think this is easy to do with jquery ajax functions right? basicly I should send the serialized data (json right?) into a page that processes that data once its feed into it, then jason returns the handler with success or even with some output right? It would be cool for the dragabble div to have a handler with last know position retrieve by jason from an external page that acts like a buffer to the database. Is this the correct pipeline? Best Regards Joricam
