Have a look at the timestamp property of UITouch Class timestamp The time when the touch occurred or when it was last mutated. (read-only) @property(nonatomic, readonly) NSTimeInterval timestamp Discussion The value of this property is the time, in seconds, since system startup the touch either originated or was last changed. You can store and compare the initial value of this attribute to subsequent timestamp values of the UITouch instance to determine the duration of the touch and, if it is being swiped, the speed of movement. For a definition of the time-since-boot value, see the description of the systemUptime method of the NSProcessInfo class. You should use it with - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; in UIResponder or UIGestureRecognizer classes according to your target OS
