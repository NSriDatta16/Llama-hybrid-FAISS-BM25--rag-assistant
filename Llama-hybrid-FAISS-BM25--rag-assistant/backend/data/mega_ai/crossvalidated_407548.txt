Which machine learning or deep learning model to use / make

I wanted to use machine learning / deep learning to predict profit of a , say, a shop using satellite imagery and previous data and I don't know what to use. I want to use close satellite imagery to check how many shops are clustered in a region and of what type and predict their profit using previous data of regions having similar clustering . For example - if there are 10 Samsung shops in one sq km their profit would be less than 1 Samsung shop in one sq.km (in a popular area) surrounded by different shops as a customer wanting a Samsung product would be more likely to buy from that shop. Using previous data and satellite imagery I want to predict how much the shop would earn depending on its location and previous year profits and profits of shops having similar locations. I don't know what exactly to use for this ( ML or DL, CNN or something else? , Which library ?) I wanna know how to go about this. I also want to know how the data could be mined Thanking you in advance .
