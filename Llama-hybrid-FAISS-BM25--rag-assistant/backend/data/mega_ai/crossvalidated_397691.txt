how to build multiple independent binary logistic regression classifiers?

I have to build a logistic regression classifier to predict $\mathbf{y}$ given $\mathbf{x}$ where $\mathbf{x} \in \Re^{n}$ is an image and $\mathbf{y} \in \Re^{m}$ is a binary attribute vector (of $m$ attributes) with each $y_{i} \in [0,1]$ . The problem statement is that we have to build $m$ independent logistic regression classifiers to learn the mapping $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow y_{i}$ for $i = 1,2,..m$ . I don't think this is a multi-label classification problem since the $m$ classifiers are learnt independently. Kindly help me with the best strategy to solve the above problem. I can use sklearn and keras libraries only. There is no need for code; just let me know the best way to solve the above problem.
