Random state value changes the results of rmse and R2

I want to know why everytime I run my algorithm (XGBoost regressor) with a different random state (applied to train/test split part) I get different values for R2 and RMSE. For example : Random state = 0 -> RMSE = 4.67, R2 = 0.78 Random state = 42 -> RMSE = 8.58, R2 = 0.54
