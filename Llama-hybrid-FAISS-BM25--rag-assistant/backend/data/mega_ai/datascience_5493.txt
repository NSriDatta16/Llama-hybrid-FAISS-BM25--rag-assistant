Post processing with Random Forest

I understand that by filtering out the instances with labels that Random Forest trees are uncertain upon with their decisions, and model these with another classifier could give a better overall result. My question is, how can I "combine" two (or more) classifiers' classification on a single unlabeled dataset?
