android setOnLongClickListner does not work with onTouch event

i have a image view which is drag able and zoom able but now i also need to put setOnLongClickListner on my image view. i have done that but it is not working. but when i disabled the ontouch event it started working. can anybody tell me please how to fix that. here is my code image.layout(0, 30, screenWidth, screenHeight - 30); image.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.FIT_XY); params = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(screenWidth, screenHeight - 30); params.leftMargin = 0; params.topMargin = 30; layout.addView(image, params); image.setOnLongClickListener(new View.OnLongClickListener() { public boolean onLongClick(View v) { Log.i("its working", "its working"); return true; } }); image.setOnTouchListener(this); i,ll be very thankful. thanks a lot.
