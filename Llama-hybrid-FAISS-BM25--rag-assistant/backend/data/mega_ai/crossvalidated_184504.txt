Small business can also take advantage of data science. If you are a restaurant owner and you want to advertise you restaurant via e.g. Groupon, you can use data science to analyze Groupon users and find your targeted customs.

By the way, I've read several articles from data science central about the same topic that you concern. http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/affinity-analysis-cost-effective-data-science-for-smaller-banks-a http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/big-data-analytics-and-business-intelligence-for-better-customer There are many more related articles on data science central.
