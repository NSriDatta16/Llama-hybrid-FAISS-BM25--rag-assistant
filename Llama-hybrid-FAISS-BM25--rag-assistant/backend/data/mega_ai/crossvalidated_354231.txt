based on what I've described, would time series regression be appropriate for this data set? Yes, it would be. You can try following an ARIMA modelling routine: Understand whether your timeseries is stationary. Apply autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analyses (this will enable you to formalize both short term and longer spatial dependencies, including seasonality) Fit a model by choosing an appropriate order: differencing, autocorrelation, seasonal, residuals. Check resulting coefficients and their standard errors. In time series regression, how strict is the requirement for something to be considered "seasonal"? A hypothesis test resulted in rejecting the hypothesis that correlation coefficient is zero. If a time series shows a peak about every 7 seconds (but sometimes 6 and sometimes 8), could that ever be considered a seasonal pattern? Try autocorrelation analysis, using, for example, cor.test() in R, where one of the arguments is your timeseries shifted n lags back (6, 7, 8, etc.).
