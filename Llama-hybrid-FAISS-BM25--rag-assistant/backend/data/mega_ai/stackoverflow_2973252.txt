An OPTIONS request can be used to query a SIP device for capabilities so yes by the letter of the law you should return all supported codecs in the OPTIONS response SDP. One thing to keep in mind is that some user agents, particularly Asterisk, use OPTIONS requests as a keep-alive mechanism and they don't actually care about the response and in fact simply drop it. If processing an OPTIONS request is going to to cost you a bit of processing time keep that fact in mind. On my own SIP Proxy I return a 405 Method Not Supported for OPTIONS requests and have never had any side effects.
