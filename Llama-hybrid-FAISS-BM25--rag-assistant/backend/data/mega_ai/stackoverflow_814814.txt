Wrong: ...and there will be a storage server Good: ...and there will be a farm of (multiple) storage servers with (multiple) load balancers in front of them Put load balancers in front of everything. For now You can have 4 backends, but in the future You can have 400 of them, so it's wise to only manage it on the LB, not all the apps that use the backend. Use multiple levels of cache. Look for popular solutions on speeding thigs up (memcached for example). If You are going to renew a system, do it part-by-part, in multiple small steps. If You do it in one big step (turn off the old one, turn on the new one and pray it will work) it will most probably fail. Use DNS names for stuff, f.e. storage-lb.servicename resolves to addresses of all storage loadbalancers. If You want to add one, just modify the dns, all the services will start using it automaticly. Keep It Simple. The more systems You depend on, the more Your service will suffer from it.
