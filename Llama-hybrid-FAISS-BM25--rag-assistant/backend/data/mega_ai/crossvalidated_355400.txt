From my experience, more data and more features are more important than the fanciest, most stacked, most tuned, model one can come up with. Look at the online advertising competitions that took place. Winning models were so complex they ended up taking a whole week to train (on a very small dataset, compared to the industry standard). On top of that, prediction in a stacked model is longer than in a simple linear model. On the same topic, remember that Netflix never used its 1M$ algorithm because of engineering costs . I would say that online data science competitions are a good way for a company to know "what is the highest accuracy (or any performance metric) that can be achieved" using the data they collect (at some point in time). Note that this actually is a hard problem which is being solved ! But, in the industry, field knowledge, hardware and business constraints usually discourage the use of "fancy modelling".
