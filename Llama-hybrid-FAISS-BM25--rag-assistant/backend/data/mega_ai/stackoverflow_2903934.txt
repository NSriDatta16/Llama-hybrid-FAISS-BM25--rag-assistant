If your problem is the speed then use (vector 1 2 3 4 5) instead of a list, and (aref vec index) to get the element. (defun extract (elems seq) (let ((av (vconcat seq))) (mapcar (lambda (x) (aref av x)) elems))) If you're going to extract from the same sequence many times of course it make sense to store the sequence in a vector just once. Python lists are indeed one-dimensional arrays, the equivalent in LISP are vectors.
