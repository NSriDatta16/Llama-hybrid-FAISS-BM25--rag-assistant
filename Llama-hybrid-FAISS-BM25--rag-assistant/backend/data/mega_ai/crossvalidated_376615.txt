Left hand side (LHS) variables (the y ) under OLS can take on any value. Under logistic regression the (predicted) LHS variable is bounded to min=0, max=1. You can use OLS for binary LHS variables. However, you will likely end up predicting values smaller zero or greater one. If you want to avoid this, use logistic regression. Please note that if you want to use interactions of right hand side variables (the X ), logistic regression is not a good choice. In this case OLS is often used ("linear probability model"), e.g. if you want to study the effect of a treatment (modelled as interaction term(s) in X ) on a binary outcome.
