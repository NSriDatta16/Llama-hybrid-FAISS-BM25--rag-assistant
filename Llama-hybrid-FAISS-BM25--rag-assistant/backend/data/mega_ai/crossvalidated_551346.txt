If by discriminative pricing you mean that n customers could encounter m different prices at a/the same point in time then it's not a problem. You would sample the price for a batch of customers and given the outcomes, you would make the Bayesian update. For example, in the case of Bernoulli bandit, for a single customer, if no purchase was observed, the update would be $\mathsf{Beta}(\alpha, \beta+1)$ , if you observed $m$ purchases and $k$ cases without purchase, the update would just be $\mathsf{Beta}(\alpha + m, \beta+k)$ . The same applies to continuous rewards, you just need to make an update that considers multiple samples.
