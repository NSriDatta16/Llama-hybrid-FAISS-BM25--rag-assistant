It has been my experience that, as per Books Online, TRY...CATCH blocks will trap all events that would generate errors (and, thus, set @@ERROR to a non-zero value). I can think of no circumstances where this would not apply. So no, the return value would never be set to 1111, and it would not be worthwhile to include that @@Error check. However, error handling can be very critical, and I'd hedge my bets for fringe situations such as DTC, linked servers, notification or brokerage services, and other SQL feature that I've had very little experience with. If you can, test your more bizarre situations to see what will actually happen.
