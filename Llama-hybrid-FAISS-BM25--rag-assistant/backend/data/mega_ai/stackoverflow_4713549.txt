Should Front End Engineers/Designers be "decently" aware of the Rich set of User Controls that are provided by frameworks like .NET, Java, RoR etc.?

Should Front End Engineers/Designers be "decently" aware of the Rich set of User Controls that are provided by frameworks like .NET, Java, RoR etc.? This would help convert designs into actual code by Developers a more elegantly as the design would be in the native controls provide by the Framework being used instead of vanilla HTML/CSS/JS? A manager friend of mine( :-) )ask this question to me, I thought it will be a good idea to have your views on this. Feel free to write back your opinions. Thanks in advance.
