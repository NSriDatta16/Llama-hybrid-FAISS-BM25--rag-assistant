Compare means of 2 variables (no individual data available)

Short question: I want to find out whether the means of 2 variables differ significantly. I know how large the dataset is (N~2000), but I only have the mean scores averaged over all participants. I do not have information about standard deviation. Is there a test that can do that? Details: 2 variables x1 and x2 were measured at times t1 and t2. Both increase. I need to compare relative change over time. The relative change for x1 is x1t2 / x1t1. Since the huge majority of subjects at t1 have values of 0 on my x, calculating relative increase is impossible for these (and I would lose 90% of the data). So what I do instead is averaging x1 and x2 scores over the whole population at both measurement points, and then calculate the relative increase of these mean scores. Example: Assume the mean of x1t1 to be 0.5 and the mean of x1t2 to be 2.0. The relative increase is 4 (or 500%). Assume the relative increase of x2 to be 5 (or 600%). Now I want to test whether 4 and 5 differ from each other significantly.
