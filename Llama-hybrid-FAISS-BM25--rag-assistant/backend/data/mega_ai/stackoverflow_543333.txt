Well another obvious benefit is performance, once the SP's are compiled they will execute quicker than SQL in code. You have already stated a major benefit of SP's for larger organisations with an eye on security and control. It makes it easier for your DBA to run an eye over the SQL running against the DB in times of performance issues also as its all in the DB. One disadvantage is portability, if you are writing a commercial application and a customer insists you adapt to their existing DB you'll have a bit more work to do with SP's than for in-line SQL.
