Have a look at SAX which allows you to see each individual part of the XML document as they pass by. You can then take action on text nodes and do the manipulation you need. The problem with XSLT is that most implementations need the whole input tree in memory, which is typically 10 times the size on disk. I only know of the commercial edition of Saxon XSLT transformer which can do streaming XSLT (but that would be perfect for your needs).
