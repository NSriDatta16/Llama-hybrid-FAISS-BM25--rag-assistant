Silence is often useful when segmenting the raw data into suitably sized samples for the machine learning methods. It is practical to run recording for several minutes at a time, but often the input to the machine learning model should for example be 1 second clips. Each clip should avoid cutting of a word midways. Having silence allows to segment words or phrases using a simple threshold algorithm.
