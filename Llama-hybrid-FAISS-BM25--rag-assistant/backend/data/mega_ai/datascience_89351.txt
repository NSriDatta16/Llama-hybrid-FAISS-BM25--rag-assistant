Support vector machines in R: Finding the equation of a hyper plane (in 6 dimensions) and showing it's correct

lin.6d $coefs) %*% svm.lin.6d$ SV # In essence this finds the hyper plane that separates our points c The above code takes the data from an excel file "lin.6d" which contains vector points "X1,X2,X3,X4,X5,X6" and "Class:-1,1". So each vector point has a class 1 or -1. I have plotted the data and colour coded each point depending on it's class (Blue if the point if it's class is -1, red otherwise). I then used the svm function to obtain the coefficients of the hyperplane where: w is the set of coefficients (W1,W2,...,W6) and c is the intercept. hence I got an answer: w=(0.02433109, 0.02803587, -0.02332039, -0.000118514, -0.009224677, -0.02626795) c= 0.1712391 where wx+c=0 is the equation of the hyperplane separating the classes of the points. My question is: How do I know if this is the correct answer? How do I create a visual plot to show this can be represented as a line separating the classes?
