There are 2 other criterion so popular over, L1 et L $_\infty$ criterion. L1 regression, say sum of abs values ! L2 minization (ie quadratic error) is fast (direct), easy computational and well established mathematically, I mean theory around fit well together (Gaussian distribution, derivative = linear, brownian motion, eig/pca, etc...). But in L1 world, mathematics are not so nice, but in some context, outperform the L2 arsenal (l1 = entropy = information minization = compression, compress sensing) Other norm are use, like L $_\infty$ (ie minimize the max) usefull for saturation problem et 0-1 binary variable minization. More generally L $_\alpha$ (ie $||.||_\alpha$ ) could be use with standard IRLS scheme, but L1 is "the minimal norm" keep the formulation convex. And non-convex world is evil, so...
