Blame SVM features for misclassifications

I am classifying webpages based on several features of HTML-structure. I get the best cross-validation results with the RBF-kernel. With a linear kernel, if I understand correctly, it is possible to attribute importance to certain features in the feature vector ( How does one interpret SVM feature weights? ). This would help in correcting the model for certain specific misclassifications (finding the features that 'are to blame' for the mistake). Am I correct when I say that this is not possible for RBF kernels? If so, is there a good way of correcting the model for specific documents that get wrong classifications? Thanks!
