Something like this should work (suggested by orip): ssh-agent bash -c 'ssh-add /somewhere/yourkey; git clone git@github.com:user/project.git' if you prefer subshells, you could try the following (though it is more fragile): ssh-agent $(ssh-add /somewhere/yourkey; git clone git@github.com:user/project.git) Git will invoke SSH which will find its agent by environment variable; this will, in turn, have the key loaded. Alternatively, setting HOME may also do the trick, provided you are willing to setup a directory that contains only a .ssh directory as HOME ; this may either contain an identity.pub, or a config file setting IdentityFile.
