PHP Complete Object Graph not stored in Session

I have read other posts on stack overflow on the issue but my question is a little different.. When storing an object in the Session does PHP save the Complete Object Graph in the session? I am having problems accessing some of the properties of the Object AFTER it is read from the Session. The object i am storing has complex type properties with some of them being objects of classes that inherit from other classes, so serializing the object before storing it in the session might be a little "expensive". What am i missing with Objects and their storage in the Session. Are there limits? Thank you.
