How to fit an ARIMA model with multiple/complex seasonality in R

My dataset contains the following information aggregated into 5-minute intervals over one month: average vehicle speed in km/h time of the observations the day of the week Thus having 288 (12*24) data points a day. I'm trying to predict the average vehicle speed during the peak hours of the day with a seasonality of 24 hours as well as considering the day of the week by including dummy variables as xreg . However, I don't know if this is the right approach to deal with multiple / complex seasonality in daily data. My code is the following: speed $avgVehicleSpeed, frequency = 288) xreg day)+0)[, 2:7] arima However, when running this code the auto.arima function takes FOREVER to run. Even a predetermined ARIMA model with the same inputs takes very long to run. I have a feeling that it's because of frequency = 288. So my question is, why does R takes so long to determine the "best" ARIMA model for the given inputs? Or what am I doing wrong trying to fit the seasonal ARIMA model.
