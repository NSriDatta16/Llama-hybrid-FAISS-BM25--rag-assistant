What is multilinear principal components analysis?

I've gotten a lot of usage out of principal component analysis , and after recently learning the basics of performing canonical polyadic decomposition I was intrigued to learn that there exists a multilinear principal components analysis (MPCA). The trouble is, the wikipedia page doesn't really clarify what it is mathematically. What it says is: MPCA computes a set of orthonormal matrices associated with each mode of the data tensor which are analogous to the orthonormal row and column space of a matrix computed by the matrix SVD. This transformation aims to capture as high a variance as possible, accounting for as much of the variability in the data associated with each data tensor mode(axis). On the face of it this usage of orthogonal matrices along modes of the tensor sounds similar to higher-order singular value decomposition which is a special case of Tucker decomposition . What is multilinear principal components analysis? I just tracked down this lengthy paper which might hold the answer.
