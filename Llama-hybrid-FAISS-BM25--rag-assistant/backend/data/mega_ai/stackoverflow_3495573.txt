I don't know about the rest of your implementation, but it seems likely the 'fragments' you are receiving are NAL units. Therefore each, each may need the the NALU start-code ( 00 00 01 or 00 00 00 01 ) appended when you reconstruct the bitstream before sending it to ffmpeg. At any rate, you might find the RFC for H264 RTP packetization useful: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3984.txt Hope this helps!
