Stouffer method

This is my question: I have to perform a mini-meta-analysis on two studies(independent, balanced sample) with a Repeated measures design and with two within factors. I have the F statistic and the p value of two significant interactions in study 1 and study 2. I want to present a unique p value, so I have to combine the p values. Is it correct to transform the p value in z score and after do I have to average the z scores and find the correspondent p value? Can you suggest a paper with a similar procedure?
