From Here : A global variable in C/C++ is a variable which can be accessed from any module in your program. int myGlobalVariable; This allocates storage for the data, and tells the compiler that you want to access that storage with the name 'myGlobalVariable'. But what do you do if you want to access that variable from another module in the program? You can't use the same statement given above, because then you'll have 2 variables named 'myGlobalVariable', and that's not allowed. So, the solution is to let your other modules DECLARE the variable without DEFINING it: extern int myGlobalVariable; This tells the compiler "there's a variable defined in another module called myGlobalVariable, of type integer. I want you to accept my attempts to access it, but don't allocate storage for it because another module has already done that".
