I'm not sure how the syntax would work in SQLite, but one way would be to parse out the date parts of each [date] field, and then specifying which WEEK and DAY boundaries in your WHERE clause and then GROUP by the week. This will give you a true average regardless of whether there are rows or not. Something like this (using T-SQL): SELECT DATEPART(w, theDate), Avg(theAmount) as Average FROM Table GROUP BY DATEPART(w, theDate) This will return a row for every week. You could filter it in your WHERE clause to restrict it to a given date range. Hope this helps.
