How do you retrieve the class to hide the button?

Given this HTML: What's the correct way to do something like this: $("#buttonId1").click(function () { alert($("#buttonId1").getClass()); } I realize the getClass function does not exist in JQuery or Javascript. But I'm hoping there's some way to approximate it. I have a more complex real world problem that's difficult to boil down into a simple question but basically I think I need to somehow access the class of an element and then use that class string to perform an additional selection such as this: $(("#buttonId1").getClass().filter("world")).hide(); Perhaps there are simpler ways of hiding the buttonId2 in the code I've given - that's not really the point, though. What I'm interested in is how to get at the class and then use that further. The only solution I've come up with so far is use a long branch of if/else statements checking all of the possible classes using the hasClass function. But it's a very inelegant solution. EDIT: Responding to Paolo's answer, perhaps something like this will work to hide button2: $(("#buttonId1").attr('class')[0].filter("world")).hide();
