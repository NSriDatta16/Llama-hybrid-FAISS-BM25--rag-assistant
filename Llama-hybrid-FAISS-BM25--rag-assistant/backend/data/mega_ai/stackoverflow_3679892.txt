AppFabric monitoring issue, events won't travel from ASStagingTable to ASWcfEventsTable

I'm trying to get AppFabric monitoring to work but I'm stuck here. Events are being inserted into the ASStagingTable but they don't propagate to the ASWcfEventsTable. They do if I manually run the ASImportEvents sp. I use SQL server 2008 worksation edition on Windows Server 2008R2. I've verified that the AppFabric Event Collection Service is running (but I guess if it wasn't there wouldn't be any records in the staging table) and SQL Server Agent is running. When I created the database (during the AppFabric configuration) I logged in with SQL server authentication and in the connection string I use are the same credentials. Did I miss anything?
