MCMC uncertainties vanish

I'm trying to fit a signal modelled by a Lorentzian ( $f(x) = \frac{\text{Amplitude}}{1 + 4((x-\text{center})/\text{width}^2)}$ ), thus I have 3 parameters : Amplitude, Central frequency and width . I use uniform priors for Amplitude and Central frequency ( $\frac{1}{\theta_{\max} - \theta_{\min}}$ ), and Jeffreys prior for the width ( $\frac{1}{\theta \ln(\theta_{\max}/\theta_{\min})}$ ). The resulting fit seem to work fine, but the uncertainties vanish , which is problematic. I calculate the uncertainties by taking the 16th, 50th and 84th percentiles to get a Ïƒ deviation (50th - 16th and 84th - 50th) on both sides of the median, after discarding the burn-in steps. Problem is, after the burn-in steps, the walkers are all converged pretty much to the same value, meaning the standard deviation of their distribution vanishes, and so do my uncertainties : $$ \mathrm{{Amplitude}} = 3242_{-23}^{15}, \mathrm{{Central frequency}} = 112.613_{0.000}^{0.000}, \mathrm{{Width\,1}} = 0.116_{0.000}^{0.000} $$ This is a plot of the evolution of the walker's positions in time, showing convergence of the walkers : This is the resulting corner plot, made by discarding the first 400 steps (burn-in) : This is the signal to be fitter with the resulting lorentzian whose parameters were estimated via the MCMC : Any idea why the uncertainties I compute vanish ? If all the walkers finish on the same position in parameter-space, the resulting distribution would be a single peak and have a width of basically 0. How do I reconcile this with the fact that surely, the uncertainty of my fit should not be 0, given my signal is not a perfect lorentzian ?
