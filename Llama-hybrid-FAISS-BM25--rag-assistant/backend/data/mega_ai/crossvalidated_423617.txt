Neural Network - Can I use sigmoid activation function in hidden layers of regression problem?

I am trying to predict for count which ranges from 0 onwards as a regression problem using NN. Can I add sigmoid, tanh or relu activation function to the hidden layers and no activation function to the final layer?
