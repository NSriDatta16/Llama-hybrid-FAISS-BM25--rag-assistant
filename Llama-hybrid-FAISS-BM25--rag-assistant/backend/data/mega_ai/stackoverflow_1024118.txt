As I'm going use C++ I don't want to use XCode, as (I understand) this is primarily used with Objective-C. XCode is a fine choice, even for pure C++ solutions. Work through Accelerated C++. That's the book that got me started! It's an excellent choice, but not a walk in the park. It took me a month or two, at a rate of about 1 to 2 hours a day. But after this you'll have made a MAJOR jump towards becoming a really good C++ programmer. Write a couple of small math-programs; something like the Mandelbrot set, a PDE-solver, or a graphing-app. This would be done using a widget toolkit. Write a small game with really crappy graphics. This is probably going to be a rip-off of Jetmen Revival or Space Invaders ;-) (When I'm fed up with the game not working), work my way through Core Python (this is a book; max. one link/question for new users...). Fine, I did Tetris. Repeat steps 2 and 3 in Python. I have no experience using Python, but I know it's a much easier language to master than C++. So if you can master C++, Python's won't be any problem. For GUI you could use Qt, especially now it has been made LGPL. However, Cocoa is interesting as well, if feel courageous enough to also learn Objective-C :) (Btw, there is a Python port for Cocoa as well.)
