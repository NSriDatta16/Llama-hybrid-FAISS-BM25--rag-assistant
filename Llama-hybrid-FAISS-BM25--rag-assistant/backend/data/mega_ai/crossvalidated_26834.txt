Which statistical test should I use when there are multiple latent predictors and multiple latent outcomes?

I am doing my research on Personality (the big five factors) and if personality can predict commitment to an organization. However, commitment is composed of three dimensions. What is the best method I can use when trying to link the big five factors of personality with commitment to an organization?
