The logic behind this exists though hard to get used to. regarding your first note, about the naming of the first param, Apple encourage you to name your methods as follows: +(void)myMethodWithArg1:(int)arg1 Arg2:(int)arg2 Arg3:(int)arg3; thus making the name readable like a sentence in english (my method had Arg1 of type int, Arg2 of type int, etc) regarding the named params and the inability to change the order, that makes no sence to me either and the comment above me is correct, you are missing those annoying : after the params In addition, the syntax of ObjC has strong relation to that of Smalltalk ( http://www.smalltalk.org/main/ ) I'd encourage you to read on that and the relation between the two languages hope this helps
