If your "local server" is accessible via the network, there should be no problem, I suppose -- after all, that's the way Internet works. The question is : can you access your server from another computer on your network ? If yes... well, just try with Magento ;-) The problems that might occur would be related to stuff like firewall, or that kind of things -- and we cannnot guess about those : it'll depend on the setup of your computers and network. If you are asking this question, maybe it's because you are experiencing some difficulty when doing so ? If so, what is the problem you are having ?
