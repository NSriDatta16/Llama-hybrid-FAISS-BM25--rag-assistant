How about something like this: Content goes here Set a height on #overflowHidden and, when the content changes in #contentContainer , check the height compared to that of #overflowHidden and set the overflow attribute on #overflowHidden as appropriate. Not the most elegant solution, but it would be fairly easy to turn on and off (for testing v. production).
