transfer file from mobile phone to another via bluetooth

I've been searching high and low on this problem. Still can't find the solution. Basically, I want to transfer an encrypted file via OBEX Push Service (bluetooth) from client (j2me) to server (j2me). In emulator, it works fine. Client able to successfully do a bluetooth discovery lookup on the server. But, when I put the application inside my phone. It doesn't show anything at all. I guess it might be a server or client url problem. Can anyone help me? Here's some of my code (most probably is this that cause my problem). (Client) discoveryAgent.searchServices(null,new UUID[] { new UUID(1105) }, (RemoteDevice) list.getRemoteDevices().elementAt(i), this); (Server) sn = (SessionNotifier) Connector.open( "btgoep://localhost:1105;name=ObexPushServer;authenticate=false;master=false;encrypt=false"); I tried replacing 1105 (in the server) with "00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF", but still the same result.
