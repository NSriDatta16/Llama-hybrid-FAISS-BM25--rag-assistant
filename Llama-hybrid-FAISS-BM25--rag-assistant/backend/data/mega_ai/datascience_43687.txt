RVM is identical to SVM, but provides a probability distribution of scores. RVM: Pros: RVM is better than SVM in terms of accuracy.(depends on size of training data), more training data implies more accuracy in RVM. (argued and experimentally shown in the paper [ 1 ]) Since it provides the probability distribution of score, not a point estimate. It opens up a variety of options to get point estimate out of Bayesian inference, like percentile, mean, median, average. Cons: Since it uses EM algorithm for learning, it might get stuck at local minima. Large data is required for learning SVM: Pros: Standard SVM is a convex optimization problem(both hard and soft), therefore they always produce unique solution i.e. converge to global optima. There is one very good paper about this.
