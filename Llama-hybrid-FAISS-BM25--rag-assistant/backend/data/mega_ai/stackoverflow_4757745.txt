The Dojo toolkit has a quite useful system to deal with HTML fragments/templates. Let's say the HTML snippet mycode/mysnippet.tpl.html is something like the following Notice the dojoAttachPoint attribute. You can then make a widget mycode/mysnippet.js using the HTML snippet as its template: dojo.declare("mycode.mysnippet", [dijit._Widget, dijit._Templated], { templateString: dojo.cache("mycode", "mysnippet.tpl.html"), construct: function(bar){ this.bar = bar; }, buildRendering: function() { this.inherited(arguments); this.foo.innerHTML = this.bar; } }); The HTML elements given attach point attributes will become class members in the widget code. You can then use the templated widget like so: new mycode.mysnippet("A cup of tea would restore my normality.").placeAt(someOtherDomElement); A nice feature is that if you use dojo.cache and Dojo's build system, it will insert the HTML template text into the javascript code, so that the client doesn't have to make a separate request. This may of course be way too bloated for your use case, but I find it quite useful - and since you asked for techniques, there's mine. Sitepoint has a nice article on it too.
