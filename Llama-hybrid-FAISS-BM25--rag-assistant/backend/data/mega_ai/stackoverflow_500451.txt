Since you are on Linux I'd suggest to use asprintf() - it it GNU extension that allocates string for you. And thanks to C99 variadic macros you don't need to mess with varagrs. So your macro would look like: #define MY_PRINT(...) do { \ char *data; \ asprintf(&data, __VA_ARGS__); \ printf("%s", data); \ other_print(data); \ free(data); \ } while (0) NB! This is C99 and GNU-only code Edit: Now it will evaluate macro arguments just once so calling macro with something like ("%d", i++) will work correctly.
