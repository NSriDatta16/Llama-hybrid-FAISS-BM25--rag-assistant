It sounds like your classification task simply has a time-series aspect to it. You could look through previous questions tagged both "time-series" and "classification" . How to leverage this will depend on how specifically the time impacts the class membership. You could have seasonality (in summer, class foo is more likely than bar), which can often be handled by periodic transformations, e.g., harmonics or periodic Gaussian splines. You might have multiple-seasonalities (foo is more likely than bar on Mondays, but the effect is more pronounced in summer than in winter). You could have long- or short-term trends. Or you could have interaction s between time and other features.
