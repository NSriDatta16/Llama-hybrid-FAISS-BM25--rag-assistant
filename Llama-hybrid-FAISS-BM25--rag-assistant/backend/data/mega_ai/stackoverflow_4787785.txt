Can SharedPreferences be shared among different Android applications?

As I checked in APIs description for getSharedPreferences(String, int),Second attribute is defining accessibility mode and can take 0 or MODE_PRIVATE for the default operation, MODE_WORLD_READABLE and MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE to control permissions. But there is this small note in API description: Note: currently this class (android.content.SharedPreferences) does not support use across multiple processes. This will be added later. Moreover in Mark L. Murphy book "beginning Android 2" he mentioned: (Eventually, preferences might be shareable across applications, but that is not supported as of the time of this writing) Im so confused! does this mean that MODE_WORLD_READABLE and MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE of getSharedPrefrences is there but NOT SUPPORTED YET in latest API level??? Thanks! Migan
