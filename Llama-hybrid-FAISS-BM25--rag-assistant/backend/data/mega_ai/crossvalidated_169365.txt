I'm not sure that I understand correctly. You say that the time-frame is fixed at three months. Does this mean that you only have data on survival yes/no after three months? In that case, you need to do a logistic regression. But if you have the date of death for each patient that dies, you can apply a Cox regression in principle. The problem is that your dependent variable seems to be continuous. You then have to assume that there is a linear effect on the hazard ratio for the drug injected. So the difference between injecting 10 mg and 20 mg is assumed to be the same as the difference between injecting 30 mg and 40 mg. If you can make this assumption (which seems dubious to me) then you can use the variable as it is, but if not, you might want to divide the variable in categories, e.g. quintile groups, and convert these groups into dummy variables for use in the analysis.
