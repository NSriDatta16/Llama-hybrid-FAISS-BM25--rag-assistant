I note that the standard modules are just imported: it's the other modules that are reloaded. I expect whoever wrote this code wanted to be able to easily reload the whole package (so as to get their latest edits). After putting in all these redundant reload calls, the programmer only had to write >>> reload(package) to bring things up to date in the interpreter, instead of having to type >>> reload(package.nrrd) >>> reload(package.sm) >>> reload(package.tensPP) etc. So please ignore the suggestion that you commit violence against the programmer who wrote this: they are far from the only programmer who's had trouble with reloading of dependencies. Just encourage them to move the reloads to a convenience function.
