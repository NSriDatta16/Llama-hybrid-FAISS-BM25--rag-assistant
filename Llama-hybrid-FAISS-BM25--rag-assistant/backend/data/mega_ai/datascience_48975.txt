How to cluster text-based software requirements

I'm beginner in deep learning and I'd like to cluster text-based software requirements by themes (words similarities/frequency of words) using neural networks. Is there any example/tutorial/github code of unsupervised neural network that groups texts based on themes and words similarities? Thank you very much for your answers!
