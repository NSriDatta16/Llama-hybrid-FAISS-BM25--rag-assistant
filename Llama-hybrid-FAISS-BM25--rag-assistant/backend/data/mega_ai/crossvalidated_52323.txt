PCA on returns or levels?

I am doing a PCA on a few economic indices (which I standardized) (24 timeseries). When doing the PCA on the values/level of the index, I get rather similar loadings on each index, which I think is good, as no one should dominate. However when I run it on the returns of these standardized indices, the loadings are much more extreme on 1 or 2 and almost none for the rest. Also when doing PCA on both levels and returns, I only get non negligible loadings on the levels! What is the interpretation of this, how are these different results possible? Additional info: I am doing it in matlab with the princomp function
