Inherit it and find the controls in the control tree, and set attributes as appropriate. protected override void OnPreRender(EventArgs e) { base.OnPreRender(e); (this.Controls[6] as CheckBox).Disabled = true; } Obviously this is fragile if the control will modify its output depending on other properties, or if you upgrade the library; but if you need a workaround, this will work.
