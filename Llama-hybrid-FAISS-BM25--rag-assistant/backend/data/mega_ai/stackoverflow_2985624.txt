If it's any consolation, you're not alone. Somebody commented on another answer of mine on SO recently, saying the same thing. It started with HTML 4, so if you learnt your HTML before 1998/9, the change was not a major one compared to the other changes and therefore not the easiest thing to notice. I didn't really start to learn HTML until 2001, so HTML 4 was where I began.
