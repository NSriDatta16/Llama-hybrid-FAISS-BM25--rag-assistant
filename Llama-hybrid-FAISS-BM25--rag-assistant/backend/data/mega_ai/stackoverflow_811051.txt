The trees are most likely abstract syntax trees (AST) and any compiler book will teach that. The dragon book is a very classic one, at the class I took we used The essence of compilers by Robin Hunter, ISBN 0-13-727835-7. You should also be able to find tons of material from different colleges and universities with some good search terms (compiler design, AST, lexical analysis, top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing, semantic analysis, LL, LR).
