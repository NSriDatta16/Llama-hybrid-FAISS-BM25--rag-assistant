In your view configuration page there should be a field: Exposed form in block. If this is checked then views will create a block with the filters on it rather than embedding it in the view itself. This block can be placed from the block configuration screen and you can make it show on any pages that you want. I think the option lived under the Filter section in Views 2, in Views 3 it's in its own place called Exposed Form.
