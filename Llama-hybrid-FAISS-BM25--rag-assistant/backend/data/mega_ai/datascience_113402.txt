Reducing the dimensionality of entire dataset

I have a lot of datasets with different shapes. For example few of them are (90, 892), (74, 853), (93, 765), ... etc. I want to convert this shape to (90, 4 ), (74, 4 ), (93, 4 ) ... (x, 4 ). And, after this I will pass the updated data to a quantum machine learning model with 4 qubits and wires. I want to transform the entire data into the above mentioned shape rather than splitting the data into train and test. Do I need to use dimensionality reduction techniques for getting the expected result? If yes, what technique do I need to follow. Any sample code will be really helpful Thanks in advance
