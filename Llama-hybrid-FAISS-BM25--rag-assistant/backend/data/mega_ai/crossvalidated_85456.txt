What makes you think that time has any effect on the dependent variable? I'd suggest plotting the dependent variable against time to gauge what sort of model might be useful. Both approaches - a linear (or non-linear) time trend and seasonal dummy variables might be necessary. (Normally dummy variables are used for seasonal or calendar effects or shocks). If you fit a dummy time variable for every time period and you don't have many observations per time period you could easily end up over fitting. Also, if you use a series of independent dummy variables you have no idea what the effect of the next time period will be - since it will be independent as well. This makes it less useful for forecasting than other ways of using time in a model. Perhaps an even more complex process such as ARIMA might be useful. Something like the forecast package in R might be useful for understanding the time series. For fitting a model you might want to look beyond OLS and consider auto-regressive or dynamic regression models.
