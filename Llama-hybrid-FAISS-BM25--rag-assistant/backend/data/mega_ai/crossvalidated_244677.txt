How to decide between PCA and logistic regression?

I´ve been studying some advanced statistics, but some concepts and differences between methods are hard to grasp. Let´s say I have a large group of individuals, each with a set of variables like age, height, IQ and so on. They can either belong to a Criminal group or NotCriminal group. If I wanted to evaluate which characteristics are more likely to influence if someone is a criminal or not, should I use PCA or logistic regression?
