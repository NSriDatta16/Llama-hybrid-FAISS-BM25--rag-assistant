I had a similar issue recently where I was using jQuery v1.3.2 on a page but a 3rd party questionnaire popup was using an older version on the same page. I eventually managed to solve the problem. I referenced jQuery 1.3.2 as follows: jq132 = jQuery.noConflict(true); I then modified all my jQuery code to use jq132 instead of $. I then did a find and replace on all of the plugins I was using to replace "$(" with "jq132(" and "$." with "jq132.". There may be a more elegant approach but this worked for me. I'm far from a jQuery expert so there may be other $ syntax that you need to handle (i.e. not just "." and "(").) .
