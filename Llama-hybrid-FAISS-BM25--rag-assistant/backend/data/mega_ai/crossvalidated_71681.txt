Normal distribution for discrete values

I understand that a normal distribution is a continuous distribution, but I came across this question in my test set that baffles me. Question: The toy cars produced in a factory have an average weight of 20 lb. The standard deviation of the individual toy cars is 3 lb. We know the weights of each toy car follow a normal distribution. Compute the proportion of 200 toy cars that weigh 14 lb each.
