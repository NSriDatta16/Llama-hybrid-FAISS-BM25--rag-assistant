Neural Network "Breeding"

I just watched a Google tech talk video covering "Polyworld" (found here ) and they talk about breeding two neural networks together to form offspring. My question is, how would one go about combining two neural networks? They seem so different that any attempt to combine them would simply form a third, totally unrelated network. Perhaps I'm missing something, but I don't see a good way to take the positive aspects of two separate neural networks and combine them into a single one. If anyone could elaborate on this process, I'd appreciate it.
