Neural network model to predict treatment outcome

I want to predict the outcome of a particular treatment (remitted or not) using demographic, plasma biomarker, genetic, and clinical data. IS a neural network model the best way of doing this? What advantages does this have over traditional logistic regression model building? How limited am I with only 120 cases and up to 40 covariates, depending on collinearity? How do I pare these down? I would normally tend towards factor analysis but will a neural net combine collinear variables sensibly? Any ideas on combining multimodal data like that would be helpful, or a starting point for reading - already have Ripley's MASS.
