You could do what you want to do very quickly using str.translate. However it is not readily apparent why you would want to do that. What I would call normalising in a language written in a Latin-based alphabet would include lowercasing, normalising whitespace, and stripping accents etc so that the result was ASCII. The purpose of doing that would be not for display but for comparing user-entered text in some kind of fuzzy search/match/lookup scenario. The point being that mistakes of accent etc are quite common even with native writers of the languages in question. Given the role that Hiragana plays in the Japanese writing system (words often have a Kanji stem and Hiragana suffixes) I can't imagine any use for changing Hiragana characters to Katakana ... please enlighten me.
