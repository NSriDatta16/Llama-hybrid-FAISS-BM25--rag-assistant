I wouldn't suggest the resizing option. Start simple and work your way up. A queue of byte buffers which gets a new one added to the end when it is exhausted would be a good start. You will probably have to pay attention to threading issues, so my advice would be to use somebody else's thread-safe queue implementation. Next you can take a look at the more complex "pointers" into a big byte array chunk, except my advice would be to have a queue of 4k/16k (some power of two multiple of the page size) blocks that you index into, and when it is full you add another big chunk to the queue. Actually, I don't recommend this at all due to the complexity and the dubious gain in performance. Start simple, work your way up. Pool of buffers, make it thread safe, see if you need anything more.
