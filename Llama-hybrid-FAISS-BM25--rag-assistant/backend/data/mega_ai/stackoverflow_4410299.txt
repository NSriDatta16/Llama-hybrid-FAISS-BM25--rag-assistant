Forcing developers to set properties in a particular order is a dangerous design: it makes the interface misleading and encourages mistakes. Instead, consider making EmploymentInformation objects immutable: // Constructor for retired / unemployed people public class EmploymentInformation(EmploymentStatus status) {} // Constructor for self-employed people - we know their status public class EmploymentInformation(string occupation) {} // Constructor for people employed by others - we know their status public class EmploymentInformation(string occupation, Company employer) {} public bool IsEmployed { get; } public string Occupation { get; } public Company Employer { get; }
