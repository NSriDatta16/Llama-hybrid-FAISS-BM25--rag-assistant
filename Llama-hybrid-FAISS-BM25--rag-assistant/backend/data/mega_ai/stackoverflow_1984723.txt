Organizing a CMake project so that sources can be easily browsed in Visual C++

(I'm new to CMake and I am not so familiar with Visual Studio.) I need to implement a relatively big library the solution/project files will be generated by CMake, and my problem is that I would like the organization of the files in VC GUI to reflect the directory structure on the disk. Basically, the library is split into different parts. For instance one of them is called "common" and will implement some headers used by the library. On the disk it will be in a specific "common" directory, which may have one or more subdirectory. src/ common/ ... portfolio/ ... asset/ contracts/ physical_assets/ ... mathutils/ ... I'd like to have the see the same thing within Visual Studio's Solution Explorer, but I only know how to split the solution into different projects. How can I do that?
