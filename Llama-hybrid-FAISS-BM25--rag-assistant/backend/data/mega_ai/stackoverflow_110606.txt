I doubt whether you have 3000 developers in your organisation all working on the same code base. I work for a medium-large software company, and we probably don't have that many in the entire company, but there are also many independent projects. Internally some groups deliver releases to other groups to use in their products; this is not managed through a SCM system. Our own group has its own SCM but there are only about 25 active developers. We use CVS, and to be quite honest it's not really up to it (we'd migrate but have a lot of scripts / commit hooks and other bits & pieces which need a lot of work to change). The problem with using CVS on a reasonable size code base is that many operations are very slow and involve locking other developers out.
