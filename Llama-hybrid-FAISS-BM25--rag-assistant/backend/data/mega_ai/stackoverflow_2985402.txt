Annotations are metadata, information about information - in this case your code. With annotations, you can provide hints and clues to the consumer of the annotation, such as the compiler or the code itself at runtime. I have used them carefully on a few occasions, where their presence replaced the need for some other boolean comparison evaluating to true, and the attributes provided further information about what actually needed to be done because the annotation was present. Regarding what you can't do with annotations .. I'm not sure how to answer that. Use them if they solve a real problem or make your code more elegant, but don't force it. Pardon me possibly over-simplifying things.
