Using word embeddings with additional features

I have the set of queries for classification task using Gradient Boosting Classifier of scikit learn. I want to enrich the model by feeding additional features along with GloVe. How should I approach scaling in this case? GloVe is already well scaled, however, features are not. I have tried StandardScaler, but this reduced the performance in comparison with just using GloVe. The problem maybe with the feature itself, however, I need your opinion on scaling starategies in case of glove and dummy variable.
