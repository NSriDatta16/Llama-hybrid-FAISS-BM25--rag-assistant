How explainable is Linear Discriminant Analysis?

In a survey paper on the interpretability of various machine learning algorithms, I didn't find Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). I wonder how explainable is LDA to audiences not familiar with machine learning? The idea behind LDA seems intuitive - finding some linear combinations of the original variables where the two classes are separated the most. So this is similar to extracting "hidden" features and use them for classification. Following this line of thought, would LDA be considered as less explainable on the spectrum?
