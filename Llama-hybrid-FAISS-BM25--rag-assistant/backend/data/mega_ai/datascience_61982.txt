Minimal example: Keras functional API & multi-input/multi-output regression

Problem: I have a regression problem, where I want to predict two or more numerical outcomes $y_i$ based on a number of numerical features $X_i$ . The model would look like: $$y_{1,i}, y_{2,i} = \beta X_i + u_i.$$ I understand that the Keras functional API could be used to solve a problem like this. In an NN setting I would use ordinary densely connected layers to solve the problem. However, I have no experiance with the functional API and I'm not sure if the problem can be solved (at all) using the functional API. Question: Can someone point me to a full-fledged minimal example on how to use the functional API for multi-input/multi-output regression as outlined above? Ideally, I'm looking for something like the code examples provided for more basic problems as described in " Deep learning with R " (code can be Python or R as I work with both). Any additional comments on model/method choice are highly appreciated as well. However, please note that I don't want to estimate/train individual models for each outcome $y_i$ , I really aim at predicting all outcomes in one model.
