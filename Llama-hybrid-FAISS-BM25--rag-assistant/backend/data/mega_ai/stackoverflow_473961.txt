Best way to create a "runner" script in Python?

I have a bunch of Python modules in a directory, all being a derivate class. I need a "runner" script that, for each module, instantiate the class that is inside it (the actual class name can be built by the module file name) and than call the "go" method on each of them. I don't know how many modules are there, but I can list all of them globbing the directory via something like "bot_*.py" I think this is something about "meta programming", but how could be the best (most elegant) way to do it?
