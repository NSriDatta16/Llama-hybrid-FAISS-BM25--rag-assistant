The other answers address what's probably your actual question. But just to add a more concrete viewpoint: if you're already a Bayesian (for small/medium datasets) and you get a large data, why not use the methodology you're familiar with? It will be relatively slow but you are familiar with the steps so you're less likely to make mistakes and you're more likely to spot problems. And a Bayesian workflow includes things like posterior predictive checks, etc, which are useful for understanding your model.
