Thanks Robert, Unfortunately sortEnd is only run when you click on a column heading to sort by. It doesn't work on the initial sort... Instead I created a new widget like so: jQuery.tablesorter.addWidget({ id: "highlightNewFolder", // format is called when the on init and when a sorting has finished format: function(table) { if(jQuery("#new_foldername").length > 0){ jQuery("#new_foldername").focus(); } } }); This now works. Unfortunately I had to drop the selecting/highlighting of all the text. For some reason when the code had 'select()' within it, not even the focusing worked: jQuery("#new_foldername").focus(function() { jQuery(this).select(); } ); If anyone has any ideas on how to focus AND highlight all text, then that would be much appreciated!
