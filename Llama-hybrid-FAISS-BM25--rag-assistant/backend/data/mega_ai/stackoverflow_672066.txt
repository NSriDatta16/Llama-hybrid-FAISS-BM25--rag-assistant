I would simply set the Drop="tvDrop" and DragOver="tvDragOver" on the StackPanel in the HierarchicalDataTemplate's ItemTemplate. This way 1) You don't have any risk of getting an event when something is dropped out of a group 2) You can safely cast the Sender to a FrameworkElement and get the DataContext and cast it to your class. You can also set a different handler on the treeview itself if you need to support dragging out of the groups.
