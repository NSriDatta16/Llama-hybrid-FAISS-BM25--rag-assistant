What is bad, good and excellent metric score for time series model?

I have created a couple of models for my master project and I used several metrics for evaluation. I used MSE, MAE, MAPE, RMSE not because I really learned about them a lot, because I saw in many other projects these metrics being used. Now I have a problem, I need to interpret results. I search for some articles or some studies that classify metrics performance as good or bad or excellent. The only material I found now is this one . With this interpretation MAPE It would be nice to provide this formal or informal interpretation for each of the metrics MSE, MAE, MAPE, RMSE specifically for time series prediction problems.
