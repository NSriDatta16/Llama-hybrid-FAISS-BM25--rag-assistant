Is Coarsened Exact Matching superior to other matching methods in case-control studies?

When used successfully to balance the covariate distributions in the treatment and control groups, is it safe to say Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) is the best method for finding an unbiased estimate of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)? I'm not aware of any research comparing CEM with more recent methodologies. Perhaps one limitation with CEM is selecting the correct subset of matching variables if there are hundreds or thousands to choose from. One strategy is to select the top $k$ variables for CEM by ranking their coefficients from an OLS regression, but this isn't guaranteed to find the optimal subset.
