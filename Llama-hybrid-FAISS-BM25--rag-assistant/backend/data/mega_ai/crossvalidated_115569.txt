Interpretation of clogit coefficients (Survival package in R)

Still very very new to R! I've run a conjoint (choice) experiment that uses the function clogit. Output as follows: (this model has been obtained through stepwise methods) clogout3a clogout3a Call: clogit(RES ~ ASC + Tasmania + Import + Price + strata(STR), data = dataset1) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p ASC 2.096 8.135 0.1270 16.51 0.0e+00 Tasmania 0.457 1.580 0.1053 4.34 1.4e-05 Import -0.172 0.842 0.1330 -1.29 2.0e-01 Price -0.526 0.591 0.0505 -10.41 0.0e+00 Likelihood ratio test=512 on 4 df, p=0 n= 3402, number of events= 1134 > gofm(clogout3a) Rho-squared = 0.2053607 Adjusted rho-squared = 0.20215 Akaike information criterion (AIC) = 1987.965 Bayesian information criterion (BIC) = 2008.099 Number of coefficients = 4 Log likelihood at start = -1245.826 Log likelihood at convergence = -989.9825 As an example, would I be corrected in saying that the odds of choosing a Tasmania product would be 1.58 times higher than the base (in this case a generic Australian product)? Or is it correct to say that a person is 1.58 times more likely to choose a product if it is a Tasmania product? (Or are this statements saying exactly the same thing??). I've tried to find examples but have had no luck. Thanks in advance!
