Is the reason behind the result from the fact that DNN algorithms require a large-sized data? There are parallels to time-series and tabular data. A recent work Tabular Data: Deep Learning is Not All You Need shows similar trends that DNN does not out perform conventional models on tabular data. However, it is right that the learning capacity of DNNs are advantageous when there are very large datasets. More justice to deep learning would be to say this is an open research area and DNNs have great potential over conventional time-series models.
