There are several differences, but the most important I can think about are : InnoDB is a transactionnal engine -- i.e. it supports transactions InnoDB supports foreign keys MyISAM only does lock at the table level -- InnoDB does locks at the row level The wikipedia entry on InnoDB lists a couple if differences -- some of which I didn't spoke about ;-) And you could be interested by the Chapter 13. Storage Engines section of the MySQL manual, which is probably not a bad reference, when it comes to InnoDB and MyISAM. Especially, I'd say : 13.5. The MyISAM Storage Engine 13.6. The InnoDB Storage Engine and 13.1. Comparing Transaction and Nontransaction Engines
