Trying to Estimate Disease Prevalence from Fragmentary Test Results

In response to the spread of COVID-19 disease, all Californians were ordered on 19 March 2020 to stay at home, except for such necessary errands as trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. On 21 March the San Francisco Chronicle reported that about $11\,500$ tests for the virus have been completed so far with $1206$ positive results among them. Can anything useful be said about the prevalence of the virus in California based on these results? If (a) the 11500 tests were from randomly chosen Californians and (b) the tests were of "gold standard" quality, then prevalence would be close to $1206/11500 = 0.1049 \approx 10.5\%.$ However, according to the Chronicle article, guidelines have centered on testing people showing symptoms of COVID-19 disease, care workers who have had contact with COVID-19 patients, and people who have symptoms of pneumonia, but test negative for pneumonia. Moreover, tests are "coming from a growing list of private companies, private labs, and public and private universities," so there is no way to know proportions of false positives and false negatives for any one test, let alone the overall rates for whatever mix of tests accounts for the 11,500 reported results. In my answer below, I will extend my answer to this question to give prevalence values resulting from various assumptions about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests involved. I use the notation of that page. This analysis may help to answer the question for whatever population produced the specimens tested. Additional answers are welcome, perhaps showing alternative methods or based on additional information that may become available as the pandemic continues
