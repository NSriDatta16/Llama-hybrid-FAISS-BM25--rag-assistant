As others have pointed out, you can just use an &amp; escape sequence. However, the more elegant approach is not to deal directly with the XML at all. var doc = new XmlDocument(); var batch = doc.CreateElement("Batch"); var field = doc.CreateElement("field"); field.InnerText = "http://mylink.com/page.aspx?id=1&disp=2" batch.Children.AppendChild(field); No need to worry about escaping anything, this way. :)
