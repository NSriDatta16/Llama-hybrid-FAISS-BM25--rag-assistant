Mixed Effects Ordinal Logistic Regression with Lasso

I have data where the outcome is ordinal (1-5) scale. I have about 500k observations that are nested into groups. The predictors are age, gender, job, and 200-300 questions (yes/no/no response). I'd like to use the LASSO to fit the following model ord.resp ~ (1|group) + age*gender + job + quest1*age*gender+quest1*job+ ... quest200*age*gender+quest200*job After some research, it looks like glmmLasso was my best bet because glmnetcr does not allow for random intercepts. I wrote a for loop to specify the model above, without the random intercept model.dat Note the package details suggest using as.factor(), but I have interactions. I attempted to simply put the interactions in the as.factor() call as suggested on another post here ; however this yields a parsing error (I think the formula is too many characters long.) Error in str2lang(x) : :2:0: unexpected end of input With the interactions (no as.factor), the model won't attempt to run -- I get the following error: Error in blockstand(X, ipen.which, inotpen.which) : Block belonging to columns 66, 1135 has not full rank! In addition: Warning message: In split.default((1:ncol(X))[-inotpen.which], ipen) : data length is not a multiple of split variable Without the interactions, it pops an error that it needs 20gb of memory. The following model DOES fit in glmnetcr ord.resp ~ age*gender + job + quest1*age*gender+quest1*job+ ... quest200*age*gender+quest200*job using modframe Questions: Is it possible to ask which features are causing the issues with glmmLasso? Is it possible to simply plug-in model matrices into glmmLasso, like glmnetcr? Is there another package that I'm missing that might work better?
