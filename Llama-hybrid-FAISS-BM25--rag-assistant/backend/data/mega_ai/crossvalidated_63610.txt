A general framework which addresses your problem is called dimensionality reduction. You would like to project data from N dimensions to 2 dimensions, while preserving the "essential information" in your data. The most suitable method depends on the distribution of your data, i.e. the N-dimensional manifold. PCA will fit a plane using least squares criterion. This will probably work poorly for the "swiss roll" example: swiss roll . More modern methods include Kernel PCA, LLE, diffusion maps and sparse dictionary representations. Regarding distance preservation, some methods can preserve non-euclidean distances.
