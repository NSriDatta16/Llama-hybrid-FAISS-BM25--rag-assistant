Why doesn't deep learning work as well in regression as in classification?

there is a lot of research where deep learning works so well with classification but not in regression field SVR, tree-based approach is still good and I couldn't find good architecture about regression well there is some scheme you have to follow when implementing deep regression but I want to know why it doesn't work well as classification any good theory or explanation why deep learning (mlp) doesn't work as well as classification? I want to dig into this problem
