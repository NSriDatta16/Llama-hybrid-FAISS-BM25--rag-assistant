You can use TGridPanel.CellRect to get the bounding rectangle for each of the cells. Here's an example of how to use CellRect : // GP: TGridPanel // This is the "OnDragDrop" handler. procedure TForm13.GPDragDrop(Sender, Source: TObject; X, Y: Integer); var DropPoint: TPoint; CellRect: TRect; i_col, i_row: Integer; begin if Source = Panel1 then // Simple test, is this a drop I want to handle? begin DropPoint := Point(X, Y); // Where did the suer drop? We need this so we can easily call PtInRect for i_col := 0 to GP.ColumnCollection.Count-1 do for i_row := 0 to GP.RowCollection.Count-1 do begin CellRect := GP.CellRect[i_col, i_row]; // Get the bounding rect for Col[i_col, i_row] if PtInRect(CellRect, DropPoint) then begin // Panel1 was dropped over Cell[i_col, i_row] end; end; end; end;
