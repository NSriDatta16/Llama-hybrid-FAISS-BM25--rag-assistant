Lazy learner: Just store Data set without learning from it Start classifying data when it receive Test data So it takes less time learning and more time classifying data Eager learner: When it receive data set it starts classifying (learning) Then it does not wait for test data to learn So it takes long time learning and less time classifying data Hint : In supervised learning Some examples are : Lazy : K - Nearest Neighbour, Case - Based Reasoning Eager : Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks
