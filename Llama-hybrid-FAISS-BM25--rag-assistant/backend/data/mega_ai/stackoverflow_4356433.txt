No, it will be called once. This: foreach (functionWithComplicatedComputationReturningAnArray() as $key => $value) { ... } is semantically equivalent to: $tmp = functionWithComplicatedComputationReturningAnArray(); foreach ($tmp as $key => $value) { ... } (ignoring the fact that the second one will leak the value outside the foreach loop).
