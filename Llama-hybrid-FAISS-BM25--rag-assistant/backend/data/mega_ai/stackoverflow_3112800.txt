I'm going to put in a plug for Star Rover and Freekick , for a few reasons: They're games, so they have that "wow" factor for students (albeit with fairly limited playability right now -- Freekick essentially plays against itself, and if you can kill an enemy in Star Rover, you're a better gamer than I am). The developer wrote a very informative blog that will help students get an idea about the learning curve. Both games some very simple code fragments that students will be able to understand immediately: the Tree module, for instance, or the radians-to-degrees conversion function. Library dependencies are relatively minimal: OpenGL and SDL, mostly. Good luck, and hope this helps.
