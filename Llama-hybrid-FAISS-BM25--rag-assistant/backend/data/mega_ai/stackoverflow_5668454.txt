Need some external advices for designing this class diagram!

Summary I have to modernize an application written in FORTRAN that, in short, is responsible for demographic projections through years. As such, I have an initial population given as an input. This initial population is categorized by years of age, that is, the sum of all numbers per year of age represents the total population for this year. Let's take a look on data for a few seconds. Year: 2009 Age 0: 43786.0000 Age 1: 42997.0000 Age 2: 42656.0000 ... Age 99: 2439.0000 Then, we have to project year 2010 according to certain death rate set the same way as this above-mentioned initial population, except that it includes rates instead of totals per year of age. Year: 2009 Age 0: 0.000213345 Age 1: 0.000212543 Age 2: 0.000201938 ... Age 99: 0.04824421 Age 106: 0.50000000 The idea is to group these entities under classes. I have already designed one, and I wonder whether it could be improved in some ways. Objective To simplify design and to embed statistical calculations within object classes so that it is more easily testable and mockable when required. Actual Class Diagram I feel like it can be improved. For your information and ease of readability, here's a index of the French terms used in the diagram: TauxFeconditeAnnuel -> Annual Fecondity Rate TauxMortaliteAnnuelle -> Annual Death Rate PopulationAnnuelle -> Annual Population SoldeMigratoireAnnuel -> Annual Net Migration StatistiqueAnnuelle -> Annual Statistic StatistiqueAnnuelleParSexe -> Annuel Statistic per Sex My reflections are about whether or not to include a Death Rate class instance within a PopulationAnnuelle class. There exist death rates for initial population year and the next 96 years of projection. Besides, an annual population has to have its death rate, and an annual population is not obliged to exist for me to have a death rate for this year. Let's say I have the initial population for 2009, I have not yet projected population for 2010, 2011, 2012, etc. until year 2105. Yet, I have death rate projections for all of these years, and population growth is based on these mortality rates to determine what population remain alive, and how many deaths we got, etc. I thought of putting the PopulationAnnuelle class as the base class for my model, though I feel like StatistiqueAnnuelle is more suitable for the job, then making PopulationAnnuelle inherit from it. Questions What are your thoughts on the about my concerns? What is the best design based on what I wish to accomplish? Should I use StatistiqueAnnuelle as the base class/interface and make the others like TauxMortalite, PopulationAnnuelle, etc. derive from it, a bit like it is now designed? Any acceptable thoughts will be upvoted personally by me. The most accurate and helping answer will be accepted as the answer to my question. Thanks for your kind help and support! =) Are you able to identify for us the common significant use cases / scenarios? (Adrian K) A common possible use case/scenario would be to plan the needs for pension plans based upon population growth. After the amount of people has been "predicted", you may calculate the number of persons who will contribute to the pension plan and the people who will retire, then estimate the funding needs the contributors will need to pay so that the pension plan funds will have enough money to pay the pensions for them later when they retire and so forth. Another possible common scenario would be insurances company. Based on population growth, statistics about the insurance usage would allow the company to predict the needs of their funding sources and establish the monthly payment for a given coverage amount based on accident refunds versus input monthly payments per age, let's say for car insurance for instance. This exercise is called valuation.
