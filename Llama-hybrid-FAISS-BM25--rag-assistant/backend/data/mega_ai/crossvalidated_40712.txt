If your hyper parameters are fixed (without any random distribution), you can use the MCMC method to simulate and update your parameters. MCMC does not need exact distribution function of the posteriors (with normalization constant). It only needs some candidate distributions for your parameters that you can define based on your opinion about each posteriors.
