Both are supervised classification methods. LDA aims to find projections that aims to minimize within class distance while maximizing between class distance. PLS-DA is basically PLS regression to class information (I think this kind of class information is called one-hot-encoding of classes in machine learning) and aims to maximize covariance between independent variables and this class information. PLS-DA provides scores, that is also a projection, so LDA-like visualization can be achieved.
