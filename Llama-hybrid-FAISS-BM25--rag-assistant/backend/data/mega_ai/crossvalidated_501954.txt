taylor series expansion in laplace approximation of bayesian neural network prediction

In chapter 6 of the book Pattern recognition and machine learning, there is this part about prediction in Bayesian neural network using laplace approximation : why assuming small variance compared with scales of w over which y(x,w) is varying leads to taylor series expansion of linear (5.169)(5.170)? I am just an undergraduate and novice in ml. can somebody help me?
