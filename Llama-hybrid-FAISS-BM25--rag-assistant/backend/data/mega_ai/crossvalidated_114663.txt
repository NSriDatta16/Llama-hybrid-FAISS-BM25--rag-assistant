What is the mathematical difference between using a un-informative prior and a frequentist approach?

Un-informative priors are preferred in instances where bias is not acceptable (ie. courtrooms, etc.) However, it seems to me that it would just make sense to use a frequentist approach instead. Why does the Bayesian approach even have a non-informative prior? Thanks!
