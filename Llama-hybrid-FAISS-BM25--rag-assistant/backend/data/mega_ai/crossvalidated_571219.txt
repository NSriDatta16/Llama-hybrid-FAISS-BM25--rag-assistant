Clustering algorithms that support FA rather than PCA

In our social sci research we've used Factor Analysis rather than PCA. It would be helpful for us to use a clustering algorithm to group respondents into the most logical factor groups. Kmeans seems to use PCA as the basis for its clustering. Is there a way to specify factoextra::kmeans() or other package to use FA rather than PCA? Which clustering algorithms would support FA?
