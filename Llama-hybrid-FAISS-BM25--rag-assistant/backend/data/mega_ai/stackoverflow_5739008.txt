Do you want real file processing or the metaphor of file load/save? Only a few browsers support real file processing beyond traditional upload and hyperlink download. With plug-ins like Silverlight, you can do better but you have to rely on plug-ins. If you just want the metaphor, you can save your data to localStorage or database and show the metaphor to user. It will be easier and every modern browser supports this.
