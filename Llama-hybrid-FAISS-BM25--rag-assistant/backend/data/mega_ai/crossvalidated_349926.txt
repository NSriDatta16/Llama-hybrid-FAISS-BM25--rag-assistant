Although the stated objective is to display changes, apparently you wish to show the annual time series by country, too. That suggests not completely redoing the graphic, but just modifying it. Since a change concerns what happens from one year to the next, you might consider representing the changes by graphical symbols that span successive years: that is, the line segments connecting the data points in the plot. Since color is so useful for distinguishing countries, and otherwise is not so good at indicating quantitative variables, that leaves us with essentially just two other characteristics that can be varied to indicate change: the style and thickness of the segments. Because your thesis concerns positive change, you will want to make line segments for increases more prominent: their styles should be more continuous and they should be thicker. Finally, your thesis concerns data after 1932. We will want to emphasize those elements of the graphic relative to the others. That can be done by saturating the color. This solution immediately provides insights that were not apparent in the original: No country experienced annual increases in death rates for all years after 1932. Any such country would appear as a continuous solid line, but there is no such line present. Much of the change ought to be attributed to factors common to all countries. This is apparent in the similarities of line style and thickness within vertical columns. For instance, during the period 1934-35 the death rates increased in almost all countries, where in 1933-34 they decreased in nearly all countries. Germany was unusual in experiencing a large increase in death rates in 1932-33 and also a slight increase in 1935-36. These suggest performing a robust two-way exploration of change in death rate versus country, perhaps by median polish, in order to penetrate more deeply into the relative performance of European countries during this period. If you wish to emphasize only the difference between 1937 and 1932, a similar technique can be used to symbolize the portions of the paths between those dates. Germany would stand out:
