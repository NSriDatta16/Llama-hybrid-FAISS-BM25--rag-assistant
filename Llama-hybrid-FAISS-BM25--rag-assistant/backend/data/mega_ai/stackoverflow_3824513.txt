SVN encrypted password store

I installed SVN on a Ubuntu machine and I can't get my head around something. Whenever I checkout something from the terminal I get this error about saving a non-encrypted password: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ATTENTION! Your password for authentication realm: Subversion Repository can only be stored to disk unencrypted! You are advised to configure your system so that Subversion can store passwords encrypted, if possible. See the documentation for details. You can avoid future appearances of this warning by setting the value of the 'store-plaintext-passwords' option to either 'yes' or 'no' in '/home/[...]/.subversion/servers'. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I goggled it a bit but I couldn't find anything useful. I found one topic where it said this was a client issue, not a server one, but I'm still not convinced. It says "configure your system"; what exactly does it mean by that? The server or the client? If I'm the server, is there anything I can do about it? besides hiding the warning (like it says)... Thanks!
