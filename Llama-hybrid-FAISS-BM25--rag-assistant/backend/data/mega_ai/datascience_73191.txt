Recommendations for learning DCGANs?

I mean stuff that doesn't use Python, Keras or TensorFlow. I have been looking for an in-depth explanation on how to implement a DCGAN from the ground up so I can have a complete understanding of the concept. Even some literature on GANs from the ground up would be useful. All of the stuff I have read thus far leaves out a lot of the details, falling back on third party libraries, hiding the implementation. Is my best bet to read papers? Trudge through references until it makes sense? Is there not a comprehensive text because of the novelty?
