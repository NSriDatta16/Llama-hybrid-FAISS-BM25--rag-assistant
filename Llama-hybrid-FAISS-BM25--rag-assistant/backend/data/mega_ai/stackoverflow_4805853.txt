Don't create a file based storage for your Wordpress-Theme-Settings if you want it to be portable. Some sites might have the themes folder readonly. For the initial setup it's ok to read your settings from almost everything filebased. Later on its best stored (and backuped) in the database. If you store things in a file use the ini-style based files as PHP gives you an API for free. Things usually only tend to be better stored in an array or serialized if your options are not restricted. Don't care about performance too much, simply use the wordpress options api as a best practice.
