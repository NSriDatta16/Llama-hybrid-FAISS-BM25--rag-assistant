What is the inhibitory classifier or inhibitory-SVM?

I want to implement Inhibitory SVM classifier in chapter 3 of this paper with scikit lib in Python. However, it is hard to find materials that explains inhibitory-SVM or classifier. In the paper, they explains inhibitory SVM but, I can't understand that. I want to know I-SVM in terms of shape of input of data and label and difference btw SVM and I-SVM. What is the inhibitory classifier or inhibitory-SVM? Thank you.
