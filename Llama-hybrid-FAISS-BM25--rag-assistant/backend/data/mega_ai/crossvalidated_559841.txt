Linear assumption for logistic regression

I wanted to ask regarding the linearity assumption of the logistic regression, is the assumption between A) independent variable (e.g. pre-score) vs logit of the outcome? or B) predictive probability of the independent variable vs logit of the outcome? Below is my R code regarding this problem. Any feedback on whether I wrote the code correctly or not and whether I should go with plot A or plot B is much appreciated. fit Plot for Point A Plot for Point B
