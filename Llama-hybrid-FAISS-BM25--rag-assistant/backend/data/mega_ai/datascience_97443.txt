There are several options: Hand-picked rules - Given domain expertise, manually choose the threshold values to create the four clusters. Machine learning - Set the number of clusters to four. Then use any clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, Gaussian mixture model, DBSCAN, spectral). This has the advantage of learning the threshold values. Choosing the best clustering result can be tricky since there are no external labels. It sounds like there are business requirements for the solution. Thus, business metrics should be used to evaluate the solution.
