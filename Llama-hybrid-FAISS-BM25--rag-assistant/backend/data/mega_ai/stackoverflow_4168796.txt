You can do something simple which is to put an HTML text box directly in your master page. It may not be as elegant as writing a customer user control that reads the location of the Search site, but if the URL to your search results page is static then something like this might work for you: function SearchPeople() { var termArr = document.getElementById("SearchTextBoxPeople").value.split(" "); var retStr = ""; for (var i = 0; i Search People One additional benefit of this is that you can control the input to include wildcards (which are horrible out-of-the-box for people searches). The JavaScript is simply including * in the search which allows wildcard searches. So a search for jo sm will actually send jo* sm* to the search page which will then match on John Smith.
