From a very brief scan of the initial article (but not the response and rebuttal) it looks like the evidence is quite weak. First and most importantly, this analysis involves a sample of 20 adolescents. That's very small and far too small to support logistic regressions with multiple covariates. Minimum sizes for logistic regressions have been discussed extensively on this site. See here and here . Second, the analysis here doesn't provide any causal evidence, only correlational evidence. Third, as I understand it, the data for this is taken from a much larger survey. Thus, it would have been entirely possible for Sullens to simply look for all possible correlations between the group of adolescents raised by same-sex parents and report correlations that were significant. This is a form of p-hacking though because as long as you look at enough possible correlation, by chance, some will be statistically significant.
