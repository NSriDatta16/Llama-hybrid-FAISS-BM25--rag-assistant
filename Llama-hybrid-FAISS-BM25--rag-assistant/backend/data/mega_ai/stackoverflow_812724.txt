A StringBuilder doesn't use a char[] to store the data, it uses an internal mutable string. That means that there is no extra step to create the final string as it is when you concatenate a list of strings, the StringBuilder just returns the internal string buffer as a regular string. The reallocations that the StringBuilder does to increase the capacity means that the data is by average copied an extra 1.33 times. If you can provide a good estimate on the size when you create the StringBuilder you can reduce that even furter. However, to get a bit of perspective, you should look at what it is that you are trying to optimise. What will take most of the time in your program is to actually write the data to disk, so even if you can optimise your string handling to be twice as fast as using a StringBuilder (which is very unlikely), the overall difference will still only be a few percent.
