Whatever floats your boat, as they say. :) You should really focus on making the code simple, easy to read and efficient, using whatever tools you need to achieve this. If it warrants putting lots of code in main - do so. If you feel that objects would make things more organized - go that way. Making a single instance of class Main and then calling the instance method Main() which does all the work is just as good as writing everything in the main method directly.
