Since I started doing research in academia I was constantly looking for a satisfactory workflow. I think that I finally found something I am happy with: Put everything under version control, e.g., Git: For hobby research projects I use GitHub, for research at work I use the private GitLab server that is provided by our university. I also keep my datasets there. I do most of my analyses along with the documentation on IPython notebooks. It is very organized (for me) to have the code, the plots, and the discussion/conclusion all in one document If I am running larger scripts, I would usually put them into separate script .py files, but I would still execute them from the IPython notebook via the %run magic to add information about the purpose, outcome, and other parameters. I have written a small cell-magic extension for IPython and IPython notebooks, called "watermark" that I use to conveniently create time stamps and keep track of the different package versions I used and also Git hashs For example %watermark 29/06/2014 01:19:10 CPython 3.4.1 IPython 2.1.0 compiler : GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5577) system : Darwin release : 13.2.0 machine : x86_64 processor : i386 CPU cores : 2 interpreter: 64bit %watermark -d -t 29/06/2014 01:19:11 %watermark -v -m -p numpy,scipy CPython 3.4.1 IPython 2.1.0 numpy 1.8.1 scipy 0.14.0 compiler : GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5577) system : Darwin release : 13.2.0 machine : x86_64 processor : i386 CPU cores : 2 interpreter: 64bit For more info, see the Github repository here .
