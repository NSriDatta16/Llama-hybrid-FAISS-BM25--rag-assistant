Since you don't have anything to differentiate between view and category items, I'd think about using a default controller which checks if the id is in the categories table and passes control to either the View or the Category controller. routes.MapRoute( "Root", // Route name "/{id}", // URL with parameters new { controller = "default", action = "redirect"} // Parameter defaults ); But if you can live with having "/category/" in your category urls, that will be the more elegant solution on the back end.
