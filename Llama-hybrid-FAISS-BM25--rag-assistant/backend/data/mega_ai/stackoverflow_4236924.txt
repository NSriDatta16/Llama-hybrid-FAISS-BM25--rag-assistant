Well you can probably improve the best case and average case substantially just by checking the length first, then a quick checksum on the digits (not something complex, as that will probably be worse order than the sort, just a summation of ordinal values), then sort, then compare. If the strings are very short the checksum expense will be not greatly dissimilar to the sort in many languages.
