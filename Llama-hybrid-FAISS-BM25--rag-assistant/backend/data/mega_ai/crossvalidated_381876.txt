Uncertainty-minimizing stratified sampling strategy

Suppose there is a school, and I want to know what proportion of students like the color red better than green, or vice versa (suppose there is no "other" option, just a binary variable). The school is 70% female and 30% male for some reason. The assumption is that females have some (unknown) probability of preferring red, and males have a different, unknown probability of preferring red. I have time to ask 100 people which color they prefer. After I ask 100 people, I will estimate the overall proportion of red-likers by estimating female-proportion-of-red-likers and male-proportion-of-red-likers and weighting these two according to the prevalence of females and males. How many females should I ask, and how many males, to minimize the uncertainty of my resulting estimate? (An ideal answer would connect this to a larger theory for the case of N strata each of which has an independently drawn unknown Bernoulli parameter. Bonus points if it extends to a Bayesian setting where the prior is non-uniform)
