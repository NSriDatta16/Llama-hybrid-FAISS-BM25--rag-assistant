jquery replace an ID with variable

I have an id="test" and would like to have it replaced by the variable:PitchesRemaining: http://jsfiddle.net/xtian/G7Qdp/ HTML: 6 55 15 Jquery: $(function(){ var AveragePitches = parseInt($("#AveragePitches").text()); var Buffer = AveragePitches * .2; var PitchesMax = AveragePitches + Buffer; var PitchesToday = parseInt($("#PitchesToday").text()); var PitchesRemaining = PitchesMax - PitchesToday; $("#test").change(function() { PitchesRemaining = $(this).val(); }).change(); });
