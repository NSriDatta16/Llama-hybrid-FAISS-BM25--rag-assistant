I actually mildly disagree with the premise. Everyone is a Bayesian, if they really do have a probability distribution handed to them as a prior. The trouble comes about when they don't, and I think there's still a pretty good-sized divide on that topic. Having said that, though, I do agree that more and more people are less inclined to fight holy wars and just get on with doing what seems appropriate in any given situation. I would say that, as the profession advanced, both sides realized there were merits in the other side's approaches. Bayesians realized that evaluating how well Bayesian procedures would do if used over and over again (e.g., does this 95% credible interval (CI) actually contain the true parameter about 95% of the time?) required a frequentist outlook. Without this, there's no calibration of that "95%" to any real-world number. Robustness? Model building through iterative fitting etc.? Ideas that came up in the frequentist world, and were adapted by Bayesians starting in the late 1980s or so. Frequentists realized that regularization was good, and use it quite commonly these days - and Bayesian priors can be easily interpreted as regularization. Nonparametric modeling via cubic splines with a penalty function? Your penalty is my prior! Now we can all get along. The other major influence, I believe, is the staggering improvement in availability of high-quality software that will let you do analysis quickly. This comes in two parts - algorithms, e.g., Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings, and the software itself, R, SAS, ... I might be more of a pure Bayesian if I had to write all my code in C (I simply wouldn't have the time to try anything else), but as it is, I'll use gam in the mgcv package in R any time my model looks like I can fit it into that framework without too much squeezing, and I'm a better statistician for it. Familiarity with your opponent's methods, and realizing how much effort it can save / better quality it can provide to use them in some situations, even though they may not fit 100% into your default framework for thinking about an issue, is a big antidote to dogmatism.
