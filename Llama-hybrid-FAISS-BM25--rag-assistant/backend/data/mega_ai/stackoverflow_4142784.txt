Your network code is buggy in two ways: 1) If the data is >1024 bytes it won't work at all 2) If the incoming data gets fragmented it's break (One Send call does NOT map to one Receive call). TCP is a stream not packet based protocol. To fix it first write the bytesize of the image, and when reading read until you have enough bytes and only then construct the image from the bytes.
