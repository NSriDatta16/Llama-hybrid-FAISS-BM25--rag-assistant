Adjust/scale a detrended time series to an arbitrary time period

Suppose I have detrended my data by using the residuals from a simple OLS time trend model. So for $t = 1, 2, ...T$ , the detrended series $z_t$ is defined as below, $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1t + \epsilon_t$ $z_t = y_t - \widehat{y_t}$ Now to adjust (or I guess "scale") the detrended series to a particular time period, can I simply add the value for that period? For example, if I want all the values to be adjusted to time period $t = 20$ , would the series be: $z_t + y_{20}$ Does this extend to the panel data case? Where now, you would use the mean value of observations at $t = 20$ , of the form $z_{ti} + \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{y_{i20}}{n}$ Thanks, this seems pretty basic but while there's a lot of resources on detrending time series, I struggled to find anything related to my question
