What I get from the OPs question is that they want to identify important relationships between variables. Given the number of tests you would have to go about, if approaching this from an inferential framework, you will have a very high type II error which you would need to correct for to prevent p-hacking; correction comes with its own issues though. If you are interested in identifying important relationships between variables, and understanding if these vary with spatial scale, then I would suggest you run a PCA on your data, arranged just how you have it - excluding class. From here you can then conduct a PERMANOVA on the PCA object to determine which variables differ, and how, between the land-use classes. You might need to build a separate one for each spatial scale, especially if variables are not standardised. The vegan package can do all this and you could easily produce some nice descriptive plots to show your findings. Also, I wouldn't personally use Lasso, ridge or elastic net regression in this case. These are fine if the aim of the exercise is to create a model that predicts data well, as these approaches restrict coefficients to prevent the model from fitting noise, but it sounds like you are more interested in identifying relationships. If I am wrong about that though you could also explore random forests.
