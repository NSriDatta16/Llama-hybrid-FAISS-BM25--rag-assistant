Is it appropriate to use NPV and PPV when performing undersampling?

I have a highly imbalanced dataset (imbalance ratio 1:100) and I trained a Balanced Radom Forest algorithm. Does reporting PPV and NPV make sense when undersampling the majority class (as is done in balanced random forest)? I understand that PPV and NPV depend on the prevalence in the true population, but I am not sure if it makes sense to use it in the case of undersampling.
