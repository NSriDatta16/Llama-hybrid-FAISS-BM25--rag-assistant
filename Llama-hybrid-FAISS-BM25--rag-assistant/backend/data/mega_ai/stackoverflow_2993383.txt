What is a good way to match a part of a line using command line tools?

I want to match a part of a line for example in the sentence: "The super id=42 or something." I want to return the number 42. echo "The super id=42 or something" | grep -o 'id=[0-9]+' | sed 's/id=//' Would return the correct answer, but is there a more elegant way of solving this, for example by using only one tool?
