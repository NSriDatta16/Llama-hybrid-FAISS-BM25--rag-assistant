I agree with Tomalak, even pictures and other smaller assets are much better served outside of the database. Our products use only reference paths to the assets in the DB, with th DB serving as a dictionary to location. Of course the one down side is the disconnect that can develop between the filesystem and the DB entries, so you need to pay special attention to how you set this up and maintain it in an ongoing fashion.
