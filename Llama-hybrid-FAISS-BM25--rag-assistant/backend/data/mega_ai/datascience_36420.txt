I'm not sure what you are trying to do. CNNs are good for image-related tasks, as they attempt to extract spatially local features from the input data. They can be used for regression problems but only as long as the input resembles an image. Random Forests on the other hand are bad at image-related tasks, unless some sort of feature extraction has been performed beforehand. Does your dataset consist of images? If not don't use CNNs!
