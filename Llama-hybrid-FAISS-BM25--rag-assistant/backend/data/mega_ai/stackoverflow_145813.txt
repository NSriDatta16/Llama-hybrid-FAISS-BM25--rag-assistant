This link http://www.testingfaqs.org/t-management.html has a list of test case management tools, both freeware and commercial. Maybe there is something on that list which can meet your needs. Another posibility is something like Trac . That is not really designed as a test case management tool but it integrates a Subversion repository browser, a bug tracker and a Wiki. If you can manage organising the test cases on the Wiki then that will let you link the Wiki pages to bugs and bugs to Subversion commits. We used to use Trac and were quite happy with it. We switched to Jira because we wanted some more bug tracking features. I have not used it, but Trac does have a testcase management plugin listed on their web page.
