So how can I couple my clusters to a feature label from my feature matrix? Principal Components are not intuitive features. What seems common here is to cluster users based on PCs and investigate clusters based on original features afterward i.e. extract different clusters and plot data based on different subsets of features and use different colors for different clusters. It might give you some intution. These two paths can be seen in many PCA results where the information varies with e.g time. For instance in your case a beginner user visits less than an old one and the number of new users are most probably higher than old ones so data will be more dense around origin and far it gets from the origin less dense it becomes. Such a phenomenon affects your PCs as well so you'll see some paths along different lines in PC space. Hope it helps :)
