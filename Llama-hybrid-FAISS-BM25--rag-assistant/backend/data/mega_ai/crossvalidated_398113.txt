Time series with python

I've a dataset in following format day,8am,9am,10am,......,8pm 2012-1-1,0.3,0.2,0.21,.....,0.4 2012-1-2,0.32,0.19,0.22,.....,0.45 ................ I'm not sure whether I processed the whole dataset and get a single time series like follows by combining each day 0.3,0.2,0.21,.....,0.4,0.32,0.19,0.22,.....,0.45,........ or is there any better way to analyze such a dataset? I'm not interested in day. I just trying to focus on the values
