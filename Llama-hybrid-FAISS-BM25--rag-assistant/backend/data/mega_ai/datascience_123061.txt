Import image as array in Orange

I would like to import a PNG image as an 2D array or "flattened" as a vector (e.g. row of a table) in orange such that, e.g., one can use all pixel values as input for PCA or for descriptive statistics. I am aware of the image embedding but I am after the "raw" pixel values. Is there a widget for this? If not, what would be the most suitable approach to achieve this? Thanks!
