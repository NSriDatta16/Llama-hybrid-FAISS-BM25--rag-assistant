There's no real issues here. You don't need the extraneous finally { cnn.close(); } as the using clause will take care of that for you. However changing it will have exactly zero impact. Another thing is that I would put the try .. catch outside of the using clause with a redirect. But, again, I don't think that would affect the dispose from being called. It's interesting that you would get connection pool errors (timeout expired) if you are always properly disposing of your connections, as you've shown. Which leaves us with only one real solution: switch hosting providers. They have either overloaded their DB server to the point of unusability or some hardware element in their network setup (nic, switch, router, etc) is bad and dropping packets.
