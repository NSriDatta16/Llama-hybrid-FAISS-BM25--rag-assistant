which interactions to explore between sex, age, height to predict weight

As a learning exercise I'm running linear regression to predict person's weight from: sex, age, height. here's a few sample lines Sex Age Height Weight 860 0 50 162.8 58.1 202 1 34 182.3 89.4 580 0 46 171.5 59.9 762 0 40 167.3 55.9 390 1 50 164.8 69.4 having examined the outcome it looks like age is contributing +/- 0.3KG which is very minor. I'm wondering if there is more useful information to be gleaned from age? I've considered adding interaction variables like sex age or age height. should I try other interactions? I've considered running PCA. would this just rotate my vectors and achieve nothing, or would it add anything? any other suggestion to try much obliged
