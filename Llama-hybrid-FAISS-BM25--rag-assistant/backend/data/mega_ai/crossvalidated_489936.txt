How to interpret the standard deviation of a discrete random variable

How would you interpret the standard deviation of a discrete random variable and state it simply for someone with limited statistical background? For example, Assume I am betting on an event with a 21% chance of occurring. If I bet it will occur and am correct, I win \$50. If I lose, I pay \$20. Let $X=\text{profit from bet}$ . $P(x=\$50) =0.21$ $P(x=-\$20)=0.79$ I logically understand the expected value $\mu$ , which in this case $\mu\approx-\$5$ . If I was to explain what this value meant to someone, I would say: If you make this bet many times under the same conditions, your long term outcome will be an average loss of $5 per bet. The standard deviation ( $\sigma$ ) is equal to approximately \$29. But I struggle for some reason with how to explain this conceptually. Does this refer to the average deviation of each individual bet, just like $\mu$ ? Would it be valid to say: If you make this bet many times under the same conditions, your long term outcome will be an average loss of $5 per bet, plus/minus \$29.
