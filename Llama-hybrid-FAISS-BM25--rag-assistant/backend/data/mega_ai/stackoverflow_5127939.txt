I ran your script on Magento Enterprise 1.9.0.0 and it worked with no problems, so there doesn't appear to be any problem with the script itself. what is your query? It's likely that there is a schema difference between the two versions that you aren't taking into account. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
