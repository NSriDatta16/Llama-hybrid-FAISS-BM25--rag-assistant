Stream with xuggle to a red5 instance and making it all jnlp based

Let's assume I have Xuggle recording the screen of the client in a video. Let's now assume I want to stream that video (while it is still being recorded) to my red 5 instance located in localhost:1935/live Is it at all possible to do this in a programmatic way(Java) and how should I open a connection to the stream to send IPackets. I assume I should use an IContainer instance to open a connection to the red5 instance but I have trouble understanding the documentation. Some code sample will be invaluable. A bonus question: Has somebody managed to make Xuggle streaming jnlp-based? If yes, how?
