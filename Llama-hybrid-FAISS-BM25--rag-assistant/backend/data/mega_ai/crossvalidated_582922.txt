To your first question - What does it mean that the decomposition is based on the linear systematic component? This means that the decomposition implemented here is on the log-odds (logit) scale. For a logistic regression, the $\beta$ coefficients are interpreted in terms of log-odds, which are linear and additive. The endowments, coefficients, and interaction outputs for your Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition are therefore all in log-odds terms. Addressing your second question about summing the decomposition estimates - this calculation is impacted by use of the log-odds scale, and the raw sum of these components will not be equal the simple difference in probabilities given by the results$y output. To better understand what's happening, let's simulate a decomposition # For reproducibility set.seed(6000) # Data generating process n Now before we fit any models to our simulated data, we already know what the true decomposition components should be, based on the means of each variable by group ( $\bar{X}_A$ and $\bar{X}_B$ ) and the log-odds scale $\beta$ coefficients we used to generate the outcome $y$ . $$\begin{align*} \text{Endowments} && (\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B)'\beta_B = 0.325 \\ \text{Coefficients} && \bar{X}_B' (\beta_A - \beta_B) = -2.275 \\ \text{Interaction} && (\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B)' (\beta_A - \beta_B) = -0.2 \\ \end{align*}$$ Which we can calculate in R by: # True decomposition estimates endowments (true_BO_par Now let's run the Blinder-Oaxaca on our simulated data library(oaxaca) fit This takes a little while to run with the bootstrap procedure (used to estimate uncertainty on the decomposition components), but we eventually find > fit$threefold$overall coef(endowments) se(endowments) coef(coefficients) 0.37101832 0.03174424 -2.48317386 se(coefficients) coef(interaction) se(interaction) 0.08839086 -0.23463968 0.02981978 Which agrees fairly well with our known decomposition parameters. If we now take the sum of both the true and estimated decomposition components, you'll notice something interesting. > sum(true_BO_par) [1] -2.15 > sum(fit$threefold$overall[c(1, 3, 5)]) [1] -2.346795 Although they agree somewhat well with each other, they are definitely not on the probability scale (i.e. they don't equal fit$y$diff ). But more importantly, transforming the summed decomposition components back to the probability scale doesn't actually give us the raw difference in probabilities. This is because transforming back to the probability scale makes the previously independent linear effects of each term on the model (i.e., on the log-odds scale) dependent on the values of the other variables in the model. We need instead to use marginal effects. To verify our results, let's estimate the separate marginal effects for each group, and find the difference library(marginaleffects) # Marginal effects needs a factor variable df $group_B group_B) # Refit the models separately m1 (mm1 (mm2 And taking the difference in estimated marginal means for the separate models, we can see it matches our summed decomposition components (again, on the log-odds scale) perfectly: > mm1$marginalmean - mm2$marginalmean [1] -2.346795 To sum up, the decomposition components you're estimating by running a Blinder-Oaxaca model with a logistic regression have a marginal interpretation on the log-odds scale.
