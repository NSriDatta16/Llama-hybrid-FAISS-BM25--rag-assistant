question on java list remove

The method public boolean remove(Object o) of List removes an object from list but does not shift the elements following.Just nulls the object value. IMHO this is an uninintuitive design choice since the size of the list before and after removal remains the same. Is there an elegant way to get a list with the elements shifted? Thanks
