Chrome Extension - XHR URLs from an array

I have saved some subject URL keys to localStorage and now want to cycle through them a get content of each of them. // Walk through saved subjects allSubjects = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('subjects')); var i = 0; var ii = 0; var xhrIn = []; for (i = 0; i This is not working, it catches only the first URL, after that my Console log says, that all other URLs were contacted, but xhrIn[i].onreadystatechange closure has never been executed. It looks like a little bit magical for me... Can anyone explain me this behavior?
