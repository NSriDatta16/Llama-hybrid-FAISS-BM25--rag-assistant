Linear Model or Time Series Model or ANOVA?

I have some data: column 1 = dates (daily data from say 1st Jan 2014 to 1 July 2014) column 2 = person (about 10 different people) column 3 = sales made (daily data from say 1st Jan 2014 to 1 July 2014) I calculated what periods the particular person was 'working' vs 'on holiday' vs 'weekend' in column 4 (unfair to say anyone will make sales in the weekend). I want to determine if holiday has a significant effect of revenue. Can I use a normal linear model or do I need a time series model? Is the person irrelevant in this case? Would 'working', 'on holiday', and 'weekend' be groups and I run an ANOVA? Thank you.
