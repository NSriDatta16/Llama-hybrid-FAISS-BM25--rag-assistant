You are getting 100% accuracy because you are using a part of training data for testing. At the time of training, decision tree gained the knowledge about that data, and now if you give same data to predict it will give exactly same value. That's why decision tree producing correct results every time. For any machine learning problem, training and test dataset should be separated. Accuracy of the model can be determined only when we examine how it is predicting for unknown values.
