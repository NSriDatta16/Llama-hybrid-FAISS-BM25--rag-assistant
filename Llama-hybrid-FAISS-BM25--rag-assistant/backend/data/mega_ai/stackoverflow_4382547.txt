Memory fragmentation occurs when chunks of memory are deallocated in between two active chunks. Think of a block of memory like so... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBCCCCCCCCCCCC Assume that B is no longer needed. If we free up the space that B was using we having something like... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA----CCCCCCCCCCC Now we have a gap that we can only put rather small objects in. A copying garbage collector might move things around so that we have... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCC---- (more free space here ) Most modern collectors can move things in-place. That is, you can see how C could be "shifted" to take up B's old space and thus there is no memory overhead.
