I am all for proper design to minimize memory usage, but you also have to be pragmatic sometimes. You will have at least 20 MB of memory available for your app on older devices, so I am actually not sure if it makes sense to spend a lot of time on lazy loading questions. You can probably easily load hundreds of questions in memory without ever noticing it. My advice: start the non-lazy way. Look with Instruments at the memory usage. It it is aceptable then leave it. If you are pushing the limits then invest time in optimizing.
