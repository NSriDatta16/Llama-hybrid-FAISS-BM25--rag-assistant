Boxplot in R showing the mean (again)

I saw Boxplot in R showing the mean I'm interested in the ggplot solution. But what I am plotting are averages already so I don't want to do an average of an average. I do have the true mean stored in TrueAvgCPC. Here is what I tried, but it's not working: p Thanks!
