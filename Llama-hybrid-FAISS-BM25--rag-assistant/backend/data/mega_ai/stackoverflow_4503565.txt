You probably don't have enough data in the index to merit defragmenting. After you get a couple thousand rows in there, the rebuilds and reorgs will get rid of the fragmentation. Until the index page count gets up to 100 or so, the fragmentation won't affect performance. You'll also want to verify that your query is covered by the index and that the index is being used. Run the query from the management studio (you can capture the query with sql profiler or the Activity Monitor if it is dynamic) and click "Include actual execution plan". This will tell you what index is being used and if the query is covered.
