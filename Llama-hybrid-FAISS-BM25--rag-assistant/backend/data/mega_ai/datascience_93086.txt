Neural net performance using rmse

I am trying to build a NN which can predict exchange values. I am quite new to R and NN and I don't quite understand how I could improve the performance metrics of the neural network. I have tried adjusting the threshold and learning rate as much as I could before it stopped improving the result. Can I improve the result further and at what point do you stop and accept the result? I have added a link to the datafile because some code works on the smaller snippets of the dataset but sometimes don't work in the full dataset Dataset: https://www.dropbox.com/s/17exy1968lsidsc/ExchangeUSDcsv.csv?dl=0 Code: library(neuralnet) library(grid) library(MASS) library(ggplot2) library(reshape2) library(gridExtra) library(neuralnet) library(zoo) normalize Current outputs: RMSE: 0.04519089 MAE: 0.04519089 MAPE: 0.03294277
