"Can each individual time series be sampled without loss of information? (Decrease the length of a time series)" If the model changes over time OR if the paramaters of the best model change over time , it may be more prudent to use less data based upon a homogeneous past thus decreasing the length. A feature of software that I have written actually tests for these conditions and I suggest this approach. It uses an extension of the CHOW test to summarily evaluate break points in the model parameters.
