cerns among mental health professionals and computer scientists regarding AI's abilities to challenge harmful beliefs and actions in users. Legality Due to the controversy surrounding them, AI therapists have been subject to bans and restrictions in several jurisdictions. In the United States, these include Nevada, Illinois, and Utah, with Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California considering similar laws. United States On May 7, 2025, a law placing restrictions on mental health chatbots went into effect in Utah. Rather than banning the use of AI for mental health services altogether, the new regulations mostly focused on transparency, mandating that AI therapists make disclosures to their users about matters of data collection and the AI's own limitations, including the fact the chatbot is not human. The law only applies to generative chatbots specifically designed or "expected" to offer mental health services, rather more generalized options, such as ChatGPT. On July 1, 2025, Nevada became the first U.S. state to ban the use of AI in psychotherapeutic services and decision-making. The new law, titled Assembly Bill 406 (AB406), prohibits AI providers from offering software specifically designed to offer services that "would constitute the practice of professional mental or behavioral health care if provided by a natural person." It further prohibits professionals from using AI as part of their practice, though permits use for administrative support, such as scheduling or data analysis. Violations may result in a penalty of up to $15.000. On August 1, 2025, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act, effectively banning therapist chatbots in the state of Illinois. The Act, passed almost unanimously by the Assembly, prohibits the provision and advertisment of AI mental health services, including the use of chatbots for the diagnosis or treatment of an individual's condition, with violations resulting in penalties up to $10.000. It further prohibits professionals from using artificial intelligence for clinical and therapeutic purposes, though allows use for administrative tasks, such as managing appointment schedules or record-keeping. == References ==
