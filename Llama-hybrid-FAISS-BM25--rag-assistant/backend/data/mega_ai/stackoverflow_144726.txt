ASP.NET MVC and...YUI? jQuery? Other

After the last project I've done using WebForms, I've decided to pass on using that framework in the future. It's great for getting your basic features out there...not so great when you have more complex UI logic. I'm looking at ASP.NET MVC, and like what I see so far. Of course the issue is that you lose the server side controls when you make that change. I've been looking for an Ajax Library that will a good replacement for the Web Forms widgets and like YUI right now. Not having a lot of experience in this area, I'd like to ask someone who has more knowledge. Which Ajax toolkit offers the most complete widget library? Is it possible to combine two or more toolkits to provide supplement to each other (e.g YUI has a great Grid, Scriptaculous has a great Calendar, let's use the best of both worlds)? Or are you more or less tied to one once you choose? Thanks for the answers and great sample. ExtJS definitely looks interesting, we spent more than that on the Infragistics WebForms suite and don't get the source. Flexigrid looks pretty good as well. Thanks again! Update 2 Just found out MSFT will be shipping jQuery with ASP.NET MVC
