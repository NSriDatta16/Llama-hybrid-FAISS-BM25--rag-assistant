Extra "_" parameter in POST request using Chrome

When I use Google Chrome to make an AJAX POST request I get extra empty parameter "_" on server-side. Here's some background information: Web-server: Python Paste Back-end: Python 2.6/Pylons Browser: Google Chrome 3.0.195.1 JavaScript Library: Prototype 1.6.1 RC3 For example simple: >>print sorted(request.POST.keys()) ['_','my_parameter'] I've Googled and I found few posts in mailing lists mentioning the same problem but I couldn't find an answer why is that happening. There were people reporting same issue using PHP and Safari so I don't think it's Server/Back-end related. I tested the same page with Firefox and I didn't get the extra parameter. I've checked HTTP 1.1 specification and couldn't find anything related. The strange thing is that I have never noticed this behaviour before. I haven't written a separate test to test it on all modern browsers yet, I though I'd ask here first. I expect the same problem might happen with Safari. A small side question; is it bad practice to expect that browser will only post the parameters which I expect or there's a chance that browser will post unnecessary/unexpected parameters like in this case. Answer As Blixt suggested the problem was in Prototype: if (params = Object.toQueryString(params)) { if (this.method == 'get') this.url += (this.url.include('?') ? '&' : '?') + params; else if (/Konqueror|Safari|KHTML/.test(navigator.userAgent)) params += '&_='; } Found it in bug tracker as well. Looks like this is fixed on Safari side, but it still in prototype code as workaround.
