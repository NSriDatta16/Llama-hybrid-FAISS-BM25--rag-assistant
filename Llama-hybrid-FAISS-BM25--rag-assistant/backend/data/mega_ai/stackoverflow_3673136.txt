Form Builder with JQuery Validation

Im looking for a really good form builder like http://jotform.com but one that uses JQuery for validation. The things I like is the really easy drag and drop and the speed at which forms can be created and then I can grab the code and put it on a site. Jotform uses Prototype and it conflicts with JQuery. Is there one avaliable?
