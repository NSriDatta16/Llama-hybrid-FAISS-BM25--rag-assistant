Applying TF/IDF to non-text data?

I have a classification problem in which I am supposed to predict the end state of an object based on a set of events it experiences. There are about one thousand possible events and each object is impacted by 10-50 events. First, I tried logistic regression (using glmnet to be specific) and got AUC = 0.59. My plan was to try xgboost next, but when I looked the data again, I realised that it looks similar to bag-of-words, with a lot of zeros and small integers here and there. That made me want to try TF-IDF for feature engineering: the events are words, and the objects are documents. Right away I got AUC > 0.7. I did some googling to find more information about this approach, but could not find anything. So, my questions are: Can TF-IDF be used for non-text data? what are some potential pitfalls of this approach? Are there any links or references to existing applications of TF-IDF for non-text data?
