label of non-classified examples in machine learning

What happens if a positive example in neither classified as positive nor negative? Will you treat such an example as False Negative (FN)? I am using a tool (machine learning) that predicts an example (which is A) as either "A" or "B". However, this tool returns no class for the example. Should you classify the example as FN? I am using supervised classification.
