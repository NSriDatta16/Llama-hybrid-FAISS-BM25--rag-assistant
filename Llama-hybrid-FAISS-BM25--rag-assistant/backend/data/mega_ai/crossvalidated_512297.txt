Estimating the score of the 5th ranked player in an anonymous tournament

I have the following problem that I want to solve using simulation. The context is the following. We have a tournament in which each game of the tournament is played by five players of different colors. Each player plays three games per round and only the Tournament director knows which player is playing each color (this information will be revealed at the end of the round). The players must play with three different colors in each of their three games in the round. The tournament round includes many players, for example, it could include 40 players playing a total of 16 games. We have data of the current scores of each color in each game. Note that all games have the same colors. Game Blue Red Green Purple White 1 5.0 35.0 0.0 13.0 16.0 ... ... ... ... ... ... The final score of a player will be the sum of their scores in the three games of the round. We would like to estimate the current score (not final score) of the Nth (but really 5th) ranked player before the end of the round. When we are doing this estimation we don't know which player is in each game/color; so we don't know which three scores to add for each player. My approach so far is "simulating" the score of each hypothetical player by picking scores from our data at random, being careful that each player gets three different colors for the round. I then sort the results and extract the 5th highest score and record that data. My questions are: Is this a suitable approach? Is the mean the right summary statistics for the resulting values? Is there a different way to summarize such data? Is there a name for what I am doing that I can search for? Is there a way to estimate how many simulation trials I need to get an accurate number? How would I report appropriate intervals for my summary statistics? Thanks for your attention. Edit: I modified the table to provide more realistic scores Edit 2: tried adding additional clarifying information (in italics)
