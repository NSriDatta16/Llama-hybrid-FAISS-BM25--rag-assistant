The highly recommended paper by Barr et al . (2013) discusses, among others, models with random slopes but without random intercepts (p. 262). Their final recommendation clearly prefer these models to random intercept only models (p. 267): LMEMs with maximal random slopes, but missing either random correlations or within-unit random intercepts, performed nearly as well as ‘‘fully’’ maximal LMEMs, with the exception of the case where p-values were determined by MCMC sampling. In addition, there was slight additional anticonservativity relative to the maximal model for the models missing within-unit random intercepts. This suggests that when maximal LMEMs fail to converge, dropping within-unit random intercepts or random correlations are both viable options for simplifying the random effects structure. and From the point of view of overall Type I error rate, we can rank the analyses for both within- and between-items designs in order of desirability: min-F' , maximal LMEMs, ‘‘near-maximal’’ LMEMs missing within-unit random intercepts or random correlations, and model selection LMEMs using backward selection and/or testing slopes using the ‘‘best path’’ algorithm.
