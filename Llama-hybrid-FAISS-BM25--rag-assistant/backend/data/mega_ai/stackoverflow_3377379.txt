On-Disk database storage, best practices

If this question seems common to you, I apologise, I did a quick search around this site and a few google searches and could not find a satisfying answer. My question is this; I have only been a software developer for 3-4 years now. This may seem like a time long enough to answer this question myself however in all my time, I have never had to develop software where the main body of data-storage is not required to be in an on-line database. This time however, my latest development requires only for its data to be stored only to disk. The actual data itself is light-weight. In-code the main asset will be a class with only a few, string based properties on it which must be persisted. My initial thoughts are on simple serialisation. On application close new assets are simply serialised and stored on disk as a file. I also though maybe for backup purposes (or if it is somehow a better option to a serialised class) an XML file would be appropriate. I cannot think of any distinct disadvantages of either of these approaches, it is this fact which causes me to ask this question publicly. In my experience, there is rarely a solution to a problem which does not have it's downsides.
