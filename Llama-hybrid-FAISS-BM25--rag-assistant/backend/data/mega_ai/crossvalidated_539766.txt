Relation between different data distribution and ML models

Despite the generalized linear models incorporate different distributions (e.g. Gaussian, Poisson, etc.) into the modelling process, I am not sure similar usage exists in machine learning. And it seems other than the iid assumptions, all those statistical distributions are so irrelevant in ML modelling. Are there any instances where statistical distribution can incorporate with ML models? Or is there such an application? What are the relation between the two?
