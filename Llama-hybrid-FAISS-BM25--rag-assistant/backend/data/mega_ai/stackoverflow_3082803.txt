Consider storing the last post as a foreign key somewhere (e.g. in the parent object table). Each time a message is posted or deleted, update this key. Yes, it's duplication, but worth considering. Having to run complex queries for each request (especially the index page) could take your application performance down. This is the pragmatic way to get the desired effect without losing performance.
