Weakest possible null hypothesis property

Is there a name for the following property of a null hypothesis : $\bar{H0}\implies \forall \alpha\in]0,1], \forall \beta\in]0,1], \exists K\in \mathbb{N}, n>K=>P(p_{value} 1-\beta$ (In other words when n tends towards $+\infty$, not rejecting $H0$ is equivalent to accept it.) This could be called "weakest possible" but I do not find a reference with such a name. A counter example: for Mann-Whithney rank sum test a commonly used $H0$ is " X and Y follow the same arbitrary distribution ". However, for example if X and Y follow two gaussian distributions with the same average and different standard deviation, even if $P(p_{value} \alpha$, when $n->\infty$, $P(p_{value} Some other sources, says that there is a preliminary hypothesis that the two distributions are the same, except of a shift, and then the $H0$ is "the shift is $0$", on this case $H0$ is well a "weakest possible".
