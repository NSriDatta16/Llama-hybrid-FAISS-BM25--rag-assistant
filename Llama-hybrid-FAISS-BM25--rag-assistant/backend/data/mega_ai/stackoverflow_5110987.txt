I would defiantly look into running Plupload. It allows great browser capability and supports multiple file drag and drop in HTML5 browsers that support FileReader. So lets say for example you dont have html 5 it will deprecate down to flash / gears / silverlight depending on what that individual has installed. Here's the compatibility chart: http://www.plupload.com/index.php It has an option called droparea: "somediv" that allows you to drag files into it and automatically cue up a file upload. Let me know if you need any help setting it up.
