django tracking recent online users

Is there any way to track active users in django? I have seen a few online solutions to the problem: http://mpcabd.igeex.biz/get-online-users-in-django/ being one of those. But it seems rather odd to modify the model structure just to solve this simple problem. I would like to know if there is any quick solution around. The last_login field in django auth is also not of much use since it only records the time when a user logs in and the field is not updated if the user has been in session for a long time
