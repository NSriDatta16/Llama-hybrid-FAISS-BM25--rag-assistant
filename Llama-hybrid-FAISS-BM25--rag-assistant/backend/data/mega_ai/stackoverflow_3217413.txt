You want to create some sort of Steganography application. By applying the technique described in this blog post , it won't be hard at all: Prepare or create an image (let's call it visible.jpg) Prepare or create your would-be hidden image (hidden.jpg) Create an application which will create a password protected rar from hidden.jpg, using Process.start() . Use Process.start again to issue the command copy /b visible.jpg + hidden.rar visible.jpg Your hidden.jpg now resides inside visible.jpg To get your hidden.jpg back, rename visible.jpg to visible.rar and extract the hidden image. Edit : According to a lifehacker article , a gif image and / or a zip file will do as well.
