Try binding to the array controller's selectedObjects , model key path count , with no value transformer. Note that this would be unsafe if you allowed multiple selection: For one thing, the count could easily be neither YES nor NO ; for another, if the user selected a multiple of 256 items, the lowest byte of the count would be 0, so the BOOL value would be NO even though there is a selection.
