Permanova for microbial ecology using adonis (R): should I include block?

I know this is a very basic question, but I have been quite unsuccessful in finding a good solution to the following issue. First the data. My spreadsheet is too big, so here is a fictional example: ORGAN FARM SP1 SP2 SP3 SP4 SP5 SP6 Mouth CityA 41 2 45 1 68 33 Stomach CityA 63 85 56 48 82 52 Intestines CityA 62 73 15 88 42 64 Mouth CityB 89 8 84 17 76 97 Stomach CityB 97 25 65 8 62 25 Intestines CityB 8 17 70 60 24 85 Mouth CityC 88 32 0 12 39 41 Stomach CityC 91 15 91 10 57 55 Intestines CityC 51 14 85 75 47 33 Mouth CityD 20 18 82 12 39 81 Stomach CityD 31 86 19 28 79 36 Intestines CityD 56 46 34 44 72 72 Mouth CityE 78 82 9 1 13 80 In each city, the microbiota of different organs of pigs were sampled. The types of microbes found are listed as "SP1" and so on. Next, I calculated a dissimilarity matrix (bray-curtis, with vegdist in R). I want to know what explains variation in the communities sampled - the organ where they were sampled or the city where they were located? If my matrix of dissimilarity is called "dist", then, what of the following is the most appropriate model for a PERMANOVA analysis? Using adonis in R: dist ~ organ*farm #no block or nest notation dist ~ organ*farm, strata = farm #farm as block dist ~ organ/farm #organs nested in farm Is it correct to say that organs are nested within farm? Does nested information remain after permutation? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
