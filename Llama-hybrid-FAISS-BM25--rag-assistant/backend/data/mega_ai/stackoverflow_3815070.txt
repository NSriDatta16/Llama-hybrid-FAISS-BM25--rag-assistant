varchar() primary key or int primary key?

I have a problem with MySql primary keys, it's for my project i'm working on now! i have to have a unit name(not a number)as a key in my database, it is a combination of letters and numbers, i can't use any primary key in INT type, where it increments as usual! what is better? should i stick to old INT, auto increment way? or it's better to use a VARCHAR to primary key? if so what is the ideal data type? regards, Rangana
