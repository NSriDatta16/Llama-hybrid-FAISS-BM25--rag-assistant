I don't have any examples of the exact scenarios your looking at, but if you want to learn more about ETL itself, you can try taking a look at the articles on Ayende's site . He has an extremely easy to use framework for ETL processes called Rhino ETL . And a video showing how to use it . As for where the T part comes in to play, the T stands for Transform. This is the step in the process where you can (but do not necessarily have to) change the shape of the data. After Extracting from one datasource, you can add or remove fields, aggregate information, break objects up in to tables, map tables into objects, etc. This part is the transform step. You then proceed to Load the data in to the new data storage or system. Hope that helps some.
