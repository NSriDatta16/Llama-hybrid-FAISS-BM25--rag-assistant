How does Xcode know which profile the application belongs to?

I have been wondering about how does xcode link the provisioning profile to a particular application. For example, I install profile named 'myprofile' in the organizer and go to the project name 'newapp' and say build and go. The application 'newapp' is installed fine on the iphone but how do i know if there is a link between 'newapp' and 'myprofile'. What happens if i change my app name and again say build and go? This is what i do: 1. Login to my account. 2. Create a new app id: 'first' 3. Use existing device: 'myiphone' 4. enter the profile name: 'myprofile', download it 5. install it inside organizer. (Till this point no application is assigned to the profile) 6. Now go to my project: 'newapp' just say build and go and app runs on the device. I never selected a profile and said assign the app to this profile so... How can i say that 'myprofile' is tied to 'newapp'? Thanks
