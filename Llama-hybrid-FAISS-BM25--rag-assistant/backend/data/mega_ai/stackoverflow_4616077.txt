How to make newline chars visible in HTML textarea?

I want to make newline (CR and LF) characters visible in a textarea field of an HTML form, as you can do in some text editors and IDEs. The user needs to be able to edit the text to insert newlines as well (i.e. create paragraph breaks), which should also show dynamically. Is there a way to do this? TIA.... Steve
