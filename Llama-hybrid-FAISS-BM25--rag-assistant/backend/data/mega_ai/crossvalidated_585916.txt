Does correlation based feature selection methods lead to worse performance?

I am constrained for compute/memory and need to reduce the cardinality of my covariates. Are correlation-based methods the proper way to tackle such problem? Further, I am unable to apply PCA to my dataset as interpretability is one of the non-functional requirements of my project. It is either correlation or picking K-best features according to Gini importance (the model in question is XGB) - which is better?
