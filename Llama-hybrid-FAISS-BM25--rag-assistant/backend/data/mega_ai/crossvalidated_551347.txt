While the accepted answer here is true, it is a bit misleading in light of recent theoretical work. When you are doing gradient descent, you are trying to find the maximum a posterior (MAP) - aka the mode of your posterior distribution. While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) will only give you a point estimate, it will give you a trajectory that will allow you to explore the posterior density around your MAP estimate. There is a ton of emerging literature around this, starting with Neal 2012 / Welling 2011 with Langevin dynamics and later Mandt 2017 , Maddox 2019 and Zhang 2021 . At this point, it is safe to say that SGD will generate a single MCMC draw from your posterior distribution.
