Power analysis from Bayesian point of view

I was reading an article on a power analysis and sample size calculations for a class of models that known as joint longitudinal-survival models. The paper derives a closed form formula for power and sample size calculation. This paper is a frequentist paper in a sense that it assumes parametric assumptions and based on those assumptions, it gets likelihood, score function, â€¦ and it eventually gets the formula. I was wondering how power analysis and sample size calculations are done in Bayesian framework? Probably my question is naive especially given that I'm not expert in power analysis, but I think no matter how we approach a problem, once we have a hypothesis, power analysis is essential. So, I wanted to ask: Is power analysis also done in Bayesian framework? Could someone kindly references some papers on power analysis from Bayesian perspective? Would be great if I can find a power analysis for problems tackled with Bayesian nonparameteric approaches.
