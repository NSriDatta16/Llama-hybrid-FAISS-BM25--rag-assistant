A few different approaches: If the subview has functionality as loading an image and doing more complicated stuff than just being a view, a good approach is to make it into a ViewController instead. In the top ViewController use: - (void) loadView { [super loadView]; } to set up things that need to be ready upon displaying the view. The use: -(void) viewDidLoad { } to do additional setup. In your case it sounds as if you need to add the indicator in the loadView method, then start the retrieval of data in the viewDidLoad method. If you are accessing web services etc. always do this on a different thread. (look into NSOperation for a good, simple way of achieving this).
