How to estimate machine learning training speed on different hardware

I need to put together a proposal for buying a better computer for machine learning. Is there any good way to estimate the general training speeds of computer hardware? Basicly, I want to be able to say that if we purchase a certain computer it in trains x times faster than our current computers. Currently I have a i5 63000U 2.4ghz 2 core cpu, with no gpu. I know switching to a computer with a gpu will speed things up greatly. I just need a way to quantify the improvement to justify the investment. Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
