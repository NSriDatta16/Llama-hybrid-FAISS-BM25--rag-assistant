Sounds like you want to know how to get from the PCA projection back to the original data for 1), and 2) what to do with nearest neighbors? Look at the PCA score coefficient matrix, which allows a back-projection. Regarding nearest neighbors after PCA, the focus commonly involves use of a doubly-centered Gram matrix ($G=XX^T)$. Hence, you probably need to work with the Gram matrix, which is used heavily in distance metric (non-linear manifold) learning.
