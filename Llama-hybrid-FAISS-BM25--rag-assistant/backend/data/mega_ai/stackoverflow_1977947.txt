How to display a child List inside of the DataSource in VS Report Viewer 2008?

I have created a static Generic List (List) and bind it to a Report Viewer's data source. In the Report Viewer designer, I am able to find the correct data source which is List and also able to drag and drop properties like ProductName, ProductNo from a single Product object onto the report. However, this Product object itself contains another List (List). My question is how I can get the objects from this inner List and display them onto the report? Any help would be much appreciated!
