Split a string straight into variables

I’d like to know if standard JS provides a way of splitting a string straight into a set of variables during their initial declaration. For example in Perl I would use: my ($a, $b, $c) = split '-', $str; In Firefox I can write var [a, b, c] = str.split('-'); But this syntax is not part of the ECMAScript 5th edition and as such breaks in all other browsers. What I’m trying to do is avoid having to write: var array = str.split('-'); var a = array[0]; var b = array[1]; var c = array[2]; Because for the code that I’m writing at the moment such a method would be a real pain, I’m creating 20 variables from 7 different splits and don’t want to have to use such a verbose method. Does anyone know of an elegant way to do this?
