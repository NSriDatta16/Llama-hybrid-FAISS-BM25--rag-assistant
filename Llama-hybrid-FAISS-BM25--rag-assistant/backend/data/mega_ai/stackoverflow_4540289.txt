Yes, there are two standard ways. Pass all your params as route params, but encode them with php urlencode() func: foreach ($myargs as $key => $val) { $myargs[$key] = urlencode($val); } $this->_redirect('*/*/myaction', $myargs); Pass your params as query params $this->_redirect('*/*/myaction', array('_query', $myargs)); You'd better take second approach, because your params logically are not route but query parameters. Magento is made with a lot of architecture thinking, so it usually points better ways to do stuff - that's why in your case it's easier to send params using second way. Notice: _redirect() internally uses Mage_Core_Model_Url, so everything said in this answer is true for all other url-forming routines and all usages of Url model.
