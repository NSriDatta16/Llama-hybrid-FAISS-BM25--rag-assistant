You use instance when you want to highlight that an object is created from a given type or class. See this paragraph on Wikipedia : In a language where each object is created from a class, an object is called an instance of that class. If each object has a type, two objects with the same class would have the same datatype. Creating an instance of a class is sometimes referred to as instantiating the class. A real-world example of an object would be "my dog", which is an instance of a type (a class) called "dog", which is a subclass of a class "animal".
