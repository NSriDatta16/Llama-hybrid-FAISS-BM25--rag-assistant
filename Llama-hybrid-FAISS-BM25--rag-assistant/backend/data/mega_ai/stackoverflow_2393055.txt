OK to put my public interfaces into their own package

Would it be OK to put my public interfaces into their own package (for my organisation only). for example com.example.myprogram - contains all normal code com.example.myprogram.public - contains public accessible interfaces com.example.myprogram.abstract - contains abstract classes Is this a good or a bad thing to do, are there any disadvantages?
