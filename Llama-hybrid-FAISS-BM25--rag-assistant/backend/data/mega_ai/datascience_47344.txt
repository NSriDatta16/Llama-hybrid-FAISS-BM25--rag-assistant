You can start with EDA on your data and find out if you can see any trend or seasonality. ( You might need to add or update your current features to get underlying trend/seasonality ) After EDA, you can start looking into following models, all of them are the go-to for time series prediction problem: Classical, Statistical ARMA for stationary data ARIMA for data with a trend - Refer SARIMA for data with seasonality Holt-Winters Forecasting - Refer Theta method - Refer Fourier Transformation - Refer Machine Learning Quantile Regression Forest(QRF) Support Vector Regression(SVR) Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) (LSTM) If you are not comfortable with Statistics then I would advise you to start with LSTMs for forecasting - Refer
