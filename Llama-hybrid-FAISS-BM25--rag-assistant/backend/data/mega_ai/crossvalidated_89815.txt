How to deal with nominal variable with too many levels?

currently I'm trying to model a response variable y, and I have zip code as my independent variable, my model is logistic regression. When it comes to nominal variable, the text book method is to create k-1 dummy variable (assuming the nominal variable have k different levels), but zip code's k is too big, I can't create that amount of dummy variables, is there any other ways to deal with this? Or more generally, how to deal with nominal variables with too many levels (k>=100)?
