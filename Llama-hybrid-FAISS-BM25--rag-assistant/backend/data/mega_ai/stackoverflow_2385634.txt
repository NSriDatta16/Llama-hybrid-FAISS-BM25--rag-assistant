xsd.exe generated classes don't serialize default value attributes

I have few .cs files generated by xsd.exe by a XSD schema. My problem is that when i try to serialize those classes to xml, the attributes whose values match the default values defined in the xsd schema are not being serialized. I found out that my problem is solved when i remove [System.ComponentModel.DefaultValueAttribute(typeof( ), " ")] attribute for the member representing a default field. So my question isn't there more elegant way to do this? For example is there any way to specify that I want the default values to be serialized anyway?
