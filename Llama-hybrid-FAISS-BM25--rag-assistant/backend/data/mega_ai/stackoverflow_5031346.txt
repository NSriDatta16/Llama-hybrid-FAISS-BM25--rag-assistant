According to this IEBlog post you should be able to read it from the browsers User-Agent string via navigator.userAgent : Detecting 64-bit Internet Explorer As machines with more than 4 gigabytes of RAM become more common, more and more users are running 64-bit versions of Windows. For compatibility with 3rd party add-ons, the 32-bit edition of Internet Explorer remains the default on 64-bit systems. However, in some cases it can be useful for websites to recognize when users are visiting using 64-bit systems—for instance, a site may want to know whether to offer a 64-bit executable download. Tokens in the User-Agent string will enable you to determine whether or not the user is running a 64-bit version of Windows, and whether they are running the 64-bit edition of Internet Explorer. 64-bit IE on 64-bit Windows: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Win64; x64 ; Trident/4.0) 32-bit IE on 64-bit Windows: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; WOW64 ; Trident/4.0) Incidentally, WOW64 stands for “Windows on Windows 64-bit.”
