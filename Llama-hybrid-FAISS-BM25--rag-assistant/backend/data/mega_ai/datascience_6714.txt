@Olologin is correct for very basic direct solves with no optimization, but there are optimizations that exist, so I wanted to add a few points... A great many mathematicians spend their entire careers on speeding up and optimizing this problem. So, the solution depends a lot on the composition of the matrix ( sparsity ), whether the problem is convex , whether it is being solved iteratively or directly , and what algorithm is being used. For lots of data science problems $O(n^2)$ and better solves are readily achieved. Some common libraries include: Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines ( BLAS ) LINPACK LAPACK Here are some surveys of the subject: General survey Survey of Iterative Methods LU decomposition Conjugate Gradient Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems
