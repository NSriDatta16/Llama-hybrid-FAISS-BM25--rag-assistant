Why are Random Forests splitted based on m random features?

I was watching the following tutorial on Random forests and it says that, "at each node, choose random subset of m features and only consider splitting on those features" I do not understand why we choose m features. Why don't we consider all features? e.g. Where the features are height, weight, age and m was 2, the random subspace could be height and weight? How does this work? Thank you in advance!
