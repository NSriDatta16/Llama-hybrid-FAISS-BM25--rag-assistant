Indentable and collapsable text and code snippets in MediaWiki

Is it possible to define indentable and collapsable blocks of text or code (e.g. formatted with Syntax Highlight Geshi) in MediaWiki? I have seen collapsable tables and lists in Wikipedia, and would like to apply the same concept to paragraphs and code snippets. Thanks!
