MS Access (MDB) concurrency

For a small project I need to utilize a simple database with very light requirements: few tables, no more than few thousands of records in total, 2 or 3 users. I am working in .NET environment. As a database server (even those Express editions) seems like a huge overkill in this case, a very simple MDB database could do for most of the requirements. I am however, concerned about concurrency. My idea is to place the .mdb file on a network share and let users access this file from their .NET-based clients. The db is mostly aimed at read-only operations but users will occasionally need to update/delete records as well. If this will not be possible at the time (due to the db being locked or whatever), I can hold the updates on the client and process them at a later time. The question itself goes along these points: How are concurrent reads handled in MDB? How are concurrent updates/deletes handled in MDB? Is there a concept of locks and how can I leverage it in a .NET app? Is placing the MDB file on a network share good or horrible idea? As I am working in .NET, I would also love to know how can I detect any concurrency problems and take appropriate action. I.e., which exception should I catch and what action would you recommend to take? EDIT : It may be my bad description of the problem, but most answers seem to advise going for a full blown DB server. I do understand the differences and benefits of having a server installation and have in fact implemented a fair number of projects on MSSQL and Oracle. In this question, however, I am only concerned with Access and its concurrency issues, so please do not suggest a db server. Thanks for your help.
