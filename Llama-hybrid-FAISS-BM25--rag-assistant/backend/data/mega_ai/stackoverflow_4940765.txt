All these answers are correct, only the metachars need to be escaped. Its kind of too bad that php doesen't have a regex operator like preg_match([operator]/$var/) so the delimeters could be the quoting agent. This way delimeter wouldn't have to be quoted in an external $var. (Perl has this with m//,s/// or =~ operators) The preg_quote is a nice way to do this, unfortunately, sometimes you want to match literal '\char' without it being escaped to '\char' for instance, and escape the rest. Not many choices with preg_quote(). You could literally set up your own php functions that does quoting of metachars (or take off a quote after preg_quote() ). like a replace all /([{}\[\]()^\$.|*+?\\<>$delim])/ with \\$1 or something. Set the $delim, and/or take out possibly the escape or any other metachars you don't want escaped. Just my $.02
