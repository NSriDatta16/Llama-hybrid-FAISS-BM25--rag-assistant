Your data is nonnegative, so maybe you could try nonnegative matrix factorization ? Also if you think that you can model your data with some kind of distribution coming from exponential family, you could try Generalized Low Rank Models (see Exponential family PCA). They also cover NMF. An example implementation comes from H2O and it is possible to use it from Python and R.
