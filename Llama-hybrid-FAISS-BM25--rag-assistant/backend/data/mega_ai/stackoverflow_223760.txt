You might want to take a look at DDHidLib, Dave Dribin's excellent framework to work with USB HID devices independently. http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2007/03/19/ddhidlib_10 (not just about joysticks, so read more than the first paragraph of that blog post) Some of the functionality of DDHidLib no longer works under Leopard, due to some security concerns at Apple regarding capturing an HID device, but if you're lucky it might provide you with what you need.
