If getCon() returns a new Connection each time it is called, or returns a ThreadLocal connection, then you are safe and there is no need to use synchronized If you return the same connection to everyone you might still save in terms of synchronization, because there is no state in the connection that gets changed (in your current code). But you should avoid this practice. Consider a connection pool instead. And a few notes on general design principles. DAOs form a separate layer. Each layer exists for a reason, not juts for the sake of having cool names. The DAO layer exists in order to abstract, or in other words - hide the database access from the services that use the DAO objects. In order to imagine it more clearly - the DAO has to be written in a way that if tomorrow you decide to switch from RDBMD storage (via JDBC) to XML storage, you should be able to do that by changing only the DAO objects and nothing else.
