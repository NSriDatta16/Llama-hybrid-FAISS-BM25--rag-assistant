As I read your question "and the fluctuations around the stable point are much smaller that the fluctuations during the transient period " what I get out of it is a request to detect when and if the variance of the errors has changed and if so when ! If that is your objective then you might consider reviewing the work or R. Tsay "outliers, Level Shifts and Variance Changes in Time Series" , Journal of Forecasting Vol 7 , 1-20 (1988). I have done considerable work in this area and find it very productive in yielding good analysis. Other approaches (ols/linear regression analysis for example ) which assume independent observations and no Pulse Outliers and/or no level shifts or local time trends and time-invariant parameters are insufficient in my opinion.
