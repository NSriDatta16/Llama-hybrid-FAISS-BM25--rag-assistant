What's wrong with a constant forecast? Would you take a nonconstant one even if its accuracy were lower? You responded, no, and I concur. Perhaps your data generating process (DGP) is best approximated by ARIMA(0,1,0) or ARIMA(0,0,0) among the class of models considered, ARIMA(p,d,q). If the DGP is a random walk, i.e. ARIMA(0,1,0), or white noise, i.e. ARIMA(0,0,0), previous observations will not be constant, yet an optimal (under symmetric loss) point forecast will be a constant. If you were worried about possibly obtaining negative forecasts, you could refer to the thread "How to achieve strictly positive forecasts?" . The core idea there is to set lambda=0 when fitting a model with auto.arima : fit . But your series values and their forecasts appear quite far away from zero, so this is probably not a problem. If you wanted integer forecasts, Weiss "Integer‐Valued Autoregressive Moving‐Average (INARMA) Models" (2018) could be of interest. But again, this is probably more relevant when the numbers are small, which is not the case in your example.
