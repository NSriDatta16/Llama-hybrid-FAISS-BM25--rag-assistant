I'm not familiar with either package, but my guess is either 1) a bug in the package or 2) model misspecificiation. Since the models are being fit with exact log likelihood and these functions are convex, global convergence should be guaranteed for any feasible data set, it just might take prohibitively long amount of time, depending on the fitting algorithm. You mentioned normalization of regressor variables doesn't help. Just how many data points do you have? P-values of 1 again suggest misspecification, perhaps due to under-/overfitting. As far as I understand, in the conditional logistic regression, you are trying to find a single mean/slope pair (for age ) that will maximize the likelihood of >6000 conditional distributions. If there is a great deal of dissimilarity between groups with similar ages, the resulting likelihood may be very flat, convergence very slow and the final fit very poor. Even with more regressors, there might not be enough compared to the number of strata. The bife documentation says it uses a 'unconditional model's which I assume means uses it uses explicit parameters for each value of id , but in this case you might be running into a lack of data to estimate 6000+ variables with much accuracy. Does the problem occur with synthetic data? Can you provide a data sample or a minimal reproducible example? That error is probably coming from the underlying optimization routine called by clogit , which isn't very good error propagation/interpretation on the author's part.
