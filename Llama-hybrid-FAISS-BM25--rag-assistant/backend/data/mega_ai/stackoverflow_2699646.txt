How to get logical parts of a sentence with java?

Let's say there is a sentence: On March 1, he was born. Changing it to He was born on March 1. doesn't break the sense of the sentence and it is still valid. Shuffling words in any other way would produce weird to invalid sentences. So basically, I'm talking about parts of the sentence, which make the information more specific, but removing them doesn't break the whole sentence. Is there any NLP library in which identifying such parts is available?
