The variance stabilizing transformation of the Poisson distribution is to take the square root. Once you have done that, the variance is approximately 1/4. So to change to a variance of 1 you would just need to $2\cdot\sqrt{\lambda_k}$ for each of your $k$ vectors. This still does not make the means the same though for each of your vectors. To do that you would still need to subtract the mean of the transformed data. Also see the Wikipedia page on the Anscombe transform for additional options with Poisson data. Note all of these transforms frequently recommend the mean of the series be about 5, under that and they just have too few of values and will never look symmetric. That is a limitation, even with the CDF transform recommended by Tilefish. I have not seen any simple transforms recommended for negative binomial distributions, so the CDF approach may be the best option. In this article though I do some simulations and show that simply adding 1 sigma (for control charting) after the $2\cdot\sqrt{\lambda_k}$ transform produces pretty close to nominal coverage.
