Why we should limit how many times we use the test set, and that we should use the validation ? It is best practice to evaluate the test dataset only once because performance on the test dataset is the best estimate for the generalization ability of a trained model. Repeatably evaluating the test dataset encourages using different algorithms and hyperparameters to better fit the test data. Fitting to the test dataset may result in overestimating the generalization ability of the model. Why it would be improper to compute and use test set means ? There are many ways to evaluate performance on the test dataset. Calculating mean performance can be one acceptable way. The mean is one of many ways to measure the central tendency for a group of data. There may be slices of the data that are more important, the mean does account for that.
