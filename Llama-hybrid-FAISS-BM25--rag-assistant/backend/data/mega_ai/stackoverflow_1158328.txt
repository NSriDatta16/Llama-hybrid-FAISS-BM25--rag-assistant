Common framework for publishing books online

Django book and Real World Haskell are using some similarly-looking web publishing platforms (with rigid TOC/chapters/paragraphs+comments structure). However, I haven't found any reference to the platform used on the corresponding websites. Is there a publishing framework or CMS similar to the ones mentioned?
