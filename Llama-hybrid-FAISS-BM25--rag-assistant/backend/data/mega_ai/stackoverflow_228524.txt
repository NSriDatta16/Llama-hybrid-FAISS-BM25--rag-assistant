Glassfish is actually an easy to use app server. I think it's easier for a beginner to use and it's integrated with Netbeans. Setting up database connection caches is easy, for example. You administer the server through this web page: http://localhost:4848 (login: admin, password: adminadmin) Glassfish will run your apps on port 8080. The Glassfish home page: http://glassfish.dev.java.net (don't really need to read) For non-Netbeans users there's a QuickStart guide: http://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/quickstart/index.html Here's a screencast overview: http://download.java.net/javaee5/screencasts/admin-console/index.html At some point you will want to learn Tomcat too because it's so prevalent, but Glassfish is a much friendlier start. In fact, it's probably better as a production server too, if you can find an affordable host.
