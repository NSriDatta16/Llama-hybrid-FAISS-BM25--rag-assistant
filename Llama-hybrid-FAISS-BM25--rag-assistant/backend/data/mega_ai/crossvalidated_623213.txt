To answer your question 1: when there's only 1 continuous instrument $z_1$ and no $x$ , the 2SLS estimator yields a weighted average of individual treatment effects $\beta_i$ (assuming treatment effect heterogeneity), where the weights are the individual first-stage coefficient $\gamma_{1,i}$ . To see why this is the case, see Nick Huntington-Klein (2020) section 2.1 and appendix 1 for a simple illustration. To answer your question 2: yes but conditionally. Imbens and Angrist (1994) (Theorem 2) show that when treatment is binary and instrument $Z$ is discrete, then the IV estimator yields a convex combination of LATEs at each discrete level of $Z$ , under regularity conditions. Furthermore, Mogstad, Torgovitsky, and Walters (2021) show that in presence of multiple instruments, 2SLS estimator also yields a weighted average of LATEs, under a mild, testable "partial monotonicity" assumption.
