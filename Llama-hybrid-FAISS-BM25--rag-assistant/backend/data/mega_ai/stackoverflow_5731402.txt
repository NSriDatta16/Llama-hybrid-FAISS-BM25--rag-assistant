Android WebView not showing a JavaScript section of website

Thanks for reading! I am using a WebView to show a mobile website. There is a page.html which does the AJAX xmlHttpRequest.responseText to fetch the page content. I see the entire website except two sections displaying ads. var agent=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); var is_iphone = ((agent.indexOf('iphone')!=-1)); if(is_iphone) { OAS_AD('MISC1'); } else { OAS_AD('TOP'); } I have done WebSettings = this.page.getSettings(); //page is a WebView s.setJavaScriptEnabled(); //enable JavaScript I am fairly new to HTML/JS. Could someone please help? Thanks! EDIT: Adding code. Note: The section below and the the section above appears in the tag ');document.writeln(' ');} //--> = 11)document.writeln(' '); //--> = 11)OAS_RICH(pos);else OAS_NORMAL(pos);} //--> EDIT2: I also tried ChromeWebClient - but turns out it only adds support for JS methods like alert(), prompt() ,etc. There is not much documentation except this but the OP seems to have accepted an answer regardless of whether it worked for them. Nevertheless, that solution didn't work for me.
