First of all you need a checkbox and the id you want to delete: Delete user You can then test if the checkbox has been set and then manually set the GET parameter to reuse your existing code: if(isset($_POST['delete'])){ $_GET['id'] = $_POST['user_id']; } That's not the most elegant solution but a really simple one that should work with your code.
