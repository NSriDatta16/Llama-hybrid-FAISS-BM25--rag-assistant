Magento Images on list.phtml

I am looking to style product listing similar to that found here: http://www.diptyqueparis.com/personal-fragrances.html CSS has only gotten me so far. My list.phtml is currently stock (from blank theme). I am looking to have my first and last images to display in a different size as the rest of the product images and adjust the grid accordingly. Then I would assume I have to modify the ul to accommodate these changes, but can't do so on my own, and this is where I need help. Any suggestions to get me going in the right (logical) direction would be appreciated. Thanks for reading. EDIT: I am not editing any core files. This is in regards to the list.phtml found in the blank (or any) theme.
