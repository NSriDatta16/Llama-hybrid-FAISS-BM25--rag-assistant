Recall (in combination with precision) is generally used in areas where one is primarily interested in finding the Positives. An example for such an area is e.g. Performance Marketing or (as already suggested by ch'ls link) the area of Information Retrieval. So: If you are primarily interested in finding the negatives, "True Negative Rate" (as already suggested by chl) is the way to go. But don't forget to look at a "precision for focus on negatives"-metric (i.e. $\frac{TN}{TN + FN}$, because otherwise the "True Negative Rate" can be optimized by setting the prediction to "Negative" for all data points). If you are interested in optimizing recall for both negatives AND positives, you should look at "Accuracy" (see again chl's link). But beware of class skew (i.e. you have many many more positives than negatives or vice versa ... in this case one can "optimize" accuracy by setting the prediction to the major class for all data points).
