When we need fine tuning of CNN?

I want to know the situation that when we need fine tuning of model that is save the weights of the model trained on old data? Is it needed when we use same training set but try it on different test set or is it required when we have to use different training sets and different training labels? What advantage we will get from this fine tuning?
