One counter-example that I see often: Outcomes that are proportions (eg 10% = 2/20, 20%= 1/5, etc) should not get dumped through OLS, instead use a logistic regression with the denominator specified. This will weight the cases correctly even though they have different variances. OTOH, logistic regression is a proper regression model, despite it mostly being taught as a classifier. So maybe this doesn't count.
