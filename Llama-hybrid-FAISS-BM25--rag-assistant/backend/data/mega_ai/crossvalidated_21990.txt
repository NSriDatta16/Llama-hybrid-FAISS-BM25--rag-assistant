How do I compare 2 models?

I would like to show that a new biomarker (let's say percent tumor volume reduction at 3 weeks of treatment estimated with automatic methods) performs better than an old one (same measure, but based on manual volume measurements) to distinguish groups or predict outcome. I have these different settings: outcome: progression free survival (PFS) (I have all data, no censoring) method: a) log-rank test for trends in stratified Kaplan Meier b) cox regression (is that a good idea if I have all data?) c) logistic regression (binary oucome PFS outcome: treatment response (3 groups) method: pairwise test on means (Mann-Whitney-U) I'd like to know if there are better approaches for these settings, and how can I compare the resulting p-values (for the new and for old biomarker). Can I compare them directly, should I run bootstrapping etc. thanks.
