I went through an autoencoder example listed at https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/17_autoencoders_and_gans.ipynb . The author used the binary cross-entropy loss function, and it seemed to work fine. I replaced it with the mse loss function, and the results were similar. Note that the author used the selu activation function. (Also, the notebooks help visualize the 'predicted' outputs as well)
