How to get Rspec test in Colour for windows on MINGW

I'm new to Ruby, just tying to learn it, following the Ruby on Rails Tutorial I'm running the GitBash MINGW for window, and when I run (rspec 2.4.0) rspec spec/ I get the response: You must use ANSICON 1.31 or later (http://adoxa.110mb.com/ansicon/) to use colour on Windows ... but I quite like using MINGW. and if I use ANSICON I cant seem to get ssh-add to work, I get the error Could not open a connection to your authentication agent I could use MINGW for Pushing and ANSICON for Testing, but I'd rather have it all in the one console.
