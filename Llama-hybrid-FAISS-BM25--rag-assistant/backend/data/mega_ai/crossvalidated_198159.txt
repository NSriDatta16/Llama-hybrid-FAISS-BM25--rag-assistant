Help with use of Bayesian statistics example

I followed this simple example of using Bayesian statistics for a simple problem . Where I lost the story was at â€• All we need now is to be able to send newsletters based on a probability distribution instead of a single cluster membership. If you are sending many emails in a period of time you can just pick a version at random for each email being sent. Use the posterior as the randomization distribution. Can you please explain the rational of using this strategy?
