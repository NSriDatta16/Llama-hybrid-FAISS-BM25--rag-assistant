Using ninject/autofac for a given scenario

I have some providers, say - ... Each of these providers can give me a session : ... Currently, I instantiate "named" sessions by looking at the provider, instantiating the type, and injecting the URL (manually). I could use a session factory, which would probably have to understand the url and return a proper session. Is there a way to handle this more elegantly/simply with ninject/autofac?
