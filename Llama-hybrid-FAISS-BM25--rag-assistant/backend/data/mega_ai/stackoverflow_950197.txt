C# Best way of assigning values to strings in a loop

I wonder what is the most efficient way of assigning string variables in a loop. So, for example if I have to browse through a list of nodes and assigning the value of the node to a string, would it be better if I define a variable before the loop starts like string myStringVariable = string.Empty foreach(XmlNode node in givenNodes) { myStringVariable = node.Value; .... ... } or would it be more efficient if I define the variable inside the loop like foreach(XmlNode node in givenNodes) { string myStringVariable = node.Value; .... ... } I think the first approach is more efficient while the second looks more elegant. Is there a performance difference between the two? Thanks for you answers.
