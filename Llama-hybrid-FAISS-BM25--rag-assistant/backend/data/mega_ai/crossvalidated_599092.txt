As you evidently have a defined time at which the treatment began, this is a simpler problem than trying to find a change point in general. You model population as a function of time, but include an interaction between time and treatment. That allows for different slopes and intercepts, depending on treatment. Here's a simple example in R. Have pop increase for the first 36 time points and decrease for the last 11, with random noise built in. The treatment trt starts at time=37 . set.seed(204) popUp Then do a linear regression model including an interaction of time with treatment. fishMod |t|) # (Intercept) 24.92105 0.41817 59.596 The time:trtTRUE interaction coefficient indicates that the slope is different between the 2 treatment periods. It's the difference from the coefficient shown for time alone, which represents the slope while trt=FALSE . You might use a Poisson generalized linear model if your values are counts. It's often better to model time flexibly, for example with a regression spline, but you might not have enough data with only 11 points during the treatment period. A warning: if you decided to do this analysis of slope only after you saw the results, then the p -values shouldn't be relied upon. The model producing them assumes that you didn't use prior outcomes from the data to build the model. If you were already intending to look at different slopes over time depending on treatment, then you're OK. Another warning: proper time-series analysis takes into account correlations along time among the observations. That's particularly important if you are trying to evaluate multiple observed predictor variables. I don't think you will have a problem justifying a simple evaluation of linear trends in this simple case with a defined time at which you introduced the treatment.
