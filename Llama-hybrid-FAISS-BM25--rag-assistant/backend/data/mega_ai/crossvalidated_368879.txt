Generate PDF from CTMC

I have an irreducible continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with a finite state space. The CTMC also does not have any one-step transitions from any state to itself. I have the transition rate matrix $Q$ , so I can solve for the limiting probabilities (null space of $Q^T$ - computed via the SVD) and stationary transition probabilities (matrix exponential $e^{Qt}$ ). Given some time interval $\Delta t$ , how do I determine the probability density function (PDF) for the number of times state $i$ has a one-step transition to state $j$ in such an interval? I'm looking for something like "state $i$ goes to state $j$ 3 times with probability 0.6 and 4 times with probability 0.4 in time interval $\Delta t$ ." Do I need any other information? note: My matrix $Q$ is very large (over three million states), so I would like to avoid computing a matrix exponential. The matrix is also very sparse - each row only have five non-zeros elements, but I don't think that would help me too much in computing a matrix exponential.
