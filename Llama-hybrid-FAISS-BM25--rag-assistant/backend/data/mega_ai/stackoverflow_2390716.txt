Business library reuse or exposing services

I am having trouble deciding between two possible design choices. I have a web site which has a pretty extensive business layer and DAL (website, bll, and dal are all in multiple separate dlls). I need to design a windows service that can take some of my business objects, write them to a file, and store them locally within our network. The files are then imported into a 3rd party program which does further processing on them. I can design this service one of two ways: Wrap the service around the business layer and DAL. This would be quick and easy but the downside is every time the business layer changes, the service will have to be updated. Add a web service to the web site and just query the web service for what I need. The windows service wouldn't have to use the business layer and as long as the web service doesn't change, I'll be good. The only downside is that I may have to create some basic business objects to parse the web service's xml into. The windows service will have to poll the business layer/dal or web service every 10-20 minutes or so. The windows service is necessary because the web site is hosted offsite and thus doesn't have access to any of our local resources. I am leaning towards option 2 but I'm torn. Given the two choices, which is the better option? Are there other possible options that I haven't considered? Also, how do you usually design for situations where you have one core set of libraries that are primarly used by a website but may end up being used either for data retrieval or to perform some function?
