Good tool to visualise database schema?

Are there any good tools for visualising a pre-existing database schema? I'm using MySQL if it matters. I'm currently using MySQL Workbench to process an SQL create script dump, but it's clunky, slow and a manual process to drag all the tables about (which would be okay if it wasn't so slow).
