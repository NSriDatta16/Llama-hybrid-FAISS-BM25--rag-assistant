What is the difference between a true estimation and an estimator?

In a machine learning class, the instructor was explaining Maximum Likelihood Estimation. He mentioned that $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}=argmax_\theta P(D;\theta)$ Where D is the data observed, $\theta$ is the true estimation and $\hat{\theta}$ is the estimator. Is an estimator the maximum value of all values that a true estimation? Is a true estimation the same as a parameter? (this is not a second question but more of a segue from the first, which i thought should be asked here instead of in a separate question)
