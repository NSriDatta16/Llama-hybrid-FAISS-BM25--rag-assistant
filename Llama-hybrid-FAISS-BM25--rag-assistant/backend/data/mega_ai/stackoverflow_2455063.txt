Ruby Rails _without_ ActiveRecord

I'm looking for any pointers on how to write a rails web app without ActiveRecord. A doc or an example of a (not too complex) web app using storage backends other than a relational database would be greatly appreciated. It's not clear on what should be implemented in the model classes in order to make the rails app work without the ActiveRecord layer. Thanks,
