Yes, there shouldn't be any problem given your description in comments of skewed predictor as actually meaning a 0/1 dummy variable that just has many more values of 1 than 0. There's no reason why this should be a problem; at most it will mean you just have a relatively high degree of uncertainty about your estimates of the coefficient for that variable, and this will just come up automatically in your results no particular problem there. But in my world, even 1,000 observations of X=0 and 30,000 of X=1 is still lots of data... :-) The fishhook with skewed continuous data is that you may end up with a few extreme points for one of your continuous variables. These points have high degrees of leverage and potentially of influence which can cause you problems. But this is not likely to be a problem in your case.
