You have the estimated coefficient and from its confidence interval you can work out its standard error. Assuming they used a normal approximation you divide the width of the confidence interval by 2 * 1.96. If they used $t$ then replace 1.96 by the corresponding value of $t$ for your degrees of freedom. Square the standard error to get the sampling variance. You now have enough to combine the estimates using the inverse variance weighting method. Edited in response to additional calculations posted by OP Your calculation of the sampling variances is correct but you do not need to estimate a shared variance, you need to weight each coefficient by the inverse of its sampling variance then average them. It would be much easier at this point to use your favourite software to do this. There are several packages in R for meta-analysis and you can also use Stata. So you have two estimates $y_i$ where $i=1,2$ and their sampling variances $v_i$. You then form the weights $w+i = \frac{1}{v_i}$ then your overall estimate $y$ and its sampling variance $w$ are $$ y = \sum \frac{(w_i y_i)}{\sum w_i} $$ $$ w = \frac{1}{\sum w_i} $$
