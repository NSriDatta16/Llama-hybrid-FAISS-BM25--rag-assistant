Implementing geospatial indexing in Redis sounds prohibitively time consuming if you think MongoDB is a valid option. Mongo is fast and very nice to work with. If the majority of the queries will be against the geospatial index there is no reason not to use Mongo, in my opinion. I often find myself using both Mongo and Redis in the same project. They both have very useful properties, and some use cases work really well in Mongo, and some in Redis. However, the converse is also true, some things are really, really hard to get right in Redis, and other things aren't practically possible in Mongo. Geospatial indexes is an example of the former and set operations an example of the latter. Also, without knowing very much about Sunspot, would it really use Redis? Doesn't it use Solr, which uses the filesystem for storage? It doesn't sound to me like you could get Redis in there, and unless I'm completely wrong I would say that you should definitely go with MongoDB.
