Both the applet and webstart methods of deploying JavaFX applications use JNLP files. This is a change from the past when JNLP was only used by WebStart (which is what you are referring to). There isn't much difference, it depends on the user experience you want the user to have. I would say for most significant apps, you are better off with the more traditional webstart method of launching apps (download a JNLP file from a link and have javaws launch it). There are subtle differences in the security privileges between a applet and webstart, further more there are also some API differences inside JavaFX between what works in an applet vs what works in a webstart launched app. These are being slowly eliminated.
