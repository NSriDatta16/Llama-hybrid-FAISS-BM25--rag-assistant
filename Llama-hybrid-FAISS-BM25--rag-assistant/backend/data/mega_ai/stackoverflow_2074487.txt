Assume for each record in the table there are 5 index records. Now each delete is in essence 5 operations. Add to that, you have a clustered index. Notice the clustered index delete time is huge? (10x) longer than the other indexes? This is because your data is being reorganized with every record deleted. I would suggest dropping at least that index, doing a mass delete, than reapplying. Index operations on delete and insert are inherently costly. A single rebuild is likely a lot faster.
