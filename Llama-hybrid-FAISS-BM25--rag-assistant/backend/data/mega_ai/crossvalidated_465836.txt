How to evaluate multiple time series forcasting model?

Hi I have multiple time series forcasting model and I want to evaluate the predictive power of this model. Let's say, we are predicting $A_T$ and $B_T$ by using $A_t,t\in[0,...,T-1]$ and $B_t,t\in[0,...,T-1]$ I found Normalized Root Mean Square (NRMS) and Root Mean Square (RMS) are very common measures for evaluation of time series forcasting model, but how to generalize it for multiple time series forcasting?
