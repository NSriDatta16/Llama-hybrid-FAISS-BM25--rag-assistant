Cross correlation vs mutual information

What is the difference between Cross Correlation and Mutual Information. What kind of problems can be solved using these measures and when is it appropriate to use one over the other. Thanks for the comments. To clarify, the question is prompted by an interest in image analysis rather than time series analysis although any enlightenment in that area would also be appreciated
