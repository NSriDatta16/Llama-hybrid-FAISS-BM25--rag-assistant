After a conversation the developers (I have been told that the alternative logger you link to is quite old and it's usage is discouraged), I am using the default, standard logger and xslt. If it does cause problems for you, please report a bug on CruiseControl.Net Jira , the more people vote on this the sooner someone with commit access to the code might look into it. "View Build Log" is a raw view, not usable except for debugging the build server setup - for some of my project this is almost 5MB large and does not cause any problems for the server (although opening it hangs the browser for a while). NCover can cause problems inflating buildlog.xml to over 100MB - you have to use NCoverExplorer to analyze the results before merging them if this happens(but don't bother before you start getting exceptions from the server). To see the formatted MSBuild results in the WebDashboard, make sure that the dashboard configuration includes msbuild.xsl (this will give you a link to "MSBuild Report" on ViewBuildReport page and include some basic information on the page itself).
