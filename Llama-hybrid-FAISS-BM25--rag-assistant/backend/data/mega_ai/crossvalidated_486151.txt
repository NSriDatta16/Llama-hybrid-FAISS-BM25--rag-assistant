Interaction is in reality more complex than the simple product term would suggest. The true conditional mean function $f(x_1, x_2) = E(Y | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2)$ is most certainly not a simply planar function except in the most primitive circumstances. In other words, you can generally assume that $f(x_1,x_2) \neq \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$ for all $(x_1,x_2)$ of interest. Thus, more complex functions are needed. A quick nod in that direction is the standard multiplicative interaction model where $f(x_1,x_2)$ is assumed equal to $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1x_2$ . Although this is a better approximation to the true $f(x_1, x_2)$ , it is also most certainly not equal to $f(x_1,x_2)$ , essentially for the same reason as for the planar (no-interaction) function. There are classes of functions known as "universal approximators" that become closer to the true $f(x_1, x_2)$ as the complexity of the function increases. One of these classes motivates the simple product interaction; this is the polynomial class. Within this class, however, you also have all other product terms like $x_1x_2^2$ , $x_1^3x_2^2$ , etc. So from the standpoint of polynomial universal approximators, the simple product interaction model is the simplest level of complexity that can be introduced to incorporate interaction. But one can assume that all other polynomial product terms are also needed (at least in theory; estimation is a separate issue). Other universal approximator classes exist and (necessarily) allow interactions, although these have quite different forms than the simple product term. Examples include neural network and Fourier function classes.
