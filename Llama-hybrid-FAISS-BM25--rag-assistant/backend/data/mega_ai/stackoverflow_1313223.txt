replace rand() with openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()

I need a replacement for PHP's rand() function that uses a cryptographically strong random number generator. The openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() function gets you access to the strong random number generator, but it outputs its data as a byte string. Instead, I need an integer between 0 and X . I imagine the key is to get the output of openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() into an integer, then you can do any math on it that you need to. I can think of a few "brute force" ways of converting from a byte string to an integer, but I was hoping for something ... elegant.
