PHP - Convert all POST data into SESSION variables

There's got to be a much more elegant way of doing this. How do I convert all non-empty post data to session variables, without specifying each one line by line? Basically, I want to perform the function below for all instances of X that exist in the POST array. if (!empty($_POST['X'])) $_SESSION['X']=$_POST['X']; I was going to do it one by one, but then I figured there must be a much more elegant solution
