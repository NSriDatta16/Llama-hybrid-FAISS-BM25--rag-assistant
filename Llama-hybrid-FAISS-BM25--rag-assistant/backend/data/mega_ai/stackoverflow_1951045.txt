If you want to know if your second code fragment is slower, the quick way to find out would be to just use timeit . I wouldn't expect there to be that much difference though, since they seem pretty equivalent. You should also ask if a performance difference actually matters in the code in question. Often readability is of more value than performance. I can't think of any good reasons for importing a module in a function, but sometimes you just don't know you'll need to do something until you see the problem. I'll have to leave it to others to point out a constructive example of that, if it exists.
