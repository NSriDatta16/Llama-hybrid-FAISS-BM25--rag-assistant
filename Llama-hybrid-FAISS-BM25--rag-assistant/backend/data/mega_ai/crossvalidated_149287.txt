Even if both tools implement PCA correctly, the results could be different if tools automatically standardize the data by default (I would always recommend standardization prior to PCA though). Very slight differences could also come from: obtaining the PCs via eigendecomposition on the covariance marix vs. singular vector decomposition If both implementations use the classic but more comput. expensive covariance matrix approach, the the co-variances & variances may have been calculated using Bessel's correction term (1/[n-1] instead of 1/n for scaling). I have a step by step tutorial for coding up an PCA in Python so that you could check your results in each step if it helps.
