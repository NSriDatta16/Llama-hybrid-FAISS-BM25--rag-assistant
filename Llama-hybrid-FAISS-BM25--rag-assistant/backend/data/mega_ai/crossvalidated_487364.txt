Testing interactions in simulated data

I have some simulated data and wish to test for interactions. There are 500 predictors (0, 1 or 2) and a binary outcome variable. Predictor 101 and 424 are simulated to interact multiplicative. The data is in the object 'dataMatrix' in which each predictor is called "Xn" (n : 1-500) and the binary outcome is called 'Phenotype'. I test the interaction by fitting the predictors to the outcome variable using logistic regression and including an interaction term for the specific pairwise interaction as such, model I have simulated 3 data sets with pairwise interactions (101, 424), (10, 50) & (200, 500). The interaction terms are below: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) X101:X424 0.34597 0.1866066 1.854008 0.06373804 Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) X10:X50 0.3210071 0.1780819 1.802581 0.07145408 Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) X200:X500 -1.509658 1.161329 -1.29994 0.1936215 I was expecting to see interaction terms of higher value and with significant p-values. Therefore I am in doubt if I am using the correct approach. Is this the correct way of testing for interactions or am I doing it wrong?
