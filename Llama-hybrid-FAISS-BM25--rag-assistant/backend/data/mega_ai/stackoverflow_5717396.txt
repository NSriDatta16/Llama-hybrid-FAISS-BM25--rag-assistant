My opinion is you should use a naming scheme reflecting specialization. I mean you don't need to think about if it's a prefix, suffix or any other. Just write names that may clearly identify classes. Honestly I believe namespacing wouldn't repleace a right class naming scheme, because namespaces are an organizational thing while classes are part of what your program does. So, at the end of the day, I'd choice your second option: specialized naming for namespaces and classes.
