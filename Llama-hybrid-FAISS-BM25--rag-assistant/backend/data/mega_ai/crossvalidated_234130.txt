If you sort the t_id column in the test dataset you will see that it goes from 1-36000. I would assume that it refers to "trade id". The way financial time series forecasting works is the you usually take lagged values of features at time t-1 and use them to predict the target value at time t , thus I would assume that all the features from 1-21 are lagged values from the previous week and the target variable must be the price increase/decrease for a particular trade id. If you look at the probabilities that your algo outputs you can see that they are usually in a range of 0.45-0.55 or something like this, thus it's not very precise, however you still get a slight edge over random results. This explains the large testing set of 36000, in order to squeeze that small edge you need to make a lot of trades. Here Renaissance Technologies (arguably the best quant fund) mentions that they have a very slight edge in forecasting the prices, but they exploit it via a large number of trades + they are using a lot of leverage to enhance these returns. I would assume Numerai is doing something similar.
