If you select individual labels and drag them around the view, they should "snap" to certain guides around the interface. If you drag an element close to another element it should snap to about 8 pixels away, and that's the standard spacing between elements on the iPhone. If you want more precise control, you can select an element and use the arrow keys to move it around one pixel at a time. You can also use the Align Horizontally/Vertically in Container menu items from the Layout menu.
