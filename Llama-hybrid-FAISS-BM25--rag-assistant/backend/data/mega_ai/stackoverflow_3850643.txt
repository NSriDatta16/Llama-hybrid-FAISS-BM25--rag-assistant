By the C++ standard, minShip, maxShip, and shipVector have been initialized using their default constructors. However, you indicated that you are using a style checker. Your style-guide may require explicit calls to the default constructor. One reason to do this is to make sure that you call the correct constructor and not rely on automatic behavior -- this is not what the standard require or even typical C++ programmers do, but if that's your style, and your style checker flags it, you might just need to comply. There are all kinds of style rules in place in different organizations that aren't necessary for the compiler, but perhaps make it easier for developers to understand each other's code.
