No, we don't re-train the model. Here is what the help page ?Arima say for the model parameter: If model is passed, this same model is fitted to ‘x’ without re-estimating any parameters. Here is an example: # library(forecast) # model.1 We note: The estimated coefficients are the same. (No surprise, since they are not re-estimated.) The standard errors are all zero. (I'd assume they are manually set this way, since they don't make any sense and would not be connected to the new data.) The estimated residual variance $\sigma^2$ has changed. This makes sense, since prediction intervals for non-re-restimated parameters will be larger than for re-estimated parameters, since the parameters don't fit as well as re-estimated ones would have. The log-likelihood and information criteria change, since they are all related to $\sigma^2$. Now, if we forecast, we of course get different values, since in each case the last observations we autoregress on are different: # forecast(model.1,h=6)$mean Time Series: Start = 25 End = 30 Frequency = 1 [1] 150.1410 140.3254 136.2646 134.5846 133.8896 133.6020 # forecast(model.2,h=6)$mean Time Series: Start = 49 End = 54 Frequency = 1 [1] 187.6868 155.8583 142.6906 137.2431 134.9894 134.0570 As to why we would not re-estimate the model after getting new data... I also don't see a really good reason. Perhaps in specific situations you might have performance issues. You may assume that a few more data points won't change the parameters a lot, especially if you already have a long time series with thousands of observations - in which case re-estimating would take some time, too.
