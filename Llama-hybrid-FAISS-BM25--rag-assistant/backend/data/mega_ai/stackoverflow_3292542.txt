Overlapping with Fusion Chart

While I drag an element (DIV or SPAN or any ), over the FusionChart control, the draggable element disappears. Sometimes the elements comes under the FusionChart. I need to drag the element over the Fusion Chart control. Here I am using Drag and Drop using jQuery. And i am dragging a text. What is the solution ?
