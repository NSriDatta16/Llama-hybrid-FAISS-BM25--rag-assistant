Uploading & Unzipping files to S3 through Rails hosted on Heroku?

I'd like to be able to upload a zip file to my Rails application that contains a number of images. Then I'd like Rails to unzip that file and attach the images inside to my Photo's model via Paperclip , so that they are ultimately stored on my Amazon S3 account (configured through Paperclip). I'd like do do this all on my Rails site hosted on Heroku , which unfortunately doesn't allow local storage of any kind (so far as I'm aware) to temporarily do the unzipping before the Paperclip parsing. How would I do this??
