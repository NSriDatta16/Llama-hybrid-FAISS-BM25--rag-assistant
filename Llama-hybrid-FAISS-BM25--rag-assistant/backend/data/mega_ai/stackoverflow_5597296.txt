Average time for mobile handset to make to setup a network connection

I wanted to check what the average time to setup a TCP HTTP UDP SIP connection on mobile handset (say Android OS device) is. What I want to check is the total average time to connect between a mobile handset and server say sending just 1 byte of data.
