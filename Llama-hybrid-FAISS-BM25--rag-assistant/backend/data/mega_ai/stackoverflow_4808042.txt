Mostly just for organization and separation of logical pieces of CSS. For example, I keep a _reset.scss that I can paste into any project, then have things like _layout.sass , _homepage.sass , etc. They all get shoved into a single compiled CSS file (so I don't have to deal with multiple HTTP requests), but I can get to the styles for any given piece of a project quickly and easily.
