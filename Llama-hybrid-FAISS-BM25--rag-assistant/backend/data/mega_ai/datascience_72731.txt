For Beginners : You may read this quora answer Which explains Pros and cons of Sigmoid Activations and softmax Probability. there are 6 answers at the time of writing for inclusiveness . Sigmoid vs Softmax Answer Highlights : if you see the function of Softmax, the sum of all softmax units are supposed to be 1. In sigmoid it’s not really necessary. In the binary classification both sigmoid and softmax function are the same where as in the multi-class classification we use Softmax function. If you’re using one-hot encoding, then I strongly recommend to use Softmax. What i Noticed : to the best of my knowledge >> Softmax is probability distribution for various possible classes (multi class) in our sample space. and all classes must be predefined in advance before passing anything to softmax activation layer via one-hot encoding. for example tokenization and word stemming in NLP to homogenize data. For Not-beginners : on the official Keras Page softmax documentation is given as: softmax keras.activations.softmax(x, axis=-1) Softmax activation function. Arguments x: Input tensor. axis: Integer, axis along which the softmax normalization is applied. Returns Tensor, output of softmax transformation. Raises ValueError: In case dim(x) == 1. While for Sigmoid is given as: sigmoid keras.activations.sigmoid(x) Sigmoid activation function. Arguments x: Input tensor. Returns The sigmoid activation: 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).
