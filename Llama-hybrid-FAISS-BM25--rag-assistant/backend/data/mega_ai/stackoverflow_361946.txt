Re your follow-up "what if"; you would simply loop: // rows is the jagged array of string1, string2 etc int totalCounter = 0, totalSum = 0; // etc foreach(string[] row in rows) { int m1 = int.Parse(row[3]); totalCounter++; totalSum += m1; switch(row[2]) { case "male": maleCount++; maleSum += m1; break; case "female": femaleCount++; femaleSum += m1; break; } } etc. However, while this works, you can do the same thing a lot more conveniently/expressively in C# 3.0 with LINQ, which is what a lot of the existing replies are trying to show... the fact is, Tim J's post already does all of this: ReadAllLines: gets the array of rows per line Split: gets the array of data per row "select new {...}": parses the data into something convenient 3 "avg" lines show how to take an average over filtered data The only change I'd make is that I'd add chuck a ToArray() in there somewhere so we only read the file once...
