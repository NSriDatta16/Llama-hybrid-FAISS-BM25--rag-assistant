I found this to be a very interesting question because it is very natural to ask but I have never seen the answer or thought about it before. Of course the answer should depend on the dimension of the normal. In researching this on the net I found that the Mahalanobis squared distance for a d-dimensional multivariate normal is chi-square with d degrees of freedom. This assumes the mean and covariance matrix are known. So from the chi-square distribution it would be easy to find in units of squared Mahalanobis distance the 90, 95 and 99 percentiles and those the ellipsoid that has that coverage. So what I just explained elaborates on Bill Huber's correct but terse response. Although this is just taken from a chi-square table I thought it would be interesting to look at the table below from the Mahalanobis distance perspective.
