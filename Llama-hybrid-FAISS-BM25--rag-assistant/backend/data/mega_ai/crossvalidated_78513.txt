I don't have any good references for you, but yes, you can do this. The question will be what the results mean and that would depend on the specifics of the tests. If they have good alphas as single tests, that means the averaged correlations among items aren't too bad. That's an aspect of reliability. But what about validity? The fact that the items correlate well does not mean they measure something useful. For example, suppose I was interested in the math ability of engineering students in a college. Further suppose I made up a test of elementary school arithmetic. If I gave that test to those students, it is likely that the Cronbach alpha would be quite high. But would it be measuring what I wanted?
