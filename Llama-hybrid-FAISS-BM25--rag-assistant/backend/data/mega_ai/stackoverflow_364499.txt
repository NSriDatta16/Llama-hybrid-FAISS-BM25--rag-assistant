As the others mentioned, its implementation dependant. Visual Studio 2005 uses 8 bytes as the default structure alignment. Internally, items are aligned by their size - a float has 4 byte alignment, a double uses 8, etc. You can override the behavior with #pragma pack. GCC (and most compilers) have similar compiler options or pragmas.
