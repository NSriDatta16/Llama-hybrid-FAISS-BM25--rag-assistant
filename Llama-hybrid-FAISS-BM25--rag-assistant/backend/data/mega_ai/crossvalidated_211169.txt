Absolutely it is. Regardless of the machine learning algorithm you are using, the quality of your features is paramount. In many instances, feature engineering (say, using domain knowledge to restructure/recode variables) creates information that was simply not there previously. To the extent that this effort introduces useful class separation, your model will very likely perform better. Random forests, or any other algorithm that I am aware of, cannot create this information without your intervention.
