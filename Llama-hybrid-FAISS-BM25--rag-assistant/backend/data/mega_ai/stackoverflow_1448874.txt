This is not possible in current Django, short of reimplementing the entire Django ORM API on top of your custom data retrieval code. There has been quite a bit of talk among Django developers about separating the ORM API (QuerySet, basically) from the SQL-specific Query backend in order to make it possible to write pluggable backends for non-relational data stores. It seems clear that this is the direction things are headed in, but there is no timeline for when it will be doable; even then you'd likely be in for quite a lot of work writing that pluggable backend for your system.
