Retrieve the corresponding element from another data set?

The problem is not necessarily related to NLP, just hopefully by putting it this way it will help illustrate the problem. I have the pronunciations of a set of words from different people and myself for training. At test time I'll have my own pronunciation of every word. Given the pronunciation of a new word from a random person, I want to find out among my own pronunciations which is that word. What model should I use? Currently what I'm doing is like, I trained a network that tries to learn a feature space where different pronunciations of the same word are close to each other. Then given the pronunciation of a new word, I'll just find the closest of mine to it in the feature space. It works fine, just it feels that the set of my pronunciations might all lie in a subspace of the feature space (say the pronunciations from different people follow a Gaussian distribution, and my special pronunciation happens to lie on the left tail). So I guess there is something I can to improve it, like mapping all the embeddings to the subspace where my embeddings live in. Any suggestion is appreciated.
