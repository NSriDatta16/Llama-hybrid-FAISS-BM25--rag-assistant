Regression with non-stationary data

I am doing time series regression (the form I prefer is what SAS calls regression with AR error a form of GLS that runs OLS on the residuals and that has various names in the literature). The problem is that in many cases the dependent variable is clearly non-stationary. I have read various authors disagree on the following points. 1)If your dependent variable is non-stationary and some, but not all of your predictors, are non-stationary can you run GLS regression on these or must all of the variables be non-stationary. 2) What happens if for example you dependent variable is integrated of order 1 (I[1]), one predictor is i[1] and a second I[2]. Do you difference all the variables to I[0] which will require some variables to be differenced different amounts. I am not even sure it is valid to run regressions when the order of integration is not the same among predictors [note I assume stochastic not deterministic non-stationarity here]. 3) Analysis of co integration I have seen deal with two, and only two variables one the dependent variable. When you have multiple predictors, does co integration assume that all the variables are co integrated?
