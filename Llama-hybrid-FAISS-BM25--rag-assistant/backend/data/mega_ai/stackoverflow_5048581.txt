How to implement exchanging items' locations by drag and drop

I am working on a mac application but have ran into a road block. I am trying to create 2 images and make it so they can be dragged and dropped to swap their locations. I am completely lost here so a thorough explanation would be greatly appreciated! I'm not new to programing but Ive only been working with xCode and objective c for a few months. Thanks in Advance!
