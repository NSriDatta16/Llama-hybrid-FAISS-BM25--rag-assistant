If you have the symbolic toolbox in MATLAB, you can do the following syms x x=solve('x^2*exp(-x)=y') x= (-2)*lambertw(k, -((-1)^l*y^(1/2))/2) Here lambertw is the solution to y=x*exp(x) , which is available as a function in MATLAB. So you can now define a function as, t=@(y,k,l)(-2)*lambertw(k, -((-1)^l*y^(1/2))/2) lambertw is a multivalued function with several branches. The variable k lets you choose a branch of the solution. You need the principal branch, hence k=0 . l (lower case L) is just to pick the appropriate square root of y . We need the positive square root, hence l=0 . Therefore, you can get the value of t or the time for any value of y by using the function. So using your example, t(0.3,0,0) gives 0.8291 . EDIT I forgot that there are two branches of the solution that give you real outputs (gnovice's answer reminded me of that). So, for both solutions, use t(0.3,[0,-1],0) which gives 0.8921 and 3.9528 .
