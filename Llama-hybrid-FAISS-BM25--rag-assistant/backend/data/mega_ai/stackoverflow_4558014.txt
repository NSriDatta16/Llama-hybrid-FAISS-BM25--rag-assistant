is it possible to hyperlink to external pdf selection?

I'd like to create hyperlink references to a text selection or offset in an external PDF document, as if there were an anchor defined. E.g., http://lib.extern.org/doc1.pdf?page=3&paragraph=4 so that when the user follows the link in their browser, the PDF document opens positioned at the offset specified. I'm looking for any granularity, e.g. page, paragraph, line, word, character or even pixel em or inch offset would be acceptable. If a range for a selection could be specified that would be ideal, the purpose being to highlight and link directly to quotes in external PDF docs (to which the app has read-only access.) Seems so basic, but I haven't found a solution. Ideas?
