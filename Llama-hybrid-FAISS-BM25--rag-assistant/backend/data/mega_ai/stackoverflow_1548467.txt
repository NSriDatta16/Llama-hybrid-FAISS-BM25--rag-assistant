As you, I had a background in C++/C# and wanted to give Ruby on Rails a shot. Similar to some of the other responses you've received I found the initial best source in getting up with Ruby on Rails, just the framework, to be Agile Web Development with Rails. For the Ruby language I found the pick axe book to be fantastic - Programming Ruby 1.9. Both are available from Pragmatic Programmer . Other great sources of Ruby and Ruby on Rails screencasts are: Railscasts Peepcode Scaling rails As always, studying the source code produced by the gurus is a great resourcee! You may also wish to consider looking for Ruby/Ruby on Rails blogs - perhaps in a different question on this site.
