template fragment caching doesn't seem to work for some custom template tags

I've been implementing caching in my django application, and used per view caching via the cache API and template fragment caching. On some of my pages I use a custom django template tag, this tag is provided via a third party developer, it takes some arguments in its template tags, and then make a request to a remote server, gets the response back over XML, and then renders the result in my page. Great - I thought I could easily cache this using fragment caching, so I : {% load cache %} {% cache 500 request.user.username %} {% load third party custom tags %} {% expensive custom tag set that gets stuff from a third party server via xml %} {{ some.stuff}} {% endcache %} Trouble is no matter what I do, the requests still get fired off to that remote server, it seems Django doesn't like to cache these custom template tags. I know memcached is working great, for other views and templates it all works just fine. Am I doing something that is incompatible with the fragment caching? Is there a way round it?
