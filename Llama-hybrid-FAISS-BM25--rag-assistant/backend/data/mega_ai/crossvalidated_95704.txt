My interpretation of the question I am assuming that the setting in problem 3 is as follows: the organizer first selects amount $X$ and puts $X$ in the first envelope. Then, the organizer flips a fair coin and based on that puts either $0.5X$ or $2X$ to the second envelope. The player knows all this , but not $X$ nor the result of the coin-flip. The organizer gives the player the first envelope (closed) and asks if the player wants to switch. The questioner argues 1. that the player wants to switch because the switching increases expectation (correct) and 2. that after switching, the same reasoning symmetrically holds and the player wants to switch back (incorrect). I also assume the player is a rational risk-neutral Bayesian agent that puts a probability distribution over $X$ and maximizes expected amount of money earned. Note that if the we player did not know about the coin-flip procedure, there might be no reason in the first place to argue that the probabilities are 0.5 for the second envelope to be higher/lower. Why there is no paradox Your problem 3 (as interpreted in my answer) is not the envelope paradox. Let the $Z$ be a Bernoulli random variable with $P(Z=1)=0.5$. Define the amount $Y$ in the 2nd envelope so that $Z=1$ implies $Y=2X$ and $Z=0$ implies $Y=0.5X$. In the scenario here, $X$ is selected without knowledge of the result of the coin-flip and thus $Z$ and $X$ are independent, which implies $E(Y\mid X) = 1.25X$. \begin{equation} E(Y) = E(E(Y\mid X)) = E(1.25X) = 1.25E(X) \end{equation} Thus, if if X>0 (or at least $E(X)>0$), the player will prefer to switch to envelope 2. However, there is nothing paradoxical about the fact that if you offer me a good deal (envelope 1) and an opportunity to switch to a better deal (envelope 2), I will want to switch to the better deal. To invoke the paradox, you would have to make the situation symmetric, so that you could argue that I also want to switch from envelope 2 to envelope 1. Only this would be the paradox: that I would want to keep switching forever. In the question, you argue that the situation indeed is symmetric, however, there is no justification provided. The situation is not symmetric: the second envelope contains the amount that was picked as a function of a coin-flip and the amount in the first envelope, while the amount in the first envelope was not picked as a function of a coin-flip and the amount in the second envelope. Hence, the argument for switching back from the second envelope is not valid. Example with small number of possibilities Let us assume that (the player's belief is that) $X=10$ or $X=40$ with equal probabilities, and work out the computations case by case. In this case, the possibilities for $(X,Y)$ are $\{(10,5),(10,20),(40,20),(40,80)\}$, each of which has probability $1/4$. First, we look at the player's reasoning when holding the first envelope. If my envelope contains $10$, the second envelope contains either $5$ or $20$ with equal probabilities, thus by switching I gain on average $0.5\times(-5) + 0.5\times10 = 2.5$. If my envelope contains $40$, the second envelope contains either $20$ or $80$ with equal probabilities, thus by switching I gain on average $0.5\times(-20) + 0.5\times(40) = 10$. Taking the average over these, the expected gain of switching is $0.5\times2.5 + 0.5\times10 = 6.25$, so the player switches. Now, let us make similar case-by-case analysis of switching back: If my envelope contains $5$, the old envelope with probability 1 contains $10$, and I gain $5$ by switching. If my envelope contains $20$, the old envelope contains $10$ or $40$ with equal probabilities, and by switching I gain $0.5\times(-10) + 0.5\times20 = 5$. If my envelope contains $80$, the old envelope with probability 1 contains $40$ and I lose $40$ by switching. Now, the expected value, i.e. probability-weighted average, of gain by switching back is $0.25\times5+0.5\times5+0.25\times(-40) = -6.25$. So, switching back exactly cancels the expected utility gain. Another example with a continuum of possibilities You might object to my previous example by claiming that I maybe cleverly selected the distribution over $X$ so that in the $Y=80$ case the player knows that he is losing. Let us now consider a case where $X$ has a continuous unbounded distribution: $X \sim \textrm{Exp}(1)$, $Z$ independent of $X$ as previously, and $Y$ as a function of $X$ and $Z$ as previously. The expected gain of switching from $X$ to $Y$ is again $E(0.25X) = 0.25E(X) = 0.25$. For the back-switch, we first compute the conditional probability $P(X=0.5Y \mid Y=y)$ using Bayes' theorem: \begin{equation} P(X=0.5Y \mid Y=y) = P(Z=1 \mid Y=y) = \frac{p(Y=y\mid Z=1)P(Z=1)}{p(Y=y)} = \frac{p(2X=y)P(Z=1)}{p(Y=y)} = \frac{0.25e^{-0.5y}}{p(Y=y)} \end{equation} and similarly $P(X=2Y \mid Y=y) = \frac{e^{-2y}}{p(Y=y)}$, wherefore the conditional expected gain of switching back to the first envelope is \begin{equation} E(X-Y \mid Y=y) = \frac{-0.125y e^{-0.5y} + ye^{-2y}}{p(Y=y)}, \end{equation} and taking the expectation over $Y$, this becomes \begin{equation} E(X-Y) = \int_0^\infty \frac{-0.125y e^{-0.5y} + ye^{-2y}}{p(Y=y)}p(Y=y) dy = -0.25, \end{equation} which cancels out the expected gain of the first switch. General solution The situation seen in the two examples must always occur: you cannot construct a probability distribution for $X,Z,Y$ with these conditions: $X$ is not a.s. 0, $Z$ is Bernoulli with $P(Z=1)=0.5$, $Z$ is independent of $X$, $Y=2X$ when $Z=1$ and $0.5X$ otherwise and also $Y,Z$ are independent. This is explained in the Wikipedia article under heading 'Proposed resolutions to the alternative interpretation': such a condition would imply that the probability that the smaller envelope has amount between $2^n,2^{n+1}$ ($P(2^n Note that there is another version of the paradox where the probabilities need not be 0.5, but the expectation of other envelope conditional on the amount in this envelope is still always higher. Probability distributions satisfying this type of condition exist (e.g., let the amounts in the envelopes be independent half-Cauchy), but as the Wikipedia article explains, they require infinite mean. I think this part is rather unrelated to your question, but for completeness wanted to mention this.
