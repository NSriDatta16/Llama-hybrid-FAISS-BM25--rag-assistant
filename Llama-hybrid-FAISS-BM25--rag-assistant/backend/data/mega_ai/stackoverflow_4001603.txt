I cover this in Rails 3 in Action 's Chapter 8. I don't cover uploading to S3 or resizing images however. Recommending you buy it based solely on it fixing this one problem may sound a little biased, but I can just about guarantee you that it'll answer other questions you have down the line. It has a Behaviour Driven Development approach as one of the main themes, introducing you to Rails features during the development of an application. This shows you not only how you can build an application, but also make it maintainable . As for the resizing of images after they've been uploaded, Paperclip's got pretty good documentation on that . I'd recommend having a read and then asking another question on SO if you don't understand any of the options / methods. And as for S3 uploading, you can do this: has_attached_file :photo, :styles => { ... }, :storage => :s3 You'd need to configure Paperclip::Storage::S3 with your S3 details to set it up, and again Paperclip's got some pretty awesome documentation for this. Good luck!
