So I've had a look around and this is the best answer I have found: http://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/59865-how-to-combine-different-histograms From what I understand you have to adjust the range your bins cover in every histogram so that there is a universal range for them all; $R$ instead of $R_i$. I think you can do this by creating empty bins in each histogram. Then you can just add them together and take the average normally (by dividing by the number of histograms). Hope that helps.
