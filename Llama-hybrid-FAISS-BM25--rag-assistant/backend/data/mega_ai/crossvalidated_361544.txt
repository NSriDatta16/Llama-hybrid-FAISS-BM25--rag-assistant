Absolutely there is a difference between the two. In the first case, you are guaranteed to roll three dice and ignore the lowest value. In the second case, you can roll three dice, but it's possible that you get stuck with the lowest value on your last roll. This die would have been ignored had you rolled all three simultaneously, as in the first case. "Roll three-pick two" will on average yield a higher total than "roll two-reroll one". If you assume the same sequence of dice rolls tested for both strategies, "roll three-pick two" will always yield the higher total.
