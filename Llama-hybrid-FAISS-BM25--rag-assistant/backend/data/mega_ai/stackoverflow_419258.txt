this is a very common problem with ie6, you have to pay attention to the closures in your code, the condition statements must be with { - } ... and function too. if(){ } function(){ }; you must put ; on the end of each statement , if not , the lines will merge into something that the browser cannot understand. i use jslint.com for javascript debugging. look for the "missing semicolon" in the error list.
