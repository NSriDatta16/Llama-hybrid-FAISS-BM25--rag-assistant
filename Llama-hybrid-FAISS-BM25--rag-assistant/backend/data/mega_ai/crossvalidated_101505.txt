Logistic regression understanding variable nature

I have 2 categorically dependent variables(both binomial) in logistic regression which individually both give positive estimates against the response(binomial). However if modeled together one give positive and other give negative. I checked for the multicollinearity using VIF, which seems fine. What could be the possible reason for such behaviour.
