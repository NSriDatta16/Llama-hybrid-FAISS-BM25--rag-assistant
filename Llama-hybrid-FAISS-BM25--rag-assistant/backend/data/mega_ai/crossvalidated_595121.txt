Bayesian Analysis in the Absence of Prior Information?

I have always wondered - how confident do researchers tend to be in their "prior" information when deciding to create statistical models using a Bayesian Approach vs. a Frequentist Approach? As an example : Suppose a team of researchers has some data relating to the healthcare industry - let's say that they are interested in fitting regression models to this data. As such, they are familiar with the scientific background of the data they are working with, but they are unsure what kinds of priors they can place on the parameters of these regression models. I saw this post over here ( What is an "uninformative prior"? Can we ever have one with truly no information? ) in which the idea of an "Uninformative Prior" is provided - but apart from the idea of the Uninformative Prior, I can not seem to find more information on this topic. As such, is the following idea true? When we don't have a lot of confidence on information that can be used to construct Bayesian Priors - is it generally better to stick to Frequentist Approaches instead of "guessing" which Priors will better fit the data and the choice of model?
