Probability theory is the theory of plausible conclusions . It gives us a set of unique, consistent rules for degrees of plausibility to be represented by real numbers in correspondence with common sense . See Jaynes' treatment of the same . "What we know" aka the a priori beliefs aren't overlooked. See Bayesian treatment which is in same league with that of Jaynes.
