The decode function is defined as follows: decode :: JSON a => String -> Result a In a real program, the type inference engine can usually figure out what type to expect from decode. For example: userAge :: String -> Int userAge input = case decode input of Result a -> a _ -> error $ "Couldn't parse " ++ input In this case, the type of userAge causes the typechecker to infer that decode's return value, in this particular case, is Result Int . However, when you use decode in GHCi, you must specify the type of the value, e.g.: decode "6" :: Result Int => Ok 6
