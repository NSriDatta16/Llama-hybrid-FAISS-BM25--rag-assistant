What can be the best Practice for a Rapid Web Application Development?

I am coming up with a web application which will be primarily based on PHP. I would like to know some of the best practices and technologies that I can make use of to come out with the app as fast as possible. My team will be working remotely, so I want to know the best ways of collaborating through web resources too. I'm expecting in here, the options or a framework of technologies that can get me a great app in a shorter time. I've given a small example out here. Please extend my plan and give me suggestions... Server Side Scripting - PHP (CakePHP for rapid development) Client Side Scripting - JS (JQuery - A JS framework for rapid development and compatibility) Authentication - OpenId Database - MySQL (Stable and OpenSource) I want more to be added to this list so that I code less and reuse more. Please help me out. Reusability is the key factor. How do I leverage already available classes, frameworks, etc in an efficient way? I want to know my options.
