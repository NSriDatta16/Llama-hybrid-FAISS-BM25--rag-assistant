Xcode - Automatically add all files in a folder to a target

In Xcode, is there a way to specify that all files in a folder are compiled by a target. Eg. the 'Test' target automatically compiles all files in the 'Tests' folder, whereas the 'App' target compiles everything in the 'Sources' folder. Today, the way I'm doing it, is to add a file to a target every time I create it. This feels a bit error prone and redundant since the files are already organized in the correct folders. Thanks.
