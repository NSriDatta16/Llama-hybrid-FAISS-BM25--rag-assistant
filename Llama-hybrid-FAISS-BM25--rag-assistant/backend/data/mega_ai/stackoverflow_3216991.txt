IPhone: NSHTTPCookie wont set

I do this, but the new cookie doesn't show up, just some other cookies that are already set. What's wrong? [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] setCookieAcceptPolicy:NSHTTPCookieAcceptPolicyAlways]; [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] setCookie:[NSHTTPCookie cookieWithProperties:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"www.mydomain.com", NSHTTPCookieOriginURL, @"/", NSHTTPCookiePath, @"mycookiename", NSHTTPCookieName, @"mycookievalue", NSHTTPCookieValue, nil]]]; NSLog(@"%@",[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage]);
