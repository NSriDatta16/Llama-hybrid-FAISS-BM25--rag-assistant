The most intuitive way to develop a score is to sum each score. This way, if two people have an average of a score of 80 but one person has ten QAs and another person has a hundred, then their scores would be 800 and 8,000, respectively. A potential issue with this is that a lot of bad scores can outweigh a few good scores. If someone has ten perfect 100 scores, that is the same as someone else having 1,000 scores of 1. Without looking at your data, I don't know how realistic these scenarios are. What I would ultimately suggest is developing two scores: an average and a sum. You can then combine them and rank them. If the averages are considered, then someone who has many QAs but performs poorly won't sneak by as "great." If the sums are considered, then someone who has one or two rave QA reviews won't be overly considered. Rank the average and the sum separately. Thus each person will have two "rank" scores. You can take the average of these to give an aggregate score, then rank these to get your final ordering from top to bottom. There may be a better way to do this, but this is how I would start the problem without reading lots of research.
