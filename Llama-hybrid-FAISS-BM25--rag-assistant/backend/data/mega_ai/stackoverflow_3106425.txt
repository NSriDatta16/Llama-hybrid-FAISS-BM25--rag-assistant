ASP.NET MVC User Control - Where to put the CSS specific to a control?

I am getting ready to code a bunch of ASP.NET MVC User Controls. All those controls are UI and require CSS. What are the best practices for that? Should I have one gigantic CSS file with the code of all controls? Ideally, I would like each control to have their own CSS file. Is it possible to do that? Thanks!
