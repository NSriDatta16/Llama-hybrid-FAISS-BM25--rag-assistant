I think this is more of model design question than on R specifically; as such, I'd like to address the context of the question first then the appropriate R packages. If your dependent variable is a probability, e.g., $y\in[0,1]$, a logistic regression is not data appropriate---particularly given that you are interested in predicting probabilities out of sample. The logistic is going to be modeling the contribution of the independent variables to the probability that your dependent variable flips from a zero to a one, and since your variable is continuous and truncated you need a different specification. I think your latter intuition about mixed effects is a good one. Since your observations are nested, i.e., US AZ Phoenix , a multi-level model, or in this case a hierarchical linear model, may be the best specification for your data. The best R packages for this type of modeling are multilevel and nlme , and there is an excellent introduction to both multi-level models in R and nlme available here . You may be particularly interested in the discussion of data manipulation for multi-level modeling, which begins on page 26.
