There's a few things to check. Firstly, check their anti-virus / security / firewall / etc. That can randomly block all sorts of things. Secondly, there's a registry setting somewhere to disable CSS, but that'd do it for all websites. Also, check to see if they've got a load of IE add-ons and toolbars installed. Some of them add crap to the user-agent string and it that gets too long I seem to remember IE will truncate it. This can confuse the adaptive rendering "feature" on .net 1.1 sites. Oh, and make sure you've validated your CSS :)
