I agree with Chris. I would say "Yes", also. But this depends on your market as stated above. If you are simply creating some basic "off-the-shelf" applications or writing tools to help your everyday work...then math isn't nearly as important. Engineering custom software solutions requires lots of problem solving and critical thinking. Skills that are most definitely enhanced when a mathematics background is present. I minored in Math with my Computer Engineering degree and I give credit to all of my math-oriented background as to why I'm where I am today. That's my 2 cents, I can tell from reading above that many would not agree. I encourage all to consider that I'm not saying you can't have those skills without a math background, I'm simply stating that the skills are side-effects of having such a background and can impact software positively.
