Normalizing reading times using analysis of variance

I'm trying to compare gaze durations measured using an eye tracker for each word. Since longer words will naturally lead to longer gaze durations, simply comparing the values is inaccurate. gaze duration word length 100ms 6 250ms 8 150ms 7 A simple way to normalize the values is by dividing the duration by the number of characters. However, this transformation assumes that reading time is normally a linear increasing function of the number of character, with a value of zero when the number of characters is zero which is not quite right. gaze duration word length Adjusted gaze duration (duration / length) 100ms 6 16.67 ms/character 250ms 8 31.25 ms/character 150ms 7 21.4 ms/character The best way to normalize the gaze durations was described in this paper : A more nearly adequate position assumes that reading time is normally a linear function of number of characters, with a zero intercept. A linear regression analysis could be used to estimate the slope and zero intercept of such a function, and thus to estimate the expected reading times for regions of varying lengths. Deviations from these expected times would indicate the existence of factors that speeded or slowed the reading of any given segment. Such an analysis was performed by computing the linear regression equation expressing reading time for each segment in each experimental passage as a function of the number of characters in it for each subject. The correlation averaged over all subjects was .38. The regression equation was used to obtain expected reading time on the basis of number of characters alone for each segment. The expected reading times were then subtracted from the obtained reading times and the resulting difference scores were submitted to an analysis of variance. linear fit {6,100},{8,250},{7,150} = 75x - 358.333 gaze duration word length expected gaze duration difference 100ms 6 75(6) - 358.333 = 91.66 8.34 250ms 8 75(8) - 358.333 = 241.67 8.33 150ms 7 75(7) - 358.333 = 166.67 -16.67 My question How does submitting the difference scores to an analysis of variance finally allow us to get the transformed values? Is merely using the difference scores as the normalized scores considered an adequate normalization? Note The best answer should provide an example of the calculation necessary to get the final corrected values, you may use the sample values provided in the question.
