See Glen_B comment. To elaborate only a little, there is no way to tell whether x1 effect on y varies by x2 or the other way around, because IF x1 effect on y varies by x2, THEN x2 effect on y varies by x1, AND the strength of the effect is identical (c in your model). You cannot separate these hypotheses, because they are the same hypothesis. This is reflected by the fact that you have one parameter estimate for the interaction (c). Consider a scenario with 2 countries (A & B), and people in these countries are either poor (P) or rich (R). Let's measure the incidence of diabetes in each of the four categories: AP = 5 per thousand AR = 3 BP = 15 BR = 3 Organized like this, it's easiest to say that the difference between rich and poor depends on which country you're in. But organized like this: PA = 5 PB = 15 RA = 3 RB = 3 it's easier to say that the difference between countries depends on wealth. I can't say I completely understand your second question, but it looks like you're again using fallacious logic about what an interaction term means. Reconsider and recast.
