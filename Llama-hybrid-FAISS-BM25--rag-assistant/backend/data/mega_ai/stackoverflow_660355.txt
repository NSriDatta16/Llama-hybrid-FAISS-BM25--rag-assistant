I'm not sure I understand what the problem is... can you clarify? From the looks of it, it would seem WCF is doing the right thing... the generated class has the right namespace URI in the [DataContract] attribute according to the schema in the WSDL fragment you showed. What were you expecting? Update: OK, I see what you're saying, but in this specific case, it's not unexpected either. If you look closely, notice that the other class you mention (HelloWorldRequest) is a Message Contract, not a DataContract. Message Contracts don't have namespaces themselves, though they can specify a namespace for the wrapper element around the message body (see the WrapperNamespace property). In your case, the message contract specifies that it is not wrapped, so the WrapperNamespace wouldn't apply anyway. Update #2: Regarding the CLR namespace (and not the XML namespace URI), SvcUtil does give you a way to control that; check out the /namespace: argument in the documentation .
