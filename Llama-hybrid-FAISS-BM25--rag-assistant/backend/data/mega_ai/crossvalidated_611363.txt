Your updated question references application of 'StandardScaler' to everything. From the documentation by default this centers (by subtracting the mean) and then rescales every feature to a unit variance. Clearly scaling features independently like this could cause differences in your analysis (consider a scaled vs unscaled PCA for example) which might be unintended. And the centering might cause some modelling not to work correctly (eg it will introduce negative values which will fail if a log-transformation or square root is indicated).
