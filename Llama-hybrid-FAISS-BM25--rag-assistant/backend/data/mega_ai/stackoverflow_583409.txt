Does a .NET library for the W3C Markup Validator API exist?

I'd like to validate that users of my WPF application are putting proper XHTML into its TextBox control. I found that there's an API for the W3C Markup Validator . It's web page says: Building of libraries used to interact with the validator's API is encouraged. â€¦ and it lists known Perl, PHP/PEAR and ColdFusion libraries. Does anyone know of a .NET library for the W3C Markup Validator API? Does one already exist?
