How to check if a specific file exists in directory or any of its subdirectories

In C#, how do I check if a specific file exists in a directory or any of its subdirectories? System.IO.File.Exists only seems to accept a single parameter with no overloads to search subdirectories. I can do it with LINQ and System.IO.Directory.GetFiles using the SearchOption.AllDirectories overload, but that seems a bit heavy handed. var MyList = from f in Directory.GetFiles(tempScanStorage, "foo.txt", SearchOption.AllDirectories) where System.IO.Path.GetFileName(f).ToUpper().Contains(foo) select f; foreach (var x in MyList) { returnVal = x.ToString(); }
