How to predict next login date & time from the login history of a website

I've been given with login time and date of all the users and I need to predict the next login time and date of each user... Initially, I thought I can group each user's login data and can use linear regression with date and time as individual features but I later found that I can't use it to predict both date and time, and can't even predict time on a particular day too... As I can't include seasonalities like the first week of the month there can be many logins (since it's a financial website) Can this data can be considered as time-series data and can I use time-series algorithms like ARIMA/SARIMA but here my data consists of only time & date, unlike Stock price data. And how should I commit feature engineering for this dataset? Can I use any deep learning technique?
