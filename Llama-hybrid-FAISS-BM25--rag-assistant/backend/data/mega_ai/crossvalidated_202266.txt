Optimal cut-off calculation in logistic regression

I am building a logistic regression model and am using k-fold cross-validation for model selection. My doubt is with regards to misclassification rate. For measuring that, i will have to first find the optimal cut-off point from the ROC curve. For each individual model the cut-off value could be different. So should i use the general rule-of thumb 0.5 has the cut-off during cross-validation to compare between the models. Once the model with lowest error rate is identified, should i then find the optimal cut-off point for that model along?
