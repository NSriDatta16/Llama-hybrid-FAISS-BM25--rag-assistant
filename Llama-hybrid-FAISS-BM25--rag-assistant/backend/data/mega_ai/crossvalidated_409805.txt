Could someone explain these ACF and PACF plots for what I think is a lag1 series?

I am trying to get my head around simple time series analysis. I think this R code shows my confusion. ### simulating lag1 autoregressive process library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(GGally) set.seed(12345) n That generates this ACF plot: Which is pretty much what I'd expect. However it gives this PACF: Thinking about that ACF plot made me realise that what I had there wasn't a typical autocorrelation process but the simple addition of a lag1 component to data, not the same thing! Oops. OK. I think this, though probably clumsy is a true lag1 autocorrelation process: tmpDF And that generates this ACF plot with the decreasing later correlations I had expected. and this PACF plot. OK, that's what I expected so I've answered part of my own question but can anyone explain to me why I get those sequential and "significant" partial autocorrelations in the first example? TIA, Chris
