Test for change of proportion pattern

I am struggling with how to test for the change of a proportion pattern. The dependent variable $t$ is an amount of time which itself is partitioned into $n\geq3$ phases $t_i$ . Thus, $t=\sum_{i=1}^n t_i$ . There is a baseline and a post treatment measurement with treatment being a two level factor. The second measurement should not only be tested for a difference in the change of $t$ between the treatments but also for a change of the pattern of the proportions $p_i=t_i/t$ . For instance consider the following crude example: > set.seed(103) > trt = (((1:100)%%2) + 4)/3 > d = data.frame(trt = rep(0:1,50), t1 = exp(rnorm(100,3)), t2 = exp(rnorm(100,5)), t3 = exp(rnorm(100,2)), t1p = exp(rnorm(100,4))*trt, t2p = exp(rnorm(100,4))*trt, t3p = exp(rnorm(100,3))*trt) > d[1:4, ] trt t1 t2 t3 t1p t2p t3p 1 0 9.152498 368.56518 6.011215 163.57718 287.60124 37.29143 2 1 21.215645 359.93256 8.396521 23.19587 45.08169 59.35694 3 0 6.217946 102.17538 2.460465 63.27128 30.65995 31.13341 4 1 16.991058 32.20921 22.548838 224.24470 366.61612 72.90971 Let's first discard the effect of treatment. Then there is an overall positive effect of post baseline (at least I tried to model it but it doesn't seem to be reflected in the data). But what I am particularly interested in is the change of the proportions from $t_i/\sum t_i$ to $t_{ip}/\sum t_{ip}$ . For each subject both of these sets of three variables obviously sum to 1. The baseline proportions (averaged over subjects via log and exp transformations, so they don't sum to 1) are $(0.08996525,0.73044067,0.03402201)$ post baseline they are $(0.3000452,0.3517296,0.1118583)$ which looks very different. But how do I test the hypothesis that they indeed are? Then, as I said I also want the interaction effect of post baseline by treatment, testing the question whether the treatment levels make the post baseline patterns differ. If $n$ was 2 it would be much easier, since then there is essentially only one variable because $t_2/\sum t_i=1-t_1/\sum t_i$ . To clarify: I am not interested to test the change in just one $t_i$ . I want an overall pattern change test. Bonus question: What if I have more than one post baseline measurement. Is there a way to test the overall post basement effect of treatment with an MMRM? Edit: Maybe I want too much so let me simplify. Is there a way to test for significant differences of the proportion pattern defined above either for two independent groups or for one group with two measures?
