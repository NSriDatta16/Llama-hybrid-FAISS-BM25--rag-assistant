Conjugate Prior for Alpha Power Inverse Weibull Distribution

Let $X$ has Alpha Power Inverse Weibull (APIW) distribution with pdf $f(x) = \frac{\log \alpha}{\alpha - 1} \lambda \beta x^{-(\beta+1)} e^{-\lambda x^{-\beta}} \alpha^{e^{-\lambda x^{-\beta}}}, \; x>0, \alpha >0, \alpha \neq 1, \lambda > 0, \beta > 0$ . In this case, I want to estimate parameter $\alpha$ (by using Bayesian method) given that parameters $\lambda$ and $\beta$ are both known. The likelihood function is (assume that $\lambda$ and $\beta$ are known) $L(x_1, ..., x_n) = \frac{(\log \alpha)^n}{(\alpha - 1)^n} \lambda^n \beta^n (\prod x_i^{-(\beta+1)}) e^{-\lambda \sum x_i^{-\beta}} \alpha^{\sum e^{-\lambda x_i^{-\beta}}}$ My question is: how do we find the conjugate prior for $\alpha$ ? I try for Gamma distribution, but I think it is not. I've shown that Alpha Power Inverse Weibull distribution is a exponential family distribution (where $\lambda$ and $\beta$ are known), so it must have conjugate prior.
