Download PDF file from iPad

I have a server side component (i.e. a Servlet) that creates a PDF file and sent it back to the browser with this response header: response.setContentType("application/pdf"); response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "cache"); response.setHeader("Pragma", "cache"); response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment;filename=document.pdf"); All works fine in all browser except on iPad. On iPad the content is showed but the browser does not ask me if I want to save the file. Any idea how to fix this issue?
