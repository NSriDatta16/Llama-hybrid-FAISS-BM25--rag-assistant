I think you're trying to do something that you don't need to do in JavaScript. In PHP, function passing is a bit of a kludge. In JavaScript it is elegant and painless. How are you planning on calling these functions later? I'm guessing that you have these function names hard-coded into your HTML in the 'onclick' attributes. Hard-coding JavaScript into your HTML via the on* attributes is a bad idea. If that's what you're doing, you have to create variables in the global scope (another practice best avoided). In the browser, the global object is window . If you define a property on window , the function will be available globally: $(document).ready(function() { var myNames = [ 'create', 'destroy' ]; for (var i = 0; i This assumes that you have onclick attributes in your HTML that match up with the function names you're creating. A better way to do this would be to just create the functions as you bind them to the events, never even assigning them to variables: $(document).ready(function() { $('#createdialog, #destroydialog').each(function() { $(this).click(function() { alert('Hello'); }); }); }); This will make both your JavaScript and your HTML smaller and cleaner.
