Honestly, the frameworks can lead to analysis paralysis quite easily. You can easily over think things. Here is what you do, keep it simple and just bang away at the keyboard. Use your "own" framework. It might not be pretty, but you'll get it eventually and you'll see why the other frameworks exist. Here is how you start: Create folders layouts and views. Put all your page layout stuff in the layouts folders (you'll probably have only a few and maybe even one layout)! Put all of your view stuff in the views folder (this will probably look like what you've been doing with a bunch bunch of files not very well organized). The key is that you won't have ANY page processing "top of page" code in your view files. Your index.cfm will be the only .cfm root. Use a URL variable "event" = action to make your framework go. In your index.cfm, use a giant cfswitch to determine which "top of page" code to execute (this will be a giant "controller"). mysite.com/index.cfm?event=contactInfo ..... Combine this with the cfmodule tag to load your layout. So, all your page requests come in through index.cfm. Index.cfm will do all the top of page stuff and then do a cfinclude to the appropriate view in your views folder. Use the cfmodule tag to load your layout (check out the tag.execution mode stuff for headers and footers). You'll keep adding features and adding features to your framework. You'll probably move the index.cfm code to a controller folder with a bunch of CFCs that call your database CFCs.
