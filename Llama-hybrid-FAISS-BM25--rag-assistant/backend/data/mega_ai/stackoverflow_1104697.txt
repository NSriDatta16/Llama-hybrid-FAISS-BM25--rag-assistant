A fairly simple way to achieve this is via client-side templating, see this blog post for a detailed look at this. As a summary, what client-side templating basically means is: You have some HTML fragment in your page that represents the hover display element Then using jquery you make an AJAX call to the server to get the data you want to display. On receipt of the data from the AJAX call you use jquery to clone the html fragment. Finally, you inject your received data into the cloned HTML fragment and display. Hope that helps you out.
