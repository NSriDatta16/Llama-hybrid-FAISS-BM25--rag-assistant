I cannot get TimeUUIDType with phpcassa

Noob here. I have a super column family sorted by timeuuidtype which has a number of entries. I'm trying to perform a simple get function with phpcassa that wont work. I'm trying to return a specific value from a UTF8 sorted column within a TimeUUID sorted SC. The exact code works with a similar SC Family sorted by BytesType. Here is the info on the scf I'm trying to get from which i previously entered via -cli. ColumnFamily: testSCF (Super) Columns sorted by: org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.TimeUUIDType/org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8Type RowKey: TestKey => (super_column=48dd0330-5bd6-11e0-adc5-343960c1b6b8, (column=test, value=74657374, timestamp=1301603831288000)) => (super_column=141a69b0-5c6e-11e0-bcce-343960c1b6b8, (column=new test, value=6e657774657374, timestamp=1301669004440000)) And here is the phpcassa script I'm using to retrieve the data. get($key, $columns=array($super))); echo $q[$super][$col]; ?> Also if I don't specify the SC like so. $q = ($entry->get($key)); print_r($q); It returns: Array ( [HÝ0[Öà­Å49`Á¶¸] => Array ( [test] => test ) [i°\nà¼Î49`Á¶¸] => Array ( [new test] => newtest ) ) I know part of the issue might have been brought up in How do I insert a row with a TimeUUIDType column in Cassandra? But it didn't really help me as I presumably have accepted timeuuidtypes. Thanks for any help guys.
