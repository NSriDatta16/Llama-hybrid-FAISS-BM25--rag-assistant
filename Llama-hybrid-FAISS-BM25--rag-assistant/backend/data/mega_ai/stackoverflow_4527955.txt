Union hack needed

I have a struct that represents a vertex. It has x, y and z fields as well as several others. Recently I came into conclusion that for certain functionality I will need to access the coordinates of the vertex as an array. I didn't want to "pollute" the code with temporary variables or change all places that look like this v.y to this v.coord[1] which is not nice nor elegant. So I thought about using a union. Something like this should work: struct { float x,y,z; } Point; struct { union { float coord[3]; Point p; }; } Vertex; This is good, but not perfect. The point class has no point being there. I want to be able to access y coordinate simply by typing v.y (and not v.p.y ). Can you suggest a hack to solve this (or tell me that it is not possible)?
