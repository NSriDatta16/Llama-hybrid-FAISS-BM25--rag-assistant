I have just written a code project article that might help you. The article is about drag selection and multiple item dragging. In the MouseMove event handler there is code that tests for the user dragging further than the threshold distance, when this happens the drag operation is initiated. http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/SimpleDragSelection.aspx
