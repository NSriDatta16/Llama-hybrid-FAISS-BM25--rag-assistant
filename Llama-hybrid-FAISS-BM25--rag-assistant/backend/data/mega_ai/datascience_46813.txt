What is purpose of partial derivatives in loss calculation (linear regression)?

I am studying ML and data science stuff from scratch. As a part of the course, I am studying how the models are derived. And for most of them, starting with the simplest - linear regression, we take partial derivatives. I understood its implementation part, however, I am a bit confused about why we need to take partial derivative there. Is there any specific reason behind it? Can we use any other methodology to compute linear regression loss function?
