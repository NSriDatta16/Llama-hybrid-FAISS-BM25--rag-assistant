UI automation cross-platform (Windows and Mac OS X) open source APIs/frameworks?

Does anyone know of any UI automation cross-platform (Windows and Mac OS X) open source APIs/frameworks available for automating external GUI applications from inside a separate application programmatically? Through searching, I've found a couple commercial cross-platform UI automation products, but obviously they wouldn't allow embedding in an open-source cross-platform application nor would they permit calling them from code (I would be calling it from Objective-C/Cocoa and/or .NET/Mono)... I'm aware of (but haven't tried yet) the open source "white" project for .NET however that of course only works on Windows since it has a dependency on the Microsoft UI Automation framework.
