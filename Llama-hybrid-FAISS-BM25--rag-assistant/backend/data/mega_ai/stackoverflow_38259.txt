Using Linq-to-Sql, you can have columns in the DataGridView appear different than in the original table by: In your Linq query, extract the columns that you want, in the order than you want, and store them in a var. Then the autogenerate columns should show them in that order in the DataGridView Use Template columns in your DataGridView Do not use drag-and-drop on the Linq-to-Sql design surface to create your entities. Rather, create them by hand and associate them with the database table using table and column properties As far as I know, there is no drag-and-drop column reorder in the designer itself
