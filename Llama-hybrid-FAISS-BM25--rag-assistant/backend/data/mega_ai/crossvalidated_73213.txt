If we define levels differently, mixed models may not be able to do what Bayesian models can. The other alternative is structural equation modeling. For e.g When variables A,B drive C. Variables A,B,C,D, drive E. You have equation : E = oA + pB + qC + rD + z ; C = mA + nB + k ; where all small letters are parameter estimates/error terms k,z Mixed models cant be used in this case since the errors z,k could be correlated. Thereby, we have to resort to hierarchical Bayesian models or structural equation models. Thoughts?
