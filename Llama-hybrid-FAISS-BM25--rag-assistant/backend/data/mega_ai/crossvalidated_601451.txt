How to chain separate models into a single unified model (where predictions of one sub-model form an input to another)?

Our team is tasked with forecasting several timeseries at the daily (or hourly) level: number of calls ('demand') number of calls catergorised as important mean vehical travel time to caller mean time to answer call These variables all form part of an integrated system that we want to model/understand. Currently, we are using R to fit 4 separate general additive models (GAMs) to do this. Each model makes its forecast based on a few relavant time series. Some of the forecasts of those models are used as inputs to the other models : models 2 and 3 both use the forecasts of model 1; model 4 uses the forecasts of models 2 and 3... So if model 1 is poor, this will influence the other models (and if model 2 or 3 are poor, so will be model 4). I would like to explore methods (not necassarily GAMs) that can reflect the intergrated nature of the system. Specifically, I want to model these 4 timeseries simultaneously, while allowing some of the predicted timeseries to be used to forecast the others, in a unified way. In other words, can I create a network of models where the outputs of some form the inputs of others? In yet other words, is there a way to link submodels together into a single larger model? So far, my searches have led me to think about using continuous time structural equation modelling (using the R package 'ctsem'), but I'm unsure if this is appropriate for timeseries with hundreds/thousands of points? Another approach could be dynamic bayesian networks? It feels like this sort of thing must exist and I'm trying to find the right search terms to start me off. Any tips/direction on how to forecast multiple timeseries that depend on each other (as well as on other predictors) would be much appreciated!
