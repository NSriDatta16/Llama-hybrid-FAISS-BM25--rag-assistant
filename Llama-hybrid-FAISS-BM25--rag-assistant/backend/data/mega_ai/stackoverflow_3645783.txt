how to bind a remote service that is installed on my android device?

i have coded this service, that computes stuff and i want other applications to be able to bind this service, i.e. i want to enable other programmers to communicate with this service. problem is, this has to work without these other programmers to get access to the source code. just the (installed) apk with the remote service is given (and of course a detailed description of the service' interface)... problem is, eclipse keeps braggin' about that the packages of the service are not available in source code... how do i do this?
