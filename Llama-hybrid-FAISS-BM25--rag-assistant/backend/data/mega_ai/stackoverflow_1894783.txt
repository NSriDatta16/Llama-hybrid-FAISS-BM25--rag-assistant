I don't know if it is useful, but Mark Glickman's Ratings Page discusses some issues with Elo ratings, their declines, etc. (see the last few paragraphs there). Also see his rating system, the Glicko system , which seems to account for playing frequency and discusses rating reliability . Finally, his research page has a lot of papers discussing ratings and their reliability. Hope that helps.
