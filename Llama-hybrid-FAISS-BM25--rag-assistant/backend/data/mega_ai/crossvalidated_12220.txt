Logistic regression really predicts odds, and as such, probabilities. The default predicted class is just the one with the highest probability. There is nothing really to prevent you from moving the probability threshold around from 0.5 to, say, 0.7, or 0.3 to get a better balance between false positives and negatives. By the way: how does this post relate to your tag 'cross-validation'?
