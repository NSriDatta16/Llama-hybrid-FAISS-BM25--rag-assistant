Windows XP Indexing Service: escape #, ! or @?

Open the search side bar in Windows explorer (Ctrl + F). In the field labeled, "A word or phrase in the file:" enter a query starting with #, ! or @ that you expect to return some results. I get the following error: The Indexing Service query cannot be completed successfully because the volumes you have specified are not indexed Is there a way to escape these characters so the search will go through? I know about Agent Ransack and command line solutions, etc. but I'm wondering if there's an easy way to make Windows work as it's supposed to.
