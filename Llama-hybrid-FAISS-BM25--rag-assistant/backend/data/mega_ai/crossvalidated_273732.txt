normalizing Bayesian Network score

I have been doing data driven causal inference from Bayesian Networks in R using bnlearn package on a random categorical dataset. The data is used to learn the structure and parameters of model. Below is the code for learning structure of Bayesian network. boot_hc bn_hc The image below represents the learned structure The BIC score for the above DAG is -339005.6 computed using > score(x = bn, data = df, type = "bic") [1] -339005.6 My question is How can I normalize the BIC score (or any other score function) in order to get more understanding of quality of fit of learned structure ?
