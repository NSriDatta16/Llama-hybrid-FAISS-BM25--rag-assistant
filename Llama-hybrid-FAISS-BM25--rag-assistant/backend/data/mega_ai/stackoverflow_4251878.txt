Simultaneous LINQ data retrieval problem

I came across a very strange problem which never happened to me before. In the login code: var sqlLogin = db.LoginRetrieve(loginID, archived).SingleOrDefault(); //(db is the linq data context) --problem: If two users login at the same time, this line of code will throw an exception which is "The required column 'UserLoginID' does not exist in the results." But if a single user logs in or two users don't click the button at the same time, it will have no exception. Is there anyone can share some lights on this? Thanks in advance. Han
