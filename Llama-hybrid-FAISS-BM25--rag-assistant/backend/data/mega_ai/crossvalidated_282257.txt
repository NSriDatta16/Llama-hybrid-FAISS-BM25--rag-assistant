The HP filter was not conceived as a simple detrending method, it proposes a way to estimate the cyclical component of a time series, leaving you with the potential long-run component. Many scholars argue against its use, as for example James Hamilton in his article " Why You Should Never Use the Hodrick-Prescott Filter " ( shorter presentation ). You should be careful whenever you use it. That being said, if you simply want to detrend the data, you could estimate: $$ y_t=\beta t + \varepsilon_t $$ and then use the residuals $\varepsilon$ as your detrended series, just like you did with the HP estimation.
