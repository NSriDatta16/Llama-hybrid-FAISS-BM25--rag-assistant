Generalized linear models are all about conditional distributions. When you make an assumption about normality, it is about the conditional distribution of $y$ , conditioned on some values of the feature(s) $x$ , being normal. Ditto for logistic regression making an assumption about conditional binomial distributions or Poisson regression being about conditional Poisson distributions. At no point is the overall distribution of $y$ considered, and the features definitely are not assumed to have normality. The reason authors will write that the residuals should be normal is because that is a way to check if the assumption of a normal conditional distribution is a good one. This is messier when you have other GLM distributions like binomial or Poisson.
