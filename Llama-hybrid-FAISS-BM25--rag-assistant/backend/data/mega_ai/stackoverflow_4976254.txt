Yes, the underlying resources are released. The Java IO stream classes are a good example of the Decorator pattern , i.e. an object that has an interface identical to an object it contains. This allows the close() method to be very simple and elegant, e.g. something like: public void close() { in.close(); } If in is a decorator itself, its close method will close another resource, recursively. If you're interested, java.io source code can be viewed online here .
