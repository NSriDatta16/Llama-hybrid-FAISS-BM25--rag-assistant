Running Groovy Unit Tests from a Eclipse Plugin Fragment?

i'm currently working on a Eclipse RCP Project. I have a Plugin Fragment where i store my Unit Tests. I like to store the Groovy Unit Tests there as well. But when i try to create a Groovy unit test, Eclipse doesn't let me, because the fragment is not a Groovy Project. Is there a way to run the the groovy tests inside the fragment? Or should i stop trying? Thanks! Patrick
