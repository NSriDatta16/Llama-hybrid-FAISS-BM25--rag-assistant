Question about Logistic Regression

I'm studying Logistic Regression, there is a thing that I'm not able to understand. I know what the Logistic Function is, I studied it. But I don't understand why the logistic function is equal to the dot product between $w$ and $x$. $$ \log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)=\bar{\omega }\cdot \bar{x} $$ For me these are two completely different concepts, I don't understand why are related in this manner. Can you help me?
