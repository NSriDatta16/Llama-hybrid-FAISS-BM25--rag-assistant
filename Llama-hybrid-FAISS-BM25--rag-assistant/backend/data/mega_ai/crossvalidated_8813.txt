If you have time series data then you might have a "degrees of freedom problem" . For example if you have 4 observations taken at hourly intervals and then decide to use 241 observations at 1minute intervals, you have 241 observations but they are not necessarily independent. When you submit these 241 values/measurements to an analytical package, the package might expect that these are 241 independent values as it proceeds to perform it's particular magic. If you have time series data you might have to upgrade your analytics. I don't know the program you refer to but it is a reasonable guess on my part ( I could be wrong ! ) that it's tests ( F tests / T tests ...etc ) probably don't apply to your problem set.
