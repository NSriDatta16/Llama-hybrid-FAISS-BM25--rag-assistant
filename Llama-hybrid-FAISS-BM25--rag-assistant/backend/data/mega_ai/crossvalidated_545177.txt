When doing LASSO, do I need to leave a level out for a categorical variable?

In a regular regression or logistic regression, if I have a categorical variable, say [Red, Blue, Green] , I can only include two of them in my model so that Y = C + Blue + Green . Do I also need to leave one out in LASSO or can I include all 3 colors? If I include all 3, can I still have an intercept? Or do I need to get rid of it? Thanks!
