How to not load the theme css when creating a TinyMCE plugin?

I'm in the process of creating my first TinyMCE plugin. I'm including 'tiny_mce_popup.js' in the html and it's loading 'advanced/skins/default/dialog.css' by default. I don't need TinyMCE to load this css and the only solution I have found so far is documented here http://www.mattephraim.com/blog/tag/tinymce/ ; and as the author suggests, it is not the most elegant solution. Please help if you know the proper way of handling this.
