jquery html() not working on positioned element in Chrome

I have a paragraphed named dialog I am trying to add content to via ajax. The element is positioned like so: Processing Please Wait... Note I am calling: $('#modal').show("fast"); before trying to add content to it. Then I try to add to the dialog paragraph like so: $.post( 'processor.php', queryString, function(data){ alert('data:'+data); $('#dialog').html(data); } ) It does not innerHTML to the dialog paragraph. I tried adding the content to a different element that is not positioned, and it worked fine. Anyone know why this is not working? or have a fix? P.s. I know I should move my styles to a style sheet, I usually do that at the end. Update I wanted to let you know I only have 1 dialog id and it actually IS removing the text inside #dialog just not adding anything. Also I am calling this in document.ready You can see the page here click the submit button on the very bottom to see it happen. update2 This is working correctly in FF and IE, its only not working in chrome.
