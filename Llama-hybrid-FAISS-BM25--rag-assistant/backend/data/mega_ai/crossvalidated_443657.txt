Comparing time series data between three treatment groups (in R)

I have time series data where the response is decreasing over time. The rate of the decrease is supposed to depend on the treatment (the concentration of a drug). By looking at the data I am not sure that the data will show a significant difference between treatments but I need to show this statistically, with a p-value. What type of statistical analysis does one need to perform to do this? The data can be fit with the first order rate equation R = R_0 * exp(-k * t). sample data: library(ggplot2) df = structure(list(time = c(0, 0, 5, 5, 10, 10, 15, 15, 20, 20, 30, 30, 40, 40), conc_A = c(0.9957, 1.004, 0.9074, 0.8415, 0.8033, 0.7782, 0.6642, 0.6504, 0.6183, 0.6347, 0.48, 0.5222, 0.3737, 0.4229), conc_B = c(1.054, 0.9463, 0.8999, 0.775, 0.738, 0.6598, 0.6498, 0.6078, 0.5878, 0.552, 0.4826, 0.4218, 0.3624, 0.2902), conc_C = c(0.9735, 1.026, 0.7553, 0.82, 0.6976, 0.6548, 0.5795, 0.531, 0.4751, 0.4508, 0.3259, 0.3688, 0.2806, 0.244)), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -14L)) melt.df quick plot of the provided data
