I used to not like GUID at all, but I've grown to love it. I love it because it is relatively uniform and adopted, and I end up writing less code by using it, and maintaining that code, than I would normally write and maintain. It is especially useful for storage of files, where you need to guarantee that a filename is unique, in a directory with a potentially large number of files, including pre-existing files.
