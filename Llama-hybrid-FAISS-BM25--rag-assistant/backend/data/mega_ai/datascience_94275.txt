Time series forecasting in Python with 2 categorical variables

What approach is the best for a time series forecasting where you want to include 2 categorical variables in python? Im not finding any useful information that can help guide me with this; mainly everything I've found is about numerical variables only (both independent and independent variables) My data looks like this: Basically I have 10 years (2010-910) of the medium salary data, per county (42) per field of activity (19). I am looking for guidance to get predictions for next years. As in - what would be the medium salary for a hotel agent in 2020 in X county? Any ideas? I am a newby in ptyhon so I could use some code as well, thanks in advance
