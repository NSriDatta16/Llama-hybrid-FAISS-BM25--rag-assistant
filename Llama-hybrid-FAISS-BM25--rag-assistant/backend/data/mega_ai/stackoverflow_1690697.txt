How do I get a string into a format I can use with UIWebView loadRequest?

It turns out that if you load data into a UIWebView using loadHTMLString, that the webView will always return NO for canGoBack and canGoForward properties. Unfortunately, I have to extract fragments of text from a large file and then put that text into a webView with loadHTMLString. [aWebView loadHTMLString:aString baseURL:nil]; In order for the canGoBack and canGoForward properties to reflect the proper values, one must use [aWebView loadRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request] How can I convert a string of text into a request that can be processed with loadRequest?
