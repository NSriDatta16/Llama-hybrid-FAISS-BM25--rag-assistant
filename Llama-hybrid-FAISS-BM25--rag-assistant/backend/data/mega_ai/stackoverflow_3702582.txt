If your program is sufficiently efficient, your internet connection WILL be the limiting factor (as Robert Harvey said in his answer). However, by doing this with a home internet connection, you are probably abusing your provider's terms of service. They will monitor it and will eventually notice if you frequently exceed their reasonable usage policy. Moreover, if they use a transparent proxy, you may hammer their proxy to death long before you reach their download limit, so be careful - make sure that you are NOT going through your ISP's proxy, transparent or otherwise. ISPs are set up for most users to do moderate levels of browsing with a few large streaming operations (video or other downloads). A massive level of tiny requests with 100s outstanding at once, will probably not make their proxy servers happy even if it doesn't use much bandwidth.
