I agree Chris that you need the code in one place, but I would not have it in the button click event. Place it in its own routine, called average or similar. And, there is a better way to average numbers, if you are using .NET Framework 3.5 ... LINQ. You can find the basics here: http://tinyurl.com/bd2zcq The benefit of the LINQ method is you can average as many numbers as you desire, so the algorithm has great reuse. Perhaps a helper class?
