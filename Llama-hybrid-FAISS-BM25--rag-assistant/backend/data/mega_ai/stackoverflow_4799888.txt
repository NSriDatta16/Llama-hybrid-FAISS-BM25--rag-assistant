Need to detect drop location in reference to Grid Element in WPF

I am creating Grid elements dynamically onto a stack panel. When an object is dropped on the stack panel, it fires an event that needs to determine where the drop point was in reference to the Grid element on the StackPanel. I am using WPF, so that might make some answers different. For example, I have the following code that is called when an object is dropped onto a grid element(that has been previously created dynamically). /*Handles Drop Event From Grid Item*/ private void Grid_Drop(object sender,DragEventArgs e) { Object droppedData = e.getData(typeof(Object)); //This part is not important /*Get the Grid that was dropped on*/ Grid grid = (Grid)sender; /*Translate Drop Point in reference to Stack Panel*/ Point dropPoint = this.TranslatePoint(e.getPosition(this),StackPanel)); } Here is where I have stopped, I need to calculate something like the following IF dropPoint IS ABOVE THE MIDDLE POINT OF THE GRID DO SOMETHING ELSE IF THE dropPoint IS BELOW THE MIDDLE POINT OF THE GRID DO SOMETHING
