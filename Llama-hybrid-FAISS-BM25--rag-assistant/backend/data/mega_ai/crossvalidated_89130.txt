coefficients extracted by effects package in R

Consider this logistic regression: mtcars$vs I tried using the effects package to extract some coefficients from the model: as.data.frame(effect("vs", log_reg_mtcars)) NOTE: vs is not a high-order term in the model vs fit se lower upper 1 0 0.3957869 2.916877 0.002150238 0.9950031 2 1 0.0336822 2.181009 0.000484832 0.7146704 Could anyone explain why the coefficients/standard error for vs given by this code are different. Or in other words, what is the effects package doing? as.data.frame(summary(log_reg_mtcars)$coef)[2,1:2] Estimate Std. Error vs1 -40.70047 40.53197
