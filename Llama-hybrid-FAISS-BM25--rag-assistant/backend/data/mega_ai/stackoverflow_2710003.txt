In MYSQL is it better to have one big table or many smaller tables

I am making a database of my client's customers to send email promotions to. The database will include all about 12 of my clients and each of them has an average of 2100 customers. I was wondering if it would be better to have a table in the db for each one of my clients that contains a list of their customers or if I should just make one big table... The customers will be queried daily. I know it is a broad question but any advice would be appreciated. Cheers, Chuck
