Theoretically GET should just GET , and not change the state of your system. See idempotency . Paragraph from Wikipedia: Some methods (for example, HEAD, GET, OPTIONS and TRACE) are defined as safe, which means they are intended only for information retrieval and should not change the state of the server. However, in your scenario an initial GET is setting up a resource purely for caching. Subsequent calls won't change the state of the system, so I'd suggest that GET is fine in this scenario.
