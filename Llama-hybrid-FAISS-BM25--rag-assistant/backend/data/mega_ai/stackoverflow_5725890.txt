You are trying to modify the content of a string literal which invokes Undefined Behaviour. String literals are generally stored in read only section of memory and have static storage duration. char *str_1 = "Hello"; . In this case "Hello" is a string literal(stored in read only section) and you are trying to modify the content by doing this str_1[index] = str_1[i]; Instead of making str_1 a pointer to the literal [i.e. char *str_1 = "Hello" ] make it an array of characters i.e. char str_1[] = "Hello" . The content of the literal would be copied onto the stack and you won't get any segfault if you try to modify the content then.
