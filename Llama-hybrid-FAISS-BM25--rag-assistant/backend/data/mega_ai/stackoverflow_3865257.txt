Telling the difference between two large pieces of text

What would be the best way to compare big paragraphs of text in order to tell the differences apart. For example string A and string B are the same except for a few missing words, how would I highlight these? Originally I thought of breaking it down into word arrays, and comparing the elements. However this breaks down when a word is deleted or inserted.
