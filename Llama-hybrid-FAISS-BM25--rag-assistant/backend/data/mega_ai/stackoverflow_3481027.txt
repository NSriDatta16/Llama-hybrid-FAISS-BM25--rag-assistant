Building a distributed index on Azure and Lucene.NET. Should I learn Solr and Hadoop?

I need to have my search indexes based on a Azure/Lucene.NET implementation. That being said, I don't have much knowledge of Solr and Hadoop, or what they offer the Linux crowd. Since I don't know the learning curve ahead of me, I'll tell you what I'm looking for and perhaps you can tell me how I should spend my time. I'm interested in indexing an ever-growing batch of emails from our system. As messages are sent or received they need to be searchable. That means the indexes could become huge, and that is why we are looking at cloud storage. Considering that I'm familliar with Azure, managment is sugguesting that we use Lucene.NET. What do you think is the best way for me to spend my time: Study how to make Lucene.NET index my documents, or look at Solr/Hadoop's implementation for the same.
