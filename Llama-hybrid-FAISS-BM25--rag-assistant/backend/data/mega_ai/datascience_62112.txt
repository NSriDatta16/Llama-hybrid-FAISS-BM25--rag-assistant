Is Annoy a machine learning algorithm to find nearest neighbor ? and is it similar to K nearest neighbor algorithm?

I was researching about Google universal sentence encoding and i saw that it uses simple neighbor/Annoy to find the nearest vector for semantic-similarity search engine. This is the first time i'm hearing about it. Is simple neighbor/Annoy another kind of machine learning algorithm to find nearest neighbor ? and is it similar to K nearest neighbor algorithm ?
