I built a simple GA for extracting useful patterns out of the frequency spectrum of music as it was being played. The output was used to drive graphical effects in a winamp plugin. Input: a few FFT frames (imagine a 2D array of floats) Output: single float value (weighted sum of inputs), thresholded to 0.0 or 1.0 Genes: input weights Fitness function: combination of duty cycle, pulse width and BPM within sensible range. I had a few GAs tuned to different parts of the spectrum as well as different BPM limits, so they didn't tend to converge towards the same pattern. The outputs from the top 4 from each population were sent to the rendering engine. An interesting side effect was that the average fitness across the population was a good indicator for changes in the music, although it generally took 4-5 seconds to figure it out.
