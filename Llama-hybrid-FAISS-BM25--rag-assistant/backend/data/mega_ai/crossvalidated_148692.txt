Term for non-quantitative, non-qualitative variables?

Disclaimer: I am a coder -- not at all a research scientist, data scientist, or statistician. I support an online survey application that is then used to generate aggregate and individual data reports and visualizations. For the sake of internal bookkeeping, we categorize all of our variables according to type ( categorical , ratio , numeric , etc). We don't really gather qualitative data (and I have to admit, I'm not familiar with any ways these might be categorized). We also collect a lot of data, that for want of a better term, we call nonresearch data -- e.g. person names, organizational names, and address information. I'm wondering if there's a better term that we could be using when talking about (and more importantly, categorizing) this data.
