I think the R forecast package you mentioned is a better fit for this problem than just using Holt-Winters. The two functions you are interested in are ets() and auto.arima() . ets() will fit an exponential smoothing model, including Holt-Winters and several other methods. It will choose parameters (alpha, beta, and gama) for a variety of models and then return the one with the lowest AIC (or BIC if you prefer). auto.arima() works similarly. However, as IrishStat pointed out, these kinds of models may not be appropriate for your analysis. In that case, try calculating some covariates, such as dummy variables for weekends, holidays, and their interactions. Once you've specified covariates that make sense, use auto.arima() to find a ARMAX model, and then forecast() to make predictions. You will probably end up with something much better than a simple Holt-Winters model in python with default parameters. You should also note that both ets() and auto.arima can fit seasonal models, but you need to format your data as a seasonal time series. Let me know if you need any help with that. You can read more about the forecast package here .
