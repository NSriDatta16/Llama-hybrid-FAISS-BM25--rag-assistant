I'm not sure this would solve your problem (it would in C#, but maybe not in PHP), but try using Dictionary > OtherInfo instead of List . Then "Hobbies" and "Websites" would be your keys and the values would be the list of hobbies or web sites. I'm not sure how it would serialize, though. You would be able to reference the lists of hobbies as: List hobbies = storageObject.OtherInfo["Hobbies"]; [EDIT] See here for a generic XML serializable dictionary. This derived class is the one you would need to use instead of generic Dictionary.
