In general, the formula allows one to compute an estimate of the generalization error by averaging the error over the 4 Bootstrap data sets. (i) The estimator $\hat{m}^{*(j)}$ is simply computed based on the $j^{th}$ Bootstrap set. The estimator is identical for both, the bootstrap and the out-of-bootstrap methods. (ii) In the standard bootstrap method, we average over all bootstrap samples, i.e. $\alpha_{ij} = \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{5}$. For the out-of-bootstrap case, the inner sum is only over those elements that were not used for training, i.e. the elements that are not contained in $j^{th}$ bootstrap data set. Therefore, $\alpha_{ij} = 0$ if $Z_i \in \text{Bootstrap } j$ otherwise $\alpha_{ij}$ is equal $\frac{1}{\# \{\text{distinct elements in Bootstrap j\}}}$.
