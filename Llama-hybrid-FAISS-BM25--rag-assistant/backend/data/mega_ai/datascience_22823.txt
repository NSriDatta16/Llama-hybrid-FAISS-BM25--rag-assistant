Classically, autocorrelation is how you model time-series data and imply seasonality. This is mostly mathematical but not much related to machine learning. Once you have the model, RSI/ADX, or other momentum index, EWMA or other moving average, are smoothing technique which help you to generate signals, which enable you to know where exactly you are in the time series. If you want to compare the similarity of two time series with the same time index, you may compare their euclidean distances, or compute a covariance matrix. These allow you to explore the data better and decide what you can do next. Machine Learning algorithm require labelled data for training. You may provide a specific context of your use case to see if there are some mature machine learning algorithm to be applied on your time-series data
