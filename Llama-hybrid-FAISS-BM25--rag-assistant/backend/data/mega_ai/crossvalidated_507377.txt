The Wilcoxon signed-rank test tests whether the probability that a randomly chosen pair of observations sums to a positive number with probability 0.5, i.e., whether or not it is equally likely that their sum is positive as it is negative. If $s$ is the average of the signed ranks, the estimate of this probability is $\frac{s}{n+1} - \frac{1}{2}$ . So interpret the signed rank test in terms of a probability, estimated by this estimator. See section 7.2.1 of BBR .
