Combining exposure variable

I have few exposure variables (from a survey N= 1241) two of which are 1) dichotomous response of the question: "Did you have enough water in past 30 days?" and 2) dichotomous response of "Have you spent 2 or more days without water in past 30 days?". I want to run logistic regression to see if they are related with disease outcome in the families. Now, if I combine these two variable into one: "yes"= had both enough water and did not spend days without water and "no"= either one or both of the above questions were "yes", am I doing anything wrong? Is it statistically okay to do so? Some other variables are water quality test result, access to toilet, hand washing practices etc. I don't have income data.
