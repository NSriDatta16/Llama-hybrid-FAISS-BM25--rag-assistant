Modeling relationship between one variable and maximum values of another variable

I'm having trouble with this because I suspect I'm missing some key terminology in how to ask this question. I have data that shows a relationship shown below: Notice how as js_avg increases, the maximum s for a given js_avg seems to decrease? For reference, these are data from bedrock streams, where we measured average bedrock joint spacing (the number of joints in the bedrock per unit distance, js_avg) and the slope of the stream (s). These data were collected using systematic random sampling from a population of bedrock river sites. I can do basic stats like a regression model (or multiple regression, since I have a bunch of variables that relate to s in this way), or spearman correlations, and get somewhat significant results, but what I'd really like to do is have a way of robustly showing that s is limited as js_avg increases (i.e., the maximum possible value of s decreases as js_avg increases), which is what I interpret from this plot (with the exception of a single outlier). Can anyone suggest a statistical tool for describing the relationship in these data? This is particularly tricky because I doubt this data describe the actual maximum value of s for a given js_avg (i.e., there is likely variability about some idealized maximum, and I'd like to quantify that).
