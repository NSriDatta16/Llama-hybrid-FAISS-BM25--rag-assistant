The problem is You need to have #include "GXRenderer.h" at the top of both: GXGL.h and also GXDX.h. The base type must be defined not just declared before defining a derived type. By the way, the error is a compiling error not linking error. Edit: About your class type redefinition: at the top of every header file you should have #pragma once . The #pragma once directive specifies that the file will be included at most once by the compiler in a build.
