I don't think there is built-in support (like varyByParam ) for generating fresh output for users with Session Data. As you suggest, I would recommend manually caching the pages. I would probably determine the user's Session state in the PreRequestHandlerExecute event handler in the Global.asax and then maybe set: HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);
