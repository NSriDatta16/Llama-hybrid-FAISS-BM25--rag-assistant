Can I override the default "Drag and Drop" behaviour when dragging email item from outlook?

After dragging email item from outlook, my own application (written in C#) can get the data and retrieve the msg data when the email item is dropped on it. But is it possible to override the default "drag and drop" behavior so that I can send some information else (rather than the default information) when dragging an email item and pick up the information when the item is dropped on my own application?
