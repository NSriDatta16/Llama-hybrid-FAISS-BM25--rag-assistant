Finding correlations between plant features?

I have a list of flowers, and each has a color and a fragrance intensity. Each data row has a color and intensity for one breed of flower, like this: Mauve intense Mauve intense Mauve intense Mauve moderate Mauve moderate Mauve moderate Mauve moderate Mauve none Mauve slight Mauve slight Mauve slight I'm having trouble finding a tool which will take this data and turn it into a correlation matrix. I'm somewhat new to this, so I'm not sure if this would even be the right term for this kind of visualization. Basically I want to show how likely different colors are to be strong in fragrance rather than moderate. Any suggestions? I am somewhat facile in R and tableau.
