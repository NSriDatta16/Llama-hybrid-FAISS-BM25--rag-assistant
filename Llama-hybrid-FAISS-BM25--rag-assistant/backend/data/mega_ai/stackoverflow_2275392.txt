The basic principle in Erlang is: Make it crash! I found quite useful to avoid the so called defensive programming . The concept is explained in a bit more detail in the Erlang Programming Rules page: http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml#HDR11 Moreover, even if some of the Erlang errors can be a bit cryptic, a nice way to deal with is trace them! Tracing in Erlang is pretty simple. Have a look to this quick reference: http://aloiroberto.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/tracing-erlang-functions/ or simply refer to the official documentation. This said, I fully agree with @jdupont.
