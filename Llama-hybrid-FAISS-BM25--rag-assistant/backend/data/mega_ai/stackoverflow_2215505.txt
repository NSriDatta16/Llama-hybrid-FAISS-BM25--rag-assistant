White background when embedding silverlight app

I currently have a silverlight app designed mainly in expression blend, using a border with a drop shadow effect encircling a rounded rectangle control. When I embed this application into a page, there is a white background around the object. I want to make this background either transparent so the page background color (defined in css) shows through, or somehow change the silverlight app to have the blue background instead of the white. A screenshot of my current problem is at: http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/8132/problemz.jpg Here is the code I am using to embed the app into the page: I have tried messing around with the windowless parameter but to no success. Thanks for any help
