Zero-inflated negative binomial model standard error too high?

I've been trying to analyze count data for ant foragers visiting on extrafloral nectaries with R. My data is both overdispersed and zero-inflated, so I used a zero-inflated negative binomial model to analyze the data. I am comparing the foraging frequencies of sick and healthy colonies, so in the model I'm trying to figure out if the treatment (infected, control) significantly affects foraging. I'm using sub-clone colonies, where the original colony is split in to two, so I'm using original colony as a random factor. I used the glmmTMB-package in R to analyze the data, since it gives me the option of using random factors in zero-inflated models. > da da da #fitting a poisson model on the data > fit check_zeroinflation(fit) # Check for zero-inflation Observed zeros: 385 Predicted zeros: 358 Ratio: 0.93 Model is underfitting zeros (probable zero-inflation). > check_overdispersion(fit) # Overdispersion test dispersion ratio = 1.162 Pearson's Chi-Squared = 791.200 p-value = 0.002 Overdispersion detected. > #Due to zero-inflation and overdispersion -> ZINB model > zinb summary(zinb) Family: nbinom1 ( log ) Formula: Foragers ~ Treatment + (1 | Colony) Zero inflation: ~Treatment Data: da AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 1520.0 1547.2 -754.0 1508.0 678 Random effects: Conditional model: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

I haven't been using zero-inflation models before, and I have no idea why the standard error is so high. I've checked the data and there shouldn't be any issues with it. This is the analysis of the 3 day data, in the 6 day data I have no issues with the zero-inflation model and the output gives me normal figures. If anyone has any ideas why the output of the ZINB model looks weird or can help me with my code, I would be grateful!
