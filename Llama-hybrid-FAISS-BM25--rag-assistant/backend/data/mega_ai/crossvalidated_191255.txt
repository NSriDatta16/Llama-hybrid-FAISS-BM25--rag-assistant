Sum of rating scores vs estimated factor scores?

I'd be interested to receive suggestions about when to use " factor scores " over plain sum of scores when constructing scales. I.e. "Refined" over "non-refined" methods of scoring a factor. From DiStefano et al. (2009; pdf ), emphasis added: There are two main classes of factor score computation methods: refined and non-refined. Non-refined methods are relatively simple, cumulative procedures to provide information about individuals’ placement on the factor distribution. The simplicity lends itself to some attractive features, that is, non-refined methods are both easy to compute and easy to interpret. Refined computation methods create factor scores using more sophisticated and technical approaches. They are more exact and complex than non-refined methods and provide estimates that are standardized scores. To my mind, if the goal is to create a scale that can be used across studies and settings, then a simple sum or average score of all scale items makes sense. But let's say that the goal is to evaluate treatment effects of a program and the important contrast is within sample—treatment vs control group. Is there any reason why we might prefer factor scores to scale sums or averages? To be concrete about the alternatives, take this simple example: library(lavaan) library(devtools) # read in data from gist ====================================================== # gist is at https://gist.github.com/ericpgreen/7091485 # this creates data frame mydata gist
