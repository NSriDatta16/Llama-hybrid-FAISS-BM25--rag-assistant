sortable - restrict dragging only to parent element?

I am using the sortable demo in jquery-ui. I am trying to add an item to the sortable list at runtime, like: $("#panelSortable").sortable({ distance: '15' }); function generatePanel() { var html = " "; html += " hello! "; html += " "; return html; } function addPanel() { var element = $(generatePanel()); element.appendTo("#panelSortable"); element.sortable(); element.disableSelection(); } the new element gets added to the sortable list ok. I can strangely drag the "p" element though, separately from the parent "li" element (which is also draggable). I want to restrict dragging to just the "li" element. If I just declare a few "li" items in the page, they all work the normal way, where you can only drag the "li" items, not their "p" child: I work normally! so I must be messing up the calls here to make the "p" elements also draggable? Thanks
