When a column is hidden, the UltraWinGrid.AfterColPosChanged event is fired. The event arguments don't tell you which column has had its position changed (i.e. hidden ) so the easiest thing to do it iterate over the columns and clear the filters of any hidden columns. private void grid_AfterColPosChanged(object sender, AfterColPosChangedEventArgs e) { foreach (UltraGridBand band in grid.DisplayLayout.Bands) { foreach (ColumnFilter filter in band.ColumnFilters) { if (filter.Column.Hidden) { filter.ClearFilterConditions(); } } } { Clunky, but it works.
