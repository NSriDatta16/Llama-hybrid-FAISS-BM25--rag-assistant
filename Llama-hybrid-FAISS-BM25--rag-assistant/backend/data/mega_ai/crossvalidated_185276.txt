I am not a fan of microsoft, but they open sourced a lightweight high scalability distributed toolkit for LDA: You can find it on github: https://github.com/Microsoft/DMTK P.S.: LDA is a Bayesian method. So in principle seeing new data corresponds to the likelihood term. The old posterior will become the prior. But how this works with a vocabulary update I don't know.
