I have a system I would like to implement, advise or theory would be pretty cool

So I want to extract the content from a system that is prebuilt... it uses PHP + MySQL to CRUD the data, I am thinking of displaying the data in moveable + draggable windows that the logged in users can set, and be recalled upon logon. I am thinking cookies and AJAX with some HTML5 + CSS3 goodness, or even some Cappucino with mongoDB. PLease LMK what you all think. V/R CAM
