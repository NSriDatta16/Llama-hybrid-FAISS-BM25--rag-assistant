How to statistically compare changes of two percentages

I plan to conduct an experiment with one between-subjects factor with two levels (control vs. treatment). Respondents will be asked to choose among three options (A vs. B vs. C). (FYI, I plan to collect N = 200 per factor). Below are predicted/made-up results. For the choice of option A, there is a 35% percentage-point decrease from control to treatment (45% to 10%). For the choice of option B, there is a 15% percentage-point decrease from control to treatment (45% to 30%). Question: I would like to test whether 35% and 15% are statistically different. What test should I use? Note: I am not comparing the choice probability of a specific option between control and treatment group (for this, I think I need to use a multinomial logistic regression). I want to compare the two percentage changes from control to treatment between choice for A and choice for B.
