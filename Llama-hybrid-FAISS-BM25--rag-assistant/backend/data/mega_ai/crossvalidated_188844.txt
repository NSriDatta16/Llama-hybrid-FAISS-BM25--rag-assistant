Problem with proof - why exponentially smoothed time series is biased

I'm working through the proof why the exponential smoothing is a biased estimator of a linear trend. The book is trying to describe the expected value of an exponentially smoothed time series. It's one of these steps I'm having trouble following. For infinite sums, the book claims that the following applies: $$\sum (1-\lambda)^t=\frac{1}{1-(1-\lambda)}=\frac{1}{\lambda}$$ and $$\sum (1-\lambda)^tt=\frac{1-\lambda}{\lambda^2}$$ The first part I think I understand, this is just the geometric sum. The second term in the numerator goes towards 0 when t goes toward infinity. That second expression I don't understand, however. Why can the second expression be written like this, can $t$ be written as a function of $\lambda$?
