Testing differences between two columns, and which pairs of points are significantly different

I have performed paired t-test data: compare2 $average_1kpa and compare2$ average_308kpa t = 14.565, df = 21628, p-value Does it mean there is a significant difference between the two columns.Also,how to analyse or figure out which rows are actually having significant difference ?
