Textbox search with dropdown results

I (think I) want to develop a custom control for my program in VB .net where I type into a textbox and simple search results will then be displayed underneath it (from a predefined set of items). Like auto suggest in google search. I believe the combobox does something similar to this but I think it only works on prefixes. At the moment I have a separate search form from which I use to filter a lot of possibilities and then use drag-and-drop to get the desired item into a TextBox. So ideally I want to combine this with a TextBox into which one can start typing at which point some results will be displayed and a user can select the item they want. (Say, an item from a list of products) Is this a good idea? How can I go about it best? Does it already exist? It has been bugging me for AGES! Help appreciated!
