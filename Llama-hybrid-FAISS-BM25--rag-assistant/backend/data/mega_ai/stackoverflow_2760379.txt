As an employer, how can you keep your employees motivated in writing good unit tests? Have a performance metrics which evaluates both unit test code coverage AND unit test quality as decided by some robust process (peer review?) Have very clear presentation on the much-discussed-on-SO benefits of good unit testing (e.g. improvement of maintenance resources spent, reduced bug count, easy/safe refactoring/reimplementation). Have a culture of testing. No code releases/checkins without new/changed functionality fully covered. Core reviews incorporating test reviews. Test cases being part of requirements/specs. Is it important to motivate your colleagues in writing unit testing? Yes. Unit testing is not very easy, especially good, diligent unit testing. AND the benefits are not instant compared to the costs. People therefore tend to skimp on it unless they are either forced to by policy, very persuasively convinced by examples, or brainwashed by culture. Ideally all 3.
