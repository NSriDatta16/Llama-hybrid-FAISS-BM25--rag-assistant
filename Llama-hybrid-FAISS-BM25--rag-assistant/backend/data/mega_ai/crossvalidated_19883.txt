As @NRN pointed out, it's a subtle issue which requires much background. A specific albeit more technical reference I can recommend is Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics where chapter 4 covers basic probability models and Markov processes. It even introduces the highly obfuscated BLAST algorithm around chapter 10. A less technical, more general reference would be Probability Models from Ross which is an extremely well written text that covers Markov models in great depth. The key assumption for the HMM is that of the Markov property: that given the present state of our sequence, the frequency (or probability if you're a Bayesian) of the following potential outcomes does not depend on any prior information. This allows us to use the empirical frequencies of nucleotides to calibrate the degree to which sequences are aligned and find an optimal such alignment using maximum likelihood.
