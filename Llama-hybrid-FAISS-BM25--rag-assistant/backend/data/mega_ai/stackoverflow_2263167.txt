An http is an http request. The server doesn't care whether it's from a browser or something else. If it rejects one and not the other, it's because you're not sending the same request. Some things to check might be the user agent, cookies, or whether the browser is somehow altering the @ sign in that url before sending it. You can use a program like fiddler to check the request sent by the browser and alter your code to make sure it sends the same request.
