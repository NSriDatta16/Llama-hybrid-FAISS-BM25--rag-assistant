A Bayesian nonparametric mixture model could look like: $X_i \sim N(\phi_i)$ $\phi_i \sim G$ $G \sim DP(G_0, \alpha)$ Where $\phi_i = (\mu_i, \sigma^2_i)$. DP is the Dirichlet process prior, so that $G$ is a discrete probability distribution and there can be some positive probability that $\phi_i = \phi_j, i\ne j$. $G_0$ is a Normal $\times $Inverse Chi-square which functions as a conjugate prior for the mean and variance of the components of the mixture model. Once you can sample from the model (see Neal 2000), you need to decide whether you're actually interested in how many components there are or whether density estimation fits your needs. MCMC for such a model may use a different number of mixture components at each step. Also, the model uses circular Gaussian components to build up more complex shapes, so there's no guarantee that the clustering at any one step is good on its own.
