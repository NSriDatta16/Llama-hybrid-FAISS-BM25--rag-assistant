How does one deal with lots of 1's when applying the logit function?

I have a dataframe containing many feature columns, one of them being Score , with values between 0 and 1 (if it helps: it represents the difficulty of a test. The closer to 1, the easier the test). I created an extra column that applies the logit function to each of these values. The reason why I did this transformation is to do a logistic regression to predict the difficulty. However, many values will be inf because in the input there are values such as 0 and 1 (most of them are 1). What do I do with them? Should I apply the logistic function (inverse of logit) to 0 and 1's? Should I just eliminate them?
