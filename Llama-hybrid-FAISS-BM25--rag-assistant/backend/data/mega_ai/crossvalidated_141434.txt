As encouraged by @whuber I am re-posting my comment as an answer. By central limit theorem the average will be approximately normally distributed provided the trials are iid. Your current sample mean has $SE=11.35/\sqrt{1000} = 0.36$. 95% confidence interval is sample mean $\pm 1.96\times SE$, ie $\pm 0.70$. (95% of normal distribution is within $1.96 \sigma$ of mean) There is no guarantee that you are within a range of the score but 95% of CIs calculated will contain true mean. For a 95% CI that is $\pm 1$ you need $SE=0.51$ so $N=495$ should do it (although you might also get variation in measured SD). More detailed calculations (since my original comment was long on brevity): \begin{align} 1.96 \times SE = 1.96 \times \frac{SD}{\sqrt{N}} &= 1 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} &= \frac{1}{1.96 \times SD} \\ \sqrt{N} &= 1.96 \times SD \\ N &= (1.96\times SD)^2 \\ &= 494.9 \end{align}
