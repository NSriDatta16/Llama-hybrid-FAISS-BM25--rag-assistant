It doesn't look like this library has been specifially coded for Silverlight. Despite being a pure C# implementation its still likely to assume the full .NET API is available. This is not true in Silverlight. Specifically Silverlight cannot ordinarily access the local file system. The SQLLite code would need to be modified to understand Silverlight's IsolatedStorage. It would also have to limit its file operations to those that are supported by the streams available Isolated Storage. The creation of a DB-esq. data source in Silverlight is typically done by create Classes the represent records and collections of records, using LINQ to query them and Xml serialisation into Isolated storage to persist them.
