One way to do it is under the assumption of "small enough" changes to linearize your equation and calculate the change in time as follows: Your target is the average cost per unit (1.9 in week 1), we'll designate it $y_t$ . and you have the costs and units sold for every buyer that we'll designate $c_{i,t}, u_{i,t}$ respectively, where $i$ designates the buyer. Therefore: $y_t = \frac{\sum_ic_{i,t}}{\sum_iu_{i,t}}$ $y_{t+1} = \frac{\sum_ic_{i,t+1}}{\sum_iu_{i,t+1}}$ we can change variables to proportion by dividing by $y_t$ : $Y_{t+1} = \frac{\sum_ic_{i,t+1}}{y_t\sum_iu_{i,t+1}}$ from here it follows that by definition $Y_t = y_t/y_t = 1$ and now linearize in every variable $u,c$ by taking the first term of the Taylor expansion: $\frac{dY_{t}}{dc_{i,t}} =\frac{1}{y_t\sum_iu_{i,t}}$ $\frac{dY_{t}}{du_{i,t}} =-\frac{y_t\sum_ic_{i,t}}{(y_t\sum_iu_{i,t})^2} = -\frac{\sum_ic_{i,t}}{y_t(\sum_iu_{i,t})^2}$ And finally, we write the Taylor expansion: $Y_{t+1} \approx 1 + \sum_i\frac{1}{y_t\sum_iu_{i,t+1}}(c_{i,t+1} - c_{i,t}) - \sum_i\frac{\sum_ic_{i,t}}{y_t(\sum_iu_{i,t})^2}(u_{i,t+1} - u_{i,t})$ since we want the change in quantities and not the absolute we subtract 1 ( $Y_t$ ) from both sides, and notice that the sums are just total cost and total units sold and rewrite the equation: $\Delta Y_{t} \approx \sum_i\frac{1}{y_tsold_{total}}\Delta c_{i,t} - \sum_i\frac{cost_{total}}{y_tsold_{total}^2}\Delta u_{i,t}$ Applying this to the data in your question: $cost_{total} = 950$ $sold_{total} = 500$ $y_t = 1.9$ $\Delta u_{1,1} = 0, \Delta u_{2,1} = 0, \Delta u_{3,1} = 0, \Delta u_{4,1} = -100 $ $\Delta c_{1,1} = 10, \Delta c_{2,1} = 0, \Delta c_{3,1} = 0, \Delta c_{4,1} = -125 $ Applying the formulas ( $\Delta_1$ is the change due to buyer 1): $\Delta_1 = \frac{1}{1.9*500}\Delta c_{1,1} - \frac{950}{1.9*500^2}\Delta c_{1,1} = 0.02$ $\Delta_2 = \frac{1}{1.9*500}\Delta c_{2,1} - \frac{950}{1.9*500^2}\Delta c_{2,1} = 0$ $\Delta_3 = \frac{1}{1.9*500}\Delta c_{3,1} - \frac{950}{1.9*500^2}\Delta u_{3,1} = 0$ $\Delta_4 = \frac{1}{1.9*500}\Delta c_{4,1} - \frac{950}{1.9*500^2}\Delta u_{4,1} = -0.131 +0.25 = 0.118$ so to summarize we can see that the change in cost of buyer 1 increased the total CPU by about 2%, and the decrease in units bought by buyer 4 increased the total cost by about 12%. this can be broken down to a 13% decrease due to decrease in total price payed by buyer 4 and 25% increase due to decrease in units bought.
