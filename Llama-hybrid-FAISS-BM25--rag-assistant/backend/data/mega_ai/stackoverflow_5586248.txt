It seems like the easiest thing to do for your show/hide navigation bar would be to add a UITapGestureRecognizer and set numberOfTouchesRequired and numberOfTapsRequired to 1. Alternatively, you could use touchesEnded instead of touchesBegan. Then in your touchesEnded, you could check for the number of touches and only show/hide if it's 1: -(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *theTouch = [touches anyObject]; if (theTouch.tapCount == 1) { // show/hide navigation here ... } else { // finish your zoom here ... } }
