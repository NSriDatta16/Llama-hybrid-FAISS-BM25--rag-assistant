A solution should be: img{ float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; background-color: #CCC; } p{ clear: left; margin: 0px; } dummy text dummy text dummy text dummy text here some text You can clear the floating by applying the "clear: left;" to any tag after the "p". However, I prefer the solution below (it solves the containing issue of the "p" tag, too): img{ float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; background-color: #CCC; } p{ margin: 0px; } div.clearer{ clear: left; } #container{ width: 300px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } dummy text dummy text dummy text dummy text here some text EDIT: My suggestion is the same even in the case of your example (however, in this example you can remove the "clear:left" applied to the "p" tag and you can't use the second method I've suggested)! The behavior of the tags "p" and "img", in the example, it's normal ... I try to explain: if you set the line-height of the paragraph to 20px (with a font-size So, you can choose or to set the margin to a value minor than 20px or to reduce the line-height!
