You didn't mention if using Amazon S3 is an option for your solution, but they do offer native partial upload support. The basic workflow is: Create an upload-placeholder and hold on to the response key Upload chunks -- can be concurrent and retried as necessary Use the response key to combine the chunks into a single file Their SDK offers built-in file slicing and chunk upload. Even if S3 is not the final location, you could use S3 as an upload holding pen and download the file at your convenience for permanent storage.
