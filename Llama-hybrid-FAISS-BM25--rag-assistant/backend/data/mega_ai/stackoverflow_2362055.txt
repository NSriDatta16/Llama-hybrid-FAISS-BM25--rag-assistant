with some of my friends we create the dynaresume project ( http://code.google.com/p/dynaresume/ ). Our main goal is to leverage best practices araund : - Eclipse RCP - Spring DM - JPA For the time being It works but It does not many things It's mainly a proof of concept We try also to provide a Web Client such as Eclipse RAP. I mavenized all this stuff using Maven 3/Tycho which is IMHO the easiest way to mavenize OSGi bundles. I suppose we should keep in touch since we aiming the same goal.
