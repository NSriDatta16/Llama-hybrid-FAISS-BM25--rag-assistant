As many have said here, FCKEditor is a good alternative. However, pay attention to the licensing models of the editors especially if you're planning on using them for a commercial, closed-source application. http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/license.php TinyMCE is just LGPL. http://ckeditor.com/license CKEditor (the most recent manifestation of FCK Editor) has a separate Closed Distribution License which may cost you some moulah... I like the feature set and theme of FCKEditor/CKEditor better than TinyMCE but I often end up using TinyMCE due to it being a little simpler to handle in terms of licensing.
