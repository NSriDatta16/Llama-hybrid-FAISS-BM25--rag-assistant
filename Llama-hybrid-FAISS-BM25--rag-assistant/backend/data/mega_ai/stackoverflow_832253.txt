Minimal "Task Queue" with stock Linux tools to leverage Multicore CPU

What is the best/easiest way to build a minimal task queue system for Linux using bash and common tools? I have a file with 9'000 lines, each line has a bash command line, the commands are completely independent. command 1 > Logs/1.log command 2 > Logs/2.log command 3 > Logs/3.log ... My box has more than one core and I want to execute X tasks at the same time. I searched the web for a good way to do this. Apparently, a lot of people have this problem but nobody has a good solution so far. It would be nice if the solution had the following features: can interpret more than one command (e.g. command; command ) can interpret stream redirects on the lines (e.g. ls > /tmp/ls.txt ) only uses common Linux tools Bonus points if it works on other Unix-clones without too exotic requirements.
