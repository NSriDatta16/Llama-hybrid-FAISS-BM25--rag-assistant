SortedList vs SortedDictionary vs Dictionary

I have a large collection of small objects, each has a unique string ident. I need to decide which class to use. MSDN says about the first two The two classes have similar object models, and both have O(log n) retrieval. Where the two classes differ is in memory use and speed of insertion and removal Since I rarely insert, mostly just retrieve it seems both are good for me. What about the plain old Dictionary?
