CNN Feature Extraction Time

I have a dataset consist of 260 thousands images that are extracted from several videos. I want to extract features of these images and use them for frame retrieval. I used VGG16 (pretrained on imagenet) that implemented in Keras library with 'avg' pooling in the last convolutional layer. VGG16 gives me a vector consist of 512 number (feature) for each image. The only reason that bothers me is that this scenario is too time-consuming. For my dataset, it took about a day and 6 hours which is too much. Is this elapsed time normal? Because of low performance, I switch from VGG16 to DenseNet121 that already implemented in Keras. For this model (now) it took a day and 18 hours to extract features from 33% of my images (about 86000). I ask again: Is this elapsed time normal? Is there any way to extract feature faster? Even without using of implemented algorithms? If you need more clarification, just ask for it. Thank You!
