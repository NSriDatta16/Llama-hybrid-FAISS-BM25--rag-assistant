OpenSSO SSOToken to SAML assertion and back

I'm considering securing a whole Java EE software platform with OpenAM (prev. Sun OpenSSO). Applications - running on WebLogic AS - would be secured by a JEE Policy Agent and web services with WS-Security SAML Token Profile . As of my understanding, the SSOTokenManager enables application code to retrieve OpenAM's SSO token. But in order to invoke the SAML protected Web Services, I need to obtain a SAML Assertion from OpenAM. Can anybody tell me how to do so ? Also, in the Web Service code, I may need to get back a SSO Token from a SAML assertion. Is that possible ?
