SQL Query to get a row, and the count of associated rows

I have two tables, like this: #Articles: ID | Title 1 "Article title" 2 "2nd article title" #Comments: ID | ParentID | Comment 1 1 "This is my comment" 2 1 "This is my other comment" I've always wanted to know, what is the most elegant way to get the following result: ID | Title | NumComments 1 "Article title" 2 2 "2nd article title" 0 This is for SQL Server.
