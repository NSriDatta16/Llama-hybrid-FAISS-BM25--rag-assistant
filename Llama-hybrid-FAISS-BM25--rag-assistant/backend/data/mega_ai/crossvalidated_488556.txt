Your profit function is correct. What you want to maximize here is the expected profit , that is: $$\mathbb E[v(X)]=\sum_{x=1}^n p(X=x)\cdot v(x)$$ We can write a R script to optimize this function: # function to find expected profit if they book n rooms expected_profit 100, 50*n-60*(X-100), 50*n) return(sum(prob*profit)) } # plotting that function plot( seq(1,400), unlist(Map(expected_profit, seq(1,400))), type="l" ) # finding the maximum which.max(unlist(Map(expected_profit, seq(1,400)))) This gives the result $n=108$ . That is, they optimize their average profit by booking 108 rooms.
