In the original paper, I do not see the previous weights being propagated: The authors thus assume (in the Prediction paragraph) the $x_{k-1}(i)$ are equally weighted, as being a sample from the distribution $p(x_{k-1}|D_{k-1})$ . Once the propagation step is accomplished, they propose a resampling (or Bayesian bootstrap) using the observation densities $p(y_k|x^*_k(i))$ as weights.
