Calculate weighted mean of different sized groups with different interests

In a conference format you often try to find "the best talk" by letting the attendees vote. Of course the primary factor is the quality of the talk itself. The problem I see is that you have differently sized interest groups per talk skewing the results. Example: Assume you have one talk with 100 attendees. You get an average of 7.5/10 out of the 100 answers of all attendees. Pretty good talk. Then there is this other talk only relevant for a very small special interest group with 5 attendees running in parallel to the other talk. As they're all friends they all vote with 10/10. Just using a mean would let the small talk win "the best talk". Is this fair? Using a minimum number of responses as a cut-off point doesn't seem fair. Shouldn't a weighted average be used, using the sample size as weight? What is the best / most fair way to figure out "the best" talk?
