If this is all you have, there is no way to do this. You can't do a multiple regression (which you tried) because you don't have the individual y values. You can't do unsupervised learning because that won't give you Y values. You want supervised learning but you have nothing to supervise the learning with. PCA is not going to help either because that is a dimension reduction method, not a way to solve for Y. Sorry, but there isn't a solution except to use the mean of Y for every y value.
