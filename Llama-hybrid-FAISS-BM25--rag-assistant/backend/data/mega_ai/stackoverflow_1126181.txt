Prabu, While I suspect the Configure::write() call will sometimes correctly set the session information (at least it looks like it might work), the Cake convention (aka the CakeWay) is to use the Session helper. I believe it is included by default in all Cake controllers; if not, you can always declare your controller as such: class UsersController extends AppController { ... var $helpers = array( 'Session', ... ) ... } Then, when you want to write info to the session, just call: $this->Session->write( 'checkAgent', false ); To read back values, use: $this->Session->read( 'checkAgent'); For more information on the Session helper, check out the CakeBook @ http://book.cakephp.org/view/484/Session
