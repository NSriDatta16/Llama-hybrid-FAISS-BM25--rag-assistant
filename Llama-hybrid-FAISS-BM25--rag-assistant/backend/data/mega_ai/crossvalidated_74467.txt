Expected value of a series of random variables in a markov chain

I have a Markov Chain such that $X_n = max(X_{n-1}+\xi _n,0)$ where the $\xi_n$ series is independent and identically distributed. I want to show that if $\mathbb E(\xi_n) > 0$ (where $\mathbb E(\xi_n)$ is the expected value of $\xi_n$) then$\frac{X_n}{n}$ tends to $\mathbb E(\xi_n)$ as n approaches infinity for any choice of $X_0$. And... I have no idea how to show this. I know that repeated application of the above will yield $X_n = max(X_0+\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\xi_i, \sum\limits_{i=2}^n\xi_i, \sum\limits_{i=3}^n\xi_i, ..., 0)$, but I'm stuck here.
