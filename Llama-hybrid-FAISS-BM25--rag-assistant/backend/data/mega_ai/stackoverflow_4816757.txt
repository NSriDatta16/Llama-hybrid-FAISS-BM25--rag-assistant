Magento - Adminhtml - Default website in new customer form

I am developing an online store for my customer and, we only have one website in our Magento setup. In the admin panel when I go to Add a customer screen, in the "Associate to Website" field I see "Admin" selected by default. I would like to have my website there by default. I think one possible way would be to write some code in: Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Customer_Edit_Tab_Account::initForm
