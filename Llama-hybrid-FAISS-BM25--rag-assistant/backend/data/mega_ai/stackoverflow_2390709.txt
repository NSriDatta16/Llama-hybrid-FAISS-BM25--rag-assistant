The code I have attached below works , except it copies all worksheets and not JUST the one, and also when new file created it opens and source file is closed . Anyone have any suggestions what wrong with my code? I have tried various combinations of Worksheet, Sheets, Activesheet but without successes)? Sub CopyMainFin() ' ' CreaMainFin Macro ' Dim LastCopyRow As String Dim MyStr As String MyStr = Format(Date, "mmddyyyy") LastCopyRow = “BT307” Application.ScreenUpdating = False Worksheets("MainFinal").Range("A1", LastCopyRow).Activate Worksheets("MainFinal").Range("A1",LastCopyrow).Select Worksheets("MainFinal").Range("A1", LastCopyRow).Copy ‘ I noticed that my rage selected ActiveSheet.SaveAs Filename:="C:\Documents and Settings\algorn\My Documents\Excel files\" & "OutputFile" & MyStr & ".xls", CreateBackup:=False 'ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:="C:\Documents and Settings\My Documents\Excel files\" & "OutputFile" & MyStr & ".xls", CreateBackup:=False = Also not working End Sub
