What sort of storage engine is best suited for my website, do i use myIsam, innodb, etc. In general for any task default to InnoDB for its ACID-compliance and row-level locking. Consider resorting to MyISAM only for (a) fulltext search and (b) specific cases where performance under InnoDB isn't good enough (it's fairly rare that this is significant but some types of data can benefit from MyISAM's profile). The website i am building is an auction website, A function like auctions really really needs a consistent transactional database behind it because you're talking about people's money. MyISAM can't offer that. Your sites need to be using transactions for all non-atomic interactions, so that it's not possible for eg. two people to win the same auction when they bid at exactly the same time. it has to deal with several read and writes EVERY SECOND!! That's not a huge amount. However, InnoDB also typically performs better in write-biased access to a large table due to MyISAM's unfortunate table-level locking. I read a few about them too but i don't know if they apply to the sort of website i have. Don't rush into it. Some web authors seem to assume that memcache is going to be needed for any site to have decent performance but that really isn't the case. Any caching solution you apply will add complexity and potential failure points to deal with update times and now-outdated information. So don't resort to caching until you really need to. If your common front-end pages habitually do complex, slow queries over the dataset then yes, having some sort of cache for that, whether that's in the database itself or an external solution like memcache, can improve speeds. But probably you'd actually be better off changing the schema and adding indexes to make that query cheaper than adding the complexity and inconsistency of a cache. And on a site that's only doing “several” operations a second, you ain't gonna need it.
