you could just create an instantaneous model, and you'd get OK first-approximation results Have you heard of Recurrent Neural Networks aka RNNs? The state parameter holds information about the past and can theoretically have infinite memory (though in practice that's not always the best configuration). Check out the link I providedâ€”that chapter has some very helpful images for understanding how RNNs model sequences by "rolling up" past information. For an example application, check out this video of two computers trained on sequences of speech data (clearly they have memory of past words and aren't just instantaneously generating a word at a time).
