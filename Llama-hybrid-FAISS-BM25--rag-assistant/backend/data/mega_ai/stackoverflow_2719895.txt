An alternative to Cron would be to use Gearman Gearman provides a generic application framework to farm out work to other machines or processes that are better suited to do the work. It allows you to do work in parallel, to load balance processing, and to call functions between languages. There is a PHP extension for Gearman that provides an API to write client and workers as well. Also see this four part series The Mysteries of Asynchronous Processing and the chapter on Process Control in Pragmatical PHP Programming
