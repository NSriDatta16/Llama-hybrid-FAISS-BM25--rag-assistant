Deploy MySQL Server + DB with .Net application

HI All, We have a .Net 2.0 application which has a MySQL backend. We want to be able to deploy MySQl and the DB when we install the application and im trying to find the best solution. The current setup is to copy the required files to a folder on the local machine and then perform a "NET START" commands to install and start the mysql service. Then we restore a backup of the DB to this newly created mysql instance using bat files. Its not an ideal solution at all and im trying to come up with something more robust. The issues are User rights on Vista, and all sorts of small things around installing and starting the service. Its far too fragile to be reliable or at least it appears that way when i am testing it. This is a Client/Server type setup so we only need to install one Server per office but i want to make sure its as hassle free as possible and with as few screens as possible. How would you do it?
