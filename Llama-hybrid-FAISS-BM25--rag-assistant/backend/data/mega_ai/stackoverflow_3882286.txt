There are a couple of answers posted here that will give you the text effects you want, but... The thing about tables is that they are organized collections of labels and data. Having both a label ("Datum") and the value that it labels in the same cell is oh so very wrong. The label should be in a element, with the value in a either in the same row or the same column (depending on the data arrangement you are trying to achieve). You can have elements running either vertically or horizontally or both, but if you don't have heading cells (which is what means), you don't have a table, you just have a meaningless grid of text. It would be preferable, too, to have a element to label the table as a whole (you don't have to display the caption, but it should be there for accessibility) and have a summary="blah blah blah" attribute in the table tag, again for accessibility. So your HTML should probably look a lot more like this: Test page with Table th { font-size: 35px; font-weight: bold; padding-left: 5px; padding-bottom: 3px; } Table of Stuff Datum November 2010 That may not be exactly what you want -- it's hard to tell whether November 2010 is a data point or a label from what you've posted, and "Datum" isn't a helpful label in any case. Play with it a bit, but make sure that when your table is finished it actually has some kind of semantic meaning. If it's not a real table of data, then don't use a to lay it out.
