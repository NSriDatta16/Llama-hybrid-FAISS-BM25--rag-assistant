Mouse Capture and Selection

I have a control, that moves around alot of different controls inside of it in the form of a grid. So basically, none of the container control is shown at any point. But i do have capture of all the mousedown and mousemove events of the controls inside. What id like to do, is create an effect alot like the desktop of a windows computer, where you can drag, and every control that is inside of the mouse's drag will be thrown in a list, and when the mouse is released i can perform an action on all the selected items. Is this possible?
