How do I handle every ASCII character (including regex special characters) in a Perl regex?

I have the following code in Perl: if (index ($retval, $_[2]) != -1) { @fs = split ($_[2], $_[1]); $_[2] is the delimiter variable and $_[1] is the string that the delimiter may exist in. ( $_[0] is used elsewhere) You may have guessed that this code is in a subroutine by those variable names. Anyway, onto my question, when my delimiter is something innocuous like 'a' or ':' the code works like it should. However, when it is something that would get parsed by Perl regex, like a '\' character, then it does not work like it is supposed to. This makes sense because in the split function Perl would see something like: split (/\/, $_[1]); which makes no sense to it at all because it would want this: split (/\//, $_[1]); So with all of that in mind my question, that I cannot answer, is this: "How do I make it so that any delimiter that I put into $_[2] , or all the ASCII characters, gets treated as the character it is supposed to be and not interpreted as something else?" Thanks in advance, Robert
