I have not found a book dedicated to exception handling, but there are some which deal with this topic at the length of a section or chapter. As a primer and for a language agnostic approach see [Martin, Ch. 7] . [McConnel, Ch. 8.4] also deals with exception handling on a very general basis. For addtionally good advices for the use of exceptions see [Subramaniam, Hunt, Ch. 36, 37] . I also found [Richter, Ch. 20] very useful although it is specific to .NET and C#. Nevertheless some sections are applicable to other languages, too. Recommendation: As an alternative approach to throwing exceptions and error-code return style of programming, do some research on the "Special Case Pattern" or "Null Object Pattern" in the WWW.
