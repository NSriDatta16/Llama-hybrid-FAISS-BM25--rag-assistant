Prolog -- better way to eliminate duplicate answer in special case?

I was having trouble with these two lines: list_swizzle(L, [], L). list_swizzle([], L, L). The problem was that if the both of the first two arguments are the empty list, the first two statements would both be used, returning the same answer. However, if I put a cut in one, it wrecks backtracking. I eventually put in this line above them: list_swizzle([], [], []):- !. And it works. But I was wondering if there is a more elegant solution.
