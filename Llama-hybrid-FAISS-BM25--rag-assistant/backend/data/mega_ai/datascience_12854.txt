What is the simplest neural network for the simplest nonlinear function $f(x,y) =xy$

How do I capture $y = x_1 x_2$ using a simple neural network with commonly used activation functions? I assume that I need at least one hidden layer. What mix of commonly activation functions should I use? So far, I have used $max(0,x)$ and $tanh$ activation for the hidden layer, but the gradient descent diverges very quickly. Some thoughts which may be useful: $$ (x_1 y_1)^2 = \exp(\log(x_1^2) + \log(x_2^2)) $$
