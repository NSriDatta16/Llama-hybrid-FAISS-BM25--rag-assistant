Here's what you'd include in your components table. CREATE TABLE `components` ( `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, `typeId` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, `moreInfo` VARCHAR(32), -- etc PRIMARY KEY (`id`), KEY `type` (`typeId`) CONSTRAINT `myForeignKey` FOREIGN KEY (`typeId`) REFERENCES `types` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE ) Just remember that you need to use the InnoDB storage engine: the default MyISAM storage engine doesn't support foreign keys.
