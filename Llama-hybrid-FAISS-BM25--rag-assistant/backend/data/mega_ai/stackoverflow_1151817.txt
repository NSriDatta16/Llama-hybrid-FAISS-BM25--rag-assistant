Best Hardware Configuration for ASP.NET Hosting Application

We have developed a vacation rental application in ASP.NET with SQL server as DB. Used .NET 3.5 with Entity Framework. Currently QA test this with P4 machine with 2GB RAM. Looks like the processor utilization goes up to 50% for every request. All our DB retrieval timings are We use Telerik RAD Controls for most of the pages. It has been decided that the server hardware is the bottleneck (from HTTP Analyzer measuring the Wait time). We expect 100 concurrent users 100-200 transactions per second. We run both the IIS & SQL server in the same server at well & hosted in GoDaddy. The legacy application responds very well at the same server - No EF, Telerik Controls etc. Can anyone recommend good hardware configuration RAM, CPU Speed etc & what other techniques to speed up the performance?
