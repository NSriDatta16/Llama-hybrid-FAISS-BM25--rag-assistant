You are inserting a pointer to a stack allocated buffer 'temp', which most of the time will be the same pointer. Change your while loop code to: outbuf[i] = '\0'; printf("PARENT read from stdout: %s\n", outbuf); std_out_lines[std_out_count] = strdup(outbuf); std_out_count++; strdup() will allocate storage for the string inserted into std_out_lines array and copy the contents of outbuf into that new string.
