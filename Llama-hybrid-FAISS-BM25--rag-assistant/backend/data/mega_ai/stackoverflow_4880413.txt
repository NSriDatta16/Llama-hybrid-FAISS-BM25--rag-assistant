Text color of a closed spinner

I understand that the closed spinner is actually a View , I think. But I am guessing it has a TextView there somewhere to show the text. How do I get access to that TextView so I can change the textcolor? EDIT: I need to change this programatically on the fly, not in the XML. TextView v = (TextView) getView(mySpinner); v.setTextColor(..... This doesnt work... Thank you! array_typ=new String[5]; array_typ[0]="Pressure"; array_typ[1]="Level"; array_typ[2]="Overage"; array_typ[3]="Under"; array_typ[4]="Taken"; adaptertyp = new ArrayAdapter (this,R.layout.simple_spinner_item, array_typ); typ.setAdapter(adaptertyp);
