If you want to respect the SRP ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle ), do the little exercice: Select your class and try to describe what it does/can do. If you have an "AND" in your description, you must move the method to an other class. See page 36: http://misko.hevery.com/attachments/Guide-Writing%20Testable%20Code.pdf Other Law (there are many more) that will help you organize your classes: Law of Demeter ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter ). To learn a lot and to help you make the right choice, I advice you Misko's blog (A google evangelist): http://misko.hevery.com Hope this helps.
