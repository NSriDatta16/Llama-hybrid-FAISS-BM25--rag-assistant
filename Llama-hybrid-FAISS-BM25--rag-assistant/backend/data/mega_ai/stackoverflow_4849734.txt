Not sure whether you're still looking for the answer, but as I've encountered this thread during my search for a solution of the same problem, I though it might be helpful for future reference. You'll need to construct your criteria as follows: final Criterion lhs = Restrictions.eq("organization",organization.getId()); final Criterion rhs = Restrictions.isNull("organization"); Criteria criteria = this.sessionFactory.getCurrentSession().createCriteria(Role.class).add(Restrictions.or(lhs, rhs));
