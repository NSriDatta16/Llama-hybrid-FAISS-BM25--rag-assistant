Comparing fit of time series to true process

I know that this question have been asked many times in this forum, but I am having troubles in understanding the correct approach to my aim. I have several time series representing a growth process grouped by some factor. Each factor contains three time series: S.true , S1 , and S2 . For each factor, I know that S.true is the true process while S1 and S2 are two simulations (deterministic) which aim at replicating the true growth. What I'd like to do is to demonstrated that S1 is a more accurate representation of S.true compared to S2 . I was thinking of using a variance test, in which I demonstrate that S1 is closer to S.true than S2 . I am not sure whether this is the correct way to approach the problem. Example of time series:
