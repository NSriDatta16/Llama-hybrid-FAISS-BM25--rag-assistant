One simple option is github . I use it a bit to share data and data analysis code. A few good examples of others sharing code and data on the site are listed on this question . Benefits of github Easy to upload once you get familiar with git, and why not use git for your version control needs. You can use gists for simple single files It's easy for others to download single or multiple files as an archive It has a good amount of free storage source code can be browsed on the internet and more... Of course, github isn't perfect for data. I can see the merits of using a more permanent institutional repository or some other dedicated tool for more serious archiving.
