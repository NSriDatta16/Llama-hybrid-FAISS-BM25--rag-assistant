Why are there differences between the coefficients for logistic regression and SVM classifiers? Is there any interpretation for the differences?

Why are there differences between the coefficients for logistic regressions and SVM even when they give more or less the same results? Is there any interpretation for the differences? I am currently using both logistic regression and SVM (linear kernel) classifier to perform classification among picture of males and females. Both the classifiers are giving me the same results yet when I check their coefficients (.coef_) I find that SVM coefficients have a much shorter range (0.2 to -0.2) whereas logistic regression model has a wider range (0.4 to -0.4). What is the reason for this difference?
