Feature extracted by max pooling vs mean pooling

In deep learning, and it's application to computer vision, is it possible to tell what kind of features these two types of pooling extract? e.g. is it possible to say that max pool extracts edges? Can we say something similar regarding mean pooling? P.S. feel free to recommend if stackoverflow is more suitable.
