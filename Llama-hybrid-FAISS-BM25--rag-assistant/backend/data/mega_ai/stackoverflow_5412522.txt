Hard way: Use the ByteArray class and load your images as byte data ( URLLoader with type set to BINARY ). Load in the first few bytes to read in the header. In the header of the image, you can parse out the width and height. You'll need to be familiar with the specifications of the image type you're using (PNG is found at http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/ ) and have a working knowledge of bytes (Thibault Imbert is writing an excellent book on the subject: http://www.bytearray.org/?p=711 ) Easy way: Load in all your images, but don't add them to the stage. They won't be shown, and you can check the width/height and draw your border as needed. Even easier way: Have a fixed border size and scale your images as they're loaded
