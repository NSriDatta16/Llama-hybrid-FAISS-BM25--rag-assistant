While I don't know of a well know algorithm for this, I did have to write something similar. The technique I used was pretty simple, but I am thinking not very efficient for large images. Basically I would take the image and do color averaging in 5 (or howerver big you want) pixel blocks and then make all those pixels the same color. You could speed this up by doing the average on just the diagonal pixels which would save a lot of cycles but be less accurate.
