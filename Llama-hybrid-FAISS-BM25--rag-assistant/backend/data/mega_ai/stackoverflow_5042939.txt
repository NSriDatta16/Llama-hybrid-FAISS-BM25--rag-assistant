If you are wanting a javascript redirect, you can examine the user agent of the browser and act accordingly. This can prove to be inaccurate because user agents can be modified (often times this is the case). The below example checks if the device is an iPad and routes the browser to another location. You will need to find out what user agents you are dealing with for the iPhone, Android, or any other device and implement this logic. Hope this helps. window.onload = Page_OnLoad; function Page_OnLoad() { if (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/) != null) { window.location = "http://[some mobile url]"; } }
