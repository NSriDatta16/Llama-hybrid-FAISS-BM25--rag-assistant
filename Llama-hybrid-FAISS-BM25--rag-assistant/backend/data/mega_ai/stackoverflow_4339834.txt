In terms of tooling, I too am in search of some way to test ASP.NET webforms apps. For the model portions (data access, etc) I use NUnit, a local sql express db, and wrote code to create the schema (from a .sql file we check in) before all of the tests run. Between tests, I use the NUnit DataRollback extension to rollback any db changes after each run. I still don't know of a good way to test the logic in the pages though, akin to Rails' functional tests. From a coverage perspective, it's devastating. You can push a lot of logic back into your models, but invariably there is code in your code behind files that is important, can break, and you'd like to get unit tested.
