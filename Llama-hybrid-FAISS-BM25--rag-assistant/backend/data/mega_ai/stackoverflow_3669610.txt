MySQL has the annoying (in my opinion) behaviour that under some circumstances, if given an invalid value to store in a column, it will store a predefined "error value" instead. For example, in a date or datetime context, it will store the "zero date" you have noticed; for an ENUM column it will store '' (corresponds to 0 in a numeric context) as an error value. Although it is inelegant, you might try doing the import and allowing the invalid zero dates to be inserted, and then issuing UPDATE table_name SET date_start = '1970-01-01 00:00:00' WHERE date_start = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
