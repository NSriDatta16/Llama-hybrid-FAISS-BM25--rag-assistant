Linear regression with white Gaussian noise

I am new to machine learning , so this question may sound fundamental. My task is to estimate the parameter vector of the equation with the least squares method: $y = \theta_0 + \theta_1x + \theta_2x^2 + η$ Where η corresponds to white Gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance 0.1 Also , I have been given the prior values of the parameter vector , say [-1,0.3,0.6] . I have to generate the N points of the training set . Should regresor be like this : [1 0.1 (o.1)^2] (for x = 0.1) And should I calculate a priori results by adding noise
