Don't throw exceptions if you can handle them in another, more elegant manner. Exceptions are expensive and should only be used for cases where there is something going on beyond your control (e.g. a database server is not responding). If you are trying to ensure that a value is set, and formatted correctly, you should try to handle failure of these conditions in a more graceful manner. For example... if(myObject.value != null && Checkformat(myObject.Value) { // good to go } else { // not a good place to be. Prompt the user rather than raise an exception? }
