How to report data when there is interaction

I did a multivariable logistic regression analysis to estimate the effect of an exposure (E) on an outcome while adjusting for confounders. I investigated interaction and discovered a significant interaction between the E and one of the confounders. From my understanding, I can not present the odds ratio (OR) for E from that model due to the presence of a significant interaction. Rather, I should perform separate regression to examine the association between E and the outcome for each level of the confounding variable. However, I have just been told that once I put the interaction term in the model, I have adjusted for the interaction and I can still present the OR I get from the single model. I feel reporting the OR from the single model does not tell the true story since it is clear that the effect is different from each level of the confounder. Please my questions are: a): Should I present the OR for E in the presence of the interaction terms? Does adding the interaction term into the model "adjust for the interaction"? b): Should I present the OF for E from separate regression analysis for each level of the confounding variable?
