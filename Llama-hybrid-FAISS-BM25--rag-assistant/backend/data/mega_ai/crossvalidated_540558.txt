To the Bayesian, there is no uncertainty around the predictive distribution (no hat). It is not something to be estimated. It has already incorporated all the uncertainty around the model parameters. Sampling from the posterior is simply a method of numerical integration, a convenience. The number of samples $k$ from the posterior would be very very large so that this numerical integration is close to exact. You can supply a percentage and identify the corresponding percentile from the predictive distribution. Likewise, you can supply a quantile and identify the corresponding percentage. They do not use hats on their samples from the posterior either.
