feature mappings and SVMs

I have a question being relatively new to SVMs. Suppose I have kernel $K(x,y)=\phi(x)^T\phi(y)$ for some feature mapping and a set of support vectors $\{ x_i \}$ . Is there any way of finding the reverse projection of a linear combination of the projections of $\{ x_i \}$ in the projected space, that is any $w$ such that $$ \phi(w) = \sum_i \lambda_i \phi(x_i) $$ for any choice of $\lambda_i$ ? Any general observations, results or specific cases would be of interest here.
