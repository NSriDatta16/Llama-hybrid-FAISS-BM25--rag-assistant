Machine learning classifier that allows interpretation of which features contributed to a prediction

I am working on a loan prediction dataset which already has multiple features and output label Rejected . In the dataset, some of the input variables are continuous and some are categorical. I would to like to know the machine learning model which can provide the reason behind the rejection of the loan. Is there a machine learning model which can be implemented to get the output in the form of the reason behind the rejection, e.g. due to a particular feature, such as a missing field, or credit history, income, marital status, etc.? I am new to this field and open to any suggestions.
