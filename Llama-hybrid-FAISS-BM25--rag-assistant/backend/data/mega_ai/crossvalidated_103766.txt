Okay, all the stats phDs and grad students are weighing in, in a most interesting but still probably overly-complicated matter to the average layperson. The problem is you are confounding a sequence of events (the odds of getting 4 heads in a row) with just the next event (one heads). The probability of getting 4 heads in a row is 0.0625 or 1/16. The probability of getting 1 heads GIVEN you already got 3 heads in a row is 1/2, because the event is independent of all past events. Here's a more intuitive way to think about it. What are the odds of the sun coming up tomorrow? Approximately 100%, or 1. What are the odds of you winning the lottery? Let's say 1 in one million. What are the odds of you winning the lottery AND the sun rising tomorrow? 1 * 1/million = 1/million. Now you just happened to win the lottery. What are the odds that the sun will rise tomorrow? They are still 1. They are not 1/million to average out to the sequential probability you established earlier.
