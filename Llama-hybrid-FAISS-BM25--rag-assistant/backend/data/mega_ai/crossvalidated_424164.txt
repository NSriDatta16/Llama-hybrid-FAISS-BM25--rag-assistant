Extremely Rare Events/Model Predicts No Occurrences

I'm trying to put together a model to predict rare claims, about 0.3% chance of occurrence. My file has 70,000 work orders (opportunities for a claim) and about 200 claims. I've manually created a model that identifies a subset of work orders that have about a 1% chance of a claim, just with excel, manual classification, and pivot tables. I'm trying to improve on that, and some data scientists have pointed me in a couple directions. I've used KNIME, both a random forest and logistic predictor. Both models simply predict that no work orders have a damage, which technically is 99.7% accurate but not very helpful. If I could predict a claim with a 5-10% accuracy that would be very valuable. Outcome is binary (claim/no claim). Three inputs, all categorical. Each input has 4-10 different categories.
