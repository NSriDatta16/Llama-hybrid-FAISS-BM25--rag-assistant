The basic way to approach this is to plot a metric of choice versus the amount of eigenvectors kept. I personally prefer to use the 'loss' after reconstruction for my applications, which usually reveals exponentially decreasing rewards. As an alternative you could also look at the spectral decay. For this, you plot the index of the eigenvector on the x-axis and the related eigenvalue on the y-axis. For PCA, this is sometimes done in a 'cumulative' way to show the cumulative sum of variance explained like so:
