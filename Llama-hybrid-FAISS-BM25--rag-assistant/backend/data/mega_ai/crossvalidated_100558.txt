Hopefully, by now you have already found your answer. Yes, you did. The "Total sample size" in g*power is for overall N. You would divide that by how ever many groups are in your study; in your case 2. Effect size should be chosen based on studies in the area that you are researching. You would want to model the average effect size typically found in the literature. If in some bizarre case that researchers failed to report this, you can go by the standard: r =.1 --small r =.3 --medium r =.5 --large
