How likely is it that this distribution is random?

This is not a homework or similar, this is the real world, I am preparing some stats for a meeting I will attend. I am a member of an association that has 26 members. There are two types of members, A (14 out of 26) and B (12). The board consists of 5-6 members elected for one year at the time. The board members are split into two categories, "regular" board members and deputies. During the last 10 years, there have been 56 "man-year" on the board (that is, the board has had on average 5,6 members per year). Out of the 56 man-years, 44 have been regular members and 12 for the deputies. Out of the regular members' 44 man-years, 40 have been of member type A while 4 member type B. OTOH just 1 out of the 12 man yeardeputies was A, while 11 was B. Membership of the board should be randomly distributed. Everyone has one vote and everyone is eligible. I would like to know how (un)likely it is that this distribution is random, for all three cases. How do I calculate that? 20 years since I studied econometrics and probability and I don't know where to start (nor finish...)
