Add attribute to result of xsl:apply-imports

I have an XSL stylesheet (A) that imports another one (B). A overrides a template (t) in B, and invokes B's template with apply-imports: From A: From B: I now want A to add an attribute to the fragment ( ... ) returned by apply-imports. The attribute should be added to element p directly, p should not be wrapped in another element. How can I do this? Regards, Jochen
