Call the probability of voting A as $\theta$, and assume you have no other information for it. You then observe out of 10, 1 votes for A. The posterior probability density function for $\theta$ then becomes $$p(\theta) = \frac{\theta^1(1-\theta)^9}{\int_0^1x^1(1-x)^9dx}$$ or, $$p(\theta) = \frac{\theta^1(1-\theta)^9}{B(2,10)}=2/12$$ This is the beta distribution . Why are we getting a counter-intuitive result? Well, that is because we assumed a uniform prior on $\theta$, basically saying that we believe the value of $\theta$ is equally likely to be anywhere between 0 and 1. i,e., $p_{\text{Prior}}(\theta) = 1 \forall\{\theta \in R ,0\le\theta\le1\}$. If you have some other prior on $\theta$, you will get a different result. I don't know what prior you assumed for your answer, but this is how you should do the calculation in a Bayesian framework.
