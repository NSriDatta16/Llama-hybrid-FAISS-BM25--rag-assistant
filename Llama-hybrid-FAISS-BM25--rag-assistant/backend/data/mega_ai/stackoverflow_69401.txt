Given A -> B -> C -> D and a pointer to, say, item B, you would delete it by 1. free any memory belonging to members of B 2. copy the contents of C into B (this includes its "next" pointer) 3. delete the entire item C Of course, you'll have to be careful about edge cases, such as working on lists of one item. Now where there was B, you have C and the storage that used to be C is freed.
