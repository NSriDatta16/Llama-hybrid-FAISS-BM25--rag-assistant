One option is to have the Notes agent start the Java app and allow the Java app to run asynchronously; it can then write directly into the Notes database (using the Notes Java API). You can configure the client to share credentials with the Notes client, so authenticating is not an issue (or you can have the Java app authenticate to Notes). The Java API is fairly straightforward - it basically mimics the back-end classes available in LotusScript. If you need to write resuls back into a specific document, you can pass the DocumentUniqueID (docid) to Java app from the Notes agent, and then use that within the Java app to write back. (See the GetdocumentByUnid method in the Database class). This article is a bit old, but I think still relevant: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-Java_access_pt1/index.html
