Are these classes in any way related? If you want to use one of them, do you need the others? If not, then those don't belong in a common package together. Robert C. Martin provides some decent introduction in the chapter "Principles of Package and Component Design" of his book "Agile Software Development". There is also a C# adapted version with very similar content called "Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#". What I'm just saying is, packaging components is not only about thinking components X and Y are "cool enough" to be reused, but also about how you organize things and how well libraries or packages fit into the big picture.
