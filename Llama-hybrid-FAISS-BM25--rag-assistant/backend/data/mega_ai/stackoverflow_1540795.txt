When clustering data I would always try at least these two algorithms in this order: K-Means : try tweaking the results as much as possible. If you can get K-Means to work for you and provide decent results you will almost surely not do better when any other algorithm. Expectation Maximization: the K-means algorithm was actually developed to be a cheap and good alternative to the EM algorithm. The EM algorithm is more complex to understand and more expensive to compute, but the results from EM are excellent. You can learn more about EM http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation-maximization_algorithm . There is an OpenCv implementation of EM : http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/expectation-maximization.html If the results of neither of these two are satisfactory, I would start looking elsewhere, but not until you have tried both.
