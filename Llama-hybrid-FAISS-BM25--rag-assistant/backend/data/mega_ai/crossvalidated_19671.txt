I believe you are correct in questioning the Potts' citation (which I took the liberty of using as my template for editing the expression in your question). Looking at both Therneau and Gramsch "Modeling Survival Data" and Kalbfleisch and Prentice "Statistical Analysis of Failure Time Data", the definition of S(t) is Pr(T>t) and all of their interval survival estimates are closed on the right ... so it should be $\hat{S}(t)$=$\prod_{t_{j} \leq t}(1-\hat{h}(t_{j}))$. Any other interpretation would either leave vacant all of the interval between time_0 and the first event or would assign it a lower probability than unity. Either choice seems counter-factual.
