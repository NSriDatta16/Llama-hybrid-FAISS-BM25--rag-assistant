Weird Javascript expression

I try to understand how Protovis works, and I stumbled upon code like this: force.node.add(pv.Dot) .size(function(d) (d.linkDegree + 4) * Math.pow(this.scale, -1.5)) // notice this .fillStyle(function(d) d.fix ? "brown" : colors(d.group)) // and this .strokeStyle(function() this.fillStyle().darker()) // and even this .lineWidth(1) .title(function(d) d.nodeName) .event("mousedown", pv.Behavior.drag()) .event("drag", force); I tried rolling my own short functions, like this: (function(a) a+2) I am NOT asking about anonymous functions declared like function(){stuff();} . The code in question looks like function() stuff; and it works. I want to know why. I don't want to learn about constructs like myvar = function(a){return a+1;} , but about constructs like myvar = (function(a) a+1) . Please look at the above code more carefully. But, as I suspected, it threw a syntax error. How can such code work? ( Note: the protovis code does work as intended. )
