Learning a stochastic pattern in a count TS using DeepAR

I am trying to the learn the following pattern of count time series of vehicle demand every hour. The count time series is generated from a negative binomial distribution with parameters n = 9 and p = 0.5 every 4 hours. The interval in-between has magnitude = 0. I would like to know if I can use this paper , Deep Autoregressive recurrent neural network to learn this : Please see the code below: https://github.com/JosePeeterson/demand_prediction simply run main.py to test Deep autoregression. In the test output I can see that the period of 4 hours is not being learnt as well as correct mean prediction output at each time step. Is there any count time series data that is known to work with this code?
