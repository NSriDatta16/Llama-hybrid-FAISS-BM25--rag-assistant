C + gamma (for kernel="rbf") or C + degree + coef0 (for kernel="poly") are usually the hyper-parameters of a SVM you want to tune with grid search (or randomized search). For the poly kernel, you don't have to tune all the coefficients by yourself, just specifify what order you want the polynomial to be. About the slacks, they are controlled by the C parameter so you don't have to set them yourself. To answer your second question: it depends on the value of C. Lower values (
