What problems may be caused by redundant features?

Regarding feature selection in machine learning (e.g., classification or regression) tasks, what would be the biggest problems if two features are somewhat redundant? For example, we try to predict the price of a house. Let's say there are three features related to area size, among other things: Entire lot size Size of the house (inside, not including yards) Size of the master bedroom First of all, would you call them redundant? IMO they are overlapping (although not entirely redundant). Moreover, are there any other problems if we include all three features in the regression? Would it cause accuracy loss or overfitting, etc?
