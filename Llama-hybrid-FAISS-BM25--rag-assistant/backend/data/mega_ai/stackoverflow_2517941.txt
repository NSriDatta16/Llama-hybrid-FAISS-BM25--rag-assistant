AS3 Embed Image Instead of drawing graphics

I've got a custom AS3 scrollbar that I need to modify. The scroll thumb (the draggable part of a scrollbar) is currently just done by drawing a rectangle. But I need it to look more like a real scrollbar. Not sure how to modify the below code to import/use a scroll thumb image: scrollThumb = new Sprite(); scrollThumb.graphics.lineStyle(); scrollThumb.graphics.beginFill(0x0066ff); scrollThumb.graphics.drawRect(0, 0, 1, 1); addChild(scrollThumb); I know that I would embed an image by doing something like this: [Embed(source="images/image1.png")] private static var Image1Class:Class; But then how do I set the scrollThumb = to the image? Thanks!
