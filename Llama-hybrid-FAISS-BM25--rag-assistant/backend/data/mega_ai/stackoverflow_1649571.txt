If you do this everyday for every user, why not just delete every record from the table in a single statement? Or even truncate table whatever reuse storage / edit The reason why I suggest this approach is that the process looks like a daily batch upload of user messages preceded by a clearing out of the old messages. That is, the business rules seems to me to be "the table will hold only one day's worth of messages for any given user". If this process is done for every user then a single operation would be the most efficient. However, if users do not get a fresh set of messages each day and there is a subsidiary rule which requires us to retain the most recent set of messages for each user then zapping the entire table would be wrong.
