One way to see this is as follows: For a discrete random variable $X$ , we obviously have that $$E[X] = \sum_{k=1}^\infty kP(X=k)$$ so our goal is to see how $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} P(X\geq k)$ relates to that. Since $X$ is a discrete rv, we also have that $$P(X>n) = \sum_{k=n}^{\infty} P(X=k)$$ which in words is saying that $P(X>n)$ is the same as just summing every individual $P(X=k)$ from $n$ onwards. Then if we were to sum all of the $P(X>n)$ from $n=1$ to $\infty$ , we have $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(X>n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{k=n}^{\infty} P(X=k)$$ Things get confusing with this double sum, so let's take a moment to think about it intuitively. When $n=1$ , we have one $P(X=k)$ for every single $k=1,\dots,\infty$ . When $n=2$ , we have one $P(X=k)$ for every single $k=2,\dots,\infty$ . So every $P(X=k)$ gets another count, except the first one! And it's clear to see that after $n=1$ , we will never count another $P(X=1)$ since the sums are $k=n,\dots,\infty$ for any $n$ . So we only get one $P(X=1)$ . To make things easier on our brain, let's just store them in an infinite dimensional matrix $A$ where the $(i,k)$ -th element is whether $P(X=k)$ gets a count for when $n=i$ ( $1$ if gets a count, $0$ otherwise). So when $n=1$ (the first row of the matrix), every $P(X=j)$ gets a count. So the first row is just an infinite vector of $1$ s. For $n=2$ , every $P(X=j)$ for $j\geq 2$ gets a count, so the first entry is $0$ , and the rest are all $1$ . For $n=3$ , every $P(X=j)$ for $j \geq 3$ gets a count, so the first two entries is $0$ , and the rest are all $1$ . The pattern is easy to see: for $n=i$ , every $P(X=j)$ for $j \geq i$ will get a count. So let's do this till infinity, and let's count how many times we count each $P(X=j)$ . For $j=1$ , we only count it once. For $j=2$ , we count it twice. For $j=i$ , we count it $i$ times. So it must be that $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(X>n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{k=n}^{\infty} P(X=k) = 1\times P(X=1) + 2\times P(X=2) + 3\times P(X=3) + \dots$$ But wait! That looks awfully like that first equation we wrote! And indeed, it is equal to $\sum_{k=1}^\infty P(X=k)$ , which is equal to $E[X]$ . The intuition is that by counting sums of $P(X=k)$ in the way described, we are counting each one $k$ times, which is the natural way to describe the 'average' value of a discrete random variable, since this is another way to write that we are weighting each value $k$ by $P(X=k)$ .
