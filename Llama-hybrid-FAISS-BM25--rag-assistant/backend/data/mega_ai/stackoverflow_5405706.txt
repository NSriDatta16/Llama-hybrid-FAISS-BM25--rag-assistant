Count number of times in a row strings appear in a vector, then removing them if count is below a Threshold

I am currently trying to remove the "noise" from a Vector and Can't find an elegant way to do it. I currently have a Vector of strings, and another vector representing the number of times in a row those strings occur. For some reason I just can't seem to get it working. The method I created to do this is shown below. public static void correctDisturbance(Vector names, Vector lengths, int lengthGuard){ int guard = lengths.size(); int total = 0; for(int i = 0; i It removes some of the ones I need but not others. I have the threshold set to 5. An example of the contents of the lengths vector is this: [15, 15, 1, 15, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3] Thanks in advance for any help.
