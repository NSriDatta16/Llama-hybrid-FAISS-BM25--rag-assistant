Apparently, the following characters \ { } $ ^ _ % ~ # & are special in LaTeX, so you should make sure to escape them (prefixing with backslash will do for some of them, see Thomas' answer for special cases) or tell your users not to use them unless they deliberately want to use LaTeX commands (or a mix of both, depending on the character). Some additional pitfalls: Not every line break in the text might be intended as a new paragraph. If your users use a language other than English (or Latin), you will need to \usepackage something that deals with the encoding (like utf8) or convert the characters yourself (e.g. Ã¤ -> \"a ). As dmckee points out, quotes also need to be treated separately. EDIT: Since this has become the accepted answer, I also added the points raised in the other answers, so this is now a summary.
