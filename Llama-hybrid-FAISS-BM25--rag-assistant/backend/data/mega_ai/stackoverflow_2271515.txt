I think what your trying to do is very much related to the view so there is no harm in putting code in your code behind (in my opinion at least), although I'm sure there are elegant ways of handling this such that it is more viewmodel based. You should be able to register to the OnPrevewMouseWheel event, check if the user has got the control key pressed and change your zoom factor accordingly to get the zooming effect you are looking for.
