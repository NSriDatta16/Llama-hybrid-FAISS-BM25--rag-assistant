When you have a query that says != it's invariably going to be slow. And note that the index is not being used on that part of the query even though the status field is on two different indexes! You don't want to have a varchar(255) field fully indexed and having it as part of two different keys is going to make your updates very very slow. Having a total of five indexes is just going to add to the mess. If you are doing any select at the same moment that an update is happening, it's really going to take a long time as you have already seen. What you might want to do is to index only a small section of your 255 character field. Better still, you might want use an integer (statusCode) instead of status here. That will speed things up a great deal. Having more memory or more CPU is not going to help here. Having an extra hard drive give you a 20 - 30% speed boost. But you can make the same query complete in less than a second by just reorganizing your indexes.
