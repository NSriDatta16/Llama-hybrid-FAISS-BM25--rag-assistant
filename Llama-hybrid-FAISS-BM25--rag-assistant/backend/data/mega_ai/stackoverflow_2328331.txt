Whenever I force content at a user, I follow this set of steps for the Response: Response.Clear() Response.ClearHeaders() Response.Buffer = True Response.ContentType = "your mime type" Response.CacheControl = "public" Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "public") Response.AddHeader("Expires", "0") Response.AddHeader("Cache-Control", "must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0") Response.AddHeader("Content-Description", "Description of your content") Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=""somefile.pdf""") ' Add your content to the buffer here Response.Flush() Response.End() This seems to be pretty good at preventing all the "file not found" garbage. EDIT: For those interested in what these headers actually mean: Pragma: public helps control cache for backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 requests. It ensures that your request makes it to the server even if there's already a cached response. Expires: 0 is an interval in seconds after which the response expires. Setting to 0 expires the response immediately, helping avoid a stale cache. Cache-control: must-revalidate tells the cache that it must obey your every command (i.e. it must give you a new response when you ask for it). Cache-control: post-check=0, pre-check=0 : this is an interval in seconds that a response must be checked for freshness after/prior to (respectively) being served the content. Setting to 0 forces freshness of the response to be checked immediately. ( More at MSDN .) The remainder are simply describing the content you want the user to receive. Specifying "attachment" tells the browser to offer the file as a download and to not display it inline.
