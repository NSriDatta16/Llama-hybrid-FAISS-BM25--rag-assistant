Is it a bad idea to implement an RSS feed for help desk assignments?

Before I ask my question, let me just say that I know very little about RSS feeds. I tried using Google Reader a long time ago, but I just don't think RSS is my thing. Now, onto the question. The company I work for uses a custom web-based help desk system. I have been asked to implement RSS feeds into it. Specifically, I have been asked to create an RSS feed for each support agent's tickets. This way, support agents that use RSS readers can be notified whenever a ticket gets assigned to them. The thing is I don't know if this is something that RSS would be good for. Tickets get reassigned frequently. So let's say that John Doe and Jane Doe both subscribe to their respective RSS feeds to be notified whenever a ticket gets assigned to them. A ticket gets assigned to John Doe. 30 minutes later, the manager changes his mind and reassigns the ticket to Jane Doe. How would this look in John Doe's RSS reader? Would there be a way to remove it from his feed or what? Thank you very much.
