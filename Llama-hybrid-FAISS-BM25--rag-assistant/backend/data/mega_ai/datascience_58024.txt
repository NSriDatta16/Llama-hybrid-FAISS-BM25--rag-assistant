I guess it would be better to start with some specialization in ml for example on coursera in oder to find interesting fields for you. There are different levels of complexity and extra knowledge isn't necessary in part of them. One more advantage is that you will have useful recommendation about materials. Then you can deepen in some area of researches and understand what you need to learn in addition. I would suggest courses by Andrew Ng . Speaking about algorithm, "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth is a good choice to have strong background in basi—Å algorithms, if you want in future to work on the development of ml methods by your self. Bayesian methods could be an extra field of study, it's interesting area, but it doesn't mean, that you will need it in every possible ml research )
