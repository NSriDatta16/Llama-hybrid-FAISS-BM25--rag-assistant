It's likely that when you reduce the features to 100, you are under-fitting. At this point, it is hard to conclusively say whether overfitting and underfitting would give better results, hence your confusion. I would recommend treating the number of features as a hyper-parameter of your model and use cross-validation to see what is the optimal number of features for an SVM on your data.
