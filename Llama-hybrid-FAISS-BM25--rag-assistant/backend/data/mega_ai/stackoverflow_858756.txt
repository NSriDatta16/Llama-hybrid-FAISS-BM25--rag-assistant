How to parse a text file with C#

By text formatting I meant something more complicated. At first I began manually adding the 5000 lines from the text file I'm asking this question for,into my project. The text file has 5000 lines with different length.For example: 1 1 ITEM_ETC_GOLD_01 골드(소) xxx xxx xxx_TT_DESC 0 0 3 3 5 0 180000 3 0 1 0 0 255 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 100 0 0 0 xxx item\etc\drop_ch_money_small.bsr xxx xxx xxx 0 2 0 0 1 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1 표현할 골드의 양(param1이상) -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx 0 0 1 4 ITEM_ETC_HP_POTION_01 HP 회복 약초 xxx SN_ITEM_ETC_HP_POTION_01 SN_ITEM_ETC_HP_POTION_01_TT_DESC 0 0 3 3 1 1 180000 3 0 1 1 1 255 3 1 0 0 1 0 60 0 0 0 1 21 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 100 0 0 0 xxx item\etc\drop_ch_bag.bsr item\etc\hp_potion_01.ddj xxx xxx 50 2 0 0 1 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 120 HP회복양 0 HP회복양(%) 0 MP회복양 0 MP회복양(%) -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx 0 0 1 5 ITEM_ETC_HP_POTION_02 HP 회복약 (소) xxx SN_ITEM_ETC_HP_POTION_02 SN_ITEM_ETC_HP_POTION_02_TT_DESC 0 0 3 3 1 1 180000 3 0 1 1 1 255 3 1 0 0 1 0 110 0 0 0 2 39 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 100 0 0 0 xxx item\etc\drop_ch_bag.bsr item\etc\hp_potion_02.ddj xxx xxx 50 2 0 0 2 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 220 HP회복양 0 HP회복양(%) 0 MP회복양 0 MP회복양(%) -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx -1 xxx 0 0 The text between the first character(1) and the second character(1/4/5) is not a whitespace,it's a tab.There's no whitespaces in that text file. What I want: I want to get the second integer(In the three lines I posted above,the second integers are 1,4 and 5) and the string in the middle of each line indicating the path(It starts with "item\" and ends with the file extension ".ddj"). My problem: When I google "Text formatting C#" - all I get is how to open a text file and how to write a text file in C#.I don't know how to search for text inside a text file.Also I can't search for the first integer,because in case its a small integer like in the three lines I posted above,I wont be able to find the corrent location,because for example "1" might exist in a different location. My question: It would be the best If I write a program that would delete anything,but what I need. The other way in my mind is to directly search inside that file,but as I mentioned above - I might get the wrong location of the second integer if its too low. Please suggest something,I can't format all this by hand.
