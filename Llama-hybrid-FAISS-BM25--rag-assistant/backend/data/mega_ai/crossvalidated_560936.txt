Assuming that the treatment was assigned randomly, after coding Small Business as 0 and Medium Business as 1, the OLS coefficient $\beta_1$ will give you an unbiased estimate of the average causal effect of treatment on purchases for Small Businesses, while $\beta_1+\beta_3$ that for Medium Businesses. $$purchases = \beta_0 + \beta_1 treatment +\beta_2 SegmentSize + \beta_3 treatment *SegmentSize + \epsilon$$ I find the menu of your exotic options to be a curious one, especially since it does not seem to include the good old linear regression model. You'll get a lot more value out of mastering one statistical model such as linear regression than from superficially acquainting yourself with a whole host of exotic models.
