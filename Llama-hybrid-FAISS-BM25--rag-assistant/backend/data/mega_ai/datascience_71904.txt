Is this the end-to-end process? Most importantly, you also need to understand the data you are using. It's not supposed to be a meat-grinder. Add some uni and multivariate analysis just before splitting your data. Look at the distributions and frequencies. After you split 70/30 or 80/20 or whatever, are the distributions approximately similar? I think you should also add touching base with stakeholders/business people just after feature engineering (and maybe add a loop arrow to reflect their feedback). Another user mentioned ensemble models / model averaging at the end - I think that is also important. Wouldn't an ensemble model perform better that any single model? You are also missing documentation - where are you documenting your steps? Is it all in your mind? How will others follow what you are doing? What about four-eyes check aka pair programming? What about version control? In most industries you will need to show how your models were derived and how they perform against alternatives. What about edge cases for reasonable results for the best 2-3 models Model explainability - how can you or your users trust the model without understanding how it is operating.
