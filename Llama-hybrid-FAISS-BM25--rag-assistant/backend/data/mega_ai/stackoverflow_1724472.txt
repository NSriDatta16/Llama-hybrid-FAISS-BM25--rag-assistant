"yes, it KILLS performance - totally. I went from a legacy system with GUID as PK/CK and 99.5% index fragmentation on a daily basis to using INT IDENTITY - HUGE difference. Hardly any index fragmentation anymore, performance is significantly better. GUIDs as Clustering Index on your SQL Server table are BAD BAD BAD - period." Might be true, but I see no logical reasoning according to which this leads me to conclude that GUIDs PER SE are also BAD BAD BAD. Maybe you should consider using other types of indexes on such data. And if your dbms does not offer you a choice between several types of index, then perhaps you should consider getting yourself a better dbms.
