How to model this complex system?

I need some tips to approach a complex challenge. I have a system that consists of four connected units. Every unit has its own light bulb and temperature. First, the brightness of the bulb and temperature are same in each unit. I do not know how a change in, for instance, unit 1 bulb's brightness affect the other units' temperature. I did some measurements and collected the data. I created a neural network to learn the relationships between the units. Now I have a model that predicts from the units' brightness level the temperatures in each units. We assume that the system is closed. Let's say we disturb the system. Now, the aim is to create a mechanism that returns temperature back to it original value in all units. In other words, to what level should I set the level of brightness in each units in order to keep the temperature constant everywhere in the system. I have tried my best, but haven't come up with anything smart yet. Do you have some ideas? I would really appreciate it.
