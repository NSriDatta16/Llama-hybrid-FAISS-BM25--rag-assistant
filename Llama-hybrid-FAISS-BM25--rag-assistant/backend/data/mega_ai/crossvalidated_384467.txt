Wow, 40 dimensions for one sample, but you are creating 256 possible filters for your first layer! Also you have 1600 samples to train a model that has several thousand parameters. This is too much! Two things to try: something else than a neural network, as less than 2000 samples is ridiculous for any deep network try 2 layers, at most, with perhaps 10 filters for the C layer, and your 10 outputs I don't think that anything more complicated will be trainable with the data you have.
