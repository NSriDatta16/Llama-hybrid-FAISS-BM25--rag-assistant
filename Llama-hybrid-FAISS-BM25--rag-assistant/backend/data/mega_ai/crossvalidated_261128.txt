Neural network for multi label classification with large number of classes outputs only zero

I am training a neural network for multilabel classification, with a large number of classes (1000). Which means more than one output can be active for every input. On an average, I have two classes active per output frame. On training with a cross entropy loss the neural network resorts to outputting only zeros, because it gets the least loss with this output since 99.8% of my labels are zeros. Any suggestions on how I can push the network to give more weight to the positive classes?
