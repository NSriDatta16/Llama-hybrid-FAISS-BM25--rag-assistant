C++ standard, 5.19, paragraph 4: An address constant expression is a pointer to an lvalue....The pointer shall be created explicitly, using the unary & operator...or using an expression of array (4.2)...type. The subscripting operator []...can be used in the creation of an address constant expression, but the value of an object shall not be accessed by the use of these operators. If the subscripting operator is used, one of its operands shall be an integral constant expression. Looks to me like &array[5] is legal C++, being an address constant expression.
