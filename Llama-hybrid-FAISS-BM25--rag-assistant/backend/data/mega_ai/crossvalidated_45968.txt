Irregularly spaced time-series in finance/economics research

In financial econometrics research, it is very common to investigate relationships between financial time series that take the form of daily data . The variable will often be made $I(0)$ by taking the log difference, for example; $\ln(P_t)-\ln(P_{t-1})$. However, daily data means that there's $5$ data points each week, and Saturday and Sunday are missing. This seems to get no mention in the applied literature that I'm aware of. Here's some closely related questions that I have that come from this observation: Does this qualify as irregularly spaced data, even though financial markets are closed over the weekend? If so, what are the consequences for the validity of extant empirical results garnered thus far in the gigantic number of papers that ignore this issue?
