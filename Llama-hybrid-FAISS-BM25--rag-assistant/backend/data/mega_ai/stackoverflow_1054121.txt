Two of the more popular choices are Domain Driven Development and Test Driven Development. Loosely speaking... In Domain Driven Development you would start by mapping out the logical organization of the development endeavor into a model that can be used to program against. In Test Driven Development you would start by writing unit tests that align to specific use cases. You then incrementally add functionality as use cases overlap, eventually satisfying all requirements. TDD enthusiasts like this approach because their mentality is to only code what is necessary to accomplish the current goal and you will ultimately have a better code base. Hopefully this gives you two different paths to look at, good luck.
