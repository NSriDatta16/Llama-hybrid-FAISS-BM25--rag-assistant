Can nonlinear clustering produce 'fake' results?

I know that overfitting in classification is possible when using, for instance, an RBF kernel, due to its infinite dimension. But, is it possible to get (in a similar manner) fake clustering results when using this (or other) kernel? i.e., if I run through various kernel widths and get several types of clusters, can one of these be caused by the infinite dimension of the kernel, and not by true clustering of the data? to be specific, let's say I use kernel-PCA with RBF. I hope my question is clear enough, even though it is not mathematically phrased... Thanks.
