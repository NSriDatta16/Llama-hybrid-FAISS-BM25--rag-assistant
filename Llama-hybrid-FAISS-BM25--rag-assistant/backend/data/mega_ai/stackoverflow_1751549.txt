jQuery Sortable+Droppable vs Draggable special functionality

I'm trying to make a functionality that allows for a draggable list of items (left column) to be dragged onto a sortable list (right column). What is different about just doing a connectToSortable is that I need the sortable list to ACT like a droppable list, in that the order of the items is retained on the right column ONLY when dragging new items but NOT when re-arranging the order between items already in the right column. The link below shows the first part of that functionality. I can drag items to the section I desire. I want to also be able to re-arrange those items once placed in the right column. Additionally, I want to add a class while dragging, and change a class of a element once dropped. I have experimented endlessly with all of this. I'm about 15 hours deep so far and I'm hitting brick walls everywhere. I don't even know how to approach these problems. Link I want to copy from here: into: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 And here's the JS $(document).ready( function() { /* $("#right_col > li").droppable({ activeClass: '.beingDragged' });*/ $(".block").draggable({ snap: '#right_col > li', snapMode: 'inner', snapTolerance: '30', connectToSortable:'#right_col', start: function(event, ui) { $(ui.item).addClass('beingDragged'); }, stop: function(event, ui) { $(ui.item).removeClass('beingDragged'); } }); $('#right_col').sortable({ }); } ); Any help is appreciated!! Thank you!
