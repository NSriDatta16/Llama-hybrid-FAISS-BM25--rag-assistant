My problem was that I wanted all the columns in a row to have the same background. I grouped both by row and by column, and with the top two solutions here I got all the rows in column 1 with a colored background, all the rows in column 2 with a white background, all the rows in column 3 with a colored background, and so on. It's as if RowNumber and bOddRow (of Catch22's solution) pay attention to my column group instead of ignoring that and only alternating with a new row. What I wanted is for all the columns in row 1 to have a white background, then all the columns in row 2 to have a colored background, then all the columns in row 3 to have a white background, and so on. I got this effect by using the selected answer but instead of passing Nothing to RowNumber , I passed the name of my column group, e.g. =IIf(RowNumber("MyColumnGroupName") Mod 2 = 0, "AliceBlue", "Transparent") Thought this might be useful to someone else.
