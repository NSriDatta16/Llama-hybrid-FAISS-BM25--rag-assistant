Magento; include price attributes in (product) subtotal

Hope someone can help me with this.. I have a magento store up&running, via the attribute management ive created a price attribute (type: price, label: "Extra costs") and added it to the right attribute-set. Now "Product A" has a price of $1 and "Extra costs" set to $2 When i order the product i kinda expect a subtotal of $3 however the extra costs are nowhere to be found. To clearify; Product A Price: $1 Extra costs: $2 Product B Price: $2 Extra costs: $4 Now im ordering both products twice; i expected my cart/order overview to look like this; Product A | Qty: 2 | $2 (2x$1) Product B | Qty: 2 | $4 (2x$2) Subtotal: $6 Extra costs: $12 (2x$2 + 2x$4) Shipping: irrelevant Tax: irrelevant Total: $18 However the extra costs are not calculated.. am I overlooking something? Or is it not possible at all? (If so, whats the usage of price attributes then?) // Roland
