How can I add a parent element to a group of paragraph?

I have this HTML: Title First paragraph Second paragraph Third paragraph I want to insert, with jQuery, a parent element for all elements, except the first one. So the HTML that I would like to generate is this: Title First paragraph Second paragraph Third paragraph There's the .wrap() function in jQuery that can add a parent, but if I use it like this: $("#description p:not(:first)").wrap(' '); It wraps all my individually. Is there any way I can modify my selector to put my around the "group" instead? Or maybe it's easier using a different function that is yet unknown to me? Thanks!
