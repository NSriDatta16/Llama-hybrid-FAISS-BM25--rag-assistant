What does ''Data as a Service (DaaS)" means?

Wikipedia says Data as a Service, or DaaS is based on the concept that the product, data in this case, can be provided on demand to the user regardless of geographic or organizational separation of provider and consumer. My question is, in what this definition differs from the Internet? Can you provide some practical examples and benefits of using this paradigm? Thanks.
