How to persist a complicated, nested object with JPA

I'm working on a project which parses information with a NLP library from classified ads on internet forums. After the processing I have ForSaleItem instances and all sorts of details like condition, price etc. When I call the toString() method on these objects, it does not return a string stored in the object itself but rather looks up its own start and end point within the entire forum post and then extracts the text from there. (This is done so I can calculate proximity of individual bits of text). I would like to use JPA to persist these objects to a RDBMS. After the processing I don't really care about the proximity stuff anymore, I just want to display the strings to the user. It would be an enormous waste if I'd persist the entire forum post and keep retrieving the actual text through the above method. My question now: Should I enhance the original classes with String fields or should I create an entirely new class, ie. something like PersistentForSaleItem?
