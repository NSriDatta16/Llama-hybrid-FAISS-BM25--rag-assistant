No, you don't ever have to use the logarithmic loss function. The logarithmic loss function is just a popular choice because maximizing it (or minimizing the negative of it) will lead to a maximum likelihood solution. Estimators based on this principle generally have nice properties. It's often possible to derive analytic formulas for maximum likelihood estimators. However, in the case of the logistic regression model, no such formulas exist. There are alternatives, however. The exponential loss function you referenced could be one such choice - although I'm not sure I understand your definition of it. Aside from log-loss, probably the most popular choice for binary data is quadratic loss which is used in the Brier scoring rule. In your case, it would take this simplified form: $$L(w) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(p_{i}-y_{i})^2$$ Minimizing either the logarithmic scoring rule or the Brier scoring rule should give you very similar $p_i$ estimates when you use logistic regression.
