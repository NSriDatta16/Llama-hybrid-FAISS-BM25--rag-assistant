Here's a scenario that may illustrate the usefulness of source control even if you work alone. Your client asks you to implement an ambitious modification to the website. It'll take you a couple of weeks, and involve edits to many pages. You get to work. You're 50% done with this task when the client calls and tells you to drop what you're doing to make an urgent but more minor change to the site. You're not done with the larger task, so it's not ready to go live, and the client can't wait for the smaller change. But he also wants the minor change to be merged into your work for the larger change. Maybe you are working on the large task in a separate folder containing a copy of the website. Now you have to figure out how to do the minor change in a way that can be deployed quickly. You work furiously and get it done. The client calls back with further refinement requests. You do this too and deploy it. All is well. Now you have to merge it into the work in progress for the major change. What did you change for the urgent work? You were working too fast to keep notes. And you can't just diff the two directories easily now that both have changes relative to the baseline you started from. The above scenario shows that source control can be a great tool, even if you work solo. You can use branches to work on longer-term tasks and then merge the branch back into the main line when it's done. You can compare whole sets of files to other branches or to past revisions to see what's different. You can track work over time (which is great for reporting and invoicing by the way). You can recover any revision of any file based on date or on a milestone that you defined. For solo work, Subversion or Git is recommended. Anyone is free to prefer one or the other, but either is clearly better than not using any version control. Good books are " Pragmatic Version Control using Subversion, 2nd Edition " by Mike Mason or " Pragmatic Version Control Using Git " by Travis Swicegood.
