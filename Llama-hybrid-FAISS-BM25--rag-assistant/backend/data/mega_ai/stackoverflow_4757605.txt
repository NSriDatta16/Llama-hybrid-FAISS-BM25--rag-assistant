as far as is know (nd if i havn't missunderstood your question), you can't - you'll have to override styles for your paragraphs or other child elements. i would do it like this: /* for direct text-nodes */ body{ color: red; } /* maybe its possible to use "body *" here, wich sounds like what you need, but i've never tested this */ body p{ color: black; /* "default" value here*/ }
