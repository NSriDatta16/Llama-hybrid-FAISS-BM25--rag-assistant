Try something like this. I think it is the right approach private void createGpsListner() { gpsListener = new LocationListener(){ public void onLocationChanged(Location location) { curLocation = location; // check if locations has accuracy data if(curLocation.hasAccuracy()) { // Accuracy is in rage of 20 meters, stop listening we have a fix if(curLocation.getAccuracy()
