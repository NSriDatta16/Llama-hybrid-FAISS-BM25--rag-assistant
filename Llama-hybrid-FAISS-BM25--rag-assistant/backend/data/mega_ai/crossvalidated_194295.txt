Several comments: The fundamental difference between the bayesian and frequentist statistician is that the bayesian is willing to extend the tools of probability to situations where the frequentist wouldn't. More specifically, the bayesian is willing to use probability to model the uncertainty in her own mind over various parameters. To the frequentist, these parameters are scalars (albeit scalars where the statistician does not know the true value). To the Bayesian, various parameters are represented as random variables! This is extremely different. The Bayesian's uncertainty over parameters valeus is represented by a prior . In Bayesian statistics, the hope is that after observing data, the posterior overwhelms the prior, that the prior doesn't matter. But this often isn't the case: results may be sensitive to the choice of prior! Different Bayesians with different priors need not agree on the posterior. A key point to keep in mind is that statements of the frequentist statistician are statements that any two Bayesians can agree on, regardless of their prior beliefs! The frequentist does not comment on priors or posteriors, merely the likelihood. The statements of the frequentist statistician in some sense are less ambitious, but the bolder statements of the Bayesian can significantly rely on the assignment of a prior. In situations where priors matter and where there is disagreement on priors, the more limited, conditional statements of frequentist statistics may stand on firmer ground.
