use a variable to access $_POST

I have a form with a lot of textareas. ... Don't ask why we need 54 questions. I want to print them out but don't want to do it manually. $i = 1; while ($i "; $i++; } The result of that code is: Question 1: Any assistance or even a point in the general direction would be great. Thanks in advance. It may not be the most elegant solution but it works... $i = 1; while ($i "; $i++; }
