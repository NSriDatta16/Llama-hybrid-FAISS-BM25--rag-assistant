Usually we will agree which bugs have to be fixed for a particular release, and then define an time frame for fixing all the bugs. For each individual bug there is a lot of uncertainty/variability in how long it could take to fix but that tends to average out with a larger number of bugs. For certain bugs that you know will take longer it may be possible to give some estimates, e.g. if you need to write a simulator or a test framework for it.
