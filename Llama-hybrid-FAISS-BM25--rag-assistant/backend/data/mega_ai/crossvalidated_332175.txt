A recent method DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA) has been proposed by Petitjean et al. to average time series. In an other paper they proved empirically and theoretically how it can be used to cluster time series with k-means. An implementation is provided on GitHub by the authors ( link to code ). 1 F.
