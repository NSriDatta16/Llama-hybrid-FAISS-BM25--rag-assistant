This might help on sheding some light on marginal distribution calculation. Also, I would recommend to use a method through power posteriors introduced by Friel and Pettitt . This approach seems quite promissing, although it has some limitations. Or you could you Laplace approximation of posterior distribution by normal distribution: if histogram from MCMC looks symmetric and normal-like, than this could be quite good approximation.
