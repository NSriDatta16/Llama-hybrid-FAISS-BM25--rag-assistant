The Express editions are the full, regular SQL Server core code - so from that point, there's no performance difference. Sure, the Enterprise edition has a few additional goodies, like indexed views and so forth, which might make things faster. But for the normal, average SQL query, there's no significant performance difference to be expected. SQL Server Express editions also have some limitations, such as supporting only a single CPU (core), max. of 1 GB of RAM, max of 4 GB of database size. But unless your query would exceed any of those limits, I don't see any reason why SQL Server Express would be any slower than SQL Server Enterprise edition.
