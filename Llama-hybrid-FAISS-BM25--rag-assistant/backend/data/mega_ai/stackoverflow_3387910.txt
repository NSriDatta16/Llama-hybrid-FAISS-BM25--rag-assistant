You are correct, swapping the declarations is required to keep MIDL happy. OleView.exe indeed won't generate declarations in the original order. I think it groups them by kind, the way the type lib is organized. The message you are getting is just a warning, not an error. It is caused by having an alias for the structure name that's different. You can safely ignore it because code won't use the "tagImportFileResult" identifier. But you can get rid of it by making the tag name the same as the typedef name: typedef [..] struct ImportFileResult { //... } ImportFileResult; Here's a KB article on the subject.
