A good intro to computational linguistics?

I have a pretty good background in data analysis and statistics in the social sciences, including both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, and I have recently been introduced to computational linguistics. I think this would be a really good thing for me to learn, especially as I'm trying to come up with computational ways to analyze political discourse and political arguments. However, I've come across maybe 5 different terms for what I think I'm trying to learn, all with their own books and websites. Might someone be able to point be in the direction of a good starting place for someone just learning about this field? EDIT: Thank you so much to those of you that have responded!
