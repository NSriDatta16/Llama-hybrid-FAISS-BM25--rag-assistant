In our last evaluation, Perforce beat subversion in its support for branching and integrating changes between branches. Work was underway on Subversion to remedy this short-coming, but we haven't been back to check it out. In Perforce, when you branch a file, Perforce "remembers" where it came from and which revisions have been "integrated" into the two versions. It also has some storage optimizations in the repository so that a branch copy doesn't really materialize until someone makes a change in the branch, and then (if I understand correctly), it uses diffs against the base copy, just like revisions within a branch. Perforce's tracking of the relationships between branches is a huge asset. If Subversion has implemented this now, please give me a heads up.
