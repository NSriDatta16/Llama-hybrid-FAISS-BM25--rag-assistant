PostgreSQL joined tables with null condition variable

I've a problem with my sql query in PostgreSQL while I'm trying to join a lot of tables. In section 'WHERE' I've a few conditions where I'm comparing some id values, e.g. operator.agent_id = app.operator_id; When every id has no null value, everything works, but in case even one id equals null, when query result is empty. Can I obtain such a result, that if one id equals null, then only values from this table are null, but rest is correct ? To be more specific, I'm programming in Java, using EJB3: stringQuery = "SELECT .... FROM ... WHERE..."; Query query = entityManager.createNativeQuery(stringQuery); List objects = query.getResultList();
