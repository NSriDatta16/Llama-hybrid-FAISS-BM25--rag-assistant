On ARIMA and its implementation

I am interested in ARMA/ARIMA models. First off, is there any material online about how to identify such models? It is done via acf and pacf, but I find the material I found online somewhat misleading. I would like to have a set of rule of thumbs I can use for that. Secondly, do you know of any C++ library, equivalent to R for time series? Finally, is it possible to include dependency across different time series? For example, suppose we know that series $\{x\}_n$ depends upon series $\{y\}_n$. How would I include this when using ARIMA models?
