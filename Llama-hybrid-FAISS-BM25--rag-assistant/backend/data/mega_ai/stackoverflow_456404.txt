Who would create such a thing? Who would use it? Near as i can tell, you're talking about a library of application designs. The people disposed to sharing such detailed designs are already doing so - in the form of open specifications or open source. The former tends to attract mostly people and organizations already involved in creating products that implement such specs, or products that inter-operate with systems that do. The latter... well, why bother re-implementing the design when you can just hack the source? As Mark Harrison notes , there are plenty of companies willing to promote their designs for common business systems. "Buy our system, and just bolt on the functionality necessary for your organization", they'll tell you; "why waste time re-implementing something we've already done?" There's really very little motivation for them to share detailed implementation specs, since they really don't want you re-implementing what they're trying to sell you. Finally... These things really just aren't that complicated. Or rather, they are... but the complexity is born out of size, out of the myriad combinations of arcane requirements that any given organization might impose upon the system. The real work comes in interpreting these requirements, building them into the base system - and tedious though it may be, it's unavoidable.
