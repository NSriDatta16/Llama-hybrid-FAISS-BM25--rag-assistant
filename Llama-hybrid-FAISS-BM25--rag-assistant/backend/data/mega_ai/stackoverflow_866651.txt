Some information about alarm() and setitimer() can be found here . Note that the upcall function is a signal handler, so it is subject to all of the limitations and restrictions associated with signal handlers as described in great detail here . As noted in the first link, alarm() is POSIX-based, setitimer() is not (although it is more flexible).
