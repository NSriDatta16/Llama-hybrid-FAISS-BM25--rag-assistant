Start and end period in each fact within a data warehouse

I have been asked to add a new table to our data warehouse. Currently, we separate our facts into monthly, quarterly, and yearly tables, with time dimensions for each. Each fact record has one time value. The data is generated in the source system by start and end period, and the end date becomes the time dimension value of the fact record. The flow of the fact into either the month, quarter, or year fact table tells one how to understand the dates in the records and how to use them. I've been asked to have the new table contain start and end dates in each record. I have been told that this violates a data warehousing principle, but it better represents the way the data is generated and allows for more flexible querying of the data, e.g. for rolling periods, etc. I'm no data warehouse expert. I understand that a single time dimension per fact is a principle. My question is, what are the ramifications of breaking that principle? In other words, what are the arguments against doing so? What problems might I face in the future in doing so? It seems to me that having the start and end periods for each fact does better represent the data, but I admit that I don't know enough to fully evaluate the implications of this design choice. Can anyone perhaps provide some prespective? Edit: I appreciate these answers. They at least tell me it isn't as bad a practice as I was led to believe. I will clarify one thing about the dates: They don't represent a period of validity, but rather a period of aggregation. Thus, a fact record may represent an average of pounds used of a certain ingredient as calculated for an arbitrary period of months. Don't know if this makes any difference, but there it is.
