Need help setting up multilevel logistic regression

I am trying to see the effect of a certain intervention in schools. The outcome variable is binary. We have students within schools. Also students' age is a covariate (doesn't changed before and after treatment). Would the following model be correct? \begin{align} {\rm logit}(p[i]) &\leftarrow \alpha_{\rm school[i]} + \beta_{\rm intervention}\times t[i] + \beta_{\rm age} \times {\rm age}[\rm student[i]], \\ i &= 1,\ldots,N_{\rm students} \\ \alpha_j &\sim N(\mu,\sigma_{\rm between\ schools}^2), \\ j &= 1,\ldots,N_{\rm schools} \end{align} Does this look correct? EDIT: t is 0 (before intervention) or 1(after intervention). There is typically 2 observations per student (1 before, 1 after the intervention), but it is possible that some data is missing, i.e. only 1 observation in some students. EDIT2: Bonus question about implementation. I am new to lme4. Would it be correct to implement the model as follows in R: require(lme4) glmer(outcome ~ t + age + (1|school) + (1|student))
