With NCover you can create an attribute and then tell NCover to ignore that attribute. In our projects, we have defined this attribute (no namespace, so it is easy to use): public class CoverageExcludeAttribute : Attribute { } We use NAnt, so we have a target that looks like this: Question 9 in the NCover FAQ describes this method. We based our solution on this. Alternatively, you can use the exclude feature of the NCoverExplorer to exclude namespaces and assemblies from the final report. This merely removes the data from the report, but the end result is the same. We use both techniques.
