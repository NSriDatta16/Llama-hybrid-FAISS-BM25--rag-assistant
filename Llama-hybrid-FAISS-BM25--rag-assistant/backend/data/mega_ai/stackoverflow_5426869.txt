How to directly RUN a function inside a controller class via cron?

In magento i tried to setup cron as following. 0 1 * * * Here it calls model but how can i directly call a function inside the controller. For example class Mage_Adminhtml_Inchoo_BirthdayController extends Mage_Adminhtml_Controller_Action { public function sendAction($strFname) { // this has to be called from cron in magento. } } How i can directly call the sendAction action function inside the above controller from cron. In other words how this sendAction initiated from cron directly. I have to run the conroller function directly instead of model. Please help me
