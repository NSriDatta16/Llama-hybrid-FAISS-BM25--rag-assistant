In what format are your input texts provided? If it is HTML then use a library that selects (for instance) from the Document Object Model DOM all paragraphs following "Requirements". In javascript you could use jQuery, or on the linux command line you could use the xmllint binary (which uses xml2 internally). Many other libraries are available. If it is PDF then doing this is more difficult. After that you could do some bag-of-words modeling as user "Borhan Kazimipour" has suggested in another answer. Or you could topic-model them. Probabilistic Topic Modeling is a more difficult technique which would take me at least a week to re-learn the principles of, and to get familiar with available command line tools and libraries.
