I assume all the instances have equal length. This is why you can try neural network or SVM. As you mentioned, neural network and SVM is not explicitly considering the dependencies on the evens of the sequence. For sequential model, Markov Chain or Hidden Markov model are widely used and can be used to model variable length sequences.
