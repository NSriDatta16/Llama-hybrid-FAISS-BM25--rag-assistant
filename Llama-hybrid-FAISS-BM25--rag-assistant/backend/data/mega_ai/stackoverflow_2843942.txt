MindFusion offers components for diagramming that you can access programmatically. They offer components for WPF and WinForms: WPFDiagram - WPF FlowChart.NET - WinForms In the past I've used their WPF component on a DSL editor project. Based on Toolbox drag-and-drops in the DSL editor, WPFDiagram was called to create shapes on the Drawing Surface.
