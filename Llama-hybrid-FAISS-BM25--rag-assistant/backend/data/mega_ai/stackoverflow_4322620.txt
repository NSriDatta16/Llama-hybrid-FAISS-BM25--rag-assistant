Drupal - rules - if URL is present

Ive setup the following rule in Drupal: NOT condition - Logged in user has his Profile created DO condition - Redirect user to profile creation page But I only want this rule to run, if the following is present in the URL. user?destination=og%2Fsubscribe%2F67 ( this forwards users to the group after the register, o allow the to reqest a join) The reason for wanting this, is because I also have logintoboggan setup, which forwards all new user to a specific page, after registration, which takes them through their setup. But I dont want users who have been asked to join a group, to follow this same procudure, which is why I have setup the rule. But unfortunatelly the rule overrides logintoboggan. Which is why I want to somehow tell the rules module to only run this rule, when "user?destination=og" is present in the URL Any help would be greatly appreciated
