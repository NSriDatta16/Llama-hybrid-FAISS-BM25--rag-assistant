What's the probability of not finding a subsequence in a sequence?

I was trying to solve the following problem: Given a sequence of n letters sampled (randomly, with possible repetitions, and equal probability) from an alphabet having v letters, what is the expected value of the fraction of all possible substrings of length 2 with 0 counts over all the possible substrings of length 2? For example, let's say I have a word of 10 letters. On average, how many substrings/words of 2 letters will not be found in the word (over all possible words of 2 letters)? Considering the word ABCDEFGHIJ, here we found the subsequence AB, BC, CD.. but not AC, AD, AZ and so on. My question is, on average, how many words of length 2 will not be present in a word of n letters? Thanks a lot!
