Since you seen to care about retrieval time over other concerns (such as space), I suggest you use a hashtable and you enter your items several times, once per subkey. So you'd put("10,20,30,40",mydata), then put("20,30,40",mydata) and so on (of course this would be a method, you're not going to manually call put so many times).
