Okay, i think there isn't any cool answer, so what about that "hack"? ${filecomment} ${package_declaration} ${typecomment} import invalid;/* ${type_declaration} */ final class ${type_name} { } If you now hit Control + Shift + O to organize imports, the old type declaration disappears. You could also add organize imports to save action to automate. I know it's bad, but it does what you want.
