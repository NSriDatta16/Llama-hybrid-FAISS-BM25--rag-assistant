You should do step selection by step selection this work on AIC and tries to improve it continuously. In step selection you must try both(which dies combination of backward and forward selection both). Once you get the final model with improved performance.. You can attempt predictions. And then further improve accuracy and f1 scores by changing the cutoff value. If you are looking to improve the performance further, go for XGBOOST.
