Magento create category with soap v2

I want to crate categories in Magento with a webservice request (soap v2). I use Magento 1.4.2.0 and as I said the v2 of magentos soap api. If I send the request I get the following error as response: 103 Attribute "include_in_menu" is required. The problem is, that the xml tag "include_in_menu" is not available in the request. If I add this tag manually it will be ignored. What can I do, if I don't want to use soap v.1? Greetings LStrike PS: This is my request: name price name 1
