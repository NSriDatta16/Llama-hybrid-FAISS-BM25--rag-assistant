How to check if a file is open for writing on windows in python?

We have a process here at work where an input file is created by SAS. That input file is then read by a legacy application and that legacy application creates results. SAS then reads the results and summarizes them. A non-programmer usually takes care of these actions one by one. So the person just creates the input file. They know when it is done, and then they run the legacy application, and they know when that is done. Then they run the summary program. I have a situation where my boss wants to run about 100 variations. I have access to 3 or 4 computers that share a network drive. Here is my plan: Use computer A, I start creating the 100 input files, one by one. Using computer B, I run the legacy program on each input file. I would like to start running the program when input is ready. So if input1 is done being created on computer A, I want to run the legacy application on input1 on computer B while input2 is being created on computer A. I know python best, so I will probably use python to glue all of this together. Now I know there is a lot of things I could do, but I think this approach is adequate and will allow me to just get the job done for the time being. I don't really have time to design and test a very elegant solution that would take advantage of all the cores on all the machines or use a database to help me synchronize all of this. I appreciate suggestions like this, but I really just want to know if there is a way, in python, to tell if a file on a network drive is open for writing by any application on any computer? If not, I will probably just come up with a dumb way to create an indicator that the job is done - like create a file "doneA" where if it exists, it means the "input1" file is complete. For example. I would add a step to the sas program that creates an indicator file after the input file has been created. Sorry for the really long explanation, but I just don't want you to waste your time offering alternate solutions that I probably will not be able to implement. I have read this question and its responses. I don't think I can use anything like lsof b/c these files would be open on different computers.
