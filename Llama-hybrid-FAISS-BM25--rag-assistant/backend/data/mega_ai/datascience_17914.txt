Has a past data outside sliding window any Influence on learning of a LSTM?

I am getting into LSTM and I have one technical question. I have time series in 1 minute interval and 2 weeks data. I need predict every next minute in the future. One sliding window has 120 minutes length. My question is, if " the past data outside of one sliding window" has an influence on training and testing in current window of a LSTM ? Different way - could be the sliding windows from the 2 weeks mixed randomly for training ( out of any order) ? Thank`s.
