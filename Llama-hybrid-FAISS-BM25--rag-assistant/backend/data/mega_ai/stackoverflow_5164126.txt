Retain the Fragment object while rotating

I have developed an app in Honeycomb and I am using fragments. This is my app I have an Activity (Say A1) and in that there is a fragment Initially this fragment hold the object one fragment object say (F1) Then depending on the user actions it may change to other objects F2,F3 .... What my problem is When The user rotate the device the activity is recreated and which make F1 as the fragment object even though before rotating it wasn't What is the way to retain the fragment object while rotating? I used setRetainInstance(true); but it didn't work for me And I have added the fragment by code in my onCreate function like this @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction(); Fragment homeFragment = new Home(); fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.mainFragement, homeFragment); fragmentTransaction.commit(); }
