To learn Ruby, read "The Well-Grounded Rubyist" by David Black . It is extremely clear, well-written, and well-organized. The best technical book I've ever read (out of maybe a dozen, since I'm a relatively new programmer). To learn Rails, read " Head First Rails ." They explain how all the mysterious parts work together. Be patient with the silliness and work your way through the examples - it will pay off. (Also, for consistency, use whatever version of Rails they use. You can upgrade later.) Both of these books assume little to no knowledge on your part, regarding OOP programming and MVC architecture. If you do know a bit, don't skim, because you might assume things incorrectly. (For instance, Ruby objects don't have public attributes, only getters and setters. But you can automatically create multiple getters/setters with a single line like attr_accessor :attr1, :attr2, :attr3 .)
