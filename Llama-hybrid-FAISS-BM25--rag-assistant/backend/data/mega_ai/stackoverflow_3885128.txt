Embedding images in a Rails Builder generated RSS feed

I'm currently building an RSS feed for my Rails application using Builder (the wealth of tutorials out there for doing it this way helped), but become a little bit stuck when it comes to adding an image alongside it (which has been uploaded via Paperclip), like a lot of the top publications do. I'm currently using this to make the text appear as it should in a reader: xml.description do xml.cdata!page.description.gsub(/\n/, ' ') end So how would I go about including an image in the feed when I normally display them in a @page.assets.each do |asset| block. Thanks.
