It really depends on the size and structure of your team, as well as how your projects are organized. Personally, I prefer to start with one project and one repository and break up the projects into folders or separate branches. This allows you to keep all of the code in one place, while still allowing everyone to work on individual projects. You can then set up separate dev, stage, and main branches related to the individual projects. This will allow you to keep track of the development process, while still keeping the code centralized. Hope it helps you!
