Coefficient sign changes in fixed effect and first-difference estimation

I have a large empirical panel, where I basically want to regress the standard deviation of (equity) returns ($y_{it}$) of firm i at time t, on leverage (equity/debt) of firm i at time t ($x_{it}$). Further I would like to control for the equity size of the firm ($z_{it}$). Unfortunately the $\beta$ coefficient sign changes (significant in both specifications) if I run the following two models: Fixed Effects Model: $$ y_{it} = a_{i} + \beta * x_{it} + c * z_{it} + u_{it}$$ First-Difference Model: $$ \Delta y_{it} = \beta * \Delta x_{it} + c * \Delta z_{it} + \Delta u_{it}$$ Since I only have basic knowledge about econometrics and my colleagues are also puzzled, I was hoping that some statistic guys might help me. I identified some potentially problems (but there might be more): $y_{it}$ might be autocorrelated Since leverage is defined as Debt/Equity, controlling for equity brings some potential problems The true question now is: Which model (if any) is econometrically correct?
