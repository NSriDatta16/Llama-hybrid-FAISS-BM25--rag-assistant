As always a competent answer... thank you! This is a real show-stopper to use Scala in a JavaEE application. Changing the annotation is not an option for me. I wonder why it worked with Scala 2.7x. On this page the author implements the annotation like this: @Remote {val value = Array(classOf[ITest])} class TestBean extends ITest { ... Which seems to work. Unfortunately, Scala 2.7x is also not an option for me...
