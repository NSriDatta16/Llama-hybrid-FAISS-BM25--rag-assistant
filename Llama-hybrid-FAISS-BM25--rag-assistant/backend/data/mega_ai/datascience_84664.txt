Role of Image Resolution in Deep Learning

I have multiple image datasets about the same topic that I want to use for a classification task utilizing Deep Learning. The datasets differ in the resolution of images (i.e. some pictures are 128x128px, some 512x512, others 2048x2048). If I used the dataset with the highest resolution for training my intuition would be that it'll be harder to classify images with a lower resolution as the network learns patterns that it may not recognize in lower resolution pictures. On the other hand, if I use the low resolution dataset for training, the patterns learnt are more crude and it performs better on any new data as higher resolution images can be scaled down easily. Is my intuition right or am I missing something? What would be the best approach in my case for selecting proper training data?
