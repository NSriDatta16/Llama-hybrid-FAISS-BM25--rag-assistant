I am not sure what you exactly call "online machine learning", but anyway we can think in two situations when a new data comes. For instance, suppose that your objective is to calculate the average of a set of points. Before the arriving of the new point, suppose that the average is $\overline x$ : 1) One possibility is to evaluate the average in the usual way: $\sum_{i=1}^{N+1}\frac{x_i}{N+1}$ 2) Another possibility is to calculate the $\overline x= \frac{1}{N+1}x_{N+1} + \frac{N}{N+1} \overline x$ . I would call the second case "online learning", since you only update the last point. Note that in both cases the average is the same. In general, all models that are a gradient based method (the parameters are evaluated using the gradient method) may estimated using online learning.
