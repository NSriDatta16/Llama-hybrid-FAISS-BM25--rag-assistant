Visual C++ TDD setup

I haven't worked much with Visual Studio before. I've started a personal project in my spare time and I would like to use test-driven development since it has been a huge benefit to me in my Java development. I started this project quite a while ago, and I used CppUnit. I know there are probably other frameworks that are better, but this is what's already in place. My Visual Stuido 2005 solution has 2 projects in it. It worked fine when the unit tests resided right alongside the application code. As the project grew in size, this became quite cumbersome and inelegant. I created a new project under my solution to house the unit tests (so it now has 3 projects). Everything went fine until I tried to build the solution. Everything compiled, but the unit test project failed to link. The output gives me 51 "unresolved external symbol" errors (LNK2019) for what seems like every function that my tests call. As far as I can deduce, the problem is the directory structure that Visual Studio creates. Each project gets its own directory, and then below that are the object files and executables that get created. I think the problem is that, while the header files are properly included in each unit test, the linker can't find the cpp files because they are in a different directory. When it fails to find the implementation of a called function, it gives me the 2019 error. Am I right in my evaluation of the problem? How can I fix it? Do I need to completely reorganize my projects or is it a simple configuration of the linker? Thanks
