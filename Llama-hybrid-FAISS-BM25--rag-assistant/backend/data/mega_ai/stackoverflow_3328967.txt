The solutions posed above require retrieval of the entire document in order to search, replace, and highlight text. If the document is large, and many are, this seems like a really bad idea. Better would be for MySQL FTS to return the text offsets directly like SQLITE does, then use an indexed substring operator - that would be significantly more efficient.
