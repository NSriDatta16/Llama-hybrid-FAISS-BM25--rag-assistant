Rails, paperclip, uploading a photo from a rake task?

How can I upload a file with paperclip via the console or a in a rake task? I'm a little unsure how this works without a form. Has anyone dealt with this? update So I found this: image = Image.new(:storage => File.open('/path/to/my/image.png', rb)) But I guess this makes my question a little simpler, say my photo was actually online (at varying domains) and I wanted to take it with paperclip and transform it and upload it to my server. Is it possible to somehow give File.open a url?
