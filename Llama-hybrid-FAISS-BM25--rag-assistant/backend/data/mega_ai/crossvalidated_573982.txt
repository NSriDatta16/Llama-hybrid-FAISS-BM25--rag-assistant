Compounding Gamma with Gamma to yield F-distribution?

I am working through some problems from my Bayesian Statistics course and am having trouble understanding a step in the solution to a question. For reference this is the question: And here is the solution: In particular I am having trouble understanding the step where the integral disappears and the multiple of the Gamma functions becomes the beta function. I am aware of the relation $$ \Gamma(a)\Gamma(b) = \mathrm{B}(a,b)\Gamma(a+b) $$ but I cannot see how this has been applied as there is no $\Gamma(a+b)$ term present. I am also unsure of how the integral has been evaluated and would appreciate any explanation or help with this. Thanks
