Instead of spectral features and moving average, I would recommend wavelet features. You could either do a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) or a Short Wavelet Transform (SWT) and identify the peaks / drop where the potholes show up. The advantage with wavelet is that it is well resistant to noise and you can also preserve the time axis information to pin point the location of peaks. The trick is just to choose an appropriate wavelet. Those which have spike shapes like Daubechies and Symlets would be ideal. With proper feature extraction, you can even do the detection without machine learning.
