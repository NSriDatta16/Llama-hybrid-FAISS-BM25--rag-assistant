The Java code doesn't need to change: if Saxon9.3 is on the classpath, it should load it and use it automatically. But if you want to be 100% confident that Saxon gets loaded (which is probably a good idea if the code uses XSLT 2.0 or Saxon extensions) then change the line TransformerFactory transFact javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance(); to TransformerFactory transFact = new net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl();
