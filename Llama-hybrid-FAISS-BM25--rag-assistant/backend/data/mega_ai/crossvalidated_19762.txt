There are so many different ways of optimizing (clustering + sparsity + independence) that you'll have to describe your combination of these in more detail to get better answers. Can you point to an example of what you want ? Is your input sparse ? What are Nsample, Nfeature, Nclass, roughly ? There's Sparse PCA , see e.g. scikit-learn SparsePCA . (By the way, Independent component analysis is something else.) Added: with only 11 variables, make 11 runs leaving out one at a time and pick the best => e.g. leave out x3; then 10 runs leaving out one at a time => e.g. leave out x8; and so on. (There are much fancier methods.)
