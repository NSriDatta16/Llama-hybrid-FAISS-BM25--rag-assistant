Multithreading with Inheritance (C++)

I am trying to call the "Run" function in a new thread. Right now, I have this code using openMP that doesn't actually run "Run" in a new thread. NOTE: I am not asking for help using OpenMP. This code was just a quick fix. I would prefer a CreateThread() method of going about this. vector * commands; string strInput; // For each command... for(vector ::iterator i = commands->begin(); i != commands->end(); ++i) { // ...if the current command we're examining is valid... if((*i)->ContainsCommand(strInput)) { // ...run it in a new thread and don't let ZChatInput handle it normally... #pragma omp sections nowait { #pragma omp section (*i)->Run(strInput); #pragma omp section bRet = false; } // ...and don't check any more commands. break; } } So how would this be done using just standard and STL? Of course, I'm looking for a way that works :)
