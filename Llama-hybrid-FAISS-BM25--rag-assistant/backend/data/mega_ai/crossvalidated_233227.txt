When a distribution is only defined by its moment generating function $\phi(t)=\mathbb{E}[\exp\{tX\}]$ or by its characteristic function $\Phi(t)=\mathbb{E}[\exp\{itX\}]$ , it is rare to find ways of generating from those distributions. A relevant example is made of $\alpha$ -stable distributions , which have no known form for density or cdf, no moment generating function, but a closed form characteristic function. In Bayesian statistics, posterior distributions associated with intractable likelihoods or simply datasets that are too large to fit in one computer can been seen as impossible to (exactly) simulate.
