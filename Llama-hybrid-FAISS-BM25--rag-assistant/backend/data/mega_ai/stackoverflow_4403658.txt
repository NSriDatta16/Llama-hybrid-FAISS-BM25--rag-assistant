I think to get any kind of reliable result you would have to modify your test slightly. Maybe you could start the Stopwatch, loop a 1000 times calling your fill method, stop the Stopwatch and then simply divide your result by 1000 to get an average. Results can change drastically for a number of reasons (e.g other processes and/or threads eating up CPU or the .NET Garbage Collection running). Peforming a test multiple times and taking an average will help smoothe out any discrepancies.
