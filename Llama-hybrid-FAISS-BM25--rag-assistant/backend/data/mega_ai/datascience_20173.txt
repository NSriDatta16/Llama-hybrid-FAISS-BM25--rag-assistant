Classifier runtime evaluation

I am looking for an example or tutorial of a system predicting numeric values by the use of various classifiers like SVM, Decision trees, ANN or KNN which optimises its choice of algorithm and parameter settings at runtime. Assuming there is unlimited input data and the system can train itself nonstop, the system should be able to adapt to different input data and choose the most accurate prediction setting as possible. Examples in Python, C++ or JAVA would be preferred. Thank you in advance!
