This is an old post but here's a paper worth considering: "Multidimensional curve fitting to unorganized data points by nonlinear minimization", Lian Fang and David C Gossard http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall05/Papers/fang95.pdf And for unordered points this paper is interesting. It describes a method of finding the order of points that are natural neighbors of each other: "Point Ordering with Natural Distance Based on Brownian Motion", Philsu Kim1 and Hyoungseok Kim2 http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2010/450460.pdf
