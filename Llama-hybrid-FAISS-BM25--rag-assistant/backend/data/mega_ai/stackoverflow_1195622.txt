Hold your horses on the sarcasm there, everybody. Peeking at http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js , the html5 shiv does successfully trick IE6/7 into doing a createElement(). In karbassi's case above, one would hope IE6/7 would first pay attention to the html5 shiv, then perform the jQuery append() as expected every time after that. It apparently doesn't do things in that order when appending to an append. This is handy to know.
