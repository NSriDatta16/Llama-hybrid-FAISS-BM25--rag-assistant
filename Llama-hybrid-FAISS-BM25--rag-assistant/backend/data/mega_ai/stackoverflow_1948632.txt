I'd bring to your attention the possibility of using svn+ssh instead of http. Once you set up your private/public keys, you won't have to type in passwords unless you set up one on your ssh agent. You will also not need to run a web server, just your ssh server which I assume you already have running. Check out this page and look for tunneling over SSH.
