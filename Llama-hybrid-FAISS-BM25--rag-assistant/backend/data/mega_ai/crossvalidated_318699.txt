A logistic regression finds some kind of (linear) relation between your independent and dependent variables. If your dependent variables always has the same value this seems superfluous, since all the variation is explained by a fixed value. Therefore, no variation is explained by your independent variables. This can hardly be the thing you are looking for. You should think about what you want to research, how this can be analysed and consequently how to assess your findings statistically.
