By doing PCA you are retaining all the important information. If your data exhibits clustering, this will be generally revealed after your PCA analysis: by retaining only the components with the highest variance, the clusters will be likely more visibile (as they are most spread out ). What you should do is to look at the scatterplot in the plan defined by your three principal components: the data should clearly be grouped in separated clusters. After you know the number of clusters, you can apply K-means algorithm to perform a classification of your dataset.
