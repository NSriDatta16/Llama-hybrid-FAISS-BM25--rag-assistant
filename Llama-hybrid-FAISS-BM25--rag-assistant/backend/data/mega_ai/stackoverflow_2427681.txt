Indesign and XML - how to auto flow into multiple pages with differing styles?

I've got a bit of a problem at the moment. I'm trying to work with indesign (cs3) and xml. Basically i have a template which is has 1 master dps, both pages have the same data (fields 1-5) but one is left aligned, one right - hence mildly different paragraph styles. What i want to be able to do is import xml and have indesign flow the data from the individual nodes into many pages. eg xml format: root day field1 field2 field3 field4 field5 day field1 field2 field3 field4 field5 day ... I can almost make this work by tagging the frames on the master pages, then creating pages and importing the xml, however it only flows the first 2 nodes into the pages reptitively for the total count of all the nodes. I can also almost make it work by creating a page from the untagged masters and then tagging the frames with the field1-5 tags then importing the xml. This populates the first page, however i then can't find a way to make the rest of the data flow into new pages... Am I missing something? Am I being a complete dumbass? If anyone can offer any help it will be greatly appreciated...
