Estimating stationarity of evolving distribution

Consider a probability distribution $P_t$ at time $t \in \mathbb{N}$ which evolves in time, but is assumed to become stationary at some unknown time $t_0$ , i.e $P_{t_0+1} = P_{t_0}$ To make matters worse, I do not know the actual probability distributions $P_t$ , but only the emperical distributions $\hat{P}_t$ which I can extract from time series data. My question is two-fold: How should I approach my problem, as stated? That is, how can I identify the point $t$ at which the marginal distributions stabilizes?
