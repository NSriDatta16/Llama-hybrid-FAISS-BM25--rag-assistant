accessing UIImage properties without loading the image in memory

As you know the iPhone guidelines discourage loading UIImage s that are greater than 1024x1024. The size of the images that I would have to load varies, and I would like to check the size of the image I am about to load; however using the .size property of UIImage requires the image to be loaded... which is exactly what I am trying to avoid. Is there something wrong in my reasoning or is there a solution?
