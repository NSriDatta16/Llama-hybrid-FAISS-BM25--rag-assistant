Is the offset_column parameter in H20's random forest algorithm the same as the offset option in SAS Proc Logistic?

I am trying to use H2O in R to run a random forest. http://docs.h2o.ai/h2oclassic/Ruser/rtutorial.html In the documentation, I saw that there is an option for an offset parameter but I cannot find much information about how it is leveraged. In logistic regression, I have used an offset in two ways: 1. To adjust for oversampling a binary event ( http://support.sas.com/kb/22/601.html ) 2. To do a two stage model where the first stage logit is calculated and then I used the logit score as an offset in the second stage so in effect the residual is modeled in stage two. I would like to replicate both of these through random forest, if possible, but did not think it was possible until I saw the offset parameter in the H2O implementation of Random Forest. Does anyone know if the H2O offset parameter functions the same as the offset option in SAS proc logistic?
