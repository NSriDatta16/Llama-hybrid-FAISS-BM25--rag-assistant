You don't need to change your interface to test these methods. Simply test the public interface thoroughly to ensure that all the private methods are tested: void Test1() { new SomeComplexClass(foo).SomeComplexCalcualation(1); } void Test2() { new SomeComplexClass(foo).SomeComplexCalcualation(2); } and so on... You can use a coverage tool (e.g. NCover for .NET) to ensure that all the code you wanted to test has actually been tested.
