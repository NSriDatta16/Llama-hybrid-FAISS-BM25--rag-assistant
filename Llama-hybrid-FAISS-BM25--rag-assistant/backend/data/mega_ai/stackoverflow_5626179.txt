looks like you're using JDO. the app engine JDO docs use this exact example - people and favorite foods - and they describe one recommended way to implement it: unowned many-to-many relationship . specifically, you'd first determine which side will generally have fewer related entities. in this case, the average Food will probably have more fans (millions) than the average Person will have favorite foods (tens to hundreds). put a key list property in Person, e.g. Set favoriteFoods , for their favorite foods. to get a person's favorite foods, you'd just load the Person entity (which costs one datastore get) and look at the favoriteFood set. to get a food's fans, you'd query for the Person entities whose favoriteFood property contains ( = in GQL) that food.
