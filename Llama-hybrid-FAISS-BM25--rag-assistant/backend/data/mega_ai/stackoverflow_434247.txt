This question is a good example of why "neural networks" do such an amazingly poor job of emulating the behavior of real-world neurons. Most real neurons have an intrinsic (or "natural") rate at which they fire action potentials, with no input from pre-synaptic neurons. The effect of pre-synaptic neurons is almost always to speed up or slow down this intrinsic firing rate, not to produce a single action potential in the post-synaptic neuron. Why don't "neural networks" typically model this phenomenon? I don't know - you'd have to ask the people for whom " the approach inspired by biology has more or less been abandoned for a more practical approach based on statistics and signal processing ".
