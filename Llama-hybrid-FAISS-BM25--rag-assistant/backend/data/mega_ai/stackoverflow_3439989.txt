Not sure which approach is more expensive, but component based approach is definitely easier to implement. All you have to do is to create your own component, override paint and contains methods. Add it to the specific position in the container (using absolute layout or any other depending on your needs). Your listeners will become part of your new component providing components behavior. From the design and program organization point of view this is much more superior approach.
