Maybe not the answer you want, but you could just download the git-manpages-*.tar.gz and git-html-*.tar.gz that are published along with the source. They're published because the asciidoc toolchain is known to be a bit fragile, and a considerable effort to get everything installed and arranged. You'd need, I believe, possibly a whole pack of docbook support files. Maybe some stylesheets as well... although if you have xmlto installed you should have got all these.
