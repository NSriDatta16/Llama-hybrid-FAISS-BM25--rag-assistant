The difference between dog and cat is a little more than just "style". Of course "style" itself is not really well defined, but generally I would think the difference between dog and cat is more content than style. CycleGAN is a general framework for translating between two domains. It works on unpaired data (that is, for each cat image, you don't have a dog image where the dog is in the exact same location in the exact same pose).
