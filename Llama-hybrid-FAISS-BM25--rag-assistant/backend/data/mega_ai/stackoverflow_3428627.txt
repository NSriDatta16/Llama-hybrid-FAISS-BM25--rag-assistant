Cookies are a start, but they can easily be cleared and they might not be enabled. A more robust solution would be to use other forms of local storage and fallback to cookies if they are not available. Some of your other options are: HTML5 Local Storage Flash Persistent Storage IE local storage Google Gears Cookies It would be a pain to implement this if someone hadn't already done it for you. Checkout Persist-Js if you feel that cookies aren't enough. It's probably overkill for just detecting a new user, but if you're not happy with cookies then this provides you with some more options.
