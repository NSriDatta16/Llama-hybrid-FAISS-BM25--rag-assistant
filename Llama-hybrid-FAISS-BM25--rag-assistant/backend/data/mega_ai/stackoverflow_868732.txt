I am not sure im understanding your question, so correct me if i am off base. You should organize your schemas as their own assembly that can be independently deployed to all the applications that need it. They can then be referenced by other projects during development. After deployment if changes are made to the schemas; the schema assembly just has to be updated on the server; the reference to the schema from the applications will be maintained. hope this helps.
