What parameters can be fixed in a hierarchical model when the outcome is standardized?

Suppose I have unstandardized data and estimate a 2-level Bayesian hierarchical model with varying intercepts and no covariates. The grand mean $\alpha_i$ and within- $i$ variance of the outcome $\sigma_y$ are estimated since I assign them priors. $$y_{it} \sim N(\alpha_0 + \alpha_{i}, \sigma_y) \\ \alpha_{i} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\alpha})\\ \alpha_0 \sim N(0,1)\\ \sigma_{\alpha} \sim Exp(0.1)\\ \sigma_y \sim Exp(0.1)\\ $$ Suppose I standardized the outcome vector $y_{it}$ to mean 0 and variance of 1. In this case, $\alpha_0$ and $\sigma_y$ are known. Given this information, my inclination is to fix these parameters. Accordingly, I could write the model as: $$y_{it} \sim N(\alpha_{i},1) \\ \alpha_{i} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\alpha})\\ \sigma_{\alpha} \sim Exp(0.1)\\ $$ While removing $\alpha_0$ seems warranted, can I do this for $\sigma_y$ ? The decomposition of the variance in $y$ into a within ( $\sigma_y$ )and between ( $\sigma_{\alpha}$ ) seems to be lost in the process.
