The strategy it to split your application to a different logical layers abstracting the data storage layer from the business logic and UI. So a simple example will be to have: Data Layer - your database engine; Data Access Layer - code which will know how to read and manipulate data from the Data Layer; Business Layer - will know how to represent Data Access Layer object within your data domain; Presentation Layer - to display/edit Business Layer objects. For not very complex domains you can use technologies like LINQ to SQL or ADO.NET Entity Framework to act as 2-3 layers.
