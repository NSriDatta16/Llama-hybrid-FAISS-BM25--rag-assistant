Where/How to start?

I want to create an application that recognises diseases from images, I know this require databases of images and image segmentation but where do I start? What should I start learning? I know nothing about data science but I want to learn. I am familiar with language like C, C#, Python3, Java. As a beginner myself I think many people would be interested to know how to begin and what to do.
