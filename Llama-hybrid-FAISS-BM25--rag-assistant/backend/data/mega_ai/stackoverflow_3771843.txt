i agree with rachel, because in K&B book it is directly mentioned that overloading does not belong to polymorphism in chapter 2(object orientation). But in lots of places i found that overloading means static polymorphism because it is compile time and overriding means dynamic polymorphism because it s run time. But one interesting thing is in a C++ book (Object-Oriented Programming in C++ - Robert Lafore) it is also directly mentioned that overloading means static polymorphism. But one more thing is there java and c++ both are two different programing languages and they have different object manipulation techniques so may be polymorphism differs in c++ and java ?
