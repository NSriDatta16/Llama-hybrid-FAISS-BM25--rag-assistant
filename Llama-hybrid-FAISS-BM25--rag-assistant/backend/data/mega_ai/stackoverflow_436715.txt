What is NV32ts and its SQL Injection Attack trying to do?

I have been getting a number of attacks on my website lately, with a User-Agent of NV32ts. They all are some variation of the following injection attacks against a querystring variable (where 99999 represents a valid querystring value, the attack is appended to the value): (For convenience I have urldecoded the following attacks) 999999 And char(124)+(Select Cast(Count(1) as varchar(8000))+char(124) From [sysobjects] Where 1=1)>0 or 999999' And char(124)+(Select Cast(Count(1) as varchar(8000))+char(124) From [sysobjects] Where 1=1)>0 and ''=' or 999999' And char(124)+(Select Cast(Count(1) as varchar(8000))+char(124) From [sysobjects] Where 1=1)>0 and ''=' I believe that sysobjects has something to do with the Sql Server master database, but I can't figure out what they are trying to accomplish. Edit: I have now seen these same things with two different user agents: NV32ts Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; WWTClient2 )
