How to sample a language model?

I've successfully trained a language model using LSTMs. But I have a confusion about sampling. On sampling, we generate a probability distribution at each time step. It will be of length vocabulary size. Now how to select a word from it? Take the highest probable word (maximum probability) in this distribution and pass it as the next input? On implementation, I found it a cyclic prediction nature using this approach. Or, say select top 5-10 most probable words and select one from them? Or, randomly select any one word from the distribution and pass that one? In this case, what is the point of language modeling at all? How to sample a language model?
