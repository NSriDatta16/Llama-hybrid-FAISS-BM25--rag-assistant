What is the cleanest way to ssh and run multiple commands in Bash?

I already have an ssh agent set up, and I can run commands on an external server in Bash script doing stuff like: ssh blah_server "ls; pwd;" Now, what I'd really like to do is run a lot of long commands on an external server. Enclosing all of these in between quotation marks would be quite ugly, and I'd really rather avoid ssh'ing multiple times just to avoid this. So, is there a way I can do this in one go enclosed in parentheses or something? I'm looking for something along the lines of: ssh blah_server ( ls some_folder; ./someaction.sh; pwd; ) Basically, I'll be happy with any solution as long as it's clean. Edit To clarify, I'm talking about this being part of a larger bash script. Other people might need to deal with the script down the line, so I'd like to keep it clean. I don't want to have a bash script with one line that looks like: ssh blah_server "ls some_folder; ./someaction.sh 'some params'; pwd; ./some_other_action 'other params';" because it is extremely ugly and difficult to read.
