PCA on the time series data yields first PC that has an opposite trend from all original time series

I have time series data with five variables that have common variation and trends and they are very noisy. I want to extract their common variation (most likely the first principal component) and use it in a regression model. Below is the original data: As you can see there is a strong correlation among the series, but they are very noisy. Next I did PCA in R and extracted five components given below: I am a bit puzzled, should not the PCs behave like the original series in terms of trends i.e. sloping downward? Well, at least one that explains most variation? Just in case, the R code I used is pcs=princomp(X[,2:6],cor=F)$scores
