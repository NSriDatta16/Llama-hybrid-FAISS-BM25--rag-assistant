Unexpected One-Factor in EFA

I have a data set of 4,000 participants. Each has rated 25 sentences on a scale of 1-100 (lowest amount of aggression present to highest amount of aggression present in each scenario portrayed in the sentences). I was not sure how many factors I would find, however I had predicted there would perhaps be 3 or 4 factors, grouping those sentences that were rated as containing the most aggression together, moderate items together, and low items together. My SPSS EFA is giving me only one factor. I cannot find any problems with my data, and wondered if anyone else has encountered this, and if it could in fact be possible to only have one factor, when the average percentages for each of the items range from 54% to 87% (or if there must be something wrong)?
