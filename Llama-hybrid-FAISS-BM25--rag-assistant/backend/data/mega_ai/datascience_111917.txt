Why can Random Forest "handle missing values and cardinality well compared to linear regression"?

I've read a question comparing Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. I was supposed to choose between then and solve a problem (=predict prices). The question mentioned that "Random Forest can also handle missing values and cardinality well compared to linear regression". Why is that? How does that happen?
