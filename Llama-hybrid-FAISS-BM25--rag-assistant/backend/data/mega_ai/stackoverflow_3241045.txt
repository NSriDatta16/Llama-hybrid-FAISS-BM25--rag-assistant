Easy SQL Incorrect Syntax when using > greater than

This has been driving me crazy! It must be something simple. Here is my code: Select logid, row_date, sum(acdcalls) as 'total calls', sum(ti_stafftime) as 'total time staffed', sum(acdtime) as 'time on the phone', Case acdtime When acdtime > 0 Then sum(ti_stafftime/acdtime) Else '0' End as MyPercent, RepLName+', '+RepFName AS Agent, SupLName+', '+SupFName AS Sup, MgrLName+', '+MgrFName AS Manager And I am getting the error message Incorrect syntax near '>'. What am I doing wrong here?
