Find all (english word) substrings of a given string

This is an interview question : Find all (english word) substrings of a given string. (every = every, ever, very). Obviously, we can loop over all substrings and check each one against an English dictionary, organized as a set. I believe the dictionary is small enough to fit the RAM. How to organize the dictionary ? As for as I remember, the original spell command loaded the words file in a bitmap , represented a set of words hash values. I would start from that. Another solution is a trie built from the dictionary. Using the trie we can loop over all string characters and check the trie for each character. I guess the complexity of this solution would be the same in the worst case ( O(n^2) ) Does it make sense? Would you suggest other solutions?
