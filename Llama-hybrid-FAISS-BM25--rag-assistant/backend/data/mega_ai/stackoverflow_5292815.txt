My best guess is that the dragged piece is dragged into the other piece, then moved back so it is no longer colliding, then dragged into the other piece again. At least that is what I would expect if collision response happens after drawing. On a side note, the following code makes me wonder a bit: //if next to another piece, //do not allow to move any further towards said piece if(eventX x&&(x==piece.x-width-1)){ return false; } Checking for equality ( == ) on floats is generally a very bad idea, see zillions of "floating point precision" topics. Alternative a) use ints instead of floats. b) use ranged comparisions ( >= , etc.). Don't use (a) though, there are many drawbacks with tiny (time) steps and such. Try using the same approach as with the touch detection instead: //check if touch is on piece if (eventX > x && eventX y && eventY
