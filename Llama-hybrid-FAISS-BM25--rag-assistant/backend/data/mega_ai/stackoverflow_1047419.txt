I would heed Joel's advice that giving homework assignments for interviews just weeds out the best programmers (paraphrased from his book). The better programmers have a lot of options and so won't want to go through the exercise of a programming assignment. They just won't apply. That will leave you with the mid-competency people. Unfortunately, in my experience those are the ones most likely to try to look better than they are and if you aren't an expert yourself, the ones most likely to mislead you. Here's an alternate option. Have them point you at some work they have already done. Not necessarily the code, but the site. During the interview, ask them questions about how they coded it. What data structures did they use? How were the classes or functions organized? What problems did they have to overcome? Then as traditional programming questions in the interview that they could answer for you ont he spot. This way you can gauge their understanding and their syntax. The two don't have to be the same question.
