The others here are correct, only use less than Int32 (for 32-bit code)/Int64 (for 64-bit code) if you need it for extreme storage requirements, or for another level of enforcement on a business object field (you should still have propery level validation in this case, of course). And in general, don't worry about efficiency until there is a performance problem. And in that case, profile it. And if guess & checking with both ways while profiling doesn't help you enough, check the IL code. Good question though. You're learning more about how the compiler does it's thing. If you want to learn to program more efficiently, learning the basics of IL and how the C#/VB compilers do their job would be a great idea.
