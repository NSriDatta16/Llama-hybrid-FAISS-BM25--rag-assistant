My experience with purchased controls (and I have quite a bit, including WeOnlyDo, Infragistics, Telerik, Dart, and others) is that they're buggy, poorly implemented, poorly supported, and produced primarily to showcase impressive demonstrations. When actually used in real software they're difficult to work with, and demonstrate only poor production values. In short, in my opinion (and this is only my opinion), they're a crutch for the weak, and not worth the time, money, or effort required to deal with them. You should think VERY hard about what you're doing and why it can't be done with standard controls. Remember, users know how to use the standard controls, they're comfortable with them. When you get into fancy non-standard stuff that deviates from the standard guidelines you just end up wasting effort and confusing users. You need to have a VERY VERY good reason whenever you deviate from that.
