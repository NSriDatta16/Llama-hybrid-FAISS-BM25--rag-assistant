Getting an http 400 error on calling a restful wcf service using http post

I have setup a wcf service. Unfortunately, when I call the service over fiddler, the web, or whereever, I get an http 400 error. I am really perplexed at where to start to solve this problem. Any suggestions are appreciated. WSDL is not an option at this time. REST is a requirement. I was able to make calls previously using GET, however, get is not secure as I need to pass the userid and password to validate and that would be easily viewable. The wcf service has the following interface: [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "/Login", Method="POST", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Xml, BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Wrapped)] [OperationContract] bool Login(string UserName, string PassWord, string AppKey); The service has the following code. yes, this code is incomplete and I know that AppKey really doesn't do anything, its there as a place holder at this point. public bool Login(string UserName, string PassWord, string AppKey) { bool bl = false; if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(AppKey)) { throw (new ApplicationException(AppKeyNull)); } if (Membership.ValidateUser(UserName, PassWord)) { bl = true; } return (bl); } I am trying to call the service over fiddler. I have the following url: http://127.0.0.1:82/WebServices/RemoteAPI.svc/Login I have the following header setup: User-Agent: Fiddler Host: 127.0.0.1:82 Content-Length: 46 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded I have the following body setup: UserName=xxxxxx&PassWord=yyyyyy&AppKey=blah
