Sharing session between WCF services

I have been working on splitting up the app tier and web tier of a web application. In the app tier, I managed to separate the business logic into a bunch of services exposed using WCF proxies. The problem is that these services talk to another legacy application that uses a large CLR object as its primary means of communication. To keep things quick, I had been keeping a copy of this object in the session after I created it the first time. Now I know that WCF can do sessions, but the session storage is per service whereas my business logic is now split into multiple services (as it should be). Now the questions: Is there a way to share session storage between WCF services hosted on the same host? Is this even something I should be doing? If not, then what are the best practices here? This is probably not the first time somebody’s had a large business object on the server. Unfortunately for me, I really do need to cache this object per user (hence the session). It’s possible the answer is obvious and I'm just not seeing it. Help please!
