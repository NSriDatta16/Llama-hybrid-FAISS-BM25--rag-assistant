Individual-level parameter estimates from ordered choice regressions

I have got a question regarding ordered choice regressions in R . I have several demographic variables with which I want to explain the ordered choice of individuals within a survey in an ordered choice ( probit or logit , this is not important) framework. Standard ordered choice estimations of course just give me aggregate parameter estimates. For my task it would however be useful to estimate or extract "hypothetical" individual-level parameter estimates (betas) for a certain independent variable and each individual in the survey. I have experimented with hierarchical Bayes algorithms provided by the bayesm and ChoiceModelR . Correct me if I am wrong but I think these techniques also demand that individuals appear several times within a survey and are confronted with different choice situations, so that one can estimate the influence of certain attributes on the individuals choices. My data however don't have any panel structure. I was also experimenting with Bayesian inference in example by the MCMCoprobit function in the MCMCpack package, but this function just simulates betas. I can't however, as far as I know, attribute them to certain individuals in the survey, which would be good. I would be very glad if somebody could give me a hint, sometimes already a catchword is helpful to google the correct solution!
