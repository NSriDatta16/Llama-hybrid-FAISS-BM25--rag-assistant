Parse custom URIs with urlparse (Python)

My application creates custom URIs (or URLs?) to identify objects and resolve them. The problem is that Python's urlparse module refuses to parse unknown URL schemes like it parses http. If I do not adjust urlparse's uses_* lists I get this: >>> urlparse.urlparse("qqqq://base/id#hint") ('qqqq', '', '//base/id#hint', '', '', '') >>> urlparse.urlparse("http://base/id#hint") ('http', 'base', '/id', '', '', 'hint') Here is what I do, and I wonder if there is a better way to do it: import urlparse SCHEME = "qqqq" # One would hope that there was a better way to do this urlparse.uses_netloc.append(SCHEME) urlparse.uses_fragment.append(SCHEME) Why is there no better way to do this?
