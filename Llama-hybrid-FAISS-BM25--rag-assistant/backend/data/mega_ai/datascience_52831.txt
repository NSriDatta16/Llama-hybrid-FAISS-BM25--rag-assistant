Integration of NLP and Angular application

I'm doing a small POC in which I've trained my Machine Learning model (Naive Bayes) and is saved in ".pkl" (pickle) format. Now my next task is to develop a web application which asks the user to enter the Text for the Text classification analysis. This newly taken (from the user) "TEXT" will be the testing dataset which can be fed to the Naive Bayes model that I built in the earlier stage and make prediction on the "text" taken from the user. My Question is: Is there any way to convert the text (taken from the user) into numpy array and then transform this numpy array using CounterVectorizer() (which was used for training dataset) and then fed to saved model for predictions ? I want to make an angular application like this . In this , input is an image and this image can be converted into pixels. In my case, it is plain text which needs to be transformed into numpy array in Angular application before I feed it to the Trained Naive Bayes Model. Thanks inadvance!
