If you're implementing the train/test (and validation if exists) correctly and getting good results (in which you should also be careful while evaluating your models as well, generally speaking), your method, even the simple logistic regression, is not weak. You don't need to use a CNN just because you have an image dataset. A well-tuned CNN saves you from feature engineering, and finds the useful features itself. Apparently, you've found your useful features yourself, and so did what CNN would do in its very first layers, and fed these feature to the decision layer, namely the logistic regression in your case.
