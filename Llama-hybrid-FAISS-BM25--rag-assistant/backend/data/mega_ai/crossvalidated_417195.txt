I'd recommend creating a dataset that contains one record per student. For each record, you have the target variable (aka the label): 1/0 to indicate whether they responded 'Yes' or 'No' to the survey question. Then you can do some feature negineering to create attributes for each student. The model would take the following form: $$ logit\ E(Y_i)=\alpha+\beta*X_i\ $$ Where $i$ represents a student. There's no methodical/statistical problem with this approach. I am assuming that the survey was taken at the end of the "observation window" (of 2 years). This way, all variables/attributes in the model serve as "leading indicators", aka they represent all information that's available at the time when the survey was taken. In addition to the two variables you mentioned here are a few more examples of variables you can create: Days since the first gym visit (this would be capped at ~730 days because only two years' worth of data is available) Average days between gym visits Number of gym visits per month Number of gym visits during weekdays (Note: 4-12 assume that you have the time-stamp of each gym visit.) Number of gym visits during weekends % of gym visits during weekends Number of gym visits during office hours Number of gym visits during mornings Number of gym visits during afternoons Number of gym visits during evenings Number of gym visits during nights % of gym visits for attributes 8-11 If you have the duration of each visits, you can create a bunch of attributes from that
