Linq: transform memberExpression type to not nullable

the following member expression type can sometimes be NUllable, I m checking that , however I need to convert it to a non nullable type , MemberExpression member = Expression.Property(param, something); var membertype = member.Type; if (membertype.IsGenericType && membertype.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(Nullable<>)) { // convert to not nullable type?... Does anyone know how?
