You mean the relation between Game Theory and Markov Decision Process. If you want a common keyword search for the Backward Induction (backward induction solutions are Nash equilibria but the inverse is not necessarily true). The backward induction can be used to solve the MDP by finding out what we call Rewards in MDP. You are right there is a common background but Game Theory is much used in economy and management decisions and MDP in IA decisions, robotics, maintenance decisions, ... But both can solve in many contexts the same problems.
