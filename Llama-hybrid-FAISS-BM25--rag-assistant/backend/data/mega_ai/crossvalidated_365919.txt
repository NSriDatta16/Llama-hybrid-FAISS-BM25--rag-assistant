Suppose that there is a store with sections and we need to draw conclusions from a sample on the frequency of visits to the sections. Do not worry about how the sample was collected. Also, we are not interested in generalizing to population. Every customer was asked to provide how many times he visited the sections within the same period of time. However, if a customer goes a lot to the store but visits each section with the same frequency, the previous reasoning would lead to erroneous conclusions. This means that the above approach is fragile. I suspect that the reason is that we have an outlier and the mean is sensitive to outliers. Does it make sense to lay out the data in this way? Can we say that the columns (Section 1, Section 2, Section 3, ..., Section n) are the variables (they could be renamed to "Visits to section"), and that the rows are the observations? What is a good approach to tackle this problem? The easiest solution is to feed your CCTV footage to one of the many cloud based services. No relying on customer participation and accuracy of the survey they fill out. You can put popular items in direct view but some distance from the door to encourage a flow through the store and make unused areas better utilized. This avoids wasting high traffic areas with low profit items. The cloud service will create a heat map that instantly and continuously shows the results. Some of the useful features of the Retail Analytics Solution are: People Counting: Gauge the number of customers in store in different times of the day or different days of the week Heat Map: Identify which areas of the store attract the highest number of customers or keep customer lingering for longer Pathmap: Map out the directions and pathways that consumers tend to take inside a store Multi-store comparison: Compare people count, heat map, pathmap and many other functions in different stores for devising effective product display or in-store promotion strategies across different stores Cloud-based user-friendly customised analytic reports, complete with visual insights for easy understanding, are generated for clients. The reports can be accessed via mobile and smart devices anytime anywhere. The article: " Hereâ€™s What Brick-And-Mortar Stores See When They Track You " explains that some retailers combine customer WiFi information with CCTV to track individuals and provide more sophisticated results.
