I would also recommend logging (over what I am about to suggest). Having said that, it is possible for a trusted (or 'no sand-box') application to redirect System.out to wherever it is most useful. E.G. you might direct it to a ByteArrayOutputStream. When the results are required, write the entire content of the BAOS to a text area, or your own server, or.. wherever you like. The same thing can be done with logging of course. I have UIs that add log messages to a list that is viewable by the end-user and included in bug reports. Logging is easily configured for level of detail and which parts of an app. to pay close attention to (by allowing different logging levels for different classes). System.out.print(ln) is not easy to configure to extract specific details. It may result in a great deal of irrelevant output.
