I really want to jump on and start developing iPhone apps as well. I've done a bit of Motorola, Blackberry and Windows Mobile development, which were all cool and east to get into with good documentation, easy to access and install SDKs. So far, I feel Apple is being a bit elitist in the fact that it seems their development environment is only available on a Mac. I'm also, not quite liking their licensing concepts. If you want to be able to actually publish apps, you need to go through them, and they have the final say on whether you can or can't or whether your app is deemed acceptable to run on their superior product. It is my belief that they are making it more difficult for the open source community to maintain and produce applications or for the iPhone neophite, like me, to even get started writing apps for the products. There's a lot of bad things said about Microsoft, but, I have to say they get their APIs and SDKs out there long before their products hit the market and really encourage programmers of all levels to dig in and get involved writing apps for their frameworks and operating systems.
