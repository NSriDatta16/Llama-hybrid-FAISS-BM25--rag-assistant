C Handles - How to work with them?

I have in some documentation for a plugin for Dreamweaver I am making that says the following: void **connectionData â€¢ The connectionData argument is a handle to the data that the agent wants Dreamweaver to pass to it when calling other API functions. I have no other information than this from the manual in regard to connectionData. Thinking literally, I figured handle refered to a generic handle,however I am not able to find documentation on working with generic handles in regard to C. HANDLE h = connectionData; Does compile in my code. How exactly do I get the "secrets" inside this data structure/can someone explain how generic handles for C work?
