Probability statistics exercise, with not enough data?

I have a question connected with this exercise. In question a) I am supposed to calculate the probability using this formula $P(A \text{ and } B)=P(A) \times P(B|A)$. I think there is not enough data. Can anybody please help me? In March 2005, the Australian government announced that an extra 450 troops would be sent to Iraq. A special Morgan poll was conducted to evaluate public opinion on Australiaâ€™s military presence in Iraq in the middle of March 2005 using an Australia-wide representative sample. It was found that 0,85 % of the respondents did not approve the decision to send 450 extra troops to Iraq. Of the respondents who are Liberal party voters, 0,18% approved the decision to send an extra 450 troops to Iraq. Assume that, of the people surveyed, 0,84 % were not Liberal party voters. One Australian is selected randomly. a) What is the probability that the person is not a Liberal party voter and approves the decision to send an extra 450 troops to Iraq? b) What is the probability that the person is not a Liberal party voter or disapproves the decision to send an extra 450 troops to Iraq?
