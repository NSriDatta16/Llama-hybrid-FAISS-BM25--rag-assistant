Can a sample average be multimodal?

Suppose $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are iid with a well defined expectation. Is it possible for the sample mean $(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$ to be multimodal for all $n$ ? Looking at simple examples I can see that for small $n$ the sample mean can be multimodal, but eventually it goes away. Is this always the case? I thought maybe using the Fourier transform this could be shown, but did not succeed. I don't want to assume the variables have a finite variance but I guess some smoothness-type assumptions on the common density will be necessary.
