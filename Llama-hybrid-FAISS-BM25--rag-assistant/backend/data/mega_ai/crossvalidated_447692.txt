Compute the cross-correlation between the time series $X_t = X_{t-1}+w_t$ and $Y_t = \theta X_t+u_t$

Compute the cross-correlation between the time series $$X_t = X_{t-1}+w_t$$ $$Y_t = \theta X_t+u_t$$ where $w_t$ and $u_t$ are white noise processes independent of each other. I have problem when calculating the covariance (the numerator of cross-correlation); here's my step: $$E[(x_t -\mu _{x_t})(y_t-\mu_{y_t})]$$ $$=E[(x_{t-1}+w_t-0)(\theta x_t+u_t+0)]$$ $$=E[x_{t-1}\theta x_t+x_{t-1}u_t+w_t \theta x_t+w_tu_t]$$ $$=0+0+0+0$$ $$=0$$ ??
