Is an Arma model equivalent to a 1-layer Recurrent Neural Network without activation function?

Given a time series $f(t)$ to forecast, let us consider an Arma model of the form: $$ f(t) = c + \sum_{i=1}^p a_i f(t-i) + e(t) + \sum_{j=1}^q b_j e(t-j) $$ where $e(t)$ are the forecast errors. On the train set, if $f(t)$ is the ground truth, then we define its estimate obtained with this model as $\widetilde{f}(t) = f(t) + e(t)$ . Let $m = min(p,q)$ , we can rewrite the first equation as: $$ \widetilde{f}(t) = c + \sum_{i=1}^m (a_i + b_i) f(t-i) + \sum_{i=m+1}^p a_i f(t-i) - \sum_{j=1}^q b_j \widetilde{f}(t-j) $$ Then after reparametrization can be rewritten as: $$ \widetilde{f}(t) = c + \sum_{i=1}^k c_i f(t-i) - \sum_{j=1}^q b_j \widetilde{f}(t-j) $$ Which is the equation of a 1-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) without activation function. So, are Arma models a subset of RNNs or is there a flaw in this reasoning ?
