In our book, Bayesian Essentials with R , we state almost the same thing: Zellner's prior somehow appears as a data-dependent prior through its dependence on $X$, but this is not really a problem since the whole model is conditional on $X$. Zellner's prior writes down as $$ \beta|\sigma \sim \mathscr{N}_p\left(\tilde\beta,g\sigma^2(X^\text{T}X)^{-1}\right)\qquad \sigma\sim\pi(\sigma)=1/\sigma $$ and its major inconvenient is the dependence on the constant $g$, that impacts in a significant manner the resulting inference. This is illustrated in the book . A way out of this problem is to associate $g$ with a prior distribution, as detailed in Bayesian Essentials with R . A more expedite way out is settle for $g=n$. A second issue with the Zellner prior is that this is an improper prior (because of $\sigma$) hence faces difficulties for model comparison as in variable selection. A somewhat dirty trick bypasses this difficulty: again quoting from the book : we are compelled to denote by $\sigma^2$ and $\alpha$ the variance and intercept terms common to all models, respectively. Although this is more of a mathematical trick than a true modeling reason, the prior independence of $(\alpha; \sigma2)$ and the model index allows for the simultaneous use of Bayes factors and an improper prior on those nuisance parameters. Therefore, it does not seem right to call Zellner's inacceptable . In my opinion, the only inacceptable priors are those that conflict with prior information. In a non-informative situation, any prior should be acceptable, at least a priori. (It may be that the data reveals a conflict between the prior and the parameter that could have been behind the data.)
