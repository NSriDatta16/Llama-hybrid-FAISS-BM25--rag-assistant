John McCarthy introduced LISP in his April, 1960 paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I" . The following paragraph is from page 6: e. Functions and Forms. It is usual in mathematics — outside of mathematical logic — to use the word “function” imprecisely and to apply it to forms such as y 2 + x. Because we shall later compute with expressions for functions, we need a distinction between functions and forms and a notation for express- ing this distinction. This distinction and a notation for describing it, from which we deviate trivially, is given by Church [3]. ... 3. A. CHURCH, The Calculi of Lambda-Conversion (Princeton University Press, Princeton, N. J., 1941). The Wikipedia article on lambda-calculus has a history of Church's publications. The 1941 paper referenced by McCarthy seems to be about the typed lambda-calculus, in contradiction to the Wikipedia article's introduction. The lambda keyword in Lisp can be understood to refer to the lambda-calculus only through analogy. A Lisp lambda expression is a type of anonymous function .
