How might one go about implementing a disk fragmenter?

I have a few ideas I would like to try out in the Disk Defragmentation Arena. I came to the conclusion that as a precursor to the implementation, it would be useful, to be able to put a disk into a state where it was fragmented. This seems to me to be a state that is more difficult to achieve than a defragmented one. I would assume that the commercial defragmenter companies probably have solved this issue. So my question..... How might one go about implementing a fragmenter? What makes sense in the context that it would be used, to test a defragmenter?
