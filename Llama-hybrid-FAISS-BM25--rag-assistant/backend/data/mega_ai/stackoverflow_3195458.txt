Suggestions to learn any programming language after Matlab

I've taken a course in C++ in my freshman year in undergrad. However once it was over I never employed it in any project or use. I am familiar with some average topics in C++ prior to where 'link list' starts. Once I got the opportunity to do my first project after Sophomore year, I was suggested by my prof. to learn Matlab which is widely used in mathematical and engineering projects. But I often hear from people that Matlab is not a language and that it can't take the place of any programming languages like C++, Java, Fortran etc. I am also concerned about its inability to run using executable files unlike Fortran, C++ etc. I am wanting to learn a programming language: 1) Which takes care of the above, and other, issues which Matlab lacks in many aspects. 2) Which is widely used and available in industry and research centers. 3) Which is relatively easy and quick to code, and powerful in its capabilities. Also please: 1) Give the advantages and disadvantages (over Matlab) for the language you suggest. 2) The best way to learn it. 3) The proper sequence of topics to learn knowing that I am familiar with the programming concepts. 4) A source, which is easy, good and interesting, to learn from. Thanks for your suggestions.
