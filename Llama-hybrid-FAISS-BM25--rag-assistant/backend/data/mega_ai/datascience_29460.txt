Your intuition that the distributions of words in the subject and email body are likely to be different has merit. Regarding and "out of the box" solution, the easiest approach would be to construct two separate classifiers -- one each for the subject and body -- and then ensemble them together. A very simple ensemblification approach would be to just use the probability scores outputted by those two models as inputs to a logistic regression classifier.
