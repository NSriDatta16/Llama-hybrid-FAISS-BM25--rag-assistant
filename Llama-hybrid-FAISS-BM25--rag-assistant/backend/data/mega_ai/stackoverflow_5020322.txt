I think it would not be an elegant solution, but you could use JavaScript to alter the action of the form element before submitting it to include querystring parameters. The form will be something like: Then you will need JavaScript to change the action element of the form: function submitMyForm(theForm) { theForm.action="http://example.com/FileUpload/UploadFile?id=" + getElementById("id").value; theForm.submit(); } Is there some reason you cannot just submit the parameters with post and pull them out on the server side?
