Embedding MS.NET C# into c/c++ (like mono)

Is it possible to embed the MS C# compiler into an umanaged c/c++ host application and make both languages interoperate, very much like Mono does this (like here and here )? I have a working implementation of this f√ºr my Qt based C++ Application using mono, but I'm limited (I really need the memory) by the 32bit constraint of mono on Windows (there are no 64bit releases for windows). So can this be achived with "the original" C# implementation? BTW: I'd like to continue using GNU compilers (mingw-w64).
