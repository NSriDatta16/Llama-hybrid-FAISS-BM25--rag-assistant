Possible to elegantly convert std:vector to cliext::vector or cli::array ?

How's that for a catchy title? I need to convert back and forth from a CLR compliant type, like an array, and a std::vector type. Are there any adapter methods out there, or should I just keep copying it in and out each time I call one of my native methods? There are some interesting methods for converting between the cliext STL variant classes and CLR types, but I'm at a loss for how to get the standard vector into the STL types without a for next loop. This is what I'm doing all over the place in this project: vector galilVector = _galilClass->arrayUpload(marshal_as (arrayName)); List ^ arrayList = gcnew List (); // Copy out the vector into a list for export to .net for(vector ::size_type i = 0; i Add(galilVector[i]); } return arrayList->ToArray();
