The object instantiated are exactly the same. The consequences of an upcasting are: generalization while storing : all objects of different specialized type can be threated as the same interface and can be stored together into data structure. (Like pointed out by @WhiteFang34 : List ) generalization while accessing objects method: the client class can call Shape's method without knowing the real type (typically you can use a factory to create object that returns the common interface Shape, so the client class is unaware of the real type of the objects but only the Shape's interface methods are exposed)
