Regression on dataset whose scatter plot contains 2 clusters

I'm new to regression and I am trying to perform regression analysis on two time series Price A (x-variable) and Price B (y-variable). When doing LASSO regression, the R-squared score is extremely low at 0.01. Log transformations made it worse. Plotting out the scatter plot, we can see 2 different clusters. How should we handle such a data set? And how do we interpret such a scatter plot? plt.scatter(df['priceA'], df['priceB']) plt.xlabel('Price A') plt.ylabel('Price B')
