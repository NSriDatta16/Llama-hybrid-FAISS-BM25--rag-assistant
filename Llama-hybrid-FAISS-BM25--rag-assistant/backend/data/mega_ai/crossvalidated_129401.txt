Since "good" is a relative term, "good results" is a very ambiguous criterion. In addition, as @Nick Cox mentioned in his comment, it's impossible to cover the entire AI field, even if "good results" criterion would have a clear interpretation. Therefore, I think that, instead of a summary , it makes sense to present the state of AI research (in terms of width rather than depth ) with examples of most popular streams of research and their applications (which is what I believe you are actually asking about). With that goal in mind, artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the following streams of research (my taxonomy , based on "The AI Book" - Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig): Intelligent agents Search algorithms and solutions, which include classical search for solutions to problems, local search (optimization), online search Game theory (aka decision theory or, in AI parlance, adversarial search ) Constraint satisfaction problems Planning algorithms and solutions Knowledge representation ( ontologies , taxonomies , semantics , reasoning ) Knowledge engineering ( propositional logic , first-order logic , inference ) Knowledge and reasoning under uncertainty (traditional and Bayesian probability statistics , probabilistic reasoning , decision making ) Machine learning (ML) (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement statistical learning , including artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms that you mentioned; knowledge-based learning ; probabilistic learning ) Communication algorithms and solutions ( natural language processing , including text classification , information retrieval and information extraction , machine translation , speech recognition ) Perception algorithms and solutions (image and object recognition ) Robotics ( perception , planning and moving ) The above is just a high-level taxonomy of AI research , that I took liberty to re-arrange partially to better match co-joining domains. Sub-domains in parentheses do not represent an exhaustive list, but I've tried to select the most popular and active research streams to the best of my knowledge. UPDATE: Just ran across the following fascinating (and scary ) TED talk by Jeremy Howard on advancements and current state of AI/ML (as well as potential social and economical problems , associated with the above). I'm thinking about submitting a question on this to StackExchange . Highly recommend to watch and think/discuss: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4kyRyKyOpo .
