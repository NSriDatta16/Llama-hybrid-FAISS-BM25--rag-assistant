Bivariate Regression when X and Y are both binary (/categorical)

Hello I wanted to know whether logistic regression can be used if X and Y are both binary. I am aware that the sole condition for logistic regression is that Y is binary, however Im not sure how to interpret it if X is binary? Also do you think this is a good strategy? Or is Chi square to be preferred in such cases. What could be other alternatives.
