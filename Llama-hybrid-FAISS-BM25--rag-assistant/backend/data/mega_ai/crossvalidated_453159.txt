The coefficient $\beta_1$ can be interpreted as follows: $e^{\beta_1t}$ is the ratio of the odds of predicting a 1 after increasing $X_1$ by $t$ units to the odds of predicting a 1 while leaving $X_1$ alone. In your specific scenario, $e^{4.75(0.10)} = 1.049$ means that the odds of getting funding after a 10% increase in VentureTeamDiversity is $1.049$ times the odds of getting funding without that increase. There's also this answer How to interpret logistic regression coefficient , which describes how to compute actual changes in the probability of predicting a 1, but that can only be computed at specific values of the predictor.
