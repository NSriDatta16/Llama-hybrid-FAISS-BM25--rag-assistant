Is there a different way to do ASP.Net forms authentication that's already built and audited?

Like a lot of people I've gone with ASP.Net Forms authentication because it's already written and writing our own security code we're told is generally a bad idea. With the current problems with ASP.Net I'm thinking it might be a good time to look at alternatives. Important: ASP.NET Security Vulnerability - ScottGu Video demonstrating attack Microsoft advisory including workaround From what I understand Microsoft tend to store things on the client side because it makes it easier to operate over server farms without needing database access calls. I don't really care about server farms though and I'd like to simply have an opaque cookie that demonstrates my lack of trust in the callers. Is there a decent solution that's already been proven solid? Update: to clarify my question. I'm talking about the authentication token part of the forms authentication that I'd like to replace. The back end is quite easy to replace, you can implement the interfaces to store your users and roles quite easily. You can also use existing libraries like http://www.memberprotect.net/ which has been mentioned here. I'd like to change the front end part of the process to use a token that doesn't provide the client with any leverage. Sticking with the existing back end infrastructure would be useful but not essential.
