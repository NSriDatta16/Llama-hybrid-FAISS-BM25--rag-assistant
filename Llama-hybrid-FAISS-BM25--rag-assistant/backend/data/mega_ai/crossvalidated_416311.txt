As far as I understand your question, I think you shouldn't be looking into hypothesis tests, but in time series analysis. (After edit of question) I think a paired t-test should be used. The two groups are "related" because they will fill in the same test, with the difference of one group not having training and the other group having had training. However I don't know if you should account for the fact that the groups containt different people.
