An ID is a unique name given to an element on a page. An example would be 'product_98509'. A class is a non-unique reference to one or more elements on a page. For example 'product'. Then when using CSS you could reference all products with '.product {}' and a specific product with '#product_98509 {}'. A is a block-level element designed for boxes and containers. For example a header bar, a quote box, etc. A is an in-line element usually used in text. For example someone's name in a paragraph, a price in a product description, etc. Hope that helps a bit!
