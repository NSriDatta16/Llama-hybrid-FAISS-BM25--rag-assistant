Where can I find gpt-35-turbo in the Microsoft Pricing calculator?

Where can I find gpt-35-turbo in the Microsoft Pricing calculator ? I don't see gpt-35-turbo in the model list: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ says "NA". However, I do see gpt-35-turbo on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models . So I'm confused.
