If it's such a big issue, what you probably want to do is abstract the database away from your actual app. So if you want to start out with something boring and easy to set up like MySQL, you can do that. And if you start to outgrow that, you can easily swap in a different storage layer. I'm not a database expert, but MySQL is boring and tested and can be made to scale horizontally , so I would recommend it.
