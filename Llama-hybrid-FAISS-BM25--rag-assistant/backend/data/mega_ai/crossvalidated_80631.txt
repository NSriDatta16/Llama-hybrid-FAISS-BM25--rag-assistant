How can I check if two numbers are equal (with some allowed error)?

I have a lot (about 10000 or more) measurement results. I measured the performance of different algorithms (it doesnt really matter which algorithms for now on). I want to check if my measurement results are stationary or not. I can simply check it with SIMPLE MOVING AVERAGE, and I did it. The thing is, I have to compare my moving averages I calculated, check if they're equal or not. If they're equal, my data set is stationary. But having so much data I need to consider a small error, with I can assume my means are equal. Example: I have a data set with the measurement results: X = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0}; , so N = 10 I chose the window, w = 3 I calculated means with the simple moving average method, stored means in SAM table: (1+2+3)/3 = 2, (2+3+4)/3 = 3, (3+4+5)/3 = 4, ..., (8+9+10)/3 = 9 so SAM = {2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0} For my data to be stationary, SAM table should look like this: SAM = {9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0} (moving means are equal) Having X set with some randomness, my SAM will not look quite that neat, it could be SAM = {9.2, 9.7, 9.3, 9.6, 9.4, 10.0, 9.1, 9.7} and heres my question: how can I calculate the acceptable error with I can assume my means are equal? When SAM looks like this: SAM = {9.2, 9.7, 9.3, 9.6, 9.4, 10.0, 9.1, 9.7} and the error is, lets say +/-0.7 then I can consider my means as equal and my data stationary. The main problem is, how can I calculate this acceptable error?
