There is a bit of an art to balancing aesthetic and informative aspects of a graphic. Prominent visualization consultant/authors like Edward Tufte and Stephen Few choose a minimal aesthetic that avoids distraction from the informative parts of the graph. However, for some audiences a small amount of flourish is justified -- see Alberto Cairo's journalistic application of data visualization, for instance. The perceptual research angle is that every graphic element communicates a message, some that we aren't consciously aware of because our visual cortex deals with it (" pre-attentive processing "). Extra elements, even redundant ones, can result in extra processing. The appropriate graph depends on the message to be communicated and the audience. To your specific question, a connected line emphasizes a trend (and variation from a trend). The filled area emphasizes deviation from the baseline. A bar chart or needle chart would emphasize discrete events deviating from a baseline. The graphic's context is also important. If you have a grid of tightly packed graphs, the fill will help associate each line with its baseline. Finally, another consideration for adding redundant graphic elements/florishes is that it makes it harder to extend the graph with more informative elements. For instance, you might want to highlight special values, overlay other trend lines or overlay bands, such as in the following mock-up.
