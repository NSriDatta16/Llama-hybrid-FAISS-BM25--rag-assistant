Books or resources for learning unified view of classical statistics?

I did a science PhD doing applied bayesian statistics, and I liked it so much that I decided to shift to statistics. For the last 2-3 years have been working at a firm that has more of a frequentist focus. It seems to me that the bayesian approach (at least what I learned) has an underlying theory that was laid out and I could understand. Now I find this - more classical - field fascinating but I am looking for some resources to get a unified view of the matter. For example, I am learning and applying anovas, F-tests and chi-squares, thinking about degrees of freedom, etc but part of me is looking for deeper understanding that would make it more than just methods. Does anyone have any suggestions on books or more resources that provide such a unified, deeper focus?
