One solution is to disable all undo registration after the very first drag event, and keep it disabled until the entire gesture is finished. If you have groupsByEvent on, you'll need to keep in mind that the undo manager ignores all grouping messages while registration is off, including the one that ends the implicit group automatically at the end of the event. So if you plan to leave registration turned off at the end of the run loop, you'll have to manually close the implicit group yourself: [moc processPendingChanges]; while ([moc.undoManager groupingLevel]) [moc.undoManager endUndoGrouping]; [moc.undoManager disableUndoRegistration]; Once the drag gesture is finished, you can re-enable undo registration with the following code: [moc processPendingChanges]; [moc.undoManager enableUndoRegistration]; This solution works, but it is a bit kludgy. The one suggested by TechZen is much cleaner: don't update model attributes until the drag gesture is done.
