How to interpret fixed effects model when the fixed effects uniquely identifies each observation?

Say I have a dataset that is uniquely identified by country and year. Then, I run a fixed effects regression with country and year fixed effects. How do I interpret the result of the regression coefficient? Surely I cannot say that it is the average correlation of X on Y controlling for countries and years, because each country and each year uniquely identify my observations! And yet commands such as areg in STATA claim that they are able to do just that. Perhaps I am misunderstanding something. Somebody please help.
