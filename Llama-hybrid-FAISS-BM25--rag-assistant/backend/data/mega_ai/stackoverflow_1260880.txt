Many companies would rather continue to patch something that is working, even if the maintenance cost is high, than go ahead with a risky rewrite. Especially if that function is business critical. You have a chance though in that you need to add major functionality, and that can be leveraged as a risk of not changing to a rewrite. However you might just need to get to a "working prototype" implementation before showing what you have. Provide a migration plan, and compatibility testing plan. If the rewrite was going to take you 6 months in total over the next year, then make sure that the savings are greater than the cost of keeping the existing system. Many people won't care if the savings are only achieved over three or more years. We're rewritten systems, but they were systems with significant yearly licensing costs that were central to the business. A six month rewrite and 2 days / month maintenance was an easy sell, never mind other benefits such as increasing the accuracy of the system vastly (resulting in redundancies for the people who were required to mentor the old system). All in all, the savings helped keep the company more alive during the recent downturn, and will give us a competitive edge going forward.
