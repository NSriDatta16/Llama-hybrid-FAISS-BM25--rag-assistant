If you're just talking about detecting swipes, then in OS 3.2, Apple introduced gesture recognizers to make this sort of thing easier in iPad applications. You can also write your own recognizers for other kinds of gestures (like long drags), with the OS doing most of the heavy lifting, and notifying you about the "interesting moments". According to some reports , it looks like they'll be in 4.0 and available to iPhone, as well.
