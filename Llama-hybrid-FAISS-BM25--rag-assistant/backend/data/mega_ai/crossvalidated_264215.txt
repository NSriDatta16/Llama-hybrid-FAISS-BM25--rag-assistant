Independent MCMC chains still okay?

Say I have a slow MCMC program that samples from my model's posterior distribution. Assume further that there is no problem submitting this program as a job to a computer cluster multiple times. Each submission generates an independent realization of the Markov Chain of length $M$. Say for each job $j$, I can also calculate $\bar{\theta}_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \theta_j^i/M$. $\bar{\theta} = \sum_{j=1}^J \bar{\theta}_j/J$ is still a consistent estimator, but what are all reasons this is an undesirable strategy? How do we get around plotting ACFs? We can just throw all the data from all jobs into one histogram, right? What types of people would object to this? Are there any mathematical difficulties I'm not thinking of? Where is this most commonly done, or who are doing this most often?
