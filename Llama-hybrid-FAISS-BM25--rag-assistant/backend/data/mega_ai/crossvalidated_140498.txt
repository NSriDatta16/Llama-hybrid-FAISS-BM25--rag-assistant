Intuition behind random matrices

I am looking for an intuition for random matrices. Say, Gaussian or Binary squares matrices to begin with. I am considering three possible viewpoints: As a $n$ random points in $\mathbb{R}^n$. As a random linear operator from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. As a network of pair-wise distances between $n$ randomly positioned points. I wonder which gives more insight? To Wishart theory? To statistical properties of PCA? etc...
