With a light-tailed distribution, the more distant points are most informative about location; with a heavier-tailed distribution their inclusion in an average may be anything from unhelpful to ruinous. So when you use a suitably-trimmed mean with a heavy-tailed distribution, it will tend to have a lower variance than not trimming. On the other hand when you do it with a light-tailed distribution, you're throwing away valuable data (and so your estimate is noisier, somewhat like it would be if you had a smaller sample) If you look at say a $t_4$ distribution you can see some gain from trimming. If you look at a uniform on $(-k,k)$, you can see a cost from trimming (indeed, you'd be better still to average the trimmed-off values at some very small level of trimming than to use the mean). These simulations were for n=100 in each case.
