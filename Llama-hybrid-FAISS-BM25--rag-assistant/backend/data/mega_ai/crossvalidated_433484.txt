a. In order to test difference of distributions there are many possible options: Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (which "focus" on the maximum difference between distributions, or Von-Misses (which looks on the average difference). If you want to test the difference in specific hours you can average them throughout the weeks (this assumes that at each week the distribution is similar, so be careful if you are willing to assume that), and use a wilcoxon or t-test for each hour between the control and group. Remember to adjust for multiple comparisons, you could also use some hierarchical method such as BB . b. Same as a but instead of comparing two empirical distributions you can compare it to the theoretical uniform distribution. c. You could use the statistic of B for each day, and then regress it against the time.
