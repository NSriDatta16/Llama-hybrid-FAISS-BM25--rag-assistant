This answer is basically copying the comments of whuber. The OP is conflating parameters with data. With count data and a Poisson model, the data must be integers, but even if 1.22 people is impossible, one can have a population that averages 1.22 people per household, say. Insisting that parameters must be integers will only limit options, make numerical maximization more difficult, and gain you nothing. Your estimations and predictions will be inferior.
