Try $(this).next('table').find('input[type=checkbox]:first')is(':checked'); You could also probably get it by name since they're related. var cbName = '#' + $(this).attr('name') + 'InheritCheckbox'; $(cbName).is(':checked'); Both of these are a little bit fragile and depend on relationships either in the DOM or between the element names, though I suspect the latter might be more stable over time.
