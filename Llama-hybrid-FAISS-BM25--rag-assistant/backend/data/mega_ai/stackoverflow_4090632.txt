Your SSIS setup sounds like it should work as you want it to do. You should be able to select the delimited format (ragged right shouldn't be necessary). Can you check your source data to see if there are trailing spaces in the values? Trailing spaces can exist even in the varchar data type. If you have trailing spaces in the data, you can use the RTRIM() function in your source query to get rid of them.
