There has been a change to JsonResult in MVC 2 and therefore it will no longer work with HTTP GET to avoid Json hijacking. So you have two options a. return your results via HTTP Post or b. the JsonRequestBehavior property to JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet There is an interesting article on how to modify here . or (more elegant) c. return Json(data, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
