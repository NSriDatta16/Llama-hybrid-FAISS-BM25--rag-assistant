I managed to fix it! I found this solution here: http://blog.chapagain.com.np/magento-admin-login-problem/ . I wanted to know why that fixed it though and var_dumped the items I commented out and realized that the cookie domain was being set to just '/' and we have magento set up under '/shop/'. So I went to the configuration section (having managed to log in after commenting out the 3 lines mentioned in the article), changed the Cookie Domain and Cookie Path to be blank and saved. I then uncommented those lines and tried again and all's working well!
