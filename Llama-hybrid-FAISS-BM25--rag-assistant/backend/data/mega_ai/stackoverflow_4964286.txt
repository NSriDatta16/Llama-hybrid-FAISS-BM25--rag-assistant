How do I get the sum of all numbers in a range function in Python?

I can't figure out how to take x (from code below) and add it to itself to get the sum and then divide it by the number of ratings. The example given in class was 4 ratings, with the numbers being 3,4,1,and 2. The average rating should be 2.5, but I can't seem to get it right! number_of_ratings = eval(input("Enter the number of difficulty ratings as a positive integer: ")) # Get number of difficulty ratings for i in range(number_of_ratings): # For each diffuculty rating x = eval(input("Enter the difficulty rating as a positive integer: ")) # Get next difficulty rating average = x/number_of_ratings print("The average diffuculty rating is: ", average)
