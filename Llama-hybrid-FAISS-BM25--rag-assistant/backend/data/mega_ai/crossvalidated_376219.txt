Diff in diff model with multiple treatments in multiple perdiods?

Can I estimate a diff in diff model to compare the effects of two different treatments that apply in different time periods in different countries? I have 30 countries for an average time span of 34 years. All of these countries are subject to these two different shocks (treatments) that happen several times during the time span. An example could be the following: 1) Treatment one: Austria 1972, 1989, 1990 Belgium 2000, 2002 Canada 1972, 1999, 2008, 2009, 2010 2) Treatment two: Austria 1990, 1992, 2014 Belgium 2005, 2014 Canada 1990, 1999, 2001, 2015 I have no un-treated countries. Is it possible to estimate a diff in diff? Do you have alternative suggestions?
