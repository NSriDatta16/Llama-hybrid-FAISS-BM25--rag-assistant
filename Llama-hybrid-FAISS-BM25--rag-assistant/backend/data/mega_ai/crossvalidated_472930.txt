If $F$ is the CDF of a continuous population distribution, then $\int (x-\mu)^2\, dF(x)$ is $\sigma_X^2 = \int (x-\mu)^2 f_X(x)\, dx,$ where $f_X(x)$ is the density function of the distribution. (The integral is taken over the support of the distribution.) If $F$ is the CDF of a discrete population distribution, then $\int (x-\mu)^2\, dF(x)$ is $\sigma_X^2 = \sum_x (x-\mu)^2 p_X(x)\, dx,$ where $p_X(x) = P(X = x),$ for each $x$ with positive probability. The expression $\int (x-\mu)^2\, dF(x)$ can be used more generally for distributions that are neither continuous nor discrete. (A distribution that agrees with standard normal for positive $x$ and has $P(X = 0) = 1/2$ would be an example.) Also, in your third paragraph, it's just saying that $V(\bar X) = \sigma_X^2/n,$ where $\bar X$ is the mean of a sample of size $n$ from a population with variance $\sigma_X^2,$ which I guess you already know.
