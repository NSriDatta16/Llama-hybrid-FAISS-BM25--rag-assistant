I would call a mapping between N dimensional input and N dimensional output a regression problem. If you add more constraints about the relation between the input and output it might be called different names: linear filtering, nonlinear filtering, etc... some examples on common techniques for that would be: neural networks, regression trees, regularised regressions...
