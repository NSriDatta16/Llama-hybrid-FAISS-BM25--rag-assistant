Referencing script files from MVC

I am having problems referencing scripts that should be included in my view, when I access the page using a different route my scripts fail. The idea is that two routes actually point to the same action: http://localhost/PaydayWebsite/registration http://localhost/PaydayWebsite/organizations/p001/departments/vest/employees/chn/registration where the second just include more params for my action. I have tried using ResolveUrl, Url.Content and mvccontribs Html.ScriptInclude but neither seem to work. Any ideas?
