One solution is to bundle the XML with the clases in the JAR/WAR and then use the getResourceAsStream() to leverage the ClassLoader to locate the file. If I put the file foo.xml with the classes in com/stackoverflow/example, I could then locate the resources from objects in that bundle with InputStream is = MyClass.getResourceAsStream( "com/stackoverflow/example" ); and from here process the file with a XML parser or whatever else you wanted to do to read the file.
