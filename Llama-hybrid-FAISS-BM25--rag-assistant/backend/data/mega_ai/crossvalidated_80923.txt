Interaction variables work differently when population is split

Let's say I have two predictors to predict financial risk: Gender and shopping habits. Gender has levels of "Male" and "Female", while shopping habits has "quick shopper" and "slow shopper". I am quite surprised to see this: When I split the population into "male" and "female", shopping habits as a single variable work quite well to separate the risk on female population (not for males). This also intuitively makes sense. But when I create an interaction variable of "gender:shopping habits" and look at logistic regression, there is no risk separation whatsoever even on the dummy created "female:quick shopper". Could there be an explanation of this? Note: I should add that the initial working performance is cross-validated (not an overfitting result). Note2: I edited the question for better understanding.
