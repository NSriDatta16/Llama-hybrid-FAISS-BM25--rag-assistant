Scott Ambler is one good authority for an answer on this. His article does a good job of highlighting some of the pitfalls of fixed-price, but it's definitely possible. Alistair Cockburn agrees it's possible also, but points out that some of the benefits you get from agile are lost in fixed-price contracts. One basic problem with "big design up-front" (BDUF) is the time spent designing functionality that is rarely, if ever, used. If you need to have a finished product in a month or less, the problem must be really well-defined beforehand. As for the cost of failure, that's a very legitimate concern. One benefit of Agile is that any failures happen earlier and at far less cost than they would in a project following the waterfall methodology. Being able to learn from those failures and get a good product at the end isn't an outcome that the waterfall methodology can deliver. The federal government has a fair number of high-profile failures of software projects that followed the waterfall methodology and BDUF. I've blogged about the FBI's Virtual Case File project failure. What methodologies you use will be determined as much by the fit with your team as the type of software you're building, and your customers. tvanfosson is quite right about the projects that aren't suited to agile methods. I agree with Kent Beck on the values mismatch idea. Some organizations aren't ready for Agile from a cultural perspective, regardless of its merits and success elsewhere.
