Welcome to the site, roc. It may be possible to employ a mixed modeling framework to your data. How many different species did you record? If there are 10-15 or more, then you could have the grouping variable be species. This would indicate that you believe that vocalization frequency is more correlated within species than it is across different species. That being said, this doesn't really solve the problem you identified about individual members of the species. That is not something you can deal with given your data. You would have to use some sort of machine learning algorithm to try to identify individuals within species, and I'm not sure that would work (it might, I just don't know much about that). However, if you only have two species (you mention SpeciesA and SpeciesB), then you are in a more difficult position. Since you cannot identify individuals within SpeciesA and SpeciesB, you cannot account for the likely fact that some members of the Species will be more likely to repeatedly call. Is it correct to assume that you want to have a predictor for SpeciesB in the model for SpeciesA vocalizations? Or were you just saying you wanted to generate the same model for each species? If you have multiple species, there are many different R packages for doing this type of analysis with your count outcome, including glmer() in lme4 , glmmTMB() and GLMMadaptive .
