First thing to do is to make a good plot. The data used here is the ACTG175 data set in R of the R package speff2trial. Treatment 1 seems to have little effect on the measurement (i.e. bloodpressure), treatment 2 on the other hand seems to have a positive effect, as the measurements seem to be higher at the end of the trial then before the trial. There is a trade of to make: When you use the mean change you compare the response on the treatment of every patient. In case the treatment has an identical effect on every patient, you can explain all the variation at the end of the trial with the variation in the beginning of the trial, and you are certain about the treatment effect. In that case, it would be foolish not to use the baseline values. In case the treatment effect varies greatly from patient to patient, you will have more variation at the end of the treatment than in the beginning. It is not certain anymore that a patient who was 1 SD below the average at baseline, is still 1 SD below the average in his group at the end of the treatment. In that case, using the baseline values only creates "noise". You need to find the test statistic with the lowest variance. When you write out all the equations of the variance of the "difference in mean change" (keeping baseline) versus the "difference in final values" (neglecting baseline) you get the following trade of: $Var_{change} - Var_{final} = \frac{1}{n_1}(\sigma_{X_1}^2 - 2 \sigma_{X_1} \sigma_{Y_1}corr(X_1,Y_1) ) + \frac{1}{n_2}(\sigma_{X_2}^2 - 2\sigma_{X_2}\sigma_{Y_2}corr(X_2,Y_2))$ With X the values at baseline, and Y the values at the end of the experiment. If 1) $n_1 = n_2$ 2) all $\sigma$'s and $corr$'s in the above formula are equal: so in case the correlation between baseline and end of treatment is above 0.5, you have benefits using the the "difference in mean change". In case the correlation is below 0.5, you should neglect the baseline values.
