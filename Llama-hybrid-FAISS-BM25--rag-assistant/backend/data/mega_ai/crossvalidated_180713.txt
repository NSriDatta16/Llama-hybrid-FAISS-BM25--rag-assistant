Hyndman & Khandakar (2007) , p. 10-11, and Hyndman & Athanasopoulos (2014) chapter 8.7 both describe how auto.arima works. It searches for the best model in the following way (roughly): it determines the integration order $d$ (and seasonal integration order $D$, if applicable) by unit-root or stationarity testing it takes four models as starting points; for non-seasonal time series they will be ARIMA(2,$d$,2), ARIMA(0,$d$,0), ARIMA(1,$d$,0) and ARIMA(0,$d$,1); it selects the one with the lowest information criterion value (information criterion is specified via the argument ic to be AICc, AIC or BIC; the default is AICc) it then proceeds in a stepwise fashion by increasing or decreasing the autoregressive and the moving average orders $p$ and $q$ (for seasonal series, also the seasonal autoregressive and moving average orders $P$ and $Q$) separately or together by 1 searching for a "nearby" (in terms of $p$, $q$, $P$, $Q$) model with the lowest value of the information criterion; it also varies the inclusion/exclusion of the constant $c$ if $d=0$ Step 3 is iterated until a new iteration gives the same outcome as the previous iteration; this outcome is then selected as the final model and becomes is the output of auto.arima . What could have happened in your case is: Step 1: $d$ found to be 0, $D$ not applicable Step 2: ARIMA(2,0,2) not found to have the lowest information criterion value among ARIMA(2,0,2), ARIMA(0,0,0), ARIMA(1,0,0) and ARIMA(0,0,1) Steps 3 and 4 yield ARIMA(1,0,0). Interestingly, if ARIMA(3,0,3) had been reached at some point in the process, it would have beaten ARIMA(1,0,0), and ARIMA(1,0,0) would not have been selected. However, apparently the search process did not come close enough to ARIMA(3,0,3) to assess it. By construction, the procedure allows for the case that you are facing. This is a side effect of saving computational time by not exploring a larger candidate model space. Therefore, if you have spent the time to find a better model (in terms of the selected information criterion), logically you should select that model.
