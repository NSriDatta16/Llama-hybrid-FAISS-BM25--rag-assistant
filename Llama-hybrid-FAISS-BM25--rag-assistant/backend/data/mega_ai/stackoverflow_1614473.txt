C# Inserting Rows from DataTable to Excel Spreadsheet

Is there a way to add rows from a DataTable to a Excel spreadsheet without interating through a SQL Insert Statement as so? Are there any alternative methods? foreach (DataRow drow in DataTable DT) { cmd.CommandText = "INSERT INTO [LHOME$]([Date], [Owner], [MAKE], [BUY], [OVERAGE], [SUM]) " + "VALUES(" + "'" + drr.ItemArray[0].ToString() + "'" + "," + "'" + drr.ItemArray[1].ToString() + "'" + "," + "'" + drr.ItemArray[2].ToString() + I'm trying to work around the DataTypes going into Excel worksheet. Because all my numbers which are saved as string are being inserted as a text with a conversion prompt on each cell. When I write to the worksheet as is. The dataTypes are all Strings. But I'm looking for a way that I don't have to specify the DataType. If there was a way to just push my changes from a DataTable and commit my changes to the spreadsheet.
