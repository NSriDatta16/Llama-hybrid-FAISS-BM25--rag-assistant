Does anyone know how to structure multiple percentages per individual for multinomial logistic regression in SPSS?

Per individual I have 6 percentages (summing to 100 per individual) for 6 different behaviors shown by the individual. I want to perform a multinomial logistic regression on this data in SPSS. However, I can only add 1 variable in the ''Dependent" variable/target box in the multinomial logistic regression analysis. In my dataset each row is an individual, and thus each individual has 6 columns of behaviors with the percentage how much that behavior was observed over a certain time.These percentages are the dependent variables. Happy new year!
