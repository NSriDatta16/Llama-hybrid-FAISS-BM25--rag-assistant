Multiple inheritance in C# - again

I know that C# does not offer multiple inheritance. And I know there' are workarounds like this one for instance. But here's a problem that I faced today, can't figure any ELEGANT workaround. I'll add some abstract code-sample so you get it quicker... (let it be a real-life ASP.NET code - cause those "class A, class B" code-samples are really confusing): public class AdminPage : System.Web.UI.Page { protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e) { //if not an admin - get out if(!CurrentUserIsAdmin()) Response.End(); base.OnInit (e); } } public class JQueryPage : System.Web.UI.Page { protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e) { RegisterJQueryScript(); base.OnLoad (e); } } //now here's what I REALLY miss in C# public class AdminJQueryPage : AdminPage, JQueryPage;
