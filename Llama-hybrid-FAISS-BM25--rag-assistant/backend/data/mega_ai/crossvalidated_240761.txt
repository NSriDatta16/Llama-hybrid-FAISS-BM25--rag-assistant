You would think that a simple question like this would have received more attention in the literature but .... To determine an anomaly one needs to have a model which characterizes typical behavior. I took your 336 values and simply graphed them and obtained very little visual support for any activity on or around period 169 BUT simple visual checking is equivalent to a simple mean model. . I then used AUTOBOX (my tool of choice which I had helped develop) to simultaneously to identify an appropriate memory model and any exceptional activity. Following is a graph of the actual,fit and forecast using that model. and model suggesting three level shifts and some 14 anomalies while incorporating a very significant AR(1) component, Any thorough analysis of time series data includes a plot of the residuals presented here and the acf of the residuals reflecting/suggesting apparent model sufficiency. In conclusion it appears to me (and AUTOBOX ) that period 169 is not suggestive of any exceptional activity. Hope this helps you and other interested readers.
