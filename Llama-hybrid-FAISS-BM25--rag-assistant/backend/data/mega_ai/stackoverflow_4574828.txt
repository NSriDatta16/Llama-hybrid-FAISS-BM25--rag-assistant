Can't get useful location from -mouseDown:event

Complete rewrite I now reproduced the issue I had posted about previously in a trivial sample project, and so I have absolutely no idea what I could be doing wrong. Here's what I'm now doing. Create a new vanilla Cocoa Application (no Core Data, not document-based) Add a class named "MyImageView.m", no header Replace the contents of MyImageView.m with: @interface MyImageView :NSImageView {} @end @implementation MyImageView - (void)mouseDown:(NSEvent *)event { NSLog( @"mouse down event: %@", event ); NSPoint point = [event locationInWindow]; NSLog( @"mouseDown location: (%d,%d)", point.x, point.y ); } @end Open MainMenu.xib in Interface Builder Drag an Image Well onto your window Change its class to MyImageView Save everything and run Click anywhere on the Image Well I then see the message below on the console: 2011-01-01 13:58:12.351 TestApp[1167:903] mouse down event: NSEvent: type=LMouseDown loc=(237,242) time=2033.7 flags=0x100 win=0x0 winNum=573 ctxt=0x0 evNum=286 click=1 buttonNumber=0 pressure=1 2011-01-01 13:58:12.353 TestApp[1167:903] mouseDown location: (-2057547688,16) Why is "loc" in the string representation of NSEvent correct, but -locationInWindow is so obviously wrong? What could I possibly do that would result in such trivial code being wrong? I already restarted my system in case that might help.
