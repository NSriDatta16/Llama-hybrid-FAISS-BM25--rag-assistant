Pivot - SQL - values from SubQuery

I have a simple query like this.. USE AdventureWorks; GO SELECT DaysToManufacture, AVG(StandardCost) AS AverageCost FROM Production.Product GROUP BY DaysToManufacture; DaysToManufacture AverageCost 0 5.0885 1 223.88 2 359.1082 4 949.4105 A simple pivot gives me SELECT 'AverageCost' AS Cost_Sorted_By_Production_Days, [0], [1], [2], [3], [4] FROM (SELECT DaysToManufacture, StandardCost FROM Production.Product) AS SourceTable PIVOT ( AVG(StandardCost) FOR DaysToManufacture IN ([0], [1], [2], [3], [4]) ) AS PivotTable; Gives me Cost_Sorted_By_Production_Days 0 1 2 3 4 AverageCost 5.0885 223.88 359.1082 NULL 949.4105 But the values in pivot query are hardcode.. I want to get those values from a subquery.. select DaysToManufacture FROM Production.Product GROUP BY DaysToManufacture; But pivot doesn't let me get values from subquery, Is there any way to do this other than writing a dynamically generated query?
