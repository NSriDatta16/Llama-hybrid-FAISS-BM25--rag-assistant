Best practices for building links in MVC

If I do not want to do this in my View Markup, what would be the best approach to creating links in MVC 2? I have a HTML helper to build a custom link but all it is doing is acting as a wrapper around RouteLink (or ActionLink). I would want something more elegant and one that has a shorter syntax. If I build my links in a controller, how do I push it into the view? Via ViewData? (hope not). Or would it be part of the ViewModel?
