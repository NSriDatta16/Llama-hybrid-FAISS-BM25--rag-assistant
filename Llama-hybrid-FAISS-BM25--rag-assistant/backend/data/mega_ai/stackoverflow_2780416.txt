You can't. The reason cryptographic hashes[1] are referred to as "non-reversible" is that they can't be reversed. Which is the entire point of using them for password storage - it means that, if a Bad Guy gets his hands on the password database, he can't just reverse the hash to find out what all the passwords are. I see from your edit that your intent is to display the user's password to the admin user(s) rather than for password recovery by the user himself. This is a Very Bad Idea . Many users attempt to ease the burden of remembering passwords by using the same password for multiple systems, which means that displaying their password in your system has a high probability of compromising their accounts on other systems. True story: Back in 2000, I took a job at a startup that produced voicemail systems. To introduce me to the product on my first day, the IT director had me create a voicemail account, which I did, then he brought it up in the admin interface. I just about died when I saw my voicemail PIN displayed on the screen for all to see. Partly because it was shockingly bad security practice, but mostly because, even though he didn't know it, he now knew the PIN for my ATM card . That's just bad, bad, bad all around. Don't do that. [1] MD5 is a hashing algorithm, not an encryption algorithm. The key difference between the two is that, for any given hashing algorithm, there are an infinite number of inputs which will produce the same output (which is why it's not reversible), while encryption has a one-to-one correspondence of input to output.
