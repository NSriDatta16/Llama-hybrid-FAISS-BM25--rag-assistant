I'd recommend using a linear mixed model to analyze these data. An example like this is discussed in detail in chapter 8 of Landau & Everitt (2004)$^{[1]}$. I would proceed as follows: Organize your data in the long-format. The dataset would look like this for the first two participants (numbers are made up): $$ \begin{array}{l|l|l|l|l|l|l} \text{ID} &\text{Time} & \text{Post} & \text{Pre} & \text{Standing} & \text{Healthy} & \text{Group} \\ \hline 1 & 0 & 39.1 & 39.6 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 5 & 72.2 & 39.6 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 15 & 77.6 & 39.6 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 0 & 52.0 & 64.6 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 5 & 55.2 & 64.6 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 15 & 16.4 & 64.6 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... \\ \end{array} $$ ID is a unique identifier for each participant. Time indicates the measuring time point. Post is the measured mobility at the respective Time. Pre is the measured mobility at baseline. Standing is an indicator variable that is 1 if the subject was standing for an hour and 0 if the subject was sitting for an hour. Healthy is an indicator variable that is 1 if the subject was healthy and 0 if it was not. Group indicates to which group the subject belongs (e.g. 1 = healthy and sitting, 2 = healthy and standing, 3 = sick and standing, 4 = sick and sitting). We can now proceed to fit a linear mixed model. The outcome variable will be the post values. The time and the group variables will be treated as categorical independent variables. It is also possible to model the post-values as continuous, if you suspect that the trajectories can be approximated reasonably well (e.g. with a linear or polynomial function). Nonlinear trajectories could be modelled using splines. The pre measurements will be included as continuous independent variable. I will include a random intercept for each participant. In R using lme4 this would look like this: mod1 The coefficients for group would tell you whether there is a difference between the groups. A more complex model would be to allow for different trajectories for each group by including an interaction term between time and group : mod2 Here are some ideas for further investigations: Inspect the effect of sitting vs. standing and of healthy vs. sick seperately. Allow for different influence of pre-measurements by including an interaction term between group and pre . References [1]: Landau S, Everitt BS (2004): A Handbook of Statistical Analyses using SPSS.
