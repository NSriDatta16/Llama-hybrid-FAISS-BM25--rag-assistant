Why are random walks intercorrelated?

I have observed that, on average, the absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficient is a constant close to 0.56 0.42 for any pair of independent random walks, regardless of the walk length. Can someone explain this phenomenon? I expected the correlations to get smaller as the walk length increases, like with any random sequence. For my experiments I used random gaussian walks with step mean 0 and step standard deviation 1. UPDATE: I forgot to center the data, that's why it was 0.56 instead of 0.42 . Here is the Python script to compute the correlations: import numpy as np from itertools import combinations, accumulate import random def compute(length, count, seed, center=True): random.seed(seed) basis = [] for _i in range(count): walk = np.array(list(accumulate( random.gauss(0, 1) for _j in range(length) ))) if center: walk -= np.mean(walk) basis.append(walk / np.sqrt(np.dot(walk, walk))) return np.mean([ abs(np.dot(x, y)) for x, y in combinations(basis, 2) ]) print(compute(10000, 1000, 123))
