i create folders containning the project stages like "initialize software process" on were we placed docs like the bussiness proposal, we use another one for requirements another for the construction,releases,one for meetings minutes, and so on. We keep those under a subversion repository but it really depends on what metodology you are using, also it depends on how do you handle the configuration management and how organize you want to be. and yes we use template for most of our artifacts so we assure in some way the quality of our products.
