Your and elements are inside the container div, which has a font size of 1.4em , and also inside in the posts div, which has a font size of 1.2em . I think that setting the font size of the paragraphs to 1em doesn't really do anything, as the em unit is cumulative. So if your "root" font size is 62.5%, it's going to be increased 40% for the first div, and increased another 20% for the second div. Your two paragraphs will also have this font size, as they aren't increasing or decreasing the size. Basically, if you want the "tags" and "published" paragraphs to have smaller text, give them a size of less than one, e.g. 0.9em . This will give them a size 10% less than other elements in the same parent div.
