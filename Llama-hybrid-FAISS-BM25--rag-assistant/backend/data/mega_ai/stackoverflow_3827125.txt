Why do browsers show ugly errors for untrusted SSL certificates?

When faced by an untrusted certificate, every single browser I know displays a blaring error like this: Why is that? This strongly discourages web developers to use an awesome technology like SSL out of fears that users will find the website extremely shady. Ilegitimate (ie: phishing) sites do fine on HTTP, so that can't be a concern. Why do they make it look like such a big deal? Isn't having SSL even if untrusted better than not having it at all? It looks like I am being misunderstood. I am taking issue with the fact that HTTP sites cannot be more secure than an HTTPS site, even if untrusted. HTTP doesn't do encryption or identification. Phishers can make their sites on HTTP and no warnings are shown. In good faith, I am at the very least encrypting traffic. How can that be a bad thing?
