For C++ projects, you should be fine ignoring the following files: *. sdf and *.opensdf (temporary file opened only while .vcxproj/.sln is loaded to Visual Studio IDE) *. suo *. vcxproj.user ipch folder, if your project uses Pre-compiled Headers (PCH); it is a storage for Intellisense compiler which can now utilise PCH for better performance For C# projects, it's also a good idea to ignore bin and obj directories, and *.suo too.
