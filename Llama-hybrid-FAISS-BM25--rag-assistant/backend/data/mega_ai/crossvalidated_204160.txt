random forest for density estimation using sklearn

I want to use or extend sklearn-randomForest for density estimation. I don't know to tackle it. I read A. Criminisi and his team work on random forest as a unified framework where they first introduced this idea. What I got are: the information gain is computed using an entropy of gaussian or another distribution Training data that reached each node are modeled by a single gauss distribution which is used to model the distribution at each leave (gaussian also). So how to concretely used these to extend sklearn-randomForest code?
