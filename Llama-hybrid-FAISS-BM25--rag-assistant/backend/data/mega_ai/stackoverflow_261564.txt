Does the worksheet already exist? If it does you can open the worksheet using the open-source component Koogra og the commercial component from Infragistics (there are others as well) and modify it in code. The alternative is to open the worksheet using excel automation, but that is not recommended in a web project. By the way. You are not the first to ask this question.
