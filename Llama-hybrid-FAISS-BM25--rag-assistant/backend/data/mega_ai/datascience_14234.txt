In addition to the answer above. Model parameters are the properties of the training data that are learnt during training by the classifier or other ml model. For example in case of some NLP task: word frequency, sentence length, noun or verb distribution per sentence, the number of specific character n-grams per word, lexical diversity, etc. Model parameters differ for each experiment and depend on the type of data and task at hand. Model hyperparameters , on the other hand, are common for similar models and cannot be learnt during training but are set beforehand. A typical set of hyperparameters for NN include the number and size of the hidden layers, weight initialization scheme, learning rate and its decay, dropout and gradient clipping threshold, etc.
