Depending on budget, Magento Enterprise may be a good solution for you. (I don't say that to sell it, I'm not a partner). You could either architect the solution or have a hosting company help you out. Rackspace is the premier partner hosting company and is great at putting these solutions together. There are a lot of numbers that come into play, such as peak simultaneous connections, pageviews per hour, transactions per hour, etc. You'd want to look into something that has at least 2 MySQL servers (master/slave replication) and multiple frontend servers behind a loadbalancer. Instead of Apache, take a look into nginx. You'll also want to check out apc & memcached for caching. A setup like that will go a long way. When set up correctly, Magento Enterprise could handle this many products with ease. The important thing to remember is that a custom solution wouldn't need to be developed - it would need to be engineered .
