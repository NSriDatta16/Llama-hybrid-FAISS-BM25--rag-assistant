What exactly do you expect to be consistent? In a t test you have t and p values while in a logistic regression you have odds ratio, wald statistic and p values. So it is unclear to me what statistic you expect to be the same. The p values? Why do you expect the results being the same? In a t test you compare the means between two groups while in a logistic regression the model is trying to estimate a function that maps the covariate values to how p changes where p determines the shape of the Bernoulli distribution. As long as the predictors are not orthogonal (= uncorrelated) it can always be the case that in a bivariat analysis one predictor is significant but in a multivariat analysis the same predictor isn't significant anymore So the situation you describe doesn't seem unsual to me in this regard. But the opposite can be true, as well: in caae of a suppression a predictor that was not significant in a bivariat analysis the same predictor can be significant in a multivariate analysis. @ "How should I interpret this?": You should choose the analysis that answers your research question. If you are interested in mean difference between two groups you can use the t test. If you want to predict a binary variable you can use the logistic regression. Alhtough as I understood you broke up a continuous variable into two groups which can be a bad idea (see here or here ). If your main problem is to decide what variables to include in the model because the bivariate and the multivariate p values differ you should read about variable selection methods (without ignoring the theoretical background).
