Problem with the formulation of a gaussian copula likelihood function

I recently got to hear about copulas which to me sounded like a nice tool to model relationships between variables. I decided to try to implement the likelihood function for a bivariate Gaussian copula with normally distributed marginals in R for use in MLE estimation or Bayesian estimation. In this case I would expect that this likelihood function would have the same likelihood as a bivariate normal distribution. This doesn't seem to be the case (as demonstrated below) and my question is: Where do I go wrong implementing the likelihood function for the Gaussian copula with normal marginals? Am I maybe misunderstanding something fundamental? Here is the code for my likelihood function in R: # x1 and x2 is the bivariate data, rho is the correlation loglike_fun Now if I generate bivariate normal randomly distributed variables with mu = 0 , sigma = 1 and rho = 0.75 as x I would expect the following to have the maximum likelihood: loglike_fun(x[,1], x[,2], mu1 = 0, mu2 = 0, sigma1 = 1, sigma2 = 1, rho = 0.75) ## -526812.6 But this is not the case as, for example, the following parameters consistently have a larger likelihood: loglike_fun(x[,1], x[,2],mu1 = 0, mu2 = 0, sigma1 = 1.7, sigma2 = 1.7, rho = 0.9) ## -484621.1 Any pointers to where I go wrong are much appreciated!
