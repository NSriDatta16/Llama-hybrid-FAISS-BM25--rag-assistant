How are eigenvalues/singular values related to variance (SVD/PCA)?

Let $X$ be a data matrix of size $n \times p$ . Assume that $X$ is centered (column means subtracted). Then, the $p \times p$ covariance matrix is given by $$C = \frac{X^TX}{n-1}$$ Since $C$ is symmetric, it is diagonalizable, hence, $\exists$ a matrix $V$ such that $$C = VLV^T$$ where $V$ is a matrix of eigenvectors of C and $L$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $C$ . Now, I've read things along the lines of: eigenvalues $Î»_i$ show variances of the respective PCs. What does this mean? How is the spread/variance of a covariate related to the eigenvalue? I understand that we want components with a large variance as large variance means more information (generally), but how does this relate to eigenvalues?
