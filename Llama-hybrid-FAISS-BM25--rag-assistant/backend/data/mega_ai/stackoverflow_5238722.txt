1) For the number of items you're using, bubble sort would be fine. However, if you need to sort a lot of things (like a few more orders of magnitude), you may want to switch to a different sorting algorithm. Bubble sort is O(n^2) on the average case. (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#Performance ) 2) Recursion is usually used for "divide and conquer"-style sorting algorithms like QuickSort. Bubble Sort can easily be implemented iteratively. (example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#Implementation ) 3) If you are running this on an embedded system with strict memory limitations, recursion may be a bad choice. Recursion typically requires having a large stack space to support the nested function calls you're making. You can remedy this with tail recursion, but you'd have to make sure your recursive functions are written to support that. (example of tail recursion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call#Example_programs )
