Is there a specific reason why that paragraph has float: left applied? If I remove this, it displays correctly. Furthermore, you're copying exactly the same style as the above for step 1. You could simply use instead of for step 2 as well, right? I mean, your outline is pretty weird as of now. ETA: Nearly everything on that page floats, which leads me to a very big question mark: As I see it, it's a very simple (layout-wise) top-to-bottom page. I think you can streamline many things in that CSS. You can easily play around with disabling or changing certain CSS rules in IE's developer tools.
