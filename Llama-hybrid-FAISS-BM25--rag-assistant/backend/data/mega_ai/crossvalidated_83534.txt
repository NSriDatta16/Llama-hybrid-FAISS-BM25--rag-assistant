What is the purpose of working on a logit scale in partial dependence plots?

What is the purpose of working on a logit scale in partial dependence plots (in binary classification)? One could simply go about as follows: Grow a forest Suppose x has v distinct values in the training data set. Construct v data sets as follows. For each of the v values of x make up a new data se where x only takes on that value, leaving all the other values untouched. For each of the v data sets thus obtained, predict the response using random forest. For each of the v data sets, average these predictions Plot v and the corresponding averaged predictions Instead of just doing that, in literature they go on and replace step 4 and 5 by (see also partialPlot in R package randomForest): Step 4.Compute average(log(predictions)-0.5(log(predicions) + log(1-predictions)))=average(0.5 logit(predictions)) Step 5.Plot v and the corresponding computed 1/2 logit(predictions) Why?
