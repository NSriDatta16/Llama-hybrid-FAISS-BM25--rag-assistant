iPhone simulator: Is it possible to restore a real iPhone backup to it?

as the question says, I have a backup of an actual iPhone. Now I want a "copy" of the content in my simulator. The reason is that my real iPhone contains third party application data that I want to have in my simulator too. Is that possible? Thanks, Norbert
