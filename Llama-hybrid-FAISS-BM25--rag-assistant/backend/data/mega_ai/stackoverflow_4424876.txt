Page is downloaded instead of rendered over SSL

I have my checkout page secured on my site with the Bluehost SSL certificate and quite frequently the page will be downloaded instead of rendered. This only happens when I use ssl, if I run the site without it the page loads fine. Is there anything i can do to prevent this, I have tried placing at the top of the page but this doesn't solve the issue. Here is an example of the file headers that are downloaded when the issue occurs: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 12 Dec 2010 23:42:18 GMT Server: Apache X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.14 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Encoding: gzip Vary: Accept-Encoding Connection: close Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html Here is an example of the headers when it loads correctly: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 13 Dec 2010 03:04:08 GMT Server: Apache X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.14 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Encoding: gzip Vary: Accept-Encoding Keep-Alive: timeout=10, max=28 Connection: Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html
