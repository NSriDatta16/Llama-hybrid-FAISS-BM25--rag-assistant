In Causal Inference, why is the average treatment effect usually written as $\tau = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) ]$ instead of $\tau_i = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) ]$?

I am wondering why in the Causal Inference literature that the Average Treatment Effect is usually written as $\tau = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) ]$ instead of $\tau_i = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) ]$? In other words, why is it that typically $\tau$ is NOT indexed by $i$? Is it to be taken that $\tau = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) ]$ is averaging over ALL iterations $i$?
