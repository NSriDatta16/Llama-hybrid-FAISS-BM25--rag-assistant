How to test and discover dependency between time series?

$x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t), ...$ are independent variables, and $y(t)$ is another variable I suspect to be dependent. I have dataset of the evolution of $x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t), ..., y(t)$ over time in many different experiments. The questions are: how do I test if $y(t)$ is dependent on $x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t), ...$ ?. How do I discover such relationship? Suppose I wanted to train a ML model that accepts $x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t), ...$ as input and predicts $y(t)$ as output. What exactly is the name of this problem? I get confused with names such as univariate/multivariate time series forecasting and multiple/linear regression. It seems to me that "forecasting" is a type of problem where you already have a history of the time series to predict $y(t)$ ; instead, I need to predict $y(t)$ from t=0 to the end. Is it still forecasting? Do you know any example/resources of this kind of problem solved in keras/tensorflow? Should I consider using LSTMs or any other RNN model?
