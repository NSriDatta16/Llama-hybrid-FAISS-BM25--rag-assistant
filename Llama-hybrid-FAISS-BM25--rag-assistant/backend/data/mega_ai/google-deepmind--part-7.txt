 The tool proposes millions of materials previously unknown to chemistry, including several hundred thousand stable crystalline structures, of which 736 had been experimentally produced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at the time of the release. However, according to Anthony Cheetham, GNoME did not make "a useful, practical contribution to the experimental materials scientists." A review article by Cheetham and Ram Seshadri were unable to identify any "strikingly novel" materials found by GNoME, with most being minor variants of already-known materials. Mathematics AlphaTensor In October 2022, DeepMind released AlphaTensor, which used reinforcement learning techniques similar to those in AlphaGo, to find novel algorithms for matrix multiplication. In the special case of multiplying two 4Ã—4 matrices with integer entries, where only the evenness or oddness of the entries is recorded, AlphaTensor found an algorithm requiring only 47 distinct multiplications; the previous optimum, known since 1969, was the more general Strassen algorithm, using 49 multiplications. Computer scientist Josh Alman described AlphaTensor as "a proof of concept for something that could become a breakthrough," while Vassilevska Williams called it "a little overhyped" despite also acknowledging its basis in reinforcement learning as "something completely different" from previous approaches. AlphaGeometry AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic AI that was able to solve 25 out of 30 geometry problems of the International Mathematical Olympiad, a performance comparable to that of a gold medalist. Traditional geometry programs are symbolic engines that rely exclusively on human-coded rules to generate rigorous proofs, which makes them lack flexibility in unusual situations. AlphaGeometry combines such a symbolic engine with a specialized large language model trained on synthetic data of geometrical proofs. When the symbolic engine doesn't manage to find a formal and rigorous proof on its own, it solicits the large language model, which suggests a geometrical construct to move forward. However, it is unclear how applicable this method is to other domains of mathematics or reasoning, because symbolic engines rely on domain-specific rules and because of the need for synthetic data. AlphaProof AlphaProof is an AI model, which couples a pre-trained language model with the AlphaZero reinforcement learning algorithm. AlphaZero has previously taught itself how to master games. The pre-trained language model used in this combination is the fine-tuning of a Gemini model to automatically translate natural language problem statements into formal statements, creating a large library of formal problems of varying difficulty. For this purpose, mathematical statements are defined in the formal language Lean. At the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad, AlphaProof together with an adapted version of AlphaGeometry have reached the same level of solving problems in the combined categories as a silver medalist in that competition for the first time. AlphaDev In June 2023, Deepmind announced that AlphaDev, which searches for improved computer science algorithms using reinforcement learning, discovered a more efficient way of coding a sorting algorithm and a hashing algorithm. The new sorting algorithm was 70% faster for shorter sequences and 1.7% faster for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements, and the new hashing algorithm was 30% faster in some cases. The sorting algorithm was accepted into the C++ Standard Library sorting algorithms, and was the first change to those algorithms in more than a decade and the first update to involve an algorithm discovered using AI. The hashing algorithm was released to an opensource library. Google estimates that these two algorithms are used trillions of times every day. AlphaEvolve In May 2025, Google DeepMind unveiled AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent using LLMs like Gemini to design optimized algorithms. AlphaEvolve begi
