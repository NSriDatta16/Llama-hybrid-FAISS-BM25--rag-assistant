How to detect Java agents, JVMTI, etc

How does one secure the Java environment when running on a machine you don't control? What is to stop someone from creating a java agent or native JVMTI agent and dumping bytecode or re-writing classes to bypass licensing and/or other security checks? Is there any way to detect if any agents are running from Java code? From JNI? From a JVMTI agent?
