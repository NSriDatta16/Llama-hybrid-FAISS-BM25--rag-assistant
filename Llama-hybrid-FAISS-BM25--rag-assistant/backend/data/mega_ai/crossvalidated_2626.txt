In its alternative form as a variogram, the rate at which the function grows with large lags is roughly the square of the average trend. This can sometimes be a useful way to decide whether you have adequately removed any trends. You can think of the variogram as the squared correlation multiplied by an appropriate variance and flipped upside down. (This result is a direct consequence of the analysis presented at Why does including latitude and longitude in a GAM account for spatial autocorrelation? , which shows how the variogram includes information about the expected squared difference between values at different locations.)
