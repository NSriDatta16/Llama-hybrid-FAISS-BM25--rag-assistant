Is there a way to quantify impact of independent variables with gradient boosting?

I've been asked to run a model using gradient boosting or random forest. So far so good, however, the only output that comes back in terms of variable importance is based on the number of times a variable was used as a branch rule. I've now been asked to basically get coefficients or somehow quantify the impact that the variables have on the target. Is there a way to do this with a gradient boosting model? My other thoughts were to either use only the variables that were showed to be sued as branch rules in a regular decision tree or in a GLM or regular regression model. Any help or ides would be appreciated!! Thanks so much!
