Is it possible to have post-debugging build steps/triggers in XCode?

I want to run some code coverage analysis (using CoverStory) on our iPhone app's unit tests in XCode automatically when the tests run. the problem is that we're using the Google Toolbox for Mac, and the way that the tests seem to run doesn't actually generate code coverage reports from gcov, so the analysis i get is out of date unless i manually regenerate the coverage html after a build and go. I'm wondering if there is any obscure way to trigger a post-debug step that would do this for me so i don't have to manually rerun CoverStory. Is it possible? Edit: To clarify, i want to have a build step run after the program is done running if possible, not before i start debugging.
