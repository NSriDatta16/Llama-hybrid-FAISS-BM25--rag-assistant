You won't find a concrete answer because of the sheer amount of variables here. Legacy code can be very stable or very buggy if being incorporated or updated. New code can be buggy because of the programmers or even when they worked on the code. I would expect code done around a holiday or Friday to be more likely to have issues than stuff on a normal work week Wednesday. Your best bet is to look at the needs of your organization against the resources available and make a conscious decision to splurge on testing. While QA is often assigned a low priority, it should not be and a dedicated team (even if it is a team of 1) should be checking how things interact at all stages of development. Having done this I can safely say it ends up costing less if the issue is found early and programmers are given plenty of warning.
