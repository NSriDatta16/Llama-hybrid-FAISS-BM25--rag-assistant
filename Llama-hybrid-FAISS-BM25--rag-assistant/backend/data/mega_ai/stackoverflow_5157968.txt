Call a JavaScript method after the RequiredFieldValidator fires?

Is it possible to fire a JavaScript method after a form element is considered invalid? Here is my scenario: There are 2 tabs on the ASPX page. The user has to fill out info on both tabs. The user, while on tab 2 clicks the submit button. However, there is a required field on tab one that needs attention. Do I need to create a custom valuator (either a CustomValidator control or create a new control from the base valuator) to call a JavaScript function to display tab 1 and show where the error is?
