You can try to run CHKDSK from a command prompt. Regarding to wikipedia : A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) or polynomial code checksum is a hash function designed to detect accidental changes to raw computer data, and is commonly used in digital networks and storage devices such as hard disk drives. A CRC-enabled device calculates a short, fixed-length binary sequence, known as the CRC code or simply CRC, for each block of data and sends or stores them both together. When a block is read or received the device repeats the calculation; if the new CRC does not match the one calculated earlier, then the block contains a data error and the device may take corrective action such as rereading or requesting the block be sent again, otherwise the data is assumed to be error free (though, with some small probability, it may contain undetected errors; this is the fundamental nature of error-checking).
