Can someone please explain dynamic time warping for determining time series similarity?

I am trying to grasp the dynamic time warping measure for comparing time series together. I have three time series datasets like this: T1 I know that T1 and T2 are correlated and consider them as ground truth so any distance metric should tell me that (T1, T2) are closer than (T2, T3) and (T1, T3). However, when using dtw in R, I am getting the following: > dtw(T1, T2, k = TRUE)$distance; dtw(T1, T3, k = TRUE)$distance; dtw(T3, T2, k = TRUE)$distance [1] 1.107791 [1] 1.568011 [1] 0.4102962 Can someone please explain how to use Dynamic Time Warping for nearest-neighbor queries?
