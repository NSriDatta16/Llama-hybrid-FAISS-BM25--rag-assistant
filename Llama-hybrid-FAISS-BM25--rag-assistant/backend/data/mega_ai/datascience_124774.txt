Is there a standard data science workflow/decision tree?

I'm looking for some kind of reference that essentially shows an example of an entire data analysis workflow beginning with feature engineering, and ending with analyzing the results. I know the typical steps are something like this: Feature engineering Feature selection Choosing the model Training the model Using the model for inference Assessing the performance of the model. Maybe do some EDA, etc... I feel like I've read bits and pieces about each of these, but would like a more consolidated reference that talks about each in detail.
