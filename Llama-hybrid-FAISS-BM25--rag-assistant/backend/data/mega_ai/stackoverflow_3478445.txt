When I was studying for my SCJP certification a lot of emphasis was made on "You can not do anything to force the GC to run at any given time, you can just give hints to it" The whole idea of having an automatic GC is precisely not having to worry about how or when it runs to clean up free memory for you. So, there is no way to actually change when or how GC does actually run... you would have to re-implement one JVM to do what you want. There are just so many factors involved in this, there may be other, more elegant solutions for this.
