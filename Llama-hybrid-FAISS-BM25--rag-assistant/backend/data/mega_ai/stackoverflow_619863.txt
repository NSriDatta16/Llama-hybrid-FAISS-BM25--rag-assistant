Creating a new text column in a SQL Server Table: which type should I choose?

I have a text field that can be 30 characters in length, however it can achieve around 2.000 characters. For "future safety", it would be nice if this new column could support until 3.000 characters. I think the average size of this field is 250 characters. Which SQL Server 2000 data type is better to increase performance and disk space?
