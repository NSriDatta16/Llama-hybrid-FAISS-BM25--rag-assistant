Looking for a free "Feature Request/Vote" system in asp.net

I'm looking for a free asp.net system or component which allow my users to make feature requests and vote for existing ones. It's for internal use (a non profit organization - with "old" users ;)). Users shouldn't need to log in to be able to suggest a feature or vote. The StackOverflow has a really great - and SIMPLE - UI. Would love something similar... Do you know if a such system or component exists ? I haven't found any yet... Thanks !
