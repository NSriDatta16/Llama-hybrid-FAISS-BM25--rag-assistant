From a computational perspective, you would want to use the sentences, rather than paragraphs when using a Conditional Random Field. The complexity of the Viterbi algorithm used for inference for CRFs is related to the number of words per sentence. For an approach with LSTMs, this would depend on design decision (i.e. character of word-based input). More interestingly would be your philosophical/cognitive stance toward what text means to us. If it were not for computational reasons, what input would you choose?
