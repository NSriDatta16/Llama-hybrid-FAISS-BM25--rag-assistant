Java Random: Seeding Problem

was wondering if you could help me out: I have a method called initializeAll : public final void initializeAll() { //other stuff........ rand = new Random(353); } So I run the project and a GUI pops up, and some operations are carried out. When I press the "reset" button in my GUI, intializeAll is called again on the same class object. However, the operations that are carried out now are not the same as before, although they should be, since both times, a seed of 353 is being used on the newly created Random object. Why this difference? Am I doing something wrong? EDIT: sorry, its not "some operations are carried out". its that some initialization of agent population takes place. and each time, the initialization is different, although the same seed is used. private static int [][] initializePop(Random rand) { int[][] temp = new int[ROWS][COLS]; for (int row = 0; row SOLUTION: sorry for taking your time guys. i figured out the problem. right now, my application is a mess of various threads, swingworkers, etc i.e. very "thready".. apparently the random is actually working fine. the problem is with the GUI display, which does some funny things and displays some interesting value. so this is more of a threading problem. i'm redesigning the code now. so thanks again, and sorry for wasting your time.
