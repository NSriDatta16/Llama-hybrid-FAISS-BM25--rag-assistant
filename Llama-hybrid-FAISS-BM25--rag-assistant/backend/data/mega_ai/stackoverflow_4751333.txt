This problem is too hard for a normal ANN. ANNs aren't really very well suited to images with lots of spatial transformations (i.e. human figures in different positions). They effectively need to learn each possible position independently, since they can't generalise well over translations, rotations and scaling etc. Even if you managed to make it work, you'd probably need billions of training images and years of training time. Your best bet is probably to go with either: Haar feature detection (which have been successfully used for face detection) A convolutional neural network (pretty successful for handwriting recognition etc.)
