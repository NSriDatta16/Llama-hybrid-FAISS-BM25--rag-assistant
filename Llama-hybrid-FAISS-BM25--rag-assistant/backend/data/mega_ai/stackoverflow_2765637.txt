Well indexes trade storage for performance. Its hard if you want both. Its hard to optimize this any further without know all the queries you run and their quantities per interval. What you have will work. If you're running into a bottleneck, you'll need to find out whether its cpu,ram,disk and/or network and adjust accordingly. Its hard and wrong to prematurely optimize. You probably want to switch to innodb if you have any updates, other wise myisam is good for insert/select. Also since your row size is small, you could look into mysql cluster (nbd). There is also an archive engine that can help with storage requirements but partitioning in 5.1 is probably a better thing to look into. Flipping the order of your index doesn't make any sense, if these indexes are already used in all of your queries. but it's more efficient to have the left-most column of an index be the one with the least variance - correct? not sure but I haven't heard this before. Doesn't seem true to me for this application. The index order matters for sorting and by having multiple unique 1st most index fields, allows more possible queries to use index.
