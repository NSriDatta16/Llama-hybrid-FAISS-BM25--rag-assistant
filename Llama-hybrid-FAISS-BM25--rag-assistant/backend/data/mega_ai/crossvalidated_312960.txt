Sometimes it's clearest and simplest just to enumerate the (equiprobable) possibilities. After all, there are only $\binom{10}{2}=45$ subsets of two interviewees. I'll be thorough rather than efficient in order to illustrate some of the techniques and to serve as a check on the arithmetic. How can the difference be zero? When either both interviewees are Independents ($\binom{5}{2}$ possibilities) or one is Republican and the other Democrat ($3\times 2$ possibilities). How can the difference be one? One interviewee is Independent and the other is not: $5\times 5$ possibilities. How can the difference be two? Both interviewees must be in the same party ($\binom{3}{2} + \binom{2}{2}$ possibilities). As a check, the total is $$\left(\binom{5}{2} + 3\times 2\right) + 5\times 5 + \left(\binom{3}{2}+\binom{2}{2}\right) = (10+6)+25+(3+1)=45=\binom{10}{2}.$$ The expectation is the probability-weighted average. We needn't include the value of zero because it contributes nothing. That leaves $$\frac{1}{\binom{10}{2}}\left((5\times 5) \times 1 + \left(\binom{3}{2}+\binom{2}{2}\right)\times 2\right) = \frac{33}{45} = \frac{11}{15}.$$ In retrospect, I suspect you might have shared only the beginning of a solution. The full solution might go like this: There's a 1/2 chance the first interviewee is Independent. Conditional on that, there's a 4/9 chance one of the remaining nine voters is one of the remaining 4 Independents and a 5/9 chance they belong to a party. The conditional expectation of the absolute difference is $$(4/9)\times 0 + (5/9)\times 1 = 5/9.$$ There's a 3/10 chance the first interviewee is Republican. Conditional on that, there's a 5/9 chance the second is Independent (absolute difference is 1), a 2/9 chance they are Republican (absolute difference is 2), and a 2/9 chance they are Democrat (absolute difference is 0). The conditional expectation is $$(5/9) \times 1 + (2/9)\times 2 + (2/9)\times 0 = 1.$$ A comparable analysis of the last case, a 2/10 chance of a Democrat, gives a conditional expectation of $$(5/9)\times 1 + (3/9)\times 0 + (1/9)\times 2 = 7/9.$$ The expectation itself is weighted by the chances of each scenario, giving $$(1/2) \times (5/9) + (3/10)\times (1) + (2/10) \times (7/9) = 11/15.$$ We can ask the computer to do the enumeration, too. Here's one way (in R ). It is coded to be a little different than either of the previous solutions--otherwise it wouldn't be a very good check. I hope it's clear enough. Its output is Expectation is 11 / 15 voters
