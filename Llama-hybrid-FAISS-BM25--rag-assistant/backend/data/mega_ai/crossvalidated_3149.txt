If you do PCA, my advice would be to briefly screen other components than only the first two. Once you have the prcomp object pc (see suncoolsu's post), you can plot(pc) to see the amount of variance attributed to the different principal components. You can also easily visualise several (usually three or four) of them with pairs(pc$x[,1:3]) or, using lattice , splom(pc$x[,1:3]) .
