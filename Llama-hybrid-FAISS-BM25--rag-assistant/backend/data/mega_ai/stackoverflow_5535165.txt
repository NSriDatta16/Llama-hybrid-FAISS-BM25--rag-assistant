CSS support for handheld, iPhone AND browsers

I have the following in my index.xhtml style type="text/css" media="screen and (min-width: 500px)" @import "style/index.css"; /style style type="text/css" media="screen and (max-width: 500px)" @import "style/portable.css"; /style style type="text/css" media="handheld" @import "style/handheld.css"; /style It works great in Opera, Opera-Mini, iPhone and a bunch of handhelds (N70, Motorola)) BUT it refuses to work with Konqueror and Firefox. How do i fix this? (I want to keep the CSS in separate files, and I'm not keen on enclosing/embedding huge chunks of CSS within @media screen {}. I'd also prefer to not go with link because style is what we've used in other pages)
