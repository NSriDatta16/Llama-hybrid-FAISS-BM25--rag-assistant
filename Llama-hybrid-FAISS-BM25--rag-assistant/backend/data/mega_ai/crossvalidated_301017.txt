How can missing data be dealt with when using splines or fractional polynomials?

I am reading Multivariable Model Building: A Pragmatic Approach to Regression Analysis Based on Fractional Polynomials for Modelling Continuous Variables by Patrick Royston and Willie Sauerbrei. So far, I am impressed and it's an interesting approach I had not considered before. But the authors do not deal with missing data. Indeed, on p. 17 they say that missing data "introduces many additional problems. Not considered here." Does multiple imputation work with fractional polynomials> FP is, in some ways (but not all) an alternative to splines. Is it easier to deal with missing data for spline regression?
