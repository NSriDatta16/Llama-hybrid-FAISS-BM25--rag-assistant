Queue that uses a Stack

I am having trouble understanding a question. The question asks first to write a C++ class to represent a stack of integers, and that much is done. Here are my prototypes: class Stack{ private: int top; int item[100]; public: Stack() {top = -1;} ~Stack(); void push(int x) {item[++top] = x;} int pop() {return item[top--];} int empty(int top); }; The second part of the question says "Using the stack for storage purposes, write a C++ class to represent a queue of integers". My queue is as follows: class Queue{ private: int * data; int beginning, end, itemCount; public: Queue(int maxSize = 100); Queue(Queue &OtherQueue); ~Queue(); void enqueue(int x); void dequeue(); int amount(); }; I don't understand how I am meant to use a stack for storage purposes for a queue.
