Remove Encoded HTML from Strings using RegEx

I currently have an extension method from removing any HTML from strings. Regex.Replace(s, @" ", string.Empty); This works fine on the whole, however, I am occasionally getting passed strings that have both standard HTML markup within them, along with encoded markup (I don't have control of the source data so can't correct things at the point of entry), e.g. &lt;p&gt; Sample text &lt;/p&gt; I need an expression that will remove both encoded and non-encoded HTML (whether it be paragraph tags, anchor tags, formatting tags etc.) from a string.
