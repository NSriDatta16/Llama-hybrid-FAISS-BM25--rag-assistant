Generating synthetic time series data with limited data

I would like some opinions on my current situation. I have a set of time series data that I want to forecast. The data however is not very long (around 500 rows) so I was looking into generating many synthetic datasets that mimic my current one's statistical characteristics. I have seen online, methods that can generate time series data based on your own dataset for example TimeGAN, DoppleGANger which are a neural-networks. It is well known that neural-networks need a lot of data to perform well and prevent things like overfitting. You can probably see my problem here, that I don't have enough data to ensure GAN models that are meant to generate me more data work effectively. Or do you think I can just go for it and it wont really matter?
