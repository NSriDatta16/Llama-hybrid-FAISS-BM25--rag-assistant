Qt4: QMap causing "strict-aliasing rules" compilation error

I'm trying to create the following data structure in Qt 4.5 in C++: QMap > > animation; However, the inclusion of this line in my code results in the following error: cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors In file included from XXX/XXX/XXX/MainWindow.qt.C.tmp.C:113: /usr/lib/qt4/include/QtCore/qmap.h: In member function ‘void MainWindow::exportAnn()’: /usr/lib/qt4/include/QtCore/qmap.h:588: error: dereferencing pointer ‘y’ does break strict-aliasing rules /usr/lib/qt4/include/QtCore/qmap.h:586: note: initialized from here Command exited with non-zero status 1 My organization requires me to treat all warnings as errors, so I can't simply ignore this. Is this a bug in Qt, or is there something I'm doing wrong?
