Complementary to @Sycorax's nice answer (+1): Remember that one of the "deep-learning" strengths is the ability of deep neural network to perform automatic feature extraction and encapsulate non-linear relations (e.g. through convolutions ( ConvNNets ), recurrences ( RNNs ), etc.). Making a highly condensed version of the data to be used an input to a deep neural network would kind off beat the objective of using a deep neural network to begin with. The network would have to "uncompress" the data only to try to recombine them once more internally to reach its full predictive capacity.
