K-means: Does it make sense to remove the outliers after clustering the datasets?

The requirements of the project is to cluster the dataset (using k-means) and then remove the outliers (using MAD) from each of the cluster. However, I don't feel that it make sense to do that. I think outliers should be removed from the dataset first and then do the clustering. I'm really new to k-means and machine learning in general. I would really appreciate suggestions. Thanks in advance! EDIT1: Answering @Tim as to why outliers should be removed: There are actually 2 process. running the k-means, removing the outliers from each cluster
