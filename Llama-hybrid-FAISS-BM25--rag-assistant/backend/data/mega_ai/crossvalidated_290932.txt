How to model for independent determinants in several groups based on follow-up time

I want to answer the research question which determinants are associated with long-term survival after a myocardial infarction (MI) in a prospective patient cohort study. More precisely: I want to compare patients who have more than 10 years healthy survival after a MI compared to patients who have a new vascular event or have died in less than 10 years after the MI. What determinants are associated with >10 years healthy surival? What characterizes these patients? I have tried to find which model is best to use, and in similar articles I have seen two different approaches: either a multivariate cox regression model or a multivariable logistic regression model. Which method is best? Or if there is no 'best' model, but it is dependent of what exactly you are trying to answer - what is the difference between the results from the two models? I hope the question is clear. I found similar questions on StackExchange, but the examples in those questions were so vastly different from mine that I found I could not answer my question. Thanks! Edit: I am now wondering if this is even the right approach at all. Like I said, the question I am trying to answer is whether patients who have a long (i.e. longer than 15 years) healthy follow-up after myocardial infarction have different characteristics than patients who did not achieve long healthy follow-up after myocardial infarction. I do not want to use a regular Cox model, as I think this does not really answer my question (it will say, e.g. that smoking is a risk factor for mortality over time, which is really not that informative as this is generally known information). What I really want to know is what characterizes those 'healthy survivors'. Though the two questions are really close, they are not precisely the same. The solution I have thought of for now is this: Make groups based on follow-up time and compare the determinants between those groups (e.g. a group with 0-5 year follow-up, 5-10, 10-15, 15+ years follow-up). However, I am not sure what model I can use to find out what independent determinants are for different groups compared to one another. Alternatively, I would like to do a sort of 'reversed' Cox, where I look at the people who have the longest follow-up time first and working back, compared to a normal Cox model which is based on events throughout the follow-up time. But I have NO idea whatsoever if there is any type of model that would allow for this.
