Change the FPS in the properties. If you are doing any animations on the timeline this will result in a smoother appearance but also a faster animation. If you want the smoother appearance but same length of time of the animation then you will have to update your animation. Assuming you are tweening then you will have to drag the keyframes by hand. Painful yes. One tip is that you can change the FPS playback via code as well, dynamically. This way if an animator has give you some animation at a certain FPS (say 24fps) but you want nice smooth animation for the rest then you can change the frame rate on the fly.
