Android dev platform supporting OpenGL ES 2.0: Where to buy?

I plan to port some camera and multimedia algorithms and functionality on a Qualcomm Snapdragon platform running Android. I need OpenGL ES 2.0 acceleration for many algorithms. Which platform is the right one? Also, where can I purchase this? The Android dev platform on Google's website supports on OpenGL ES 1.x Thanks for any input.
