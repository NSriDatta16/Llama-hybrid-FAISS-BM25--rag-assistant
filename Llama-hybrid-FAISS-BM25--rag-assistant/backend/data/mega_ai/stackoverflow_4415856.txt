The OpenKinect library is basically a driver — at least for now — so don't expect much high functions from it . You will more or less get the raw data from both the depth and the video cameras. This is basically an array received in a callback function each time a frame arrives. You can give it a try by following the instructions provided on the OpenKinect website , it's really quick to install and try it, and you can play a bit with the glview application provided to get a feeling of what's possible. I've set up a few demos using opencv , and got pretty cool results even though I didn't have much background in computer vision so I can only encourage you to try it yourself! Alternately, if you're looking for more advanced functions, the OpenNI framework was just released this week and provides some impressive high level algorithms such as skeleton tracking and some gesture recognition . Part of the framework is proprietary algorithms from PrimeSense (like the powerful skeleton tracking module...). I haven't tried it yet and don't know how well it integrates with the kinect and the different OS, but since a bunch of guys from different groups (OpenKinect, Willow Garage...) are working hard on it that shouldn't be an issue within a week.
