Which distance function to use depends on the data geometry itself. In some cases you can plot you data and visualize then take decisions but in real world problems mostly it is not possible. For most clustering algorithm like Kmeans, as long as a distance function is a metric you can use it. There exists methods to learn a metric according to data geometry which you can use to cluster the data. What is metric learning ? Introduction and Motivation . Brian Kulis has a very nice survey paper on this. Metric learning is closely related to dimensionality reduction. If you are using MATLAB check this toolkit .
