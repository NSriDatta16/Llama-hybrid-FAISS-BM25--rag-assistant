I do not know of a VCS specialized in PBX Vector. It actually depends on the internal format of such an object. According to " Configuring Avaya Definity PBX ": vectoring uses a table outlining the coverage path for each station, instead of each station being configured individually (hunt-to configuration). Depending upon your Avaya Definity software version, the table can support anywhere from 13 to 32 routes or more per vector. That means: if it is text-based, any VCS tool can store deltas between 2 versions of a vector what will be more important as to the choice of a Version tool is how the update is done: from a single location, or with agent through the country. In the former case, a centralized VCS (Subversion, Perforce, ...) is enough, with a direct access to a single repository storing the vector deifnitions. In the latter case, a DVCS (Mercurial, Git, ...) is needed, in order for each agent to work with the full local repository, and then synchronize it between them.
