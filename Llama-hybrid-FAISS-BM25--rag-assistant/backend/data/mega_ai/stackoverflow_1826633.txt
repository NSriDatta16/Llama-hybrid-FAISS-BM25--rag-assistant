Some points to consider that I think about also Rasmus Lerdorf has said frequently that "you shouldn't have more than about five includes". I can only assume that he knows what he's talking about, because he made PHP. I am skeptical about the feasibility of this, however. Especially on large projects. I've found that it's better for development and milestones to make life easier on your developers. If that means separate files, then that's a good idea. If you're worried about CPU usage or bandwidth, there are probably more obvious bottlenecks than liberal use of include. Un-optimized functions are a good way to make the app faster, and paying attention to images and css or js files is a good way to reduce bandwidth.
