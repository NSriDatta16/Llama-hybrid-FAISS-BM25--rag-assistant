How to access a structure declared in other file using extern keyword in 'c' language

I have 3 files . In one file I declared a structure and in another file which has the main, I am trying to access that structure using extern key word -------- //a.c--- include extern struct k ; extern int c; int main() { extern int a,b; fun1(); fun2(); c=10; printf("%d\n",c); struct k j; j.id=89; j.m=43; printf("\n%d\t%f",j.id,j.m); } //1.c #include struct k { int id; float m; }j; int c; void fun1() { int a=0,b=5; printf("tis is fun1"); printf("\n%d%d\n",a,b); } //2.c-- #include struct k { int id; float m; }j; void fun2() { int a=10,b=4; printf("this is fun2()"); printf("\n%d%d\n",a,b); } I compiled this code by using cc a.c 1.c 2.c but I am getting error as storage size of ‘j’ isn’t known
