There is a substantial literature on relative importance so I would suggest using an established technique. In her paper "Estimators of relative importance in linear regression based on variance decomposition" here Gr√∂mping suggests criteria for choosing between methods and then gives a detailed comparison between two methods: LMG which obtains the Model I sums of squares for each predictor and then averages over all the possible orders of fitting the predictors, and PMVD which is a weighted version of LMG. In an earlier paper discussing her software "Relative importance for linear regression in R: the package relaimpo" here she also discusses four other versions.
