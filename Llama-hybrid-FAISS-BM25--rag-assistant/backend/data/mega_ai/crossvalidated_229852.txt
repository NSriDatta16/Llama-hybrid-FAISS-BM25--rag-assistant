Why is the Bayes factor sometimes considered more important than the Posterior Odds?

To the best of my knowledge, the posterior odds satisfies the equation: $$(\text{posterior odds}) = (\text{Bayes factor}) \times (\text{prior odds}) $$ This is a simple consequence of Bayes' rule. The whole point of Bayesian inference when applied to model selection, or so I thought, was to use the information from the prior probabilities to get a more accurate estimate of what the correct answer is than the naive estimate one gets from the likelihoods, which is given by the Bayes factor. However, I recall having read several papers where the Bayes factors were reported as evidence of one model being more likely than the other. Was the idea of the paper's authors to appeal to frequentists who would have considered it taboo to incorporate information from prior probabilities, and to show that their argument was (their results were) robust to such objections on methodological/philosophical grounds? Would a Bayesian ever be more interested in the Bayes factor than the posterior odds? Note: I had these questions while reading the first chapter of James Stone's "Bayes' Rule: A Tutorial Introduction to Bayesian Analysis" and while thinking back to some papers I had read a while ago about influenza virus transmission. I can try to find the paper if that would help. Anyway I am a complete novice at this so I apologize in advance if this question is non-sensical.
