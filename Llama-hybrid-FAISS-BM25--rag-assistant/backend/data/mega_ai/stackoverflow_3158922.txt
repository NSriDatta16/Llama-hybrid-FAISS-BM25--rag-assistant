Reverse iterator won't compile

I'm trying to compile a reverse iterator but my attempts to do so give a horrid mess. The minimal example of the code is... #include #include #include class frag { public: void print (void) const; private: std::vector a; }; void frag::print (void) const { for (std::vector ::reverse_iterator iter = a.begin (); iter != a.end (); ++iter) { std::cout and attempting to compile it produces the following... In file included from /usr/include/c++/4.4/bits/stl_algobase.h:69, from /usr/include/c++/4.4/bits/char_traits.h:41, from /usr/include/c++/4.4/ios:41, from /usr/include/c++/4.4/ostream:40, from /usr/include/c++/4.4/iostream:40, from frag.cpp:1: /usr/include/c++/4.4/bits/stl_iterator.h: In constructor ‘std::reverse_iterator ::reverse_iterator(const std::reverse_iterator &) [with _Iter = __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator > >, _Iterator = __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator > >]’: frag.cpp:14: instantiated from here /usr/include/c++/4.4/bits/stl_iterator.h:134: error: no matching function for call to ‘__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator > >::__normal_iterator(__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator > >)’ /usr/include/c++/4.4/bits/stl_iterator.h:686: note: candidates are: __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator ::__normal_iterator(const _Iterator&) [with _Iterator = int*, _Container = std::vector >] /usr/include/c++/4.4/bits/stl_iterator.h:683: note: __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator ::__normal_iterator() [with _Iterator = int*, _Container = std::vector >] /usr/include/c++/4.4/bits/stl_iterator.h:669: note: __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator > >::__normal_iterator(const __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator > >&) There was a question on this subject yesterday but I don't think this is the same as it isn't a template. If a vector is declared in a similar way locally it is quite happy. (g++ on Ubuntu 10.4). Anyone know what I should do?
