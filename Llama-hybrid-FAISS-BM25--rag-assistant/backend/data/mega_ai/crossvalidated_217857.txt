If your data is a time series, you may want to look into triple exponential smoothing, also known as Holt-Winters' method. This can accommodate additive seasonality (where the seasonal amplitude does not grow with the upwards trend over time) and multiplicative seasonality.

Here is the entire taxonomy of exponential smoothing methods, based on Gardner (2006, International Journal of Forecasting ) . To actually model such a series, extract trend, seasonal and error components and forecast, I recommend the ets() function in the forecast package for R .
