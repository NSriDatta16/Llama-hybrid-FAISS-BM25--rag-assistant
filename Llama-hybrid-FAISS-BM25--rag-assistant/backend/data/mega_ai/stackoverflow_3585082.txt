There is no overarching, fundamental reason not to have strings mutable. The best explanation I have found for their immutability is that it promotes a more functional, less side-effectsy way of programming. This ends up being cleaner, more elegant, and more Pythonic. Semantically, they should be immutable, no? The string "hello" should always represent "hello" . You can't change it any more than you can change the number three!
