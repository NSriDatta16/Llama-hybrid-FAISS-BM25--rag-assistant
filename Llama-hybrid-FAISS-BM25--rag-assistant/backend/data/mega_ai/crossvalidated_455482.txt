Distribution of forecast error of ARMA + GARCH model

I am modelling a time series process and want to explore ARMA + GARCH. Using ARMA alone, with normally distributed residuals, we can determine the distribution of the forecast error using the technique described here . This involves converting the ARMA to a pure MA representation and multiplying the model variance by a factor derived from the pure MA representation. $$\hat{\sigma}^{2}_{forecast} = \hat{\sigma}^2_{model}\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\Psi^2_j$$ where each $\Psi_j$ comes from the pure MA representation. If I am using GARCH with a normal distribution, and thus have a different forecast for variance for each day out to $m$ , can I simply do this? $$\hat{\sigma}^{2}_{forecast} = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\hat{\sigma}^2_{garch,j}\Psi^2_j$$ If I am using GARCH with a skew t distribution (or any of those offered by rugarch in R), is it known how to combine each of these single period distributions into a distribution for the whole forecast horizon? In the normal case it is simple, since a normal distribution is completely characterized by it's mean (from ARMA) and variance (from GARCH). But for a skew t, I am not certain if this is valid to keep skew and shape constant and just adjust scale using the above procedure.
