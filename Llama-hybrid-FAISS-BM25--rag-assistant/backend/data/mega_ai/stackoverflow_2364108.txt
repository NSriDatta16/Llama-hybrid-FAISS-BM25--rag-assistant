You could use an AMQP broker (such as RabbitMQ) and I have an "agent" (e.g. a python process built using pyton-amqplib) that sits on an exchange an intercepts specific messages (specific routing_key ); once a timer has elapsed, send back the message on the exchange with a different routing_key . I realize this means "translating/mapping" routing keys but it works. Working with RabbitMQ and python-amqplib is very straightforward.
